 (man singing in foreign language)

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,560
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,240
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,840
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,080
 James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,360
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,000
 And in a particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,400
 Starting with you, James.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,320
 - Okay, my fact this week is that on their birthday,

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,520
 every beef eater at the Tower of London

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,240
 gets a gift of a free bottle of beef eater gin.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,120
 - On their birthday singular, so do they all do they all?

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,920
 - They only hire people born on the 25th of September.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,200
 - They're like race horses.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,360
 They all get their new age on the 1st of January.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,120
 No, it's every beef eater on that particular person's birthday.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,520
 They get one bottle of gin.

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,400
 And the beef eater gin brand

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,640
 is nothing to do with the beef eaters.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,200
 But I went to the Tower of London this week,

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,640
 and I spoke to my friend Andy the beef eater.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,320
 And he said that basically the beef eater gin brand

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,400
 they've got so much out of the beef eaters over the years,

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,040
 it's the least they can do to get them

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,720
 a bottle of gin every year.

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,560
 - Sorry, sweet.

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,480
 So did you go to the beef eater pub?

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,920
 - I went to the, it's called the Keys,

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,120
 and it's the pub inside the Tower of London.

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,960
 Yes, it had got there.

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,800
 - That's very cool.

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,640
 - That's cool.

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,480
 Yeah, I was reading about it.

38
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,440
 - A lot of pubs in the Tower of London.

39
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,000
 This is the last remaining one.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,960
 - There's just one left, which means if you fall out

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,200
 with any other beef eaters, if you have beef with them,

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
 you have to go to the same pub all the time.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
 - That's terrible.

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,960
 - But there's a sick calm.

45
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
 - Sure, I would watch it.

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,440
 In fact, there's a soap opera set in the Tower of London pub.

47
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,080
 - You're right, you're right.

48
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,560
 - Because they get up to quite bad behavior sometimes,

49
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,800
 and they have done traditionally.

50
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,760
 So I always thought of beef eaters as these sort of like,

51
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,320
 eminent bastions of British stateliness,

52
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
 in other words, like that.

53
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,680
 - But actually, they were historically

54
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,440
 used to kind of be drunkards, I think,

55
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,840
 in the 18th century.

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,560
 They were known for creating havoc

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,480
 and for illegally subletting their rooms out to other people.

58
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,760
 They would just randomly sell on the post of beef eater

59
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,040
 to make a bit of extra cash whenever they wanted.

60
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,440
 Yeah, they were known as scoundrels.

61
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,000
 - You could only do that once.

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
 Like once you sold it, it would belong to the other person

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,040
 and then they might sell it on afterwards.

64
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,800
 - Yeah, unless you stole it back from them in the night.

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,840
 - Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how it worked.

66
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,720
 I think you basically got money off them

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
 and then they had the ceremony.

68
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,080
 And the ceremony to become a beef eater,

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,920
 you get a little kind of cup, a little pewter cup,

70
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,720
 and you drink some part and you do a toast,

71
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
 and then you're a beef eater, basically.

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,880
 - Yeah.

73
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,840
 Imagine if we could just sell our jobs to other people.

74
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,880
 You can if you want.

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,200
 - I mean, well, I'm in talks with a few guys in my case.

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,920
 Alex Bell is pretty interesting.

77
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,440
 - In the toast, it's a reference to that, isn't it?

78
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,680
 'Cause they do the toast with a poor,

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,320
 and then I think the thing they say

80
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,440
 when they're toasting a new beef eater is,

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,520
 is it may you never die a yeoman order?

82
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,160
 So they're officially called yeoman orders.

83
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,120
 And that's because the idea was,

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
 if you made the mistake of dying in an office,

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
 then you've been an idiot

86
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,800
 'cause you hadn't sold it on in time

87
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,840
 and made that extra cash.

88
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
 - Yes, exactly.

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,440
 It's like dying after, or not selling a house

90
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
 in the years before you die.

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,240
 And to go just on a rampage with the money.

92
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
 - Is that what you're gonna do?

93
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,160
 Considering you do have a son.

94
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,760
 - Yeah, good point.

95
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,920
 and they were really unpopular in loads of ways.

96
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,600
 So as well as selling their jobs,

97
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,680
 a writer historically said,

98
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,160
 they have gradually assumed to themselves

99
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,200
 the more lucrative occupation of stopping everybody

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
 who wishes to visit these objects

101
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
 of our national pride and glory

102
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,680
 and forcing themselves upon them as their guides.

103
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
 So the guards would just say,

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,560
 hey, do you wanna guide a tour and pest you

105
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,200
 until you gave in against the money?

106
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,360
 - That's right, yeah.

107
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,760
 - So Andy the beef eater gave us a guided tour this week.

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
 And I gotta say, if you do go to the Tower of London,

109
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,320
 do get a tour from their beef eater's,

110
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,240
 'cause they are amazing.

111
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,720
 And they know all sorts of stuff.

112
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,240
 But you were duped into paying for a meal on your shirt.

113
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,680
 It's a very easy job to eat.

114
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,640
 (laughing)

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,840
 - I read this thing about the beef eater's that.

116
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,160
 So I think London, anyone coming here,

117
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,600
 there's a famous fact about the cabbies,

118
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 the bike cab drivers having the knowledge.

119
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,760
 It's one of those things.

120
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,480
 They have to memorize every single road in London.

121
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
 And that's a test they take.

122
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,040
 There's a similar thing that happens with the beef eater's.

123
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,080
 They have to memorize what's known as the story.

124
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 And it's 900 years of the Tower of London's history.

125
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,920
 They need to know it word by word

126
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,120
 within six months of passing their probation

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,360
 after being sworn in.

128
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,680
 - Yeah, but you now get these Uber beef eater's stuff

129
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
 who come in and they just read the story

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
 if they can not.

131
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,840
 - I don't think we know why they're called beef eater's, do we?

132
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
 There are lots of theories.

133
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
 The story we were told on the tour was that

134
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,920
 it was because they were paid in beef,

135
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,480
 which they know definitely is true or paid in meat,

136
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,040
 which they know definitely was true.

137
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,480
 And that the people outside kind of thought,

138
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,640
 I'll look at these guys eating all that meat.

139
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,680
 And so it was like an insult kind of thing.

140
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
 - It makes sense.

141
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,440
 I mean, and they're part of the royal household.

142
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,960
 They eat lots of meat, they eat lots of beef.

143
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,040
 - I've seen other people poo pooing like crazy that story.

144
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
 - That's just, all right.

145
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,480
 - But it just makes so much sense.

146
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,560
 It seems to be like one of those things

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
 that you can't really poo poo.

148
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,920
 It's like, yeah, they eat lots of beef

149
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,040
 and they're called beef eater's.

150
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,600
 - Do you have a better theory of red?

151
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,160
 - I've read two or three.

152
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,440
 There's one which is sort of it's from the French boufete,

153
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,360
 which is a different word meaning something else.

154
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
 - Yeah, that's clearly nonsense, isn't it?

155
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
 - What? Why?

156
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
 - Because that is such a convoluted way

157
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,200
 to get to the word beef eater

158
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,520
 rather than just they ate loads of beef.

159
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,680
 - I think eating beef is--

160
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,520
 - And we're paid in it.

161
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,600
 - There's probably something--

162
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,720
 - Who gets paid in the beef?

163
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,880
 - But we know they were paid in it.

164
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,720
 - They know that they were, yeah.

165
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,040
 We know they were given a stipend of beef,

166
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,080
 which most people were able to eat at the time.

167
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
 - Oh, we know the people took the place out

168
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,400
 of the royal household for having,

169
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,320
 'cause they ate so much beef around that time.

170
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,080
 - I think Andy's right, there's so many holes in this.

171
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,920
 - Just can't see.

172
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,760
 - I just don't believe it.

173
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
 - I don't believe it.

174
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,240
 - But it could be that it came from something else

175
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,880
 and then it was helped by the fact they ate lots of beef.

176
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
 - Yeah, exactly.

177
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,960
 It could have come from Buffetay.

178
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,080
 And then I'm not buying it.

179
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,920
 - So what is Buffetay?

180
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,680
 - But there are beef eaters today.

181
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,720
 The Ravens eat raw beef.

182
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,680
 - They get fed raw beef from Smithville, Marble.

183
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
 - The beef eaters probably eat beef.

184
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,120
 (all laughing)

185
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
 - Wait, are you gonna explain

186
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,240
 your definitely more plausible, weird, French origin

187
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,760
 convoluted on?

188
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,320
 - I did read this and I thought,

189
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
 well, that's clearly bollocks for the fun.

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,000
 - So the thing is that the beef eaters began,

191
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,040
 they're called the Yomangard of the King of Queen, right?

192
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,360
 Well, they're called the Yomang Waters,

193
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,760
 which is part of a larger group called the Yomangard.

194
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,400
 And they're kind of the bodyguard of the King of Queen.

195
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 But it started in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485,

196
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,480
 when Henry VII won the crown

197
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
 and all these guys who'd helped him,

198
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
 who were from this Northern Regiment,

199
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,480
 he brought them in and they became his bodyguard.

200
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,600
 But Henry VII will have been an English-speaking king.

201
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,040
 So if it was further back in Norman times,

202
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,880
 you can kind of see where the French thing might have come from.

203
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
 - Yeah. - That's a good point.

204
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,360
 - Whereas Henry VII's actually hailed from Wales.

205
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
 - Did he?

206
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,280
 - Yeah, the tutors were all Welsh family.

207
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,440
 - Is there any Welsh word

208
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,600
 that sounds a bit like B-feeters?

209
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,440
 - Tafferter?

210
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,040
 (all laughing)

211
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,000
 - It could have come from B-feeters.

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,880
 Like B, what's the B-feet?

213
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
 - You know a feat, like you accomplish a feat.

214
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,640
 - With a B. - Yeah, with a B.

215
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,480
 - B-racing or something.

216
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,760
 - Exactly, so maybe they were famous for their B-racing

217
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,440
 back in the day and they got known as the B-feeters.

218
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,280
 - That's good.

219
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,720
 - Maybe the Bs were the original Ravens, you think,

220
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
 but they trained.

221
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 - Well, maybe there was originally another group

222
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,520
 called the A-feeters who did lots of things.

223
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,360
 - Exactly, yeah.

224
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,560
 - And then they kind of died out

225
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,280
 and then the B-feeters came in.

226
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,120
 - Bingo.

227
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,320
 - The less good featers we could never got into the '18.

228
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
 - Maybe.

229
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,680
 - I'm just saying, there's a lot of explanations.

230
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,920
 - You're right.

231
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
 Did you see, when you were in the pub, James,

232
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,760
 I wonder if there's apparently a framed photo of Rudolf Hess.

233
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
 - I took a photo of it.

234
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
 - Did you?

235
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
 - Yeah, of his signature as well.

236
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
 - Wow.

237
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,520
 - He sort of signed, they asked him for a pin-up photo, basically,

238
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,680
 because he was a senior Nazi who was imprisoned there

239
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,040
 briefly in 1941.

240
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,520
 - I think he defected.

241
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,560
 - Everyone else was taking photos of all the pictures

242
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,200
 of B-feeters and stuff, but I clung to the signature

243
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,440
 of Rudolf Hess and I got to get a photo of that.

244
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,320
 - Well, you've got a large collection of Nazi signatures.

245
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,480
 Instantly, you recognise that.

246
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,960
 - I see that covenant behind the fake bookshelf in your house, right?

247
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
 (laughing)

248
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
 - Okay, that makes sense.

249
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,600
 He did he defect, because it sounds like when he was there,

250
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,960
 a lot of people collected his signature and that feels odd.

251
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,760
 - I think he flew over with his family to Scotland, by and all of a sudden.

252
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,120
 Yeah, I think he came out, I think, typically,

253
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,760
 there weren't many Nazis arrested during the war in the German side.

254
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,960
 - But he was prison, I wasn't he.

255
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
 - He was prisoned, yeah.

256
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
 - He was prisoned.

257
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,960
 - He wasn't just drinking at the pub.

258
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,720
 - Yeah, if you'd effect, they'd have to say,

259
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,120
 "Oh, great, well, welcome to Britain, here's your home."

260
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
 - Yeah, no, he was in jail.

261
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
 - And they were under.

262
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,040
 - And then they sort of asked you a few questions.

263
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

264
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,320
 - Are you sure you're Rudolf Hess, that kind of thing?

265
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

266
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,400
 - But then he did get tried after the war,

267
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
 didn't he and committed suicide in prison Hess?

268
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,960
 - I'm not saying it's a happy ending to the story.

269
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,800
 - Right.

270
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,640
 (laughing)

271
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,280
 - But also, let's not waste too much sympathy on the guy.

272
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,120
 (laughing)

273
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,160
 - So if you've got the Rudolf Hess,

274
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,720
 everyone else is doing B-feeters.

275
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,560
 - Did you see the framed photo of Bruce Willis?

276
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
 - I didn't see that.

277
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
 - Did you not?

278
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,760
 - I saw a framed picture of the Duke of Edinburgh.

279
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,880
 - Okay.

280
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,200
 - I didn't see Bruce Willis.

281
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,440
 - Well, it says, amongst the things that you'll find there,

282
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,920
 there's a ceremonial ax, which is in the corner,

283
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,680
 so that photos of guests like Bruce Willis and Tom Clancy,

284
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,360
 the-- - I don't know what Tom Clancy looks like.

285
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,600
 - No one does, so that could be--

286
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
 - Does he look like a Duke of Edinburgh?

287
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,360
 (laughing)

288
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,840
 - That's true, and you've got Facebook, though, so actually--

289
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,760
 - I would recognize Bruce Willis, perhaps.

290
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,600
 - Right.

291
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
 - If I was stuck next to someone who said,

292
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
 "That's Bruce Willis, yeah."

293
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
 (laughing)

294
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,320
 No, I didn't see that, but I wouldn't,

295
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,680
 you know, there's lots of pictures there.

296
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,520
 - Yeah.

297
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,880
 - Do they have pictures of their final prisoners?

298
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,240
 'Cause they should do, and actually I didn't read that they did,

299
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,480
 but their last prisoners were the Cray brothers, weren't they?

300
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,000
 - Oh, were they the very last prisoners?

301
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,840
 - Yeah. - Wow.

302
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,880
 - I think this is so odd, there's such a weird coincidence.

303
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,160
 - Well, it's because of their national service, right?

304
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,960
 - Yes, no, I know, but it's odd that it's them.

305
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,800
 - Yeah.

306
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
 - They were famous, right?

307
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,480
 - Yeah, exactly.

308
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,440
 So this was in 1952 before they were famous,

309
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,480
 and they had just--

310
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 - Where are they now?

311
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,440
 (laughing)

312
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,000
 - And they'd failed to report for national service,

313
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
 and they'd been on the run for ages,

314
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,920
 and then they'd been caught by a policeman

315
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,680
 who was like, "You didn't report for national service,

316
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,840
 "and I think they punched him."

317
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,640
 - Yeah, but I think their regimen--

318
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,840
 - Was based at the Tower of London.

319
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,680
 - Was based at the Tower of London.

320
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
 - Yeah, which is bizarre.

321
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,600
 - And Cray brothers, for any overseas listeners,

322
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,560
 they're the very famous mob London gangsters.

323
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 They are Godfather's, basically.

324
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,000
 - Made by Tom Hardy and Tom Hardy in that movie.

325
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
 - That's right, yes.

326
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
 - Yeah.

327
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
 Here's a tenuous link.

328
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,520
 You mentioned the Duke of Edinburgh just there.

329
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,360
 - I did.

330
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,760
 - So the Duke of Wellington--

331
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,600
 - Okay.

332
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,440
 - I completely different to you.

333
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
 (laughing)

334
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
 So the famous Duke of Wellington,

335
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,960
 the one who won the Battle of Waterloo,

336
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,200
 he was the Constable of the Tower for 26 years

337
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,680
 after the Battle of Waterloo,

338
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
 and he completely changed it.

339
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,800
 So he did this huge reform program.

340
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,560
 He stopped people selling their jobs as beef eaters,

341
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,280
 and he drained the moat,

342
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,320
 'cause lots of people were getting cholera, basically,

343
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,640
 'cause it was so stagnant.

344
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,240
 And he also closed the Royal Menagerie,

345
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,200
 which used to be based at the Tower of London.

346
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,040
 - Yeah.

347
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,880
 - And it closed it,

348
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,280
 because people kept being killed by the animals.

349
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
 - Oh really?

350
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
 - Really?

351
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,200
 - Used to just be allowed into the monkey room.

352
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 There were no barriers.

353
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,800
 - But the monkeys would eat you.

354
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,640
 - But they?

355
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
 - Well, they might--

356
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,480
 - They might nibble on you.

357
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
 - Well, that's kind of it.

358
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,360
 And account, the account was that a monkey,

359
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
 Toriboy's leg quotes in a dangerous manner.

360
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
 - Wow.

361
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,080
 - Yeah.

362
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,800
 An assistant keeper accidentally let a lion

363
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,160
 and two tigers into the same room,

364
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,720
 and they started killing each other,

365
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,000
 the wolves escaped and they ate a terrier.

366
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
 Lots of just constant accidents happening,

367
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
 'cause there were these wild animals there.

368
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,040
 - Wow.

369
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,160
 - And so when that guy came in,

370
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,400
 that's basically when they count the beef eaters from,

371
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
 really, beef eater number one was that guy,

372
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
 and then beef eater number two was his mate,

373
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,880
 and then so on and so on.

374
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,400
 They don't really have records for the previous ones,

375
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,080
 because they were so often sold between people.

376
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,440
 But from that guy to the present day,

377
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,800
 there have been about 400 beef eaters,

378
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,280
 and that is fewer than people who have been in space.

379
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,120
 - Wow.

380
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
 - Wow.

381
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
 - Have any beef eaters been in space?

382
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,200
 - Not to my knowledge.

383
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
 (laughing)

384
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,840
 So the guy who was the constable,

385
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,600
 he, historically, was allowed to keep all livestock

386
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,920
 that fell from Tower Bridge into the river.

387
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,320
 So anything that fell from the bridge into the river,

388
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
 he was allowed to keep it.

389
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,160
 - Again, that sitcom is gonna be a great episode

390
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,640
 where the constable is trying to push livestock off.

391
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,520
 (laughing)

392
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,560
 - And for every foot of livestock

393
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,200
 that stumbled into the Tower Moat,

394
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
 he received one penny.

395
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,720
 - Quite a lot to retrieve a cow from a moat,

396
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
 I would have thought.

397
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
 I think you've earned it if you do that.

398
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,560
 - Wait, so if a donkey puts one foot into the moat,

399
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
 you get one penny.

400
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,120
 - One foot in the moat, it could be the neighborhood

401
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,960
 of the sitcom.

402
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,480
 (laughing)

403
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,080
 - I believe that's right, yeah.

404
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,520
 - You mentioned Ravens before,

405
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,600
 the idea that they would be fed beef from,

406
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
 and what was it, an East London--

407
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,600
 - Smithfield Market.

408
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
 - Smithfield Market.

409
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,560
 - The Tower of London, one of the employees there,

410
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
 and I'm not sure if he counts technically

411
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,560
 as a yeoman wardo, but he's the Raven Master.

412
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,480
 - Yes, he is a beef eater.

413
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,120
 - So yeah, so they hire this guy who,

414
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,080
 his whole family lives there, they have a house,

415
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,160
 and he just has to look after these Ravens

416
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,920
 because of an enduring myth

417
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,320
 that if the Ravens left the Tower of London,

418
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
 England would fall.

419
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,160
 That's basically a ceremonial role just to fulfill

420
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,520
 this little men.

421
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,280
 And I've met him, he's a really cool guy.

422
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,400
 I've done it and stand up with him.

423
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,680
 - We did stand up with him.

424
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
 - Yeah, Chris, he was really cool.

425
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
 - He must have a lot of very relatable stories.

426
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
 (laughing)

427
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,520
 - Did he bring his Ravens?

428
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
 'Cause Ravens are very good at talking.

429
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,360
 - Are they?

430
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,480
 - Yeah, COVIDs are famously the best birds

431
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,400
 at kind of being able to form almost human sounding like words,

432
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,960
 and they're extremely clever.

433
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,800
 - Oh.

434
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,360
 - And so he's trained them up to do some quite cool stuff.

435
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,200
 - I thought he was getting bigger laughs than I was.

436
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,360
 - Random table four.

437
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,440
 - Yes, that's great!

438
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
 (laughing)

439
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,800
 - Then that's my bed!

440
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,360
 (laughing)

441
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,400
 - That was a genuine problem, wasn't it?

442
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,640
 When the Royal Astronomer was stationed

443
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,000
 at the Tower of London while they were waiting

444
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,360
 for the Greenwich Observatory to be built.

445
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,200
 And this was John Flamste, the first Royal Astronomer.

446
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,960
 And while the Observatory was being built,

447
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,240
 he was trying to do his astronomy at the Tower of London

448
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,880
 and the Ravens kept pooing on the telescope.

449
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,760
 And so he said, "Can you please remove all the Ravens?"

450
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,000
 And King Charles was going to,

451
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
 I think it was Charles II was going to,

452
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,200
 and then said, "Oh no, I've heard that the crown will fall."

453
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,080
 - But for him, it will have been quite close

454
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,880
 to the last time the crown fell, right?

455
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,200
 Charles II.

456
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,560
 - Yeah, I suppose it was.

457
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,880
 - So he's just come back, he's just restored the crown.

458
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,640
 I can understand why he's worried.

459
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,480
 - But he's worried. - That he's worried.

460
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
 - You're right.

461
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,160
 It's totally understandable.

462
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,880
 - Like these days, I think no one seriously expects

463
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,720
 if the Ravens go, and he's looking to be like he does.

464
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,400
 - Well, this guy would be out of a house and a job.

465
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,560
 Chris, if they can.

466
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,320
 - Well, they do just be able to stand up

467
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,760
 for a career to fall back.

468
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,000
 I should add, it was a night of historical talks.

469
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,280
 He happened to be very funny,

470
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
 and it was mainly stand-ups doing it.

471
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,480
 His talk was on Jack the Ripper.

472
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,760
 So it was a bit dark, actually.

473
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,640
 - Jack do all the Ripper more like.

474
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,480
 - Yeah.

475
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
 - He's in that sweat and crows.

476
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,480
 (laughing)

477
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,060
 (upbeat music)

478
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:17,280
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

479
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,240
 My fact is that the economic activity of the Roman Empire

480
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,240
 can be measured by studying thousand-year-old ice

481
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,920
 in Greenland.

482
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,760
 - Wow.

483
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,600
 - Wow.

484
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
 - That's amazing.

485
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,280
 - Amazing.

486
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,120
 - It's so cool.

487
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,840
 Okay, so it takes a tiny bit of explaining.

488
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
 So a group of scientists have released a new study,

489
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,000
 which is all about measuring the Greenland ice sheet.

490
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,600
 There's a miles thick ice sheet covering

491
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,880
 a huge amount of Greenland.

492
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,640
 And we know when ice forms, because we know how much snow falls

493
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,560
 and it packs down and it becomes ice,

494
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,120
 and it gradually gets deeper and deeper.

495
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,840
 So the scientists have been studying the period

496
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,840
 between 1,100 BC, 3,000 years ago, and 800 AD.

497
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,800
 And they've been measuring the chemicals in there.

498
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,640
 And one thing we know from that time in history

499
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,800
 is that Rome was making lots of coins,

500
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,440
 and the production of the coins, the coins were silver,

501
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,640
 that they produced a lot of lead pollution,

502
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,920
 'cause they were using all which contained lead.

503
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,320
 That lead wafted all the way across the world.

504
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,760
 It ended up in Greenland.

505
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,200
 It gets rained down, packed into the ice.

506
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,680
 And since 1999, scientists have been measuring

507
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,680
 the lead level, corresponding with exact years in history,

508
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,840
 and they can produce documents now showing that, for example,

509
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,520
 when Rome devalued its currency in 64 AD,

510
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,200
 there was less silver in each coin,

511
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,280
 so there would have been less lead produced,

512
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,720
 so there's less lead in the ice.

513
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,560
 - Yeah.

514
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,840
 - It's extraordinary. - It's nuts.

515
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,680
 - It's really good.

516
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,720
 It doesn't help people in ancient Rome

517
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,520
 who want to know whether to invest in things.

518
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,360
 - No, it doesn't.

519
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
 - Sadly.

520
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,040
 (laughing)

521
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,520
 - But yeah, they follow, I think they've debunked

522
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,440
 and thought that when the Roman Republic fell,

523
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,560
 the economy was booming, and they've actually worked out

524
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,720
 that when it came to the fall of the Republic,

525
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,320
 the lead amounts in the ice actually show

526
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,280
 that it was undergoing a bit of a recession.

527
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,560
 And stuff like when Rome took Carthage,

528
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,080
 they got all the Carthaginian mines,

529
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,320
 so suddenly they were mining a hell of a lot more silver,

530
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,080
 and you can see that exact year

531
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,960
 of the Carthaginian invasion from looking at the ice.

532
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,000
 - How far away is a distance that we're talking here

533
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,080
 from the mines to the ice?

534
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,920
 - It's thousands of miles.

535
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,760
 - Thousands of miles.

536
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,440
 It just shows you how strong wind is, doesn't it?

537
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
 - That's my main takeaway.

538
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,200
 - Well, I just, if you think about it, no.

539
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
 - I tell you what's weird.

540
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 The prevailing wind in the world

541
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,800
 goes from Greenland to the east because of the jet stream.

542
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,040
 So how is it going?

543
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,360
 It must be going all the way around the world.

544
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,200
 - All the way around the world.

545
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,480
 - I don't know about that, by the way.

546
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,320
 - Wow.

547
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,760
 - It makes sense, right?

548
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,960
 - But it's like, you know how as well,

549
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,080
 how there are sheep in whales

550
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,320
 that have been affected by the Chernobyl radiation.

551
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,920
 Like that's carried through the wind.

552
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
 - That is the lake district.

553
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,640
 - And the lake district is just winders, you know.

554
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,560
 - And that got there even faster than this 2000 years.

555
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,240
 - Wait a minute though, Chernobyl also to the east

556
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,960
 of the lake districts and whales,

557
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,320
 but that didn't go all the way around the world.

558
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,600
 So maybe my jet stream theory.

559
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,240
 - It feels like wind might be more complicated

560
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,640
 than just the one big gust going around the world.

561
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
 - Thank you so much.

562
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
 - It might be a couple of different directions.

563
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,720
 - I think this is very powerful flat earth evidence.

564
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,560
 - Yes.

565
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,040
 - I'll probably be shouting down in the comments about this.

566
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,720
 - One explanation for it going the wrong way

567
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,480
 is as one person pointed out,

568
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,160
 this is the hypothesis at the moment,

569
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,640
 but for instance, it ignores the fact

570
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,000
 that China existed and was doing quite well

571
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 around that time.

572
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,960
 - I think Western scientists and historians

573
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,080
 always have a tendency to do.

574
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,920
 And it could well be that China was just producing

575
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,600
 massive amounts of silver or lead or whatever

576
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,920
 that was influencing it.

577
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,200
 - But we don't know, but it could be that

578
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,000
 something was coming from the east to affect it.

579
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,960
 - But it does seem to fit in with these things in Rome.

580
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,800
 - Yeah.

581
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,240
 - So for instance, there was a plague,

582
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,040
 the Antonin plague, which they think,

583
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,080
 they're not sure what caused it,

584
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,240
 but lots of people died.

585
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,200
 It might have been smallpox.

586
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
 It might even have been Ebola.

587
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,760
 And this was in between 250 and 262,

588
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,640
 when 5,000 people a day were said to be dying.

589
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,480
 And the amount of lead being produced then

590
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,840
 obviously went down because people

591
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,080
 had more pressing things on their minds.

592
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,560
 But they assumed 250 AD, who was it?

593
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,480
 Christians.

594
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,320
 Assumed it was to do the Christians.

595
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,880
 And so they basically sought out as many scapegoats

596
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,960
 as they could and they kind of executed

597
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,560
 a load of clergy and stuff like that.

598
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
 - Wow.

599
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,920
 - Did it work?

600
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,000
 - Did it work?

601
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,600
 - Well, we no longer have Christianity.

602
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,240
 (laughing)

603
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,360
 - On that, a lot of people think

604
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,160
 because it was so persecuted during this plague,

605
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,240
 that kind of made Christianity a lot more solid

606
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
 as a religion.

607
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,280
 And that's kind of one of the main things

608
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,640
 that made it such a worldwide religion in the end.

609
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,480
 - Wow.

610
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
 - There you go, bully someone and make them stronger.

611
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
 - Yes.

612
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,640
 No, don't bully someone.

613
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,760
 No, don't bully someone.

614
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,200
 But if you are being bullied, you'll come out of it stronger.

615
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
 - Okay.

616
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,880
 - Is that right?

617
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
 - That's a healthier message here.

618
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,640
 - So just quickly on this whole Greenland ice-led thing,

619
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,440
 have you guys heard of Claire Patterson?

620
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,160
 (laughing)

621
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,920
 Does she, is she the Venn diagram?

622
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,760
 - She is.

623
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
 - All those words.

624
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
 (laughing)

625
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,840
 - She's a he actually.

626
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,680
 He was a scientist.

627
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,600
 - Ah, he was an amazing guy.

628
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,720
 I wish we could do a whole podcast on him.

629
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,760
 He was trying to find out how all the universe was

630
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,200
 in the 1950s.

631
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,480
 Okay, so that involves calculating

632
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,680
 how fast uranium decays.

633
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,520
 But he found massive lead contamination

634
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
 everywhere he went.

635
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,560
 And it drove him mad.

636
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,160
 There was all this lead showing up

637
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,120
 that shouldn't have been there.

638
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
 He tried and tried and tried to build

639
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,480
 this incredibly lead-free lamp, basically.

640
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,800
 He scrubbed everything.

641
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
 He cleaned everything for years.

642
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,480
 He founded basically the first ever clean laboratory.

643
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,040
 And he proved that lead in petrol was bad.

644
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
 And that was, he-

645
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,880
 - Ah, I saw him.

646
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
 - Yeah, he was the guy who demonstrated later in his career

647
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,000
 that modern Americans had 600 times as much lead

648
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 in their bodies as ancient Egyptians.

649
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,840
 - Wow.

650
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,680
 - All thanks to lead-ed petrol.

651
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,800
 Yeah, and so as part of this research,

652
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,480
 he went to remote spots in Greenland and Antarctica

653
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,720
 and measured the lead much further down.

654
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,920
 So this is one of the stories of the last two millennia

655
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,600
 is massively increasing amounts of lead.

656
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
 And that lead to all these efforts lead

657
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,600
 to all the efforts to cut lead out of petrol, for example.

658
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,440
 - Really?

659
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,280
 - Yeah.

660
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,880
 - Because the person who invented putting lead in petrol

661
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,120
 was Thomas Midgeley.

662
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,520
 And that was a really good invention

663
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,240
 'cause it stopped knocking and engines.

664
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,080
 - Right.

665
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,360
 - But when it first happened, everyone thought,

666
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,600
 this is an amazing, oh, just putting lead in there

667
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,120
 that solves this massive problem.

668
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
 - Yeah, these to be all these little explosions

669
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,840
 and the car engine basically is when you put kerosene in.

670
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,240
 - Okay, and that's knocking.

671
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,080
 - And there's good knocking.

672
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,800
 And they try hundreds of different experiments

673
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,120
 and chemicals to try and get rid of the knock.

674
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,400
 And once it did, that was huge.

675
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,880
 It made cars a real thing.

676
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,560
 (laughing)

677
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,400
 - Wow.

678
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
 This guy sounds awesome.

679
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,040
 - Yeah, he does.

680
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
 - It was very bad for you.

681
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,520
 We should say, lead is bad.

682
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,360
 - Lead is bad.

683
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,520
 - Well, isn't it true?

684
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,360
 That the, a lot of people put the fall of the Roman Empire

685
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,360
 down to lead in the pipes.

686
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,200
 - I pointed it out.

687
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
 - The plumbing was that.

688
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,360
 - Yeah, the plumbing was made of lead.

689
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,640
 And so they were lead poisoned

690
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,160
 and that supposedly killed off a lot of the rich people.

691
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,000
 - Don't know if that's true.

692
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
 - Well, I've heard, so Roman miners,

693
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
 they knew that lead was bad

694
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,920
 'cause they shielded themselves

695
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,080
 by covering their mouths with animal blood as incidentally.

696
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,800
 So a lot of people knew that lead was bad for you,

697
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,120
 but they still kept the pipes being out of lead.

698
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
 I think some people said, even at the time,

699
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,400
 are we sure about this lead stuff?

700
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,240
 - Yeah, right.

701
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,080
 - Everyone said no, no, no, it's fine.

702
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,080
 - Would people at the time have died a sort of,

703
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,440
 they would have just slowly got ill

704
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,600
 and it would have looked like,

705
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,720
 oh, you've got a flu and then it,

706
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
 or would it be instant lead lead?

707
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
 - Not sure what sentence of lead poisoning.

708
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,920
 - Oh, yeah.

709
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,080
 - Then you go a bit mad, didn't you?

710
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,520
 - I just wonder how long it would take

711
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,520
 if someone, sinister, had re-plumbed.

712
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,360
 - Rudolf Hess for instance.

713
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,280
 - Rudolf Hess re-plumbed the city of London

714
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
 with lead piping.

715
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
 (all laughing)

716
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,440
 - Wow.

717
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,080
 Super bellied blood.

718
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,360
 - It's a subtly trade.

719
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,200
 - Sutterly.

720
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,640
 - Every single one.

721
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,240
 - How long must be better ways?

722
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,720
 - But how long before we would notice it?

723
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 - Just the fat bugs alone in the ice.

724
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,560
 - It can be done.

725
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,520
 - A supervillain that rises to prominence

726
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,040
 in Thames water, right?

727
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,880
 - Yes.

728
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,240
 - And slowly start saying all the replacement pipes

729
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,120
 have lead in them and then 40 years like,

730
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,920
 no, it's really weird.

731
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,880
 Your body thinks that lead is calcium.

732
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
 It mistakes the two, chemically.

733
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,680
 And it absolutely shreds you on the inside.

734
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,840
 It gets in the way of all your neurotransmitters

735
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,040
 and sends them crazy.

736
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,560
 It weakens the blood brain barrier

737
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,920
 so you're more vulnerable to,

738
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,800
 it has about 30 different horrible effects on your body.

739
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,960
 - Well, so your body tries to do the same stuff with it

740
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,840
 as it does with calcium, like build your nails

741
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 and things like that.

742
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,960
 - Yeah, do you have bones made of lead?

743
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,560
 - I start drawing with our fingers.

744
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,120
 (all laughing)

745
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,920
 - There's no lead in pencil stuff.

746
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,080
 - Okay, I'm not sure.

747
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,720
 I don't know.

748
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
 I don't know the full details, anyway.

749
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,960
 - It wouldn't be super efficient though.

750
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,680
 You couldn't guarantee to wipe everyone out.

751
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,320
 - What an infrastructure-based bond movie

752
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,400
 that would be over a period of several decades.

753
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,360
 - I just wonder what point would someone know?

754
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,800
 Like, hang on, I think what London is suffering from

755
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,240
 is everyone's being poisoned by lead.

756
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
 - I'm looking forward to this movie called "led finger."

757
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
 (all laughing)

758
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,040
 He does all this in London,

759
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,120
 but also can write things when it's bigger.

760
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,880
 (all laughing)

761
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,880
 - I have a few things about great things found in ice.

762
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,480
 So in Southern Yukon, they have had ice melting recently

763
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,040
 and there's a big patch that's melted

764
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,720
 and underneath it, they found all this caribou dung

765
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,960
 that's been sitting there held in the ice.

766
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,520
 Now, what's interesting is there is no caribou

767
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,600
 that exists in Southern Yukon, but what it's done

768
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
 is it's confirmed one of the oldest oral history stories

769
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,960
 that have passed down from the First Nations people,

770
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,640
 as it says in the article,

771
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
 the First Nations people of the area

772
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,160
 who claimed that the land used to be roamed by caribou.

773
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,520
 So they did these tests on it

774
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,000
 and they've discovered that some of them are hundreds of years old,

775
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 the dunks, some are thousands of years old.

776
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,200
 So an oral history that's made it all the way through

777
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
 that was thought to be wrong has been confirmed.

778
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,440
 - Yeah.

779
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,560
 Frozen deer in ice are actually a bit of a problem now though,

780
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,400
 aren't they?

781
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,280
 So there was that thing last year, I think,

782
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,280
 which was about the permafrost melting in Siberia

783
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,480
 and when the permafrost melts, then it starts to explode

784
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
 and this is because of global warming,

785
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,320
 it exposes the dead bodies of things

786
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
 that have died of bad diseases.

787
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,840
 And I think it exposed a reindeer who had anthrax poisoning

788
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,520
 and it had anthrax poisoning in 1895,

789
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,720
 but it released the anthrax back into the atmosphere

790
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,680
 and I think someone died of anthrax poisoning actually.

791
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
 - Really?

792
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
 - Yeah, and now scientists are saying that, you know,

793
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
 it's as it melts in global warming advances on us

794
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,680
 and it's going to release all sorts of old stuff,

795
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,280
 like bubonic plague is going to...

796
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
 - I've heard smallpox.

797
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
 - I've heard smallpox.

798
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,880
 - I've heard smallpox is going to come back, yeah.

799
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,760
 - It's a good sequel for your movie, Dan.

800
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,600
 - Yes.

801
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,960
 - Next movie, "The Super Villain Mooster Siberia"

802
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,120
 with a hair dryer.

803
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
 (laughing)

804
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,400
 - No, come on, just hair dryer in the world.

805
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
 - No, he comes back here selling ice cubes

806
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,200
 to everyone in London.

807
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,320
 They melt in the house, and everyone dies

808
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,640
 when they have a cup of water on us.

809
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,240
 - Why do all these films set only in London?

810
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
 (laughing)

811
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
 - 'Cause he's James Bond, he's British, yeah.

812
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
 - Yeah.

813
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,480
 - I really like this fact, okay,

814
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,280
 because it's sort of a historical thing

815
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,920
 being revealed by science and it's kind of an exciting

816
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,200
 crossing of those two academic worlds

817
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,160
 and something quite similar to that,

818
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,680
 was you know the saddle worth more fires this year.

819
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,520
 - Yep.

820
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,960
 - So that was in the Manchester area obviously.

821
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,280
 One side effect of those fires is that it's going to release

822
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,120
 all of this long lost pollutant from the industrial revolution

823
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,360
 because it's, I know it's exciting.

824
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,720
 (laughing)

825
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,960
 We're all going to die in some way.

826
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,760
 - I noticed the people in North Manchester.

827
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,600
 - Yeah.

828
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,440
 - Just my family really.

829
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,360
 - Yeah, I'm really sorry about that, you should give them a call.

830
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,000
 But the reason for this is that the peat

831
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,640
 is an unbelievably good store.

832
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,000
 So you know people talk about peat being a really good carbon store.

833
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 So it holds it for hundreds of years.

834
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,640
 It's also a good store of other substances and pollutants.

835
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,240
 And then the fires just set fire to it all

836
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,360
 and release them all into the air.

837
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,200
 So we're getting to now inhale that deliciously

838
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,040
 smoggy stuff that the Victorians are doing.

839
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,480
 - I want to kind of rain down, I guess, right?

840
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,840
 - I don't think you'll be able to see

841
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,640
 sort of bits of 19th century coal falling out of the sky.

842
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,480
 - What?

843
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,320
 - I mean, sometimes you get that.

844
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,360
 - Don't you like when it's been, like it picks up sand

845
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,160
 from the Sahara and it rains down in--

846
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,960
 - Yeah, might get a bit more smoggy.

847
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,920
 But you won't be able to tell it's 19th century coal,

848
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,400
 particularly there won't be a top hat raining down

849
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,440
 with it or a pipe.

850
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
 Hey, that could be the third film you're trying to do then.

851
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,280
 - Yes.

852
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,120
 - Peat finger.

853
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,640
 - Peat finger, yeah.

854
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,160
 No, he's a sex offender from a nutshell, I think.

855
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
 - Yeah.

856
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
 - No, this, you would need the villain

857
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,640
 to create a gust of wind that sends all the peat

858
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,400
 from Manchester to London, but could we do this

859
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
 with his giant hairdryer?

860
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
 - Yes, okay, so all right.

861
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,320
 So the villain of the second film we survived

862
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
 into the third.

863
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,400
 - 'Cause last week we did mention that they're looking

864
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,160
 for a new director of the Bond films.

865
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,680
 (laughing)

866
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,720
 I think we're only cementing our pledge to become that.

867
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,040
 (laughing)

868
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,640
 (upbeat music)

869
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,000
 - Time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

870
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,400
 My fact this week is that the umlauts that are used

871
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,920
 for the band Motley Crew are purely decorative.

872
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,560
 They're not intended to have pronunciation.

873
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,440
 However, when Motley Crew first performed in Germany,

874
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
 the crowd didn't know that and chanted,

875
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
 "Motley Krug!"

876
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,680
 "Motley Krug!"

877
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,320
 (laughing)

878
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,400
 - This is fantastic.

879
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,680
 Now this was tweeted by Quikipedia a couple of days ago

880
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,160
 since we recorded, and we needed proper verification on it,

881
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,160
 and we got it from Tommy Lee, the drummer of Motley Crew

882
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,880
 or Motley Krug, who said, "Ha ha, Tra!"

883
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,720
 Nick, to someone who asked him on behalf of us.

884
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,680
 So yeah, we've got confirmation,

885
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,240
 yeah, that they were Motley Krug.

886
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,960
 It's very exciting 'cause the metal umlaut

887
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
 is purely decorative.

888
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,480
 Motohead had it as well.

889
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,480
 Maximo Park, Maximo Park, and yeah, so that's very,

890
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,960
 very exciting.

891
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,000
 It's a proper verification from a real source,

892
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
 which is also awesome.

893
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,080
 I was looking into Tommy Lee if you don't know who he is.

894
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,920
 So he is a drummer of Motley Crew.

895
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,120
 - He's married to Pamela Anderson.

896
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,840
 Responsible for the leaked porn video as well.

897
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,080
 I don't know if he leaked it, but famously her porn video,

898
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,720
 there are two, he is one.

899
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,440
 - Oh, this is a real trip down memory lane.

900
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

901
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,040
 - She is a first celebrity story of the world.

902
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,680
 - You were the boom operator for that film, didn't you?

903
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,080
 - I thought of about 15 years that Tommy Lee

904
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,640
 was the same person as Tommy Lee Jones.

905
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
 - Yeah, and then I used to watch men in black

906
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
 and be like, "I can't believe this guy."

907
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,640
 - With family, yeah.

908
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,720
 - He does have a surname, Tommy Lee.

909
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,040
 But he doesn't use it.

910
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,360
 And I only just learnt it before we started recording.

911
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,440
 It's bass.

912
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,960
 And I reckon he doesn't use it because he's the drummer.

913
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,080
 So that would have just been confusing.

914
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,400
 - Very, yeah.

915
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,520
 Whereas just shoving umla, it was left right in center

916
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,760
 that all the first three pronounce is absolutely fine.

917
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,080
 - So it's just a convention in metal bands, right?

918
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,840
 - Well, I guess not just metal bands,

919
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
 'cause I just learnt as well that JZ used to have

920
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,000
 an umla in his name.

921
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,840
 - What?

922
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,080
 - Yeah, he over, I guess, well, he doesn't specify.

923
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,680
 He just said I used to have an umla.

924
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,240
 And he uses punctuation quite oddly.

925
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,880
 He had a hyphen to begin with.

926
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,240
 He got rid of the hyphen.

927
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,440
 His latest album came back.

928
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,920
 He not only came back with a hyphen,

929
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,520
 but in all caps as well.

930
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
 So JZ is now shouting at you.

931
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,360
 And he admitted that he used to have an umla out there.

932
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,240
 - Do you know I think we should have an umla out in our name?

933
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,520
 Or maybe some kind of punctuation?

934
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,360
 - I think we definitely.

935
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,040
 It seems like a supply way to make yourself sound hard, basically.

936
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,880
 - No, no, such thing as a fish.

937
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,760
 - No, 'cause then we sound like we're from Yorkshire.

938
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
 (laughing)

939
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,400
 - There's no such thing as a fish.

940
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,040
 (laughing)

941
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,320
 - It's fine line between heavy metal and Yorkshire.

942
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,120
 (laughing)

943
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,080
 - Has JZ ever done an autobiography?

944
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,920
 - He has, yeah.

945
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,400
 Is it called J2Z?

946
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
 (laughing)

947
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,440
 - It's not, and it should be, why is it not?

948
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,320
 And I'm pretty sure it is an A to Z as well.

949
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,160
 - You're kidding, yeah?

950
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,000
 - No.

951
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,840
 - No.

952
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,680
 - I'm pretty sure.

953
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,240
 - And who does a A to Z of their art and biography?

954
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,320
 - It's quite a fun idea.

955
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,440
 - Matt Lucas did it.

956
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,960
 We should write an A to Z book.

957
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,120
 - Yeah, but you do have some B is Bond,

958
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,760
 but what do you do before that?

959
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,040
 - Oh yeah.

960
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,480
 Antenatal, I guess.

961
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,320
 - Nice.

962
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,160
 - Yeah.

963
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
 - It's not as good as the movie ideas.

964
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
 - Interesting.

965
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,040
 (laughing)

966
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,920
 - Stick to another sequel of those.

967
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,800
 - So on the metal um-lout,

968
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,080
 the first band to have a num-lout was called

969
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,640
 Amon Dual, the second, that's A, M, O, N, D,

970
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,400
 U, um-lout, U, um-lout, L, and then two eyes.

971
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,480
 But that is fair enough because dual is a Turkish word

972
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,640
 which has um-louts in it.

973
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,480
 - Oh.

974
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,120
 - And the first band to give itself a spurious

975
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,880
 on-lout was Blue Eister cult.

976
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,720
 - Oh yeah.

977
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,880
 - Oh, of course.

978
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,720
 - Yes, yeah.

979
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,560
 - Over which?

980
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,400
 - Lesson.

981
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
 - Over the O in Eister.

982
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
 - Mmm.

983
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
 - Mmm.

984
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,680
 - And the longest continuous um-louted word

985
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,840
 in the world is Ya, so J-A-A-A,

986
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,080
 all of which have um-louts above are.

987
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,360
 It's Estonian and it means the edge of the ice.

988
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,640
 So when you get to the edge of the ice,

989
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,480
 - Yeah.

990
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,040
 - Oh, that was good.

991
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,240
 - So yeah, punctuation.

992
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,240
 - Yeah.

993
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,200
 - So, I think we've covered before the intera bang,

994
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,080
 maybe on QI, which was that was something

995
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,840
 that actually appeared on typewriters in the '60s,

996
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,800
 which was a question mark and an exclamation mark

997
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,640
 that were elided, which means you're asking a question,

998
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,560
 but like, oh, we're going to the cinema today

999
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,240
 in a really excited way.

1000
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,760
 I had a really sad childhood.

1001
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,400
 I was the one who kind of think they got me excited.

1002
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,800
 But another thing that the language has always been

1003
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,320
 hunting for is ways to show irony, right?

1004
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,720
 So people have always been trying to invent bits of punctuation

1005
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,400
 that show you're being sarcastic.

1006
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,920
 And actually, the first person who suggested a way of doing that

1007
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,720
 was a guy called John Wilkins.

1008
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,080
 And do you remember John Wilkins?

1009
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,920
 - Nope, no.

1010
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,720
 - He is the guy who also was the first person

1011
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,560
 to plan to put a man on the moon and design a rocket

1012
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,840
 for it, Oliver Cromwell's brother.

1013
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,680
 - Yes.

1014
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,960
 - So was he suggesting that ironically?

1015
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
 - It was a one big joke.

1016
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,080
 (laughing)

1017
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,520
 Out of hand.

1018
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,560
 Yeah, his main thing was he wrote this huge book

1019
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,600
 on how to change the language.

1020
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,280
 And he said he should have an upside down exclamation mark

1021
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,560
 to show irony.

1022
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,600
 - Well, they call that the sarc mark, don't they?

1023
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
 - They do, yes.

1024
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,240
 - It's the sarcasm, yes.

1025
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,480
 - Just on another symbol that didn't kick off.

1026
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,920
 I read this fact, and it's hard actually to verify it.

1027
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,720
 So it'd be interested to know if anyone can get

1028
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,480
 to the bottom of this, but Hagrid Hawkes,

1029
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,960
 who's a fantastic Twitter account and has a few books,

1030
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,480
 he put this up saying that in 1580,

1031
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,240
 English printer Henry Denham,

1032
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,800
 proposed using a reverse question mark,

1033
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
 so a sort of mirror-imaged question mark

1034
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,880
 to indicate when a question was rhetorical,

1035
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,160
 which would be very useful if you were an author.

1036
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
 - Would it?

1037
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
 - Yeah, it would.

1038
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,840
 - No, no, no.

1039
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,160
 (laughing)

1040
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,720
 - So we think that this might,

1041
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
 we're not sure if this is true, right?

1042
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,800
 Because we've not found anything earlier than the 1990s,

1043
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,560
 of evidence for it, although Denham,

1044
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,160
 he did invent two different types of question mark.

1045
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,280
 One for yes, no questions,

1046
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,640
 and another one for questions that begin with WH,

1047
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
 like why were what?

1048
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
 So he had two different questions marks for those.

1049
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
 - What was that for?

1050
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,640
 Why do you need a special question mark

1051
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,280
 to let you know the question begins with WH?

1052
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,120
 'Cause--

1053
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,320
 - In case it's been such a long sentence,

1054
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,680
 you can't remember the word of the handle.

1055
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,120
 - I think the reason that we don't still have them

1056
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,200
 is because they're not that useful.

1057
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,160
 But he was the first person also to use semi-colons

1058
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,640
 with any kind of regularity.

1059
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,880
 He didn't invent them,

1060
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,800
 but he was the first one to use them regularly.

1061
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,920
 - Nice.

1062
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,040
 - And consistently.

1063
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,080
 He also invented the word parathesis for brackets

1064
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,600
 which later became parentheses.

1065
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,880
 - Oh, wow.

1066
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
 - Oh, he had a huge influence.

1067
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,480
 - Yeah, so he was a massive kind of punctuation, dude.

1068
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,920
 But huge in that world amongst all the greats.

1069
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,480
 - Well, semi-colons, I didn't realize,

1070
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,680
 some people really hate semi-colons, basically.

1071
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,880
 So George Orwell, he hated them so much

1072
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,040
 then he wrote a novel called "Coming Up for Air"

1073
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,360
 is one of his early ones, I think,

1074
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,320
 and he put no semi-colons in.

1075
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,600
 But then he was a bit worried that no one would notice

1076
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,440
 that he hadn't put any in.

1077
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,560
 So he wrote to his publisher, saying,

1078
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,440
 "I haven't put any semi-colons in here."

1079
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,280
 (laughing)

1080
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,440
 Oh, man.

1081
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,720
 - So childish.

1082
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,160
 - I know, one of the great writers.

1083
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,000
 - Yeah.

1084
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,960
 - Hemingway as well, very much.

1085
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,000
 So played with the rules of punctuation.

1086
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,440
 But he only did so with the claim that he knew it's so well

1087
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,600
 that he was able to go beyond the acceptable rules.

1088
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,840
 - I think that's quite normal.

1089
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,680
 - Yeah.

1090
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
 - I think that's quite standard, I would say people,

1091
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,120
 like Hillary Mantell and Rachel Cusk do that,

1092
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,000
 but it's because you can feel they've got such a good grasp of it

1093
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,400
 that they're mastering it rather than just spewing nonsense

1094
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,040
 onto a page and then going,

1095
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,280
 "Oh yeah, it's just so familiar with the art."

1096
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

1097
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,240
 So William Blake would sometimes put a full stop

1098
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,840
 in the middle of a word.

1099
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,680
 (laughing)

1100
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,360
 - What a maverick.

1101
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,200
 (laughing)

1102
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,120
 Is that because it was to be read and he wanted the punctuation

1103
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,720
 of a word to be broken up?

1104
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,640
 - I don't know, he also saw a lot of angels.

1105
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,920
 So, it might have been taking dictation from them.

1106
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,480
 - Guys, the punctuation point I need all the time

1107
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,960
 is a question mark colon.

1108
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
 And I can't believe this isn't a thing.

1109
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,000
 When you're writing an email and you're like,

1110
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
 "What about these points?"

1111
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,840
 And then you give a list and I always put a question mark

1112
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,560
 followed by a colon and it looks stupid.

1113
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,200
 It's, I think that's the most essential piece of punctuation

1114
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,120
 and no one's ever come up with one as far as I know.

1115
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,600
 - Yeah, so how are we gonna fix it?

1116
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,720
 - Is it a question mark with two dots at the bottom?

1117
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
 - Sideways, I'm allowed to at the bottom.

1118
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,760
 I have a second dot underneath the first dot.

1119
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,000
 So it's a way to start.

1120
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,160
 - Sideways, yeah, right.

1121
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,440
 - What about a second dot in the middle

1122
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,960
 of the round bit of the question mark?

1123
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,880
 Like an eyeball.

1124
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,560
 - Like an eyeball.

1125
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
 - Or a nipple?

1126
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,640
 Let's make the question mark a bit sexy.

1127
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,840
 - I think dots at the bottom makes more sense, doesn't it?

1128
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,720
 - We could call them question knocks.

1129
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,560
 - Okay, no.

1130
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,400
 - Oh god.

1131
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,800
 - Let's just send it.

1132
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,920
 That's actually being called a high brow point initially, I feel.

1133
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,320
 (laughing)

1134
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,900
 (upbeat music)

1135
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,320
 - Okay, it's time for our final step to the show

1136
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,400
 and that is Chazinski.

1137
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,480
 - My fact this week is that traditionally,

1138
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,080
 indigenous Hawaiians had personalized chance

1139
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,320
 for their genitals.

1140
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,360
 - That's unusual to be Hawaiians.

1141
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,120
 (laughing)

1142
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,280
 - This is so amazing.

1143
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,480
 All of this stuff about indigenous Hawaiians

1144
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,120
 and the what they associated with their genitals,

1145
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,160
 which I spent a lot of time reading about this week.

1146
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,400
 But I should say, I read it initially on the BBC

1147
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,240
 of such a cheat.

1148
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,520
 It was a series of amazing sex facts from around the world

1149
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,560
 and I saw that and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard it.

1150
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,600
 - That's not a cheat.

1151
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,080
 - This, is that not a cheat?

1152
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,920
 - No.

1153
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,080
 - I felt like a cheat.

1154
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,280
 - You're not allowed to get your facts from anywhere.

1155
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,760
 - I actually went to Hawaii to try and find something.

1156
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,080
 I didn't find anything.

1157
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,760
 - I went to Hawaii, you stood in the air pot

1158
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,480
 and did a chance about my genitals.

1159
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
 (laughing)

1160
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,000
 - Not allowed back in the United States.

1161
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
 (laughing)

1162
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,560
 This started being recorded from the 18th century

1163
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,080
 when cook and others went to Hawaii

1164
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,440
 and yeah, it turns out that indigenous Hawaiians

1165
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,080
 would give their genitals a name

1166
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,760
 or their parents would give their genitals a name

1167
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,440
 almost as soon as they were born

1168
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,800
 and they'd also design, they'd also write a song for them

1169
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,280
 and sort of have a story around their genitals

1170
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,000
 and it's called the Mille Mai, the genital chant

1171
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,560
 and it describes that individual's organ.

1172
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,520
 - So you had to, sorry, you had to name your child

1173
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,480
 and then you also had to name your child's genitals.

1174
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,280
 - It's hard enough to find a good name for your child, isn't it?

1175
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,760
 Have you reckon they had pucks?

1176
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,360
 (laughing)

1177
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,400
 The perfect name for your child's genitals.

1178
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
 (laughing)

1179
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,040
 I named my child's genitals after his grandpa's genitals.

1180
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,560
 (laughing)

1181
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,080
 - One example that I found was Queen Liliro Kulanis

1182
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,760
 Mille Mai was the story of her vagina

1183
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,840
 and it was called anapal, which meant frisky

1184
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,880
 and it was about her frolicing genitals

1185
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,200
 that went up and down apparently.

1186
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,040
 - Oh.

1187
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,360
 - So yeah, they used to frolic it.

1188
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,560
 - I think the source of the b-barticle

1189
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,520
 was this paper by a guy called Milton Diamond

1190
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,520
 who studied a lot of Hawaiian sexual traditions and culture

1191
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,560
 and things about nudity as well.

1192
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,840
 So this is really weird.

1193
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,840
 - Nudity was not sexual, in almost all contexts.

1194
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,760
 You only started wearing your clothes

1195
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,400
 over your genitals when you hit puberty

1196
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,720
 and that was out of respect for your genitals.

1197
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,960
 (laughing)

1198
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,520
 It's amazing.

1199
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,040
 But nudity for adults was symbolic of death

1200
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,880
 or punishment or lamentation.

1201
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,160
 And if you were seen nude outside a ritual context,

1202
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,120
 it was widely assumed that you had gone mad with grief.

1203
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,960
 - Yes.

1204
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,640
 - So it's not a sexy.

1205
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,720
 - It's really not.

1206
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,200
 - Nude speeches, three sad places in Hawaii.

1207
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,960
 - It could also be used as an appeal for forgiveness

1208
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
 this paper said.

1209
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,360
 So if someone's done you are wrong,

1210
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,800
 then the way you ask for their forgiveness

1211
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,160
 is by taking all your clothes off

1212
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,960
 and following them around until they forgive you.

1213
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,000
 - Turn up outside their house at three in the morning.

1214
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
 (laughing)

1215
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
 - Please forgive me.

1216
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,520
 Please take me back.

1217
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,600
 - I've done that actually.

1218
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,080
 (laughing)

1219
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,040
 - It's normally just my Hawaiian heritage.

1220
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,440
 (laughing)

1221
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,640
 - Is it, do we know if this is no longer being done?

1222
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,720
 Was this for traditional old indigenous?

1223
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,480
 - So what happened was when the Europeans came to Hawaii,

1224
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,000
 they saw all this stuff happening,

1225
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
 but then they soon cut it all out

1226
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,840
 because it wasn't very Christian.

1227
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,880
 - So there was a lot of taking over Hawaiian culture

1228
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,960
 and enforcing Western.

1229
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,560
 And then Hawaiian indigenous people have tried to take

1230
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,840
 a lot of it back, but I think it's obviously quite difficult

1231
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,720
 'cause it was lost for about 50 years.

1232
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,040
 - They said there was a basically where they go,

1233
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,880
 the penis chant, do we want that back here?

1234
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,240
 - I'm good I think.

1235
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,200
 - So like for instance, Hula dancing is probably

1236
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,000
 one of the most famous things in Hawaii

1237
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,680
 and Captain Cook said it was perfectly easy and graceful.

1238
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,200
 He thought it was amazing,

1239
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,120
 but when the missionaries arrived, it was officially suppressed.

1240
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,680
 - Have you heard of penis blowing?

1241
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,520
 - Yes.

1242
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,360
 (laughing)

1243
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,200
 - No, I don't think you have.

1244
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,160
 - I've seen that tummy leap in the eye.

1245
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,840
 (laughing)

1246
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,160
 - It's a signal to men in black.

1247
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,000
 - Okay.

1248
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,520
 (laughing)

1249
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,600
 - This is odd.

1250
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,040
 This was a daily ritual for Hawaiian infant,

1251
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,880
 which is where the members of the family would blow

1252
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,680
 on the penis, just with a stream of air,

1253
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,240
 just, and it was to prepare the foreskin

1254
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,600
 for a kind of micro-circumcidian ceremony,

1255
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,200
 and it would normally be an art or a grandmother

1256
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,520
 who did the blowing.

1257
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,840
 But lots of relatives were qualified to be the blower

1258
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,480
 if you didn't have any art, so that's fine.

1259
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,760
 - Wait, so what were they blowing onto it?

1260
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,800
 - Sort of Mike, or sort of a story of it?

1261
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,840
 - No, they just blow to protect it in their mythology.

1262
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,680
 - Yeah, okay.

1263
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,120
 - And this is a really common thing,

1264
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,320
 and there were lots of people even well into the 1980s,

1265
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,000
 for example, who had this done to them in their childhood.

1266
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,560
 - Yeah, in fact, there was a story, wasn't there,

1267
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,040
 about a man who was totally non-sexual, we should say.

1268
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,200
 - Yeah, completely.

1269
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,080
 There was a story about a man who was annoyed

1270
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,880
 because he'd married a Hawaiian woman,

1271
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,840
 and he left her mom to babysit their child,

1272
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,920
 and came back and found her doing this.

1273
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,240
 It was like, why are you blowing on my child's penis?

1274
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,040
 And apparently the mother-in-law was like,

1275
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,120
 well, I have to, otherwise it's very bad luck,

1276
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,320
 and was really worried about the baby's health if she didn't.

1277
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,560
 But it does, it seemed weird, actually,

1278
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,960
 if you haven't explained that before.

1279
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
 - Yes, yeah.

1280
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,560
 I like it's another gust of wind,

1281
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,240
 in fact, going into the,

1282
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
 (laughing)

1283
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,600
 'cause maybe it does have it.

1284
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
 Interestingly, you can tell the economic activity

1285
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,360
 of the Reven Empire from discarded foreskins

1286
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
 of Hawaiian children.

1287
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,880
 - Oh my God.

1288
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,120
 This, the author of this paper is called Milton Diamond,

1289
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,520
 as you mentioned before, and the only thing

1290
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,680
 that I could find of an interest outside

1291
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,440
 of him writing this paper.

1292
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,200
 So he wrote a lot about sex and gender, and so on.

1293
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,880
 He had a big feud with a man called Money,

1294
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,640
 so Diamond and Money had a big feud,

1295
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,880
 and they famously got into a punch-up

1296
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,720
 at a conference in Dubrovnik.

1297
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,200
 So Money had written a book called,

1298
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,240
 as nature made him the boy raised as a girl,

1299
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,440
 and mentions it in this book, this fight.

1300
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,640
 And there was a lot of chat about transgender at the time,

1301
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,200
 and so that's where they fell foul

1302
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,000
 of what they thought definitions were.

1303
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,640
 And yeah, there was a fight,

1304
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,640
 although Diamond claims he doesn't recall being punched.

1305
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,480
 But yeah, there's the only sort of thing.

1306
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,840
 - The thing is, with Diamond, he is really hard, isn't he?

1307
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,920
 (laughing)

1308
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,560
 - I have some stuff on chance.

1309
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,880
 - Right?

1310
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,560
 - So this, I just thought this was really interesting.

1311
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,600
 I'd never heard of it before,

1312
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,640
 but have you guys heard fruit singing?

1313
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,400
 - Oh, like Mongolian stuff, yeah.

1314
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
 - Yeah, so I didn't know that--

1315
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,240
 - Actually, I'm sorry.

1316
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,960
 - It sounded like that, but it's okay.

1317
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,800
 (laughing)

1318
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
 - It actually does sound a bit like that,

1319
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,600
 but I didn't realize that they're creating multiple notes.

1320
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,840
 - Yeah, they do harmonies, don't they?

1321
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,680
 - Yeah, with one throat.

1322
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,960
 So yeah, this is like Mongolians and some Inuits,

1323
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,400
 and it's called a two-tooth and overtone technique

1324
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,640
 when it's done in Mongolia,

1325
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,520
 and they can get up to six simultaneous notes

1326
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,400
 to come out of their mouth by doing this special fruit singing

1327
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,240
 technique, which I did not have time to look properly

1328
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,440
 into how exactly it works.

1329
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,960
 So all I can tell you is, it involves opening and closing

1330
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,400
 the vocal chords until harmonic resonances appear,

1331
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,200
 and I think if you go faster and faster,

1332
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,400
 different resonances come, and you make different noises,

1333
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,280
 but it's really cool.

1334
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,880
 And then there's this one other really cool way

1335
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,760
 of fruit singing, which is, this is an Inuit culture,

1336
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,760
 it's called the Katajak, and two women stand face to face,

1337
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,880
 but super close, so the lips almost touching each other,

1338
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,680
 and it's like a duel, a singing duel,

1339
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,360
 and so it goes really, really fast.

1340
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,000
 One woman says one note or throat noise,

1341
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,560
 and then the other one has to respond to it,

1342
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,840
 and it goes faster and faster,

1343
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,600
 and they use each other's mouths as kind of resonators,

1344
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,200
 basically, and it only ends when one of them

1345
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
 like collapses, laughing, or runs out of breath,

1346
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,960
 and they can go on for hours, and it looks so cool.

1347
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,200
 - It's like tooling banjos. - Yeah.

1348
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,280
 - But what you were saying is, so you got two people,

1349
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,840
 the mouths open, and I'm making good noise

1350
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,280
 into the other person's mouth, and because they've got a mouth,

1351
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,160
 there it's resonating the... - Exactly, and it makes a sound,

1352
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,200
 - but they're resonating in your mouth at the same time.

1353
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,200
 - Well straight after you, yeah, exactly. - Oh, right after you, right.

1354
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,560
 - So they're using your mouth as a musical instrument.

1355
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,440
 - That is so great. - That's weird.

1356
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,160
 - I know, it's fun, isn't it?

1357
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,320
 - Have you heard any? - Yeah.

1358
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,920
 - Wow. - It sounds cool.

1359
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,160
 - That sounds weird. - Yeah.

1360
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,600
 - It's not singing the normal stuff.

1361
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,840
 The Mongolian stuff sounds a bit like, did you reduce, doesn't it?

1362
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,160
 - It does, yes. - Yeah.

1363
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,000
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1364
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,120
 - Who else? - Who else has got it?

1365
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,280
 (laughing)

1366
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,600
 - Six, no, six. - It's not doing that in my mouth, darling.

1367
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,280
 (laughing)

1368
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,400
 - Can I quickly mention, because naming of genitals

1369
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,560
 is a practice that still does go on.

1370
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,200
 There was a server that was done in 2015,

1371
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,720
 and it got reported in many places,

1372
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,280
 'cause it was a genuine survey,

1373
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,000
 and they found that 73% of men have given their penis a nickname.

1374
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,600
 - Is that right? - Yeah.

1375
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,480
 59% say that it was a woman who came up with their nickname

1376
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,040
 for them. - Oh.

1377
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,320
 - So the survey was commissioned by a men's retailer

1378
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,760
 called Jackamo, so this is a survey done through them.

1379
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,360
 So, okay, let's, a few nicknames.

1380
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,160
 - I can't think of anything that's not rude, Terry.

1381
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,440
 - So the top five. - Give us, what letter does it begin with?

1382
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,000
 - T for a... - I was a Terry.

1383
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,360
 (laughing)

1384
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,120
 - Is it one word? - It is one word.

1385
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,760
 - I think... - Terminator.

1386
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,640
 - I think sort of... - Terminator.

1387
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,160
 - Think what? - Gods.

1388
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,800
 - For? - No.

1389
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,320
 - No, 'cause that's just someone with a lisp.

1390
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,080
 - Sorry, I also have an aerial disease.

1391
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,680
 - I was trying not to. - My fetus is thought.

1392
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,280
 (laughing)

1393
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,280
 - Sorry, this isn't a god.

1394
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,720
 I was trying to put us in the ancient Greeks.

1395
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,880
 - All right, so what do you say that's a god?

1396
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,600
 - Oh, feces. - No, Troy.

1397
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,000
 So... - Troy?

1398
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,200
 - Yeah, yeah, weird.

1399
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,560
 - Doctor Doolittle, is that one?

1400
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,800
 - No, it's not. - That's shame.

1401
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,960
 - Russell the muscle is.

1402
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,760
 - Russell the muscle. - Yeah.

1403
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,320
 - It's not a muscle.

1404
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,400
 It's an organ.

1405
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,960
 - Oggons can have muscles in them.

1406
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,160
 Your heart's an organ, it's loads of muscle.

1407
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,480
 - Good point. - But there isn't a muscle in the penis.

1408
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
 - No, sir.

1409
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,640
 - Well, I'd be working out.

1410
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,400
 (laughing)

1411
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,000
 - I've also been kicked out of the chair yet.

1412
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,760
 (laughing)

1413
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,920
 - Okay, that's it.

1414
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,040
 That is all of our facts.

1415
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,520
 Thank you so much for listening.

1416
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,280
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1417
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,640
 about the things that we have said

1418
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,080
 over the course of this podcast,

1419
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,840
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1420
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,840
 I'm on @tribaland, and my penis is on it.

1421
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,200
 (laughing)

1422
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,640
 - The table right now, damn.

1423
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,960
 (laughing)

1424
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,960
 - He stopped blowing on it.

1425
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,760
 (laughing)

1426
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,760
 - Andy?

1427
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,000
 - At Andrew Hunter M.

1428
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,840
 - James.

1429
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,680
 - At James Harkin.

1430
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,600

00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,680
 - You can email podcast@QI.com.

1432
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,240
 - Yep, or you can go to our group account,

1433
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,240
 which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to our Facebook page.

1434
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,840
 No such thing as a fish, or go to our website.

1435
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,480
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1436
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,280
 As I said, last week we've redone it.

1437
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,720
 It looks really awesome.

1438
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,880
 It has everything up there from ticket links

1439
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,160
 to all of our previous episodes

1440
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,040
 to our new book that's coming out.

1441
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,960
 You can also get a behind-the-scenes documentary

1442
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,840
 that we made called Behind the Gills.

1443
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,360
 That's up there, link to that.

1444
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,560
 So go there, find everything.

1445
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,160
 And if you wanna hear us again,

1446
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,840
 we'll be back again next week.

1447
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,800
 We'll see you then.

1448
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,640
 Goodbye.

1449
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,220
 (upbeat music)

1450
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,800
 (upbeat music)

1451
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,040
 (upbeat music)
