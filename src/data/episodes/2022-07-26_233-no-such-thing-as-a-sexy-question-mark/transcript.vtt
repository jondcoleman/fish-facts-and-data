00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 (man singing in foreign language)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.840
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.560
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.240
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.840
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080
 James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.360
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.000
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.320
 - Okay, my fact this week is that on their birthday,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.520
 every beef eater at the Tower of London

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.240
 gets a gift of a free bottle of beef eater gin.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.120
 - On their birthday singular, so do they all do they all?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.920
 - They only hire people born on the 25th of September.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.200
 - They're like race horses.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.360
 They all get their new age on the 1st of January.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.120
 No, it's every beef eater on that particular person's birthday.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.520
 They get one bottle of gin.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.400
 And the beef eater gin brand

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.640
 is nothing to do with the beef eaters.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.200
 But I went to the Tower of London this week,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.640
 and I spoke to my friend Andy the beef eater.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.320
 And he said that basically the beef eater gin brand

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.400
 they've got so much out of the beef eaters over the years,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.040
 it's the least they can do to get them

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.720
 a bottle of gin every year.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.560
 - Sorry, sweet.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.480
 So did you go to the beef eater pub?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.920
 - I went to the, it's called the Keys,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.120
 and it's the pub inside the Tower of London.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.960
 Yes, it had got there.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.800
 - That's very cool.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.640
 - That's cool.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.480
 Yeah, I was reading about it.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.440
 - A lot of pubs in the Tower of London.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.000
 This is the last remaining one.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.960
 - There's just one left, which means if you fall out

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.200
 with any other beef eaters, if you have beef with them,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 you have to go to the same pub all the time.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 - That's terrible.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.960
 - But there's a sick calm.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 - Sure, I would watch it.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.440
 In fact, there's a soap opera set in the Tower of London pub.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.080
 - You're right, you're right.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.560
 - Because they get up to quite bad behavior sometimes,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.800
 and they have done traditionally.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.760
 So I always thought of beef eaters as these sort of like,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.320
 eminent bastions of British stateliness,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.520
 in other words, like that.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.680
 - But actually, they were historically

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.440
 used to kind of be drunkards, I think,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.840
 in the 18th century.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.560
 They were known for creating havoc

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.480
 and for illegally subletting their rooms out to other people.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.760
 They would just randomly sell on the post of beef eater

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.040
 to make a bit of extra cash whenever they wanted.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.440
 Yeah, they were known as scoundrels.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.000
 - You could only do that once.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 Like once you sold it, it would belong to the other person

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.040
 and then they might sell it on afterwards.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.800
 - Yeah, unless you stole it back from them in the night.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.840
 - Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how it worked.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.720
 I think you basically got money off them

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 and then they had the ceremony.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 And the ceremony to become a beef eater,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.920
 you get a little kind of cup, a little pewter cup,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.720
 and you drink some part and you do a toast,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.040
 and then you're a beef eater, basically.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.880
 - Yeah.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.840
 Imagine if we could just sell our jobs to other people.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.880
 You can if you want.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.200
 - I mean, well, I'm in talks with a few guys in my case.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.920
 Alex Bell is pretty interesting.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.440
 - In the toast, it's a reference to that, isn't it?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 'Cause they do the toast with a poor,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.320
 and then I think the thing they say

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.440
 when they're toasting a new beef eater is,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.520
 is it may you never die a yeoman order?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.160
 So they're officially called yeoman orders.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.120
 And that's because the idea was,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.360
 if you made the mistake of dying in an office,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.520
 then you've been an idiot

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.800
 'cause you hadn't sold it on in time

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.840
 and made that extra cash.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.680
 - Yes, exactly.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.440
 It's like dying after, or not selling a house

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.920
 in the years before you die.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.240
 And to go just on a rampage with the money.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240
 - Is that what you're gonna do?

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.160
 Considering you do have a son.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.760
 - Yeah, good point.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.920
 and they were really unpopular in loads of ways.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.600
 So as well as selling their jobs,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.680
 a writer historically said,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.160
 they have gradually assumed to themselves

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.200
 the more lucrative occupation of stopping everybody

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.800
 who wishes to visit these objects

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.240
 of our national pride and glory

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.680
 and forcing themselves upon them as their guides.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.000
 So the guards would just say,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.560
 hey, do you wanna guide a tour and pest you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.200
 until you gave in against the money?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.360
 - That's right, yeah.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.760
 - So Andy the beef eater gave us a guided tour this week.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.760
 And I gotta say, if you do go to the Tower of London,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.320
 do get a tour from their beef eater's,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.240
 'cause they are amazing.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.720
 And they know all sorts of stuff.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.240
 But you were duped into paying for a meal on your shirt.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.680
 It's a very easy job to eat.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.640
 (laughing)

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.840
 - I read this thing about the beef eater's that.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.160
 So I think London, anyone coming here,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.600
 there's a famous fact about the cabbies,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 the bike cab drivers having the knowledge.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.760
 It's one of those things.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.480
 They have to memorize every single road in London.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.760
 And that's a test they take.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.040
 There's a similar thing that happens with the beef eater's.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.080
 They have to memorize what's known as the story.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 And it's 900 years of the Tower of London's history.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.920
 They need to know it word by word

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.120
 within six months of passing their probation

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.360
 after being sworn in.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.680
 - Yeah, but you now get these Uber beef eater's stuff

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.720
 who come in and they just read the story

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.560
 if they can not.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.840
 - I don't think we know why they're called beef eater's, do we?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.280
 There are lots of theories.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.080
 The story we were told on the tour was that

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.920
 it was because they were paid in beef,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.480
 which they know definitely is true or paid in meat,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.040
 which they know definitely was true.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.480
 And that the people outside kind of thought,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.640
 I'll look at these guys eating all that meat.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.680
 And so it was like an insult kind of thing.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.760
 - It makes sense.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.440
 I mean, and they're part of the royal household.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.960
 They eat lots of meat, they eat lots of beef.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.040
 - I've seen other people poo pooing like crazy that story.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040
 - That's just, all right.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.480
 - But it just makes so much sense.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.560
 It seems to be like one of those things

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.400
 that you can't really poo poo.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.920
 It's like, yeah, they eat lots of beef

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.040
 and they're called beef eater's.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.600
 - Do you have a better theory of red?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.160
 - I've read two or three.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.440
 There's one which is sort of it's from the French boufete,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.360
 which is a different word meaning something else.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.240
 - Yeah, that's clearly nonsense, isn't it?

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.240
 - What? Why?

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.080
 - Because that is such a convoluted way

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.200
 to get to the word beef eater

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.520
 rather than just they ate loads of beef.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.680
 - I think eating beef is--

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.520
 - And we're paid in it.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.600
 - There's probably something--

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.720
 - Who gets paid in the beef?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.880
 - But we know they were paid in it.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.720
 - They know that they were, yeah.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.040
 We know they were given a stipend of beef,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.080
 which most people were able to eat at the time.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.480
 - Oh, we know the people took the place out

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.400
 of the royal household for having,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.320
 'cause they ate so much beef around that time.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.080
 - I think Andy's right, there's so many holes in this.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.920
 - Just can't see.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.760
 - I just don't believe it.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.600
 - I don't believe it.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.240
 - But it could be that it came from something else

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.880
 and then it was helped by the fact they ate lots of beef.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.720
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.960
 It could have come from Buffetay.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.080
 And then I'm not buying it.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.920
 - So what is Buffetay?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.680
 - But there are beef eaters today.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.720
 The Ravens eat raw beef.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.680
 - They get fed raw beef from Smithville, Marble.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.000
 - The beef eaters probably eat beef.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.120
 (all laughing)

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.320
 - Wait, are you gonna explain

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.240
 your definitely more plausible, weird, French origin

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.760
 convoluted on?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.320
 - I did read this and I thought,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.160
 well, that's clearly bollocks for the fun.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.000
 - So the thing is that the beef eaters began,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.040
 they're called the Yomangard of the King of Queen, right?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.360
 Well, they're called the Yomang Waters,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.760
 which is part of a larger group called the Yomangard.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.400
 And they're kind of the bodyguard of the King of Queen.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.400
 But it started in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.480
 when Henry VII won the crown

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.120
 and all these guys who'd helped him,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.720
 who were from this Northern Regiment,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.480
 he brought them in and they became his bodyguard.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.600
 But Henry VII will have been an English-speaking king.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.040
 So if it was further back in Norman times,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.880
 you can kind of see where the French thing might have come from.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.880
 - Yeah. - That's a good point.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.360
 - Whereas Henry VII's actually hailed from Wales.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.200
 - Did he?

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.280
 - Yeah, the tutors were all Welsh family.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.440
 - Is there any Welsh word

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.600
 that sounds a bit like B-feeters?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.440
 - Tafferter?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.040
 (all laughing)

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.000
 - It could have come from B-feeters.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.880
 Like B, what's the B-feet?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.120
 - You know a feat, like you accomplish a feat.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.640
 - With a B. - Yeah, with a B.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.480
 - B-racing or something.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.760
 - Exactly, so maybe they were famous for their B-racing

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.440
 back in the day and they got known as the B-feeters.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.280
 - That's good.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.720
 - Maybe the Bs were the original Ravens, you think,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.000
 but they trained.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 - Well, maybe there was originally another group

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.520
 called the A-feeters who did lots of things.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.360
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.560
 - And then they kind of died out

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.280
 and then the B-feeters came in.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.120
 - Bingo.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.320
 - The less good featers we could never got into the '18.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.160
 - Maybe.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.680
 - I'm just saying, there's a lot of explanations.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.920
 - You're right.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.920
 Did you see, when you were in the pub, James,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.760
 I wonder if there's apparently a framed photo of Rudolf Hess.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.760
 - I took a photo of it.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.600
 - Did you?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.160
 - Yeah, of his signature as well.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.000
 - Wow.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.520
 - He sort of signed, they asked him for a pin-up photo, basically,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.680
 because he was a senior Nazi who was imprisoned there

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.040
 briefly in 1941.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.520
 - I think he defected.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.560
 - Everyone else was taking photos of all the pictures

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.200
 of B-feeters and stuff, but I clung to the signature

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.440
 of Rudolf Hess and I got to get a photo of that.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.320
 - Well, you've got a large collection of Nazi signatures.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.480
 Instantly, you recognise that.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.960
 - I see that covenant behind the fake bookshelf in your house, right?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.360
 (laughing)

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360
 - Okay, that makes sense.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.600
 He did he defect, because it sounds like when he was there,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.960
 a lot of people collected his signature and that feels odd.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.760
 - I think he flew over with his family to Scotland, by and all of a sudden.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.120
 Yeah, I think he came out, I think, typically,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.760
 there weren't many Nazis arrested during the war in the German side.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.960
 - But he was prison, I wasn't he.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960
 - He was prisoned, yeah.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.800
 - He was prisoned.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.960
 - He wasn't just drinking at the pub.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.720
 - Yeah, if you'd effect, they'd have to say,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.120
 "Oh, great, well, welcome to Britain, here's your home."

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.360
 - Yeah, no, he was in jail.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.200
 - And they were under.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.040
 - And then they sort of asked you a few questions.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.320
 - Are you sure you're Rudolf Hess, that kind of thing?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.400
 - But then he did get tried after the war,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.400
 didn't he and committed suicide in prison Hess?

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.960
 - I'm not saying it's a happy ending to the story.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.800
 - Right.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.640
 (laughing)

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.280
 - But also, let's not waste too much sympathy on the guy.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.120
 (laughing)

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.160
 - So if you've got the Rudolf Hess,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.720
 everyone else is doing B-feeters.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.560
 - Did you see the framed photo of Bruce Willis?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.720
 - I didn't see that.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.560
 - Did you not?

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.760
 - I saw a framed picture of the Duke of Edinburgh.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.880
 - Okay.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.200
 - I didn't see Bruce Willis.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.440
 - Well, it says, amongst the things that you'll find there,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.920
 there's a ceremonial ax, which is in the corner,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.680
 so that photos of guests like Bruce Willis and Tom Clancy,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.360
 the-- - I don't know what Tom Clancy looks like.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.600
 - No one does, so that could be--

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.000
 - Does he look like a Duke of Edinburgh?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.360
 (laughing)

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.840
 - That's true, and you've got Facebook, though, so actually--

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.760
 - I would recognize Bruce Willis, perhaps.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.600
 - Right.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.120
 - If I was stuck next to someone who said,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.880
 "That's Bruce Willis, yeah."

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.720
 (laughing)

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.320
 No, I didn't see that, but I wouldn't,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.680
 you know, there's lots of pictures there.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.520
 - Yeah.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.880
 - Do they have pictures of their final prisoners?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.240
 'Cause they should do, and actually I didn't read that they did,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.480
 but their last prisoners were the Cray brothers, weren't they?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.000
 - Oh, were they the very last prisoners?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.840
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.880
 - I think this is so odd, there's such a weird coincidence.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.160
 - Well, it's because of their national service, right?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.960
 - Yes, no, I know, but it's odd that it's them.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.800
 - Yeah.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.640
 - They were famous, right?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.480
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.440
 So this was in 1952 before they were famous,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.480
 and they had just--

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
 - Where are they now?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.440
 (laughing)

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.000
 - And they'd failed to report for national service,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.080
 and they'd been on the run for ages,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.920
 and then they'd been caught by a policeman

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.680
 who was like, "You didn't report for national service,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.840
 "and I think they punched him."

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.640
 - Yeah, but I think their regimen--

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.840
 - Was based at the Tower of London.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.680
 - Was based at the Tower of London.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.680
 - Yeah, which is bizarre.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.600
 - And Cray brothers, for any overseas listeners,

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.560
 they're the very famous mob London gangsters.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.560
 They are Godfather's, basically.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.000
 - Made by Tom Hardy and Tom Hardy in that movie.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.600
 - That's right, yes.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.440
 - Yeah.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.280
 Here's a tenuous link.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.520
 You mentioned the Duke of Edinburgh just there.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.360
 - I did.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.760
 - So the Duke of Wellington--

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.600
 - Okay.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.440
 - I completely different to you.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440
 (laughing)

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.480
 So the famous Duke of Wellington,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.960
 the one who won the Battle of Waterloo,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.200
 he was the Constable of the Tower for 26 years

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.680
 after the Battle of Waterloo,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.680
 and he completely changed it.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.800
 So he did this huge reform program.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.560
 He stopped people selling their jobs as beef eaters,

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.280
 and he drained the moat,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.320
 'cause lots of people were getting cholera, basically,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.640
 'cause it was so stagnant.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.240
 And he also closed the Royal Menagerie,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.200
 which used to be based at the Tower of London.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.040
 - Yeah.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.880
 - And it closed it,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.280
 because people kept being killed by the animals.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.120
 - Oh really?

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.960
 - Really?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.200
 - Used to just be allowed into the monkey room.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.200
 There were no barriers.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.800
 - But the monkeys would eat you.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.640
 - But they?

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640
 - Well, they might--

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.480
 - They might nibble on you.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.320
 - Well, that's kind of it.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.360
 And account, the account was that a monkey,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.240
 Toriboy's leg quotes in a dangerous manner.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.920
 - Wow.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.080
 - Yeah.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.800
 An assistant keeper accidentally let a lion

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.160
 and two tigers into the same room,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.720
 and they started killing each other,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.000
 the wolves escaped and they ate a terrier.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.920
 Lots of just constant accidents happening,

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.200
 'cause there were these wild animals there.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.040
 - Wow.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.160
 - And so when that guy came in,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.400
 that's basically when they count the beef eaters from,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.200
 really, beef eater number one was that guy,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.000
 and then beef eater number two was his mate,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.880
 and then so on and so on.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.400
 They don't really have records for the previous ones,

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.080
 because they were so often sold between people.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.440
 But from that guy to the present day,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.800
 there have been about 400 beef eaters,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.280
 and that is fewer than people who have been in space.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.120
 - Wow.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.960
 - Wow.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.080
 - Have any beef eaters been in space?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.200
 - Not to my knowledge.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.000
 (laughing)

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.840
 So the guy who was the constable,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.600
 he, historically, was allowed to keep all livestock

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.920
 that fell from Tower Bridge into the river.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.320
 So anything that fell from the bridge into the river,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320
 he was allowed to keep it.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.160
 - Again, that sitcom is gonna be a great episode

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.640
 where the constable is trying to push livestock off.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.520
 (laughing)

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.560
 - And for every foot of livestock

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.200
 that stumbled into the Tower Moat,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.200
 he received one penny.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.720
 - Quite a lot to retrieve a cow from a moat,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720
 I would have thought.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.000
 I think you've earned it if you do that.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.560
 - Wait, so if a donkey puts one foot into the moat,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.560
 you get one penny.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.120
 - One foot in the moat, it could be the neighborhood

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.960
 of the sitcom.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.480
 (laughing)

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.080
 - I believe that's right, yeah.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.520
 - You mentioned Ravens before,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.600
 the idea that they would be fed beef from,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.760
 and what was it, an East London--

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.600
 - Smithfield Market.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.440
 - Smithfield Market.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.560
 - The Tower of London, one of the employees there,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.560
 and I'm not sure if he counts technically

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.560
 as a yeoman wardo, but he's the Raven Master.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.480
 - Yes, he is a beef eater.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.120
 - So yeah, so they hire this guy who,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.080
 his whole family lives there, they have a house,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.160
 and he just has to look after these Ravens

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.920
 because of an enduring myth

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.320
 that if the Ravens left the Tower of London,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.560
 England would fall.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.160
 That's basically a ceremonial role just to fulfill

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.520
 this little men.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.280
 And I've met him, he's a really cool guy.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.400
 I've done it and stand up with him.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.680
 - We did stand up with him.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.560
 - Yeah, Chris, he was really cool.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.480
 - He must have a lot of very relatable stories.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.480
 (laughing)

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.520
 - Did he bring his Ravens?

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.520
 'Cause Ravens are very good at talking.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.360
 - Are they?

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.480
 - Yeah, COVIDs are famously the best birds

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.400
 at kind of being able to form almost human sounding like words,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.960
 and they're extremely clever.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.800
 - Oh.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.360
 - And so he's trained them up to do some quite cool stuff.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.200
 - I thought he was getting bigger laughs than I was.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.360
 - Random table four.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.440
 - Yes, that's great!

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.280
 (laughing)

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.800
 - Then that's my bed!

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.360
 (laughing)

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.400
 - That was a genuine problem, wasn't it?

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.640
 When the Royal Astronomer was stationed

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.000
 at the Tower of London while they were waiting

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.360
 for the Greenwich Observatory to be built.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.200
 And this was John Flamste, the first Royal Astronomer.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.960
 And while the Observatory was being built,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.240
 he was trying to do his astronomy at the Tower of London

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.880
 and the Ravens kept pooing on the telescope.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.760
 And so he said, "Can you please remove all the Ravens?"

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.000
 And King Charles was going to,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.400
 I think it was Charles II was going to,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.200
 and then said, "Oh no, I've heard that the crown will fall."

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.080
 - But for him, it will have been quite close

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.880
 to the last time the crown fell, right?

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.200
 Charles II.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.560
 - Yeah, I suppose it was.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.880
 - So he's just come back, he's just restored the crown.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.640
 I can understand why he's worried.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.480
 - But he's worried. - That he's worried.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.320
 - You're right.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.160
 It's totally understandable.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.880
 - Like these days, I think no one seriously expects

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.720
 if the Ravens go, and he's looking to be like he does.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.400
 - Well, this guy would be out of a house and a job.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.560
 Chris, if they can.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.320
 - Well, they do just be able to stand up

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.760
 for a career to fall back.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.000
 I should add, it was a night of historical talks.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.280
 He happened to be very funny,

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.080
 and it was mainly stand-ups doing it.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.480
 His talk was on Jack the Ripper.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.760
 So it was a bit dark, actually.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.640
 - Jack do all the Ripper more like.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.480
 - Yeah.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.760
 - He's in that sweat and crows.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.480
 (laughing)

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.060
 (upbeat music)

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:17.280
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.240
 My fact is that the economic activity of the Roman Empire

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.240
 can be measured by studying thousand-year-old ice

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.920
 in Greenland.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.760
 - Wow.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.600
 - Wow.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.440
 - That's amazing.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.280
 - Amazing.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.120
 - It's so cool.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.840
 Okay, so it takes a tiny bit of explaining.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.840
 So a group of scientists have released a new study,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.000
 which is all about measuring the Greenland ice sheet.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.600
 There's a miles thick ice sheet covering

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.880
 a huge amount of Greenland.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.640
 And we know when ice forms, because we know how much snow falls

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.560
 and it packs down and it becomes ice,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.120
 and it gradually gets deeper and deeper.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.840
 So the scientists have been studying the period

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.840
 between 1,100 BC, 3,000 years ago, and 800 AD.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.800
 And they've been measuring the chemicals in there.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.640
 And one thing we know from that time in history

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.800
 is that Rome was making lots of coins,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.440
 and the production of the coins, the coins were silver,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.640
 that they produced a lot of lead pollution,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.920
 'cause they were using all which contained lead.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.320
 That lead wafted all the way across the world.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.760
 It ended up in Greenland.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.200
 It gets rained down, packed into the ice.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.680
 And since 1999, scientists have been measuring

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.680
 the lead level, corresponding with exact years in history,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.840
 and they can produce documents now showing that, for example,

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.520
 when Rome devalued its currency in 64 AD,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.200
 there was less silver in each coin,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.280
 so there would have been less lead produced,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.720
 so there's less lead in the ice.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.560
 - Yeah.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.840
 - It's extraordinary. - It's nuts.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.680
 - It's really good.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.720
 It doesn't help people in ancient Rome

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.520
 who want to know whether to invest in things.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.360
 - No, it doesn't.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.200
 - Sadly.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.040
 (laughing)

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.520
 - But yeah, they follow, I think they've debunked

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.440
 and thought that when the Roman Republic fell,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.560
 the economy was booming, and they've actually worked out

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.720
 that when it came to the fall of the Republic,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.320
 the lead amounts in the ice actually show

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.280
 that it was undergoing a bit of a recession.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.560
 And stuff like when Rome took Carthage,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.080
 they got all the Carthaginian mines,

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.320
 so suddenly they were mining a hell of a lot more silver,

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.080
 and you can see that exact year

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.960
 of the Carthaginian invasion from looking at the ice.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.000
 - How far away is a distance that we're talking here

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.080
 from the mines to the ice?

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:17.920
 - It's thousands of miles.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.760
 - Thousands of miles.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.440
 It just shows you how strong wind is, doesn't it?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.640
 - That's my main takeaway.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.200
 - Well, I just, if you think about it, no.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.400
 - I tell you what's weird.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.400
 The prevailing wind in the world

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.800
 goes from Greenland to the east because of the jet stream.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.040
 So how is it going?

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.360
 It must be going all the way around the world.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.200
 - All the way around the world.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.480
 - I don't know about that, by the way.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.320
 - Wow.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.760
 - It makes sense, right?

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.960
 - But it's like, you know how as well,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.080
 how there are sheep in whales

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.320
 that have been affected by the Chernobyl radiation.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.920
 Like that's carried through the wind.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.760
 - That is the lake district.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.640
 - And the lake district is just winders, you know.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.560
 - And that got there even faster than this 2000 years.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.240
 - Wait a minute though, Chernobyl also to the east

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.960
 of the lake districts and whales,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.320
 but that didn't go all the way around the world.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.600
 So maybe my jet stream theory.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.240
 - It feels like wind might be more complicated

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.640
 than just the one big gust going around the world.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.480
 - Thank you so much.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.080
 - It might be a couple of different directions.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.720
 - I think this is very powerful flat earth evidence.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.560
 - Yes.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.040
 - I'll probably be shouting down in the comments about this.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.720
 - One explanation for it going the wrong way

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.480
 is as one person pointed out,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.160
 this is the hypothesis at the moment,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.640
 but for instance, it ignores the fact

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.000
 that China existed and was doing quite well

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 around that time.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.960
 - I think Western scientists and historians

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.080
 always have a tendency to do.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.920
 And it could well be that China was just producing

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.600
 massive amounts of silver or lead or whatever

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.920
 that was influencing it.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.200
 - But we don't know, but it could be that

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.000
 something was coming from the east to affect it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.960
 - But it does seem to fit in with these things in Rome.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.800
 - Yeah.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.240
 - So for instance, there was a plague,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.040
 the Antonin plague, which they think,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.080
 they're not sure what caused it,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.240
 but lots of people died.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.200
 It might have been smallpox.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.400
 It might even have been Ebola.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.760
 And this was in between 250 and 262,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.640
 when 5,000 people a day were said to be dying.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.480
 And the amount of lead being produced then

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.840
 obviously went down because people

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.080
 had more pressing things on their minds.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.560
 But they assumed 250 AD, who was it?

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.480
 Christians.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.320
 Assumed it was to do the Christians.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.880
 And so they basically sought out as many scapegoats

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.960
 as they could and they kind of executed

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.560
 a load of clergy and stuff like that.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.400
 - Wow.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.920
 - Did it work?

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.000
 - Did it work?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.600
 - Well, we no longer have Christianity.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.240
 (laughing)

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.360
 - On that, a lot of people think

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.160
 because it was so persecuted during this plague,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.240
 that kind of made Christianity a lot more solid

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.440
 as a religion.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.280
 And that's kind of one of the main things

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.640
 that made it such a worldwide religion in the end.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.480
 - Wow.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.960
 - There you go, bully someone and make them stronger.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.800
 - Yes.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.640
 No, don't bully someone.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.760
 No, don't bully someone.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.200
 But if you are being bullied, you'll come out of it stronger.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.040
 - Okay.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.880
 - Is that right?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.720
 - That's a healthier message here.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.640
 - So just quickly on this whole Greenland ice-led thing,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.440
 have you guys heard of Claire Patterson?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.160
 (laughing)

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.920
 Does she, is she the Venn diagram?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.760
 - She is.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.760
 - All those words.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.000
 (laughing)

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.840
 - She's a he actually.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.680
 He was a scientist.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.600
 - Ah, he was an amazing guy.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.720
 I wish we could do a whole podcast on him.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.760
 He was trying to find out how all the universe was

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.200
 in the 1950s.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.480
 Okay, so that involves calculating

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.680
 how fast uranium decays.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.520
 But he found massive lead contamination

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.720
 everywhere he went.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.560
 And it drove him mad.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.160
 There was all this lead showing up

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.120
 that shouldn't have been there.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.720
 He tried and tried and tried to build

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.480
 this incredibly lead-free lamp, basically.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.800
 He scrubbed everything.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.480
 He cleaned everything for years.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 He founded basically the first ever clean laboratory.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.040
 And he proved that lead in petrol was bad.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.040
 And that was, he-

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.880
 - Ah, I saw him.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.360
 - Yeah, he was the guy who demonstrated later in his career

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.000
 that modern Americans had 600 times as much lead

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 in their bodies as ancient Egyptians.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.840
 - Wow.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.680
 - All thanks to lead-ed petrol.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.800
 Yeah, and so as part of this research,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.480
 he went to remote spots in Greenland and Antarctica

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.720
 and measured the lead much further down.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.920
 So this is one of the stories of the last two millennia

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.600
 is massively increasing amounts of lead.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.080
 And that lead to all these efforts lead

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.600
 to all the efforts to cut lead out of petrol, for example.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.440
 - Really?

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.280
 - Yeah.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.880
 - Because the person who invented putting lead in petrol

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.120
 was Thomas Midgeley.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.520
 And that was a really good invention

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.240
 'cause it stopped knocking and engines.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.080
 - Right.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.360
 - But when it first happened, everyone thought,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.600
 this is an amazing, oh, just putting lead in there

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.120
 that solves this massive problem.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.800
 - Yeah, these to be all these little explosions

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.840
 and the car engine basically is when you put kerosene in.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.240
 - Okay, and that's knocking.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.080
 - And there's good knocking.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.800
 And they try hundreds of different experiments

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.120
 and chemicals to try and get rid of the knock.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.400
 And once it did, that was huge.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.880
 It made cars a real thing.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.560
 (laughing)

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.400
 - Wow.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.200
 This guy sounds awesome.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.040
 - Yeah, he does.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040
 - It was very bad for you.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.520
 We should say, lead is bad.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.360
 - Lead is bad.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.520
 - Well, isn't it true?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.360
 That the, a lot of people put the fall of the Roman Empire

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.360
 down to lead in the pipes.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.200
 - I pointed it out.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.200
 - The plumbing was that.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.360
 - Yeah, the plumbing was made of lead.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.640
 And so they were lead poisoned

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.160
 and that supposedly killed off a lot of the rich people.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.000
 - Don't know if that's true.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.360
 - Well, I've heard, so Roman miners,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.520
 they knew that lead was bad

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.920
 'cause they shielded themselves

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.080
 by covering their mouths with animal blood as incidentally.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.800
 So a lot of people knew that lead was bad for you,

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.120
 but they still kept the pipes being out of lead.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.480
 I think some people said, even at the time,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.400
 are we sure about this lead stuff?

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.240
 - Yeah, right.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.080
 - Everyone said no, no, no, it's fine.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.080
 - Would people at the time have died a sort of,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.440
 they would have just slowly got ill

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.600
 and it would have looked like,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.720
 oh, you've got a flu and then it,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.080
 or would it be instant lead lead?

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.080
 - Not sure what sentence of lead poisoning.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.080
 - Then you go a bit mad, didn't you?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.520
 - I just wonder how long it would take

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.520
 if someone, sinister, had re-plumbed.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.360
 - Rudolf Hess for instance.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.280
 - Rudolf Hess re-plumbed the city of London

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.600
 with lead piping.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.600
 (all laughing)

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.440
 - Wow.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.080
 Super bellied blood.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.360
 - It's a subtly trade.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.200
 - Sutterly.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.640
 - Every single one.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.240
 - How long must be better ways?

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.720
 - But how long before we would notice it?

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.720
 - Just the fat bugs alone in the ice.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.560
 - It can be done.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.520
 - A supervillain that rises to prominence

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.040
 in Thames water, right?

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.880
 - Yes.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.240
 - And slowly start saying all the replacement pipes

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.120
 have lead in them and then 40 years like,

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.920
 no, it's really weird.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.880
 Your body thinks that lead is calcium.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.880
 It mistakes the two, chemically.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.680
 And it absolutely shreds you on the inside.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.840
 It gets in the way of all your neurotransmitters

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.040
 and sends them crazy.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.560
 It weakens the blood brain barrier

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.920
 so you're more vulnerable to,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.800
 it has about 30 different horrible effects on your body.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.960
 - Well, so your body tries to do the same stuff with it

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.840
 as it does with calcium, like build your nails

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840
 and things like that.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.960
 - Yeah, do you have bones made of lead?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.560
 - I start drawing with our fingers.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.120
 (all laughing)

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.920
 - There's no lead in pencil stuff.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.080
 - Okay, I'm not sure.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.720
 I don't know.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.520
 I don't know the full details, anyway.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.960
 - It wouldn't be super efficient though.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.680
 You couldn't guarantee to wipe everyone out.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.320
 - What an infrastructure-based bond movie

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.400
 that would be over a period of several decades.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.360
 - I just wonder what point would someone know?

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.800
 Like, hang on, I think what London is suffering from

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.240
 is everyone's being poisoned by lead.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.240
 - I'm looking forward to this movie called "led finger."

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.000
 (all laughing)

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.040
 He does all this in London,

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.120
 but also can write things when it's bigger.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.880
 (all laughing)

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.880
 - I have a few things about great things found in ice.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.480
 So in Southern Yukon, they have had ice melting recently

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.040
 and there's a big patch that's melted

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.720
 and underneath it, they found all this caribou dung

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.960
 that's been sitting there held in the ice.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.520
 Now, what's interesting is there is no caribou

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.600
 that exists in Southern Yukon, but what it's done

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.600
 is it's confirmed one of the oldest oral history stories

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.960
 that have passed down from the First Nations people,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.640
 as it says in the article,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.080
 the First Nations people of the area

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.160
 who claimed that the land used to be roamed by caribou.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.520
 So they did these tests on it

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.000
 and they've discovered that some of them are hundreds of years old,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 the dunks, some are thousands of years old.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.200
 So an oral history that's made it all the way through

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.360
 that was thought to be wrong has been confirmed.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.440
 - Yeah.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.560
 Frozen deer in ice are actually a bit of a problem now though,

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.400
 aren't they?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.280
 So there was that thing last year, I think,

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.280
 which was about the permafrost melting in Siberia

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.480
 and when the permafrost melts, then it starts to explode

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 and this is because of global warming,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.320
 it exposes the dead bodies of things

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.840
 that have died of bad diseases.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.840
 And I think it exposed a reindeer who had anthrax poisoning

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.520
 and it had anthrax poisoning in 1895,

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.720
 but it released the anthrax back into the atmosphere

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.680
 and I think someone died of anthrax poisoning actually.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.520
 - Really?

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.720
 - Yeah, and now scientists are saying that, you know,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.840
 it's as it melts in global warming advances on us

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.680
 and it's going to release all sorts of old stuff,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.280
 like bubonic plague is going to...

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280
 - I've heard smallpox.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280
 - I've heard smallpox.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.880
 - I've heard smallpox is going to come back, yeah.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.760
 - It's a good sequel for your movie, Dan.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.600
 - Yes.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.960
 - Next movie, "The Super Villain Mooster Siberia"

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.120
 with a hair dryer.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.120
 (laughing)

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.400
 - No, come on, just hair dryer in the world.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.360
 - No, he comes back here selling ice cubes

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.200
 to everyone in London.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.320
 They melt in the house, and everyone dies

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.640
 when they have a cup of water on us.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.240
 - Why do all these films set only in London?

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.240
 (laughing)

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.240
 - 'Cause he's James Bond, he's British, yeah.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.240
 - Yeah.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.480
 - I really like this fact, okay,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.280
 because it's sort of a historical thing

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.920
 being revealed by science and it's kind of an exciting

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.200
 crossing of those two academic worlds

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.160
 and something quite similar to that,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.680
 was you know the saddle worth more fires this year.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.520
 - Yep.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.960
 - So that was in the Manchester area obviously.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.280
 One side effect of those fires is that it's going to release

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.120
 all of this long lost pollutant from the industrial revolution

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.360
 because it's, I know it's exciting.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.720
 (laughing)

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.960
 We're all going to die in some way.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.760
 - I noticed the people in North Manchester.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.600
 - Yeah.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.440
 - Just my family really.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.360
 - Yeah, I'm really sorry about that, you should give them a call.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.000
 But the reason for this is that the peat

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.640
 is an unbelievably good store.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.000
 So you know people talk about peat being a really good carbon store.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 So it holds it for hundreds of years.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.640
 It's also a good store of other substances and pollutants.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.240
 And then the fires just set fire to it all

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.360
 and release them all into the air.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.200
 So we're getting to now inhale that deliciously

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.040
 smoggy stuff that the Victorians are doing.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.480
 - I want to kind of rain down, I guess, right?

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.840
 - I don't think you'll be able to see

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.640
 sort of bits of 19th century coal falling out of the sky.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.480
 - What?

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.320
 - I mean, sometimes you get that.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.360
 - Don't you like when it's been, like it picks up sand

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.160
 from the Sahara and it rains down in--

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.960
 - Yeah, might get a bit more smoggy.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.920
 But you won't be able to tell it's 19th century coal,

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.400
 particularly there won't be a top hat raining down

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.440
 with it or a pipe.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.440
 Hey, that could be the third film you're trying to do then.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.280
 - Yes.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.120
 - Peat finger.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.640
 - Peat finger, yeah.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.160
 No, he's a sex offender from a nutshell, I think.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.160
 - Yeah.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.160
 - No, this, you would need the villain

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.640
 to create a gust of wind that sends all the peat

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.400
 from Manchester to London, but could we do this

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.200
 with his giant hairdryer?

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.600
 - Yes, okay, so all right.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.320
 So the villain of the second film we survived

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.520
 into the third.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.400
 - 'Cause last week we did mention that they're looking

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.160
 for a new director of the Bond films.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.680
 (laughing)

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.720
 I think we're only cementing our pledge to become that.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.040
 (laughing)

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.640
 (upbeat music)

00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.000
 - Time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.400
 My fact this week is that the umlauts that are used

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.920
 for the band Motley Crew are purely decorative.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.560
 They're not intended to have pronunciation.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.440
 However, when Motley Crew first performed in Germany,

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.440
 the crowd didn't know that and chanted,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.720
 "Motley Krug!"

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.680
 "Motley Krug!"

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.320
 (laughing)

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.400
 - This is fantastic.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.680
 Now this was tweeted by Quikipedia a couple of days ago

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.160
 since we recorded, and we needed proper verification on it,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.160
 and we got it from Tommy Lee, the drummer of Motley Crew

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.880
 or Motley Krug, who said, "Ha ha, Tra!"

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.720
 Nick, to someone who asked him on behalf of us.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.680
 So yeah, we've got confirmation,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.240
 yeah, that they were Motley Krug.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.960
 It's very exciting 'cause the metal umlaut

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.920
 is purely decorative.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.480
 Motohead had it as well.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.480
 Maximo Park, Maximo Park, and yeah, so that's very,

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.960
 very exciting.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.000
 It's a proper verification from a real source,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.200
 which is also awesome.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.080
 I was looking into Tommy Lee if you don't know who he is.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.920
 So he is a drummer of Motley Crew.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.120
 - He's married to Pamela Anderson.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.840
 Responsible for the leaked porn video as well.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.080
 I don't know if he leaked it, but famously her porn video,

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.720
 there are two, he is one.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.440
 - Oh, this is a real trip down memory lane.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.040
 - She is a first celebrity story of the world.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.680
 - You were the boom operator for that film, didn't you?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.080
 - I thought of about 15 years that Tommy Lee

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.640
 was the same person as Tommy Lee Jones.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.960
 - Yeah, and then I used to watch men in black

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.960
 and be like, "I can't believe this guy."

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.640
 - With family, yeah.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.720
 - He does have a surname, Tommy Lee.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.040
 But he doesn't use it.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.360
 And I only just learnt it before we started recording.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.440
 It's bass.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.960
 And I reckon he doesn't use it because he's the drummer.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.080
 So that would have just been confusing.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.400
 - Very, yeah.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.520
 Whereas just shoving umla, it was left right in center

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.760
 that all the first three pronounce is absolutely fine.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.080
 - So it's just a convention in metal bands, right?

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.840
 - Well, I guess not just metal bands,

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.840
 'cause I just learnt as well that JZ used to have

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.000
 an umla in his name.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.840
 - What?

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.080
 - Yeah, he over, I guess, well, he doesn't specify.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.680
 He just said I used to have an umla.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.240
 And he uses punctuation quite oddly.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.880
 He had a hyphen to begin with.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.240
 He got rid of the hyphen.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.440
 His latest album came back.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.920
 He not only came back with a hyphen,

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.520
 but in all caps as well.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.520
 So JZ is now shouting at you.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.360
 And he admitted that he used to have an umla out there.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.240
 - Do you know I think we should have an umla out in our name?

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.520
 Or maybe some kind of punctuation?

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.360
 - I think we definitely.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.040
 It seems like a supply way to make yourself sound hard, basically.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.880
 - No, no, such thing as a fish.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.760
 - No, 'cause then we sound like we're from Yorkshire.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.360
 (laughing)

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.400
 - There's no such thing as a fish.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.040
 (laughing)

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.320
 - It's fine line between heavy metal and Yorkshire.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.120
 (laughing)

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.080
 - Has JZ ever done an autobiography?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.920
 - He has, yeah.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.400
 Is it called J2Z?

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400
 (laughing)

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.440
 - It's not, and it should be, why is it not?

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.320
 And I'm pretty sure it is an A to Z as well.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.160
 - You're kidding, yeah?

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.000
 - No.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.840
 - No.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.680
 - I'm pretty sure.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.240
 - And who does a A to Z of their art and biography?

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.320
 - It's quite a fun idea.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.440
 - Matt Lucas did it.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.960
 We should write an A to Z book.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.120
 - Yeah, but you do have some B is Bond,

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.760
 but what do you do before that?

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.040
 - Oh yeah.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.480
 Antenatal, I guess.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.320
 - Nice.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.160
 - Yeah.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.160
 - It's not as good as the movie ideas.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160
 - Interesting.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.040
 (laughing)

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.920
 - Stick to another sequel of those.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.800
 - So on the metal um-lout,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.080
 the first band to have a num-lout was called

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.640
 Amon Dual, the second, that's A, M, O, N, D,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.400
 U, um-lout, U, um-lout, L, and then two eyes.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.480
 But that is fair enough because dual is a Turkish word

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.640
 which has um-louts in it.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.480
 - Oh.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.120
 - And the first band to give itself a spurious

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.880
 on-lout was Blue Eister cult.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.880
 - Oh, of course.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.720
 - Yes, yeah.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.560
 - Over which?

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.400
 - Lesson.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400
 - Over the O in Eister.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.240
 - Mmm.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240
 - Mmm.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.680
 - And the longest continuous um-louted word

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.840
 in the world is Ya, so J-A-A-A,

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.080
 all of which have um-louts above are.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.360
 It's Estonian and it means the edge of the ice.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.640
 So when you get to the edge of the ice,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.480
 - Yeah.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.040
 - Oh, that was good.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.240
 - So yeah, punctuation.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.240
 - Yeah.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.200
 - So, I think we've covered before the intera bang,

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.080
 maybe on QI, which was that was something

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.840
 that actually appeared on typewriters in the '60s,

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.800
 which was a question mark and an exclamation mark

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.640
 that were elided, which means you're asking a question,

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.560
 but like, oh, we're going to the cinema today

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.240
 in a really excited way.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.760
 I had a really sad childhood.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.400
 I was the one who kind of think they got me excited.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.800
 But another thing that the language has always been

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.320
 hunting for is ways to show irony, right?

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.720
 So people have always been trying to invent bits of punctuation

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.400
 that show you're being sarcastic.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.920
 And actually, the first person who suggested a way of doing that

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.720
 was a guy called John Wilkins.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.080
 And do you remember John Wilkins?

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.920
 - Nope, no.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.720
 - He is the guy who also was the first person

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.560
 to plan to put a man on the moon and design a rocket

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.840
 for it, Oliver Cromwell's brother.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.680
 - Yes.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.960
 - So was he suggesting that ironically?

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.240
 - It was a one big joke.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.080
 (laughing)

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.520
 Out of hand.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.560
 Yeah, his main thing was he wrote this huge book

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.600
 on how to change the language.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.280
 And he said he should have an upside down exclamation mark

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.560
 to show irony.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.600
 - Well, they call that the sarc mark, don't they?

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600
 - They do, yes.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.240
 - It's the sarcasm, yes.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.480
 - Just on another symbol that didn't kick off.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.920
 I read this fact, and it's hard actually to verify it.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.720
 So it'd be interested to know if anyone can get

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.480
 to the bottom of this, but Hagrid Hawkes,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.960
 who's a fantastic Twitter account and has a few books,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.480
 he put this up saying that in 1580,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.240
 English printer Henry Denham,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.800
 proposed using a reverse question mark,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.000
 so a sort of mirror-imaged question mark

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.880
 to indicate when a question was rhetorical,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.160
 which would be very useful if you were an author.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.160
 - Would it?

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.000
 - Yeah, it would.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.840
 - No, no, no.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.160
 (laughing)

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.720
 - So we think that this might,

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.960
 we're not sure if this is true, right?

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.800
 Because we've not found anything earlier than the 1990s,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.560
 of evidence for it, although Denham,

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.160
 he did invent two different types of question mark.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.280
 One for yes, no questions,

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.640
 and another one for questions that begin with WH,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.640
 like why were what?

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.640
 So he had two different questions marks for those.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.320
 - What was that for?

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.640
 Why do you need a special question mark

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.280
 to let you know the question begins with WH?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.120
 'Cause--

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.320
 - In case it's been such a long sentence,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.680
 you can't remember the word of the handle.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.120
 - I think the reason that we don't still have them

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.200
 is because they're not that useful.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.160
 But he was the first person also to use semi-colons

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.640
 with any kind of regularity.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.880
 He didn't invent them,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.800
 but he was the first one to use them regularly.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.920
 - Nice.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.040
 - And consistently.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.080
 He also invented the word parathesis for brackets

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.600
 which later became parentheses.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.880
 - Oh, wow.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.880
 - Oh, he had a huge influence.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.480
 - Yeah, so he was a massive kind of punctuation, dude.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.920
 But huge in that world amongst all the greats.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.480
 - Well, semi-colons, I didn't realize,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.680
 some people really hate semi-colons, basically.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.880
 So George Orwell, he hated them so much

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.040
 then he wrote a novel called "Coming Up for Air"

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.360
 is one of his early ones, I think,

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.320
 and he put no semi-colons in.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.600
 But then he was a bit worried that no one would notice

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.440
 that he hadn't put any in.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.560
 So he wrote to his publisher, saying,

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.440
 "I haven't put any semi-colons in here."

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.280
 (laughing)

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.440
 Oh, man.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.720
 - So childish.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.160
 - I know, one of the great writers.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.000
 - Yeah.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.960
 - Hemingway as well, very much.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.000
 So played with the rules of punctuation.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.440
 But he only did so with the claim that he knew it's so well

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.600
 that he was able to go beyond the acceptable rules.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.840
 - I think that's quite normal.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.680
 - Yeah.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680
 - I think that's quite standard, I would say people,

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.120
 like Hillary Mantell and Rachel Cusk do that,

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.000
 but it's because you can feel they've got such a good grasp of it

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.400
 that they're mastering it rather than just spewing nonsense

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.040
 onto a page and then going,

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.280
 "Oh yeah, it's just so familiar with the art."

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.240
 So William Blake would sometimes put a full stop

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.840
 in the middle of a word.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.680
 (laughing)

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.360
 - What a maverick.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.200
 (laughing)

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.120
 Is that because it was to be read and he wanted the punctuation

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.720
 of a word to be broken up?

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.640
 - I don't know, he also saw a lot of angels.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.920
 So, it might have been taking dictation from them.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.480
 - Guys, the punctuation point I need all the time

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.960
 is a question mark colon.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.440
 And I can't believe this isn't a thing.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.000
 When you're writing an email and you're like,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.400
 "What about these points?"

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.840
 And then you give a list and I always put a question mark

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.560
 followed by a colon and it looks stupid.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.200
 It's, I think that's the most essential piece of punctuation

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.120
 and no one's ever come up with one as far as I know.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.600
 - Yeah, so how are we gonna fix it?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.720
 - Is it a question mark with two dots at the bottom?

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.360
 - Sideways, I'm allowed to at the bottom.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.760
 I have a second dot underneath the first dot.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.000
 So it's a way to start.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.160
 - Sideways, yeah, right.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.440
 - What about a second dot in the middle

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.960
 of the round bit of the question mark?

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.880
 Like an eyeball.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.560
 - Like an eyeball.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.560
 - Or a nipple?

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.640
 Let's make the question mark a bit sexy.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.840
 - I think dots at the bottom makes more sense, doesn't it?

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.720
 - We could call them question knocks.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.560
 - Okay, no.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.400
 - Oh god.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.800
 - Let's just send it.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.920
 That's actually being called a high brow point initially, I feel.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.320
 (laughing)

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.900
 (upbeat music)

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.320
 - Okay, it's time for our final step to the show

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.400
 and that is Chazinski.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.480
 - My fact this week is that traditionally,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.080
 indigenous Hawaiians had personalized chance

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.320
 for their genitals.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.360
 - That's unusual to be Hawaiians.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.120
 (laughing)

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.280
 - This is so amazing.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.480
 All of this stuff about indigenous Hawaiians

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.120
 and the what they associated with their genitals,

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.160
 which I spent a lot of time reading about this week.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.400
 But I should say, I read it initially on the BBC

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.240
 of such a cheat.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.520
 It was a series of amazing sex facts from around the world

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.560
 and I saw that and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard it.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.600
 - That's not a cheat.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.080
 - This, is that not a cheat?

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.920
 - No.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.080
 - I felt like a cheat.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.280
 - You're not allowed to get your facts from anywhere.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.760
 - I actually went to Hawaii to try and find something.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.080
 I didn't find anything.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.760
 - I went to Hawaii, you stood in the air pot

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.480
 and did a chance about my genitals.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.320
 (laughing)

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.000
 - Not allowed back in the United States.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.160
 (laughing)

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.560
 This started being recorded from the 18th century

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.080
 when cook and others went to Hawaii

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.440
 and yeah, it turns out that indigenous Hawaiians

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.080
 would give their genitals a name

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.760
 or their parents would give their genitals a name

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.440
 almost as soon as they were born

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.800
 and they'd also design, they'd also write a song for them

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.280
 and sort of have a story around their genitals

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.000
 and it's called the Mille Mai, the genital chant

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.560
 and it describes that individual's organ.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.520
 - So you had to, sorry, you had to name your child

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.480
 and then you also had to name your child's genitals.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.280
 - It's hard enough to find a good name for your child, isn't it?

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.760
 Have you reckon they had pucks?

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.360
 (laughing)

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.400
 The perfect name for your child's genitals.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.400
 (laughing)

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.040
 I named my child's genitals after his grandpa's genitals.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.560
 (laughing)

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:36.080
 - One example that I found was Queen Liliro Kulanis

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.760
 Mille Mai was the story of her vagina

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.840
 and it was called anapal, which meant frisky

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.880
 and it was about her frolicing genitals

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.200
 that went up and down apparently.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.040
 - Oh.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.360
 - So yeah, they used to frolic it.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.560
 - I think the source of the b-barticle

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.520
 was this paper by a guy called Milton Diamond

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.520
 who studied a lot of Hawaiian sexual traditions and culture

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.560
 and things about nudity as well.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.840
 So this is really weird.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.840
 - Nudity was not sexual, in almost all contexts.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.760
 You only started wearing your clothes

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.400
 over your genitals when you hit puberty

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.720
 and that was out of respect for your genitals.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.960
 (laughing)

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.520
 It's amazing.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.040
 But nudity for adults was symbolic of death

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.880
 or punishment or lamentation.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.160
 And if you were seen nude outside a ritual context,

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.120
 it was widely assumed that you had gone mad with grief.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:27.960
 - Yes.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.640
 - So it's not a sexy.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.720
 - It's really not.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.200
 - Nude speeches, three sad places in Hawaii.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.960
 - It could also be used as an appeal for forgiveness

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960
 this paper said.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.360
 So if someone's done you are wrong,

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.800
 then the way you ask for their forgiveness

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.160
 is by taking all your clothes off

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.960
 and following them around until they forgive you.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.000
 - Turn up outside their house at three in the morning.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.600
 (laughing)

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.600
 - Please forgive me.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.520
 Please take me back.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.600
 - I've done that actually.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.080
 (laughing)

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.040
 - It's normally just my Hawaiian heritage.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.440
 (laughing)

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.640
 - Is it, do we know if this is no longer being done?

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.720
 Was this for traditional old indigenous?

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.480
 - So what happened was when the Europeans came to Hawaii,

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.000
 they saw all this stuff happening,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.800
 but then they soon cut it all out

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.840
 because it wasn't very Christian.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.880
 - So there was a lot of taking over Hawaiian culture

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.960
 and enforcing Western.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.560
 And then Hawaiian indigenous people have tried to take

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.840
 a lot of it back, but I think it's obviously quite difficult

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.720
 'cause it was lost for about 50 years.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.040
 - They said there was a basically where they go,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.880
 the penis chant, do we want that back here?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.240
 - I'm good I think.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.200
 - So like for instance, Hula dancing is probably

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.000
 one of the most famous things in Hawaii

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.680
 and Captain Cook said it was perfectly easy and graceful.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.200
 He thought it was amazing,

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.120
 but when the missionaries arrived, it was officially suppressed.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.680
 - Have you heard of penis blowing?

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.520
 - Yes.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.360
 (laughing)

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.200
 - No, I don't think you have.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.160
 - I've seen that tummy leap in the eye.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.840
 (laughing)

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.160
 - It's a signal to men in black.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.000
 - Okay.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.520
 (laughing)

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.600
 - This is odd.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.040
 This was a daily ritual for Hawaiian infant,

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.880
 which is where the members of the family would blow

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.680
 on the penis, just with a stream of air,

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.240
 just, and it was to prepare the foreskin

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.600
 for a kind of micro-circumcidian ceremony,

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.200
 and it would normally be an art or a grandmother

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.520
 who did the blowing.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.840
 But lots of relatives were qualified to be the blower

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.480
 if you didn't have any art, so that's fine.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.760
 - Wait, so what were they blowing onto it?

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.800
 - Sort of Mike, or sort of a story of it?

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.840
 - No, they just blow to protect it in their mythology.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.680
 - Yeah, okay.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.120
 - And this is a really common thing,

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.320
 and there were lots of people even well into the 1980s,

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.000
 for example, who had this done to them in their childhood.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.560
 - Yeah, in fact, there was a story, wasn't there,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.040
 about a man who was totally non-sexual, we should say.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.200
 - Yeah, completely.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.080
 There was a story about a man who was annoyed

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.880
 because he'd married a Hawaiian woman,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.840
 and he left her mom to babysit their child,

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.920
 and came back and found her doing this.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.240
 It was like, why are you blowing on my child's penis?

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.040
 And apparently the mother-in-law was like,

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.120
 well, I have to, otherwise it's very bad luck,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.320
 and was really worried about the baby's health if she didn't.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.560
 But it does, it seemed weird, actually,

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.960
 if you haven't explained that before.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960
 - Yes, yeah.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.560
 I like it's another gust of wind,

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.240
 in fact, going into the,

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.240
 (laughing)

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.600
 'cause maybe it does have it.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.000
 Interestingly, you can tell the economic activity

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.360
 of the Reven Empire from discarded foreskins

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.360
 of Hawaiian children.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:19.880
 - Oh my God.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.120
 This, the author of this paper is called Milton Diamond,

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.520
 as you mentioned before, and the only thing

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.680
 that I could find of an interest outside

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.440
 of him writing this paper.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.200
 So he wrote a lot about sex and gender, and so on.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.880
 He had a big feud with a man called Money,

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.640
 so Diamond and Money had a big feud,

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.880
 and they famously got into a punch-up

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.720
 at a conference in Dubrovnik.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.200
 So Money had written a book called,

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.240
 as nature made him the boy raised as a girl,

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.440
 and mentions it in this book, this fight.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.640
 And there was a lot of chat about transgender at the time,

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.200
 and so that's where they fell foul

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.000
 of what they thought definitions were.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.640
 And yeah, there was a fight,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.640
 although Diamond claims he doesn't recall being punched.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.480
 But yeah, there's the only sort of thing.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.840
 - The thing is, with Diamond, he is really hard, isn't he?

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.920
 (laughing)

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:16.560
 - I have some stuff on chance.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.880
 - Right?

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.560
 - So this, I just thought this was really interesting.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.600
 I'd never heard of it before,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.640
 but have you guys heard fruit singing?

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.400
 - Oh, like Mongolian stuff, yeah.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.400
 - Yeah, so I didn't know that--

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.240
 - Actually, I'm sorry.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.960
 - It sounded like that, but it's okay.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.800
 (laughing)

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.640
 - It actually does sound a bit like that,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.600
 but I didn't realize that they're creating multiple notes.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.840
 - Yeah, they do harmonies, don't they?

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.680
 - Yeah, with one throat.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.960
 So yeah, this is like Mongolians and some Inuits,

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.400
 and it's called a two-tooth and overtone technique

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.640
 when it's done in Mongolia,

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.520
 and they can get up to six simultaneous notes

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.400
 to come out of their mouth by doing this special fruit singing

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.240
 technique, which I did not have time to look properly

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.440
 into how exactly it works.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.960
 So all I can tell you is, it involves opening and closing

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.400
 the vocal chords until harmonic resonances appear,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.200
 and I think if you go faster and faster,

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.400
 different resonances come, and you make different noises,

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.280
 but it's really cool.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.880
 And then there's this one other really cool way

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.760
 of fruit singing, which is, this is an Inuit culture,

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.760
 it's called the Katajak, and two women stand face to face,

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.880
 but super close, so the lips almost touching each other,

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.680
 and it's like a duel, a singing duel,

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.360
 and so it goes really, really fast.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.000
 One woman says one note or throat noise,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.560
 and then the other one has to respond to it,

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.840
 and it goes faster and faster,

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.600
 and they use each other's mouths as kind of resonators,

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.200
 basically, and it only ends when one of them

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.760
 like collapses, laughing, or runs out of breath,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.960
 and they can go on for hours, and it looks so cool.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.200
 - It's like tooling banjos. - Yeah.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:46.280
 - But what you were saying is, so you got two people,

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.840
 the mouths open, and I'm making good noise

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.280
 into the other person's mouth, and because they've got a mouth,

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.160
 there it's resonating the... - Exactly, and it makes a sound,

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.200
 - but they're resonating in your mouth at the same time.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.200
 - Well straight after you, yeah, exactly. - Oh, right after you, right.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.560
 - So they're using your mouth as a musical instrument.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.440
 - That is so great. - That's weird.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.160
 - I know, it's fun, isn't it?

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.320
 - Have you heard any? - Yeah.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.920
 - Wow. - It sounds cool.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.160
 - That sounds weird. - Yeah.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.600
 - It's not singing the normal stuff.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.840
 The Mongolian stuff sounds a bit like, did you reduce, doesn't it?

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.160
 - It does, yes. - Yeah.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.000
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.120
 - Who else? - Who else has got it?

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.280
 (laughing)

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.600
 - Six, no, six. - It's not doing that in my mouth, darling.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.280
 (laughing)

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.400
 - Can I quickly mention, because naming of genitals

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.560
 is a practice that still does go on.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.200
 There was a server that was done in 2015,

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.720
 and it got reported in many places,

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.280
 'cause it was a genuine survey,

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.000
 and they found that 73% of men have given their penis a nickname.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.600
 - Is that right? - Yeah.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.480
 59% say that it was a woman who came up with their nickname

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.040
 for them. - Oh.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.320
 - So the survey was commissioned by a men's retailer

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.760
 called Jackamo, so this is a survey done through them.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.360
 So, okay, let's, a few nicknames.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.160
 - I can't think of anything that's not rude, Terry.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.440
 - So the top five. - Give us, what letter does it begin with?

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.000
 - T for a... - I was a Terry.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.360
 (laughing)

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.120
 - Is it one word? - It is one word.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.760
 - I think... - Terminator.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.640
 - I think sort of... - Terminator.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.160
 - Think what? - Gods.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.800
 - For? - No.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.320
 - No, 'cause that's just someone with a lisp.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.080
 - Sorry, I also have an aerial disease.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.680
 - I was trying not to. - My fetus is thought.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.280
 (laughing)

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.280
 - Sorry, this isn't a god.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.720
 I was trying to put us in the ancient Greeks.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.880
 - All right, so what do you say that's a god?

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.600
 - Oh, feces. - No, Troy.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.000
 So... - Troy?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.200
 - Yeah, yeah, weird.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.560
 - Doctor Doolittle, is that one?

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.800
 - No, it's not. - That's shame.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.960
 - Russell the muscle is.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.760
 - Russell the muscle. - Yeah.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.320
 - It's not a muscle.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.400
 It's an organ.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.960
 - Oggons can have muscles in them.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.160
 Your heart's an organ, it's loads of muscle.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.480
 - Good point. - But there isn't a muscle in the penis.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480
 - No, sir.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.640
 - Well, I'd be working out.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.400
 (laughing)

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.000
 - I've also been kicked out of the chair yet.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.760
 (laughing)

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.920
 - Okay, that's it.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.040
 That is all of our facts.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.520
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.280
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.640
 about the things that we have said

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.080
 over the course of this podcast,

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.840
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.840
 I'm on @tribaland, and my penis is on it.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.200
 (laughing)

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.640
 - The table right now, damn.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.960
 (laughing)

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.960
 - He stopped blowing on it.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.760
 (laughing)

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.760
 - Andy?

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.000
 - At Andrew Hunter M.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.840
 - James.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.680
 - At James Harkin.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.600
 - And Shazinsky.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.680
 - You can email podcast@QI.com.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.240
 - Yep, or you can go to our group account,

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.240
 which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to our Facebook page.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.840
 No such thing as a fish, or go to our website.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.480
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.280
 As I said, last week we've redone it.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.720
 It looks really awesome.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.880
 It has everything up there from ticket links

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.160
 to all of our previous episodes

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.040
 to our new book that's coming out.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.960
 You can also get a behind-the-scenes documentary

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.840
 that we made called Behind the Gills.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.360
 That's up there, link to that.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.560
 So go there, find everything.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.160
 And if you wanna hear us again,

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.840
 we'll be back again next week.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.800
 We'll see you then.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.640
 Goodbye.

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.220
 (upbeat music)

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.800
 (upbeat music)

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.040
 (upbeat music)
