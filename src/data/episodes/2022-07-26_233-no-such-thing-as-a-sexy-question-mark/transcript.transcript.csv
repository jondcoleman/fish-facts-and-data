00:00:05,00:00:12,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:12,00:00:13,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:13,00:00:15,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:15,00:00:18,from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:19,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:19,00:00:21,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:21,00:00:24,"James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski."
00:00:24,00:00:26,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:26,00:00:29,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:29,00:00:32,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:32,00:00:34,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"- Okay, my fact this week is that on their birthday,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,every beef eater at the Tower of London
00:00:39,00:00:43,gets a gift of a free bottle of beef eater gin.
00:00:43,00:00:46,"- On their birthday singular, so do they all do they all?"
00:00:46,00:00:48,- They only hire people born on the 25th of September.
00:00:48,00:00:50,- They're like race horses.
00:00:50,00:00:52,They all get their new age on the 1st of January.
00:00:52,00:00:56,"No, it's every beef eater on that particular person's birthday."
00:00:56,00:00:57,They get one bottle of gin.
00:00:57,00:00:59,And the beef eater gin brand
00:00:59,00:01:01,is nothing to do with the beef eaters.
00:01:01,00:01:04,"But I went to the Tower of London this week,"
00:01:04,00:01:06,and I spoke to my friend Andy the beef eater.
00:01:06,00:01:09,And he said that basically the beef eater gin brand
00:01:09,00:01:11,"they've got so much out of the beef eaters over the years,"
00:01:11,00:01:13,it's the least they can do to get them
00:01:13,00:01:14,a bottle of gin every year.
00:01:14,00:01:15,"- Sorry, sweet."
00:01:15,00:01:17,So did you go to the beef eater pub?
00:01:17,00:01:19,"- I went to the, it's called the Keys,"
00:01:19,00:01:22,and it's the pub inside the Tower of London.
00:01:22,00:01:22,"Yes, it had got there."
00:01:22,00:01:23,- That's very cool.
00:01:23,00:01:24,- That's cool.
00:01:24,00:01:25,"Yeah, I was reading about it."
00:01:25,00:01:27,- A lot of pubs in the Tower of London.
00:01:27,00:01:29,This is the last remaining one.
00:01:29,00:01:30,"- There's just one left, which means if you fall out"
00:01:30,00:01:34,"with any other beef eaters, if you have beef with them,"
00:01:34,00:01:36,you have to go to the same pub all the time.
00:01:36,00:01:36,- That's terrible.
00:01:36,00:01:37,- But there's a sick calm.
00:01:37,00:01:38,"- Sure, I would watch it."
00:01:38,00:01:41,"In fact, there's a soap opera set in the Tower of London pub."
00:01:41,00:01:43,"- You're right, you're right."
00:01:43,00:01:45,"- Because they get up to quite bad behavior sometimes,"
00:01:45,00:01:46,and they have done traditionally.
00:01:46,00:01:49,"So I always thought of beef eaters as these sort of like,"
00:01:49,00:01:53,"eminent bastions of British stateliness,"
00:01:53,00:01:54,"in other words, like that."
00:01:54,00:01:56,"- But actually, they were historically"
00:01:56,00:01:59,"used to kind of be drunkards, I think,"
00:01:59,00:02:00,in the 18th century.
00:02:00,00:02:02,They were known for creating havoc
00:02:02,00:02:06,and for illegally subletting their rooms out to other people.
00:02:06,00:02:08,They would just randomly sell on the post of beef eater
00:02:08,00:02:11,to make a bit of extra cash whenever they wanted.
00:02:11,00:02:12,"Yeah, they were known as scoundrels."
00:02:12,00:02:14,- You could only do that once.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"Like once you sold it, it would belong to the other person"
00:02:16,00:02:18,and then they might sell it on afterwards.
00:02:18,00:02:20,"- Yeah, unless you stole it back from them in the night."
00:02:20,00:02:22,"- Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how it worked."
00:02:22,00:02:24,I think you basically got money off them
00:02:24,00:02:26,and then they had the ceremony.
00:02:26,00:02:28,"And the ceremony to become a beef eater,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,"you get a little kind of cup, a little pewter cup,"
00:02:30,00:02:33,"and you drink some part and you do a toast,"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"and then you're a beef eater, basically."
00:02:35,00:02:35,- Yeah.
00:02:35,00:02:38,Imagine if we could just sell our jobs to other people.
00:02:38,00:02:39,You can if you want.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"- I mean, well, I'm in talks with a few guys in my case."
00:02:43,00:02:44,Alex Bell is pretty interesting.
00:02:44,00:02:48,"- In the toast, it's a reference to that, isn't it?"
00:02:48,00:02:49,"'Cause they do the toast with a poor,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,and then I think the thing they say
00:02:51,00:02:53,"when they're toasting a new beef eater is,"
00:02:53,00:02:55,is it may you never die a yeoman order?
00:02:55,00:02:57,So they're officially called yeoman orders.
00:02:57,00:02:59,"And that's because the idea was,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"if you made the mistake of dying in an office,"
00:03:01,00:03:02,then you've been an idiot
00:03:02,00:03:03,'cause you hadn't sold it on in time
00:03:03,00:03:04,and made that extra cash.
00:03:04,00:03:05,"- Yes, exactly."
00:03:05,00:03:08,"It's like dying after, or not selling a house"
00:03:08,00:03:09,in the years before you die.
00:03:09,00:03:12,And to go just on a rampage with the money.
00:03:12,00:03:13,- Is that what you're gonna do?
00:03:13,00:03:15,Considering you do have a son.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- Yeah, good point."
00:03:17,00:03:20,and they were really unpopular in loads of ways.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"So as well as selling their jobs,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"a writer historically said,"
00:03:24,00:03:26,they have gradually assumed to themselves
00:03:26,00:03:29,the more lucrative occupation of stopping everybody
00:03:29,00:03:30,who wishes to visit these objects
00:03:30,00:03:32,of our national pride and glory
00:03:32,00:03:34,and forcing themselves upon them as their guides.
00:03:34,00:03:36,"So the guards would just say,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,"hey, do you wanna guide a tour and pest you"
00:03:37,00:03:39,until you gave in against the money?
00:03:39,00:03:40,"- That's right, yeah."
00:03:40,00:03:43,- So Andy the beef eater gave us a guided tour this week.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"And I gotta say, if you do go to the Tower of London,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,"do get a tour from their beef eater's,"
00:03:48,00:03:49,'cause they are amazing.
00:03:49,00:03:50,And they know all sorts of stuff.
00:03:50,00:03:53,But you were duped into paying for a meal on your shirt.
00:03:53,00:03:54,It's a very easy job to eat.
00:03:54,00:03:56,(laughing)
00:03:56,00:03:58,- I read this thing about the beef eater's that.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"So I think London, anyone coming here,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,"there's a famous fact about the cabbies,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,the bike cab drivers having the knowledge.
00:04:05,00:04:06,It's one of those things.
00:04:06,00:04:09,They have to memorize every single road in London.
00:04:09,00:04:10,And that's a test they take.
00:04:10,00:04:13,There's a similar thing that happens with the beef eater's.
00:04:13,00:04:16,They have to memorize what's known as the story.
00:04:16,00:04:19,And it's 900 years of the Tower of London's history.
00:04:19,00:04:20,They need to know it word by word
00:04:20,00:04:23,within six months of passing their probation
00:04:23,00:04:24,after being sworn in.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"- Yeah, but you now get these Uber beef eater's stuff"
00:04:26,00:04:28,who come in and they just read the story
00:04:28,00:04:29,if they can not.
00:04:29,00:04:33,"- I don't think we know why they're called beef eater's, do we?"
00:04:33,00:04:35,There are lots of theories.
00:04:35,00:04:38,The story we were told on the tour was that
00:04:38,00:04:39,"it was because they were paid in beef,"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"which they know definitely is true or paid in meat,"
00:04:42,00:04:44,which they know definitely was true.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"And that the people outside kind of thought,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,I'll look at these guys eating all that meat.
00:04:48,00:04:50,And so it was like an insult kind of thing.
00:04:50,00:04:51,- It makes sense.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"I mean, and they're part of the royal household."
00:04:54,00:04:56,"They eat lots of meat, they eat lots of beef."
00:04:56,00:05:00,- I've seen other people poo pooing like crazy that story.
00:05:00,00:05:01,"- That's just, all right."
00:05:01,00:05:03,- But it just makes so much sense.
00:05:03,00:05:04,It seems to be like one of those things
00:05:04,00:05:05,that you can't really poo poo.
00:05:05,00:05:06,"It's like, yeah, they eat lots of beef"
00:05:06,00:05:08,and they're called beef eater's.
00:05:08,00:05:09,- Do you have a better theory of red?
00:05:09,00:05:11,- I've read two or three.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"There's one which is sort of it's from the French boufete,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,which is a different word meaning something else.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"- Yeah, that's clearly nonsense, isn't it?"
00:05:17,00:05:18,- What? Why?
00:05:18,00:05:20,- Because that is such a convoluted way
00:05:20,00:05:21,to get to the word beef eater
00:05:21,00:05:23,rather than just they ate loads of beef.
00:05:23,00:05:24,- I think eating beef is--
00:05:24,00:05:25,- And we're paid in it.
00:05:25,00:05:26,- There's probably something--
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Who gets paid in the beef?
00:05:27,00:05:28,- But we know they were paid in it.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- They know that they were, yeah."
00:05:29,00:05:32,"We know they were given a stipend of beef,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,which most people were able to eat at the time.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"- Oh, we know the people took the place out"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"of the royal household for having,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,'cause they ate so much beef around that time.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"- I think Andy's right, there's so many holes in this."
00:05:42,00:05:42,- Just can't see.
00:05:42,00:05:43,- I just don't believe it.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- I don't believe it.
00:05:44,00:05:47,- But it could be that it came from something else
00:05:47,00:05:50,and then it was helped by the fact they ate lots of beef.
00:05:50,00:05:51,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:05:51,00:05:52,It could have come from Buffetay.
00:05:52,00:05:55,And then I'm not buying it.
00:05:55,00:05:55,- So what is Buffetay?
00:05:55,00:05:57,- But there are beef eaters today.
00:05:57,00:05:59,The Ravens eat raw beef.
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- They get fed raw beef from Smithville, Marble."
00:06:01,00:06:03,- The beef eaters probably eat beef.
00:06:03,00:06:05,(all laughing)
00:06:05,00:06:06,"- Wait, are you gonna explain"
00:06:06,00:06:09,"your definitely more plausible, weird, French origin"
00:06:09,00:06:10,convoluted on?
00:06:10,00:06:12,"- I did read this and I thought,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,"well, that's clearly bollocks for the fun."
00:06:14,00:06:17,"- So the thing is that the beef eaters began,"
00:06:17,00:06:21,"they're called the Yomangard of the King of Queen, right?"
00:06:21,00:06:22,"Well, they're called the Yomang Waters,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,which is part of a larger group called the Yomangard.
00:06:24,00:06:27,And they're kind of the bodyguard of the King of Queen.
00:06:27,00:06:32,"But it started in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485,"
00:06:32,00:06:35,when Henry VII won the crown
00:06:35,00:06:37,"and all these guys who'd helped him,"
00:06:37,00:06:38,"who were from this Northern Regiment,"
00:06:38,00:06:41,he brought them in and they became his bodyguard.
00:06:41,00:06:45,But Henry VII will have been an English-speaking king.
00:06:45,00:06:48,"So if it was further back in Norman times,"
00:06:48,00:06:50,you can kind of see where the French thing might have come from.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- Yeah. - That's a good point.
00:06:51,00:06:54,- Whereas Henry VII's actually hailed from Wales.
00:06:54,00:06:55,- Did he?
00:06:55,00:06:57,"- Yeah, the tutors were all Welsh family."
00:06:57,00:06:58,- Is there any Welsh word
00:06:58,00:07:00,that sounds a bit like B-feeters?
00:07:00,00:07:01,- Tafferter?
00:07:01,00:07:03,(all laughing)
00:07:03,00:07:06,- It could have come from B-feeters.
00:07:06,00:07:08,"Like B, what's the B-feet?"
00:07:08,00:07:11,"- You know a feat, like you accomplish a feat."
00:07:11,00:07:12,"- With a B. - Yeah, with a B."
00:07:12,00:07:13,- B-racing or something.
00:07:13,00:07:15,"- Exactly, so maybe they were famous for their B-racing"
00:07:15,00:07:18,back in the day and they got known as the B-feeters.
00:07:18,00:07:19,- That's good.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"- Maybe the Bs were the original Ravens, you think,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,but they trained.
00:07:23,00:07:25,"- Well, maybe there was originally another group"
00:07:25,00:07:27,called the A-feeters who did lots of things.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:07:28,00:07:29,- And then they kind of died out
00:07:29,00:07:31,and then the B-feeters came in.
00:07:31,00:07:32,- Bingo.
00:07:32,00:07:34,- The less good featers we could never got into the '18.
00:07:34,00:07:35,- Maybe.
00:07:35,00:07:36,"- I'm just saying, there's a lot of explanations."
00:07:36,00:07:37,- You're right.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"Did you see, when you were in the pub, James,"
00:07:39,00:07:43,I wonder if there's apparently a framed photo of Rudolf Hess.
00:07:43,00:07:44,- I took a photo of it.
00:07:44,00:07:45,- Did you?
00:07:45,00:07:47,"- Yeah, of his signature as well."
00:07:47,00:07:48,- Wow.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"- He sort of signed, they asked him for a pin-up photo, basically,"
00:07:50,00:07:52,because he was a senior Nazi who was imprisoned there
00:07:52,00:07:54,briefly in 1941.
00:07:54,00:07:55,- I think he defected.
00:07:55,00:07:57,- Everyone else was taking photos of all the pictures
00:07:57,00:08:00,"of B-feeters and stuff, but I clung to the signature"
00:08:00,00:08:02,of Rudolf Hess and I got to get a photo of that.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"- Well, you've got a large collection of Nazi signatures."
00:08:05,00:08:07,"Instantly, you recognise that."
00:08:07,00:08:10,"- I see that covenant behind the fake bookshelf in your house, right?"
00:08:10,00:08:13,(laughing)
00:08:13,00:08:14,"- Okay, that makes sense."
00:08:14,00:08:17,"He did he defect, because it sounds like when he was there,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,a lot of people collected his signature and that feels odd.
00:08:19,00:08:25,"- I think he flew over with his family to Scotland, by and all of a sudden."
00:08:25,00:08:28,"Yeah, I think he came out, I think, typically,"
00:08:28,00:08:31,there weren't many Nazis arrested during the war in the German side.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"- But he was prison, I wasn't he."
00:08:33,00:08:34,"- He was prisoned, yeah."
00:08:34,00:08:35,- He was prisoned.
00:08:35,00:08:36,- He wasn't just drinking at the pub.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"- Yeah, if you'd effect, they'd have to say,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,"""Oh, great, well, welcome to Britain, here's your home."""
00:08:41,00:08:42,"- Yeah, no, he was in jail."
00:08:42,00:08:43,- And they were under.
00:08:43,00:08:45,- And then they sort of asked you a few questions.
00:08:45,00:08:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:45,00:08:47,"- Are you sure you're Rudolf Hess, that kind of thing?"
00:08:47,00:08:48,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:48,00:08:50,"- But then he did get tried after the war,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,didn't he and committed suicide in prison Hess?
00:08:52,00:08:53,- I'm not saying it's a happy ending to the story.
00:08:53,00:08:54,- Right.
00:08:54,00:08:55,(laughing)
00:08:55,00:08:58,"- But also, let's not waste too much sympathy on the guy."
00:08:58,00:09:01,(laughing)
00:09:01,00:09:04,"- So if you've got the Rudolf Hess,"
00:09:04,00:09:05,everyone else is doing B-feeters.
00:09:05,00:09:08,- Did you see the framed photo of Bruce Willis?
00:09:08,00:09:10,- I didn't see that.
00:09:10,00:09:11,- Did you not?
00:09:11,00:09:15,- I saw a framed picture of the Duke of Edinburgh.
00:09:15,00:09:16,- Okay.
00:09:16,00:09:18,- I didn't see Bruce Willis.
00:09:18,00:09:20,"- Well, it says, amongst the things that you'll find there,"
00:09:20,00:09:22,"there's a ceremonial ax, which is in the corner,"
00:09:22,00:09:26,"so that photos of guests like Bruce Willis and Tom Clancy,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,the-- - I don't know what Tom Clancy looks like.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"- No one does, so that could be--"
00:09:29,00:09:31,- Does he look like a Duke of Edinburgh?
00:09:31,00:09:32,(laughing)
00:09:32,00:09:34,"- That's true, and you've got Facebook, though, so actually--"
00:09:34,00:09:36,"- I would recognize Bruce Willis, perhaps."
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Right.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- If I was stuck next to someone who said,"
00:09:39,00:09:40,"""That's Bruce Willis, yeah."""
00:09:40,00:09:41,(laughing)
00:09:41,00:09:43,"No, I didn't see that, but I wouldn't,"
00:09:43,00:09:44,"you know, there's lots of pictures there."
00:09:44,00:09:45,- Yeah.
00:09:45,00:09:48,- Do they have pictures of their final prisoners?
00:09:48,00:09:51,"'Cause they should do, and actually I didn't read that they did,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"but their last prisoners were the Cray brothers, weren't they?"
00:09:53,00:09:55,"- Oh, were they the very last prisoners?"
00:09:55,00:09:55,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:09:55,00:09:58,"- I think this is so odd, there's such a weird coincidence."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"- Well, it's because of their national service, right?"
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- Yes, no, I know, but it's odd that it's them."
00:10:02,00:10:03,- Yeah.
00:10:03,00:10:04,"- They were famous, right?"
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:10:05,00:10:08,"So this was in 1952 before they were famous,"
00:10:08,00:10:10,and they had just--
00:10:10,00:10:11,- Where are they now?
00:10:11,00:10:14,(laughing)
00:10:14,00:10:16,"- And they'd failed to report for national service,"
00:10:16,00:10:17,"and they'd been on the run for ages,"
00:10:17,00:10:18,and then they'd been caught by a policeman
00:10:18,00:10:20,"who was like, ""You didn't report for national service,"
00:10:20,00:10:21,"""and I think they punched him."""
00:10:21,00:10:23,"- Yeah, but I think their regimen--"
00:10:23,00:10:24,- Was based at the Tower of London.
00:10:24,00:10:25,- Was based at the Tower of London.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"- Yeah, which is bizarre."
00:10:26,00:10:28,"- And Cray brothers, for any overseas listeners,"
00:10:28,00:10:32,they're the very famous mob London gangsters.
00:10:32,00:10:35,"They are Godfather's, basically."
00:10:35,00:10:38,- Made by Tom Hardy and Tom Hardy in that movie.
00:10:38,00:10:39,"- That's right, yes."
00:10:39,00:10:40,- Yeah.
00:10:40,00:10:41,Here's a tenuous link.
00:10:41,00:10:42,You mentioned the Duke of Edinburgh just there.
00:10:42,00:10:43,- I did.
00:10:43,00:10:44,- So the Duke of Wellington--
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Okay.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- I completely different to you.
00:10:46,00:10:47,(laughing)
00:10:47,00:10:48,"So the famous Duke of Wellington,"
00:10:48,00:10:49,"the one who won the Battle of Waterloo,"
00:10:49,00:10:54,he was the Constable of the Tower for 26 years
00:10:54,00:10:55,"after the Battle of Waterloo,"
00:10:55,00:10:56,and he completely changed it.
00:10:56,00:10:58,So he did this huge reform program.
00:10:58,00:11:01,"He stopped people selling their jobs as beef eaters,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"and he drained the moat,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,"'cause lots of people were getting cholera, basically,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,'cause it was so stagnant.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"And he also closed the Royal Menagerie,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,which used to be based at the Tower of London.
00:11:12,00:11:13,- Yeah.
00:11:13,00:11:13,"- And it closed it,"
00:11:13,00:11:16,because people kept being killed by the animals.
00:11:16,00:11:17,- Oh really?
00:11:17,00:11:17,- Really?
00:11:17,00:11:19,- Used to just be allowed into the monkey room.
00:11:19,00:11:20,There were no barriers.
00:11:20,00:11:21,- But the monkeys would eat you.
00:11:21,00:11:22,- But they?
00:11:22,00:11:23,"- Well, they might--"
00:11:23,00:11:24,- They might nibble on you.
00:11:24,00:11:25,"- Well, that's kind of it."
00:11:25,00:11:27,"And account, the account was that a monkey,"
00:11:27,00:11:30,Toriboy's leg quotes in a dangerous manner.
00:11:31,00:11:31,- Wow.
00:11:31,00:11:33,- Yeah.
00:11:33,00:11:34,An assistant keeper accidentally let a lion
00:11:34,00:11:36,"and two tigers into the same room,"
00:11:36,00:11:37,"and they started killing each other,"
00:11:37,00:11:40,the wolves escaped and they ate a terrier.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"Lots of just constant accidents happening,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,'cause there were these wild animals there.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- Wow.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"- And so when that guy came in,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,"that's basically when they count the beef eaters from,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"really, beef eater number one was that guy,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"and then beef eater number two was his mate,"
00:11:51,00:11:52,and then so on and so on.
00:11:52,00:11:55,"They don't really have records for the previous ones,"
00:11:55,00:11:58,because they were so often sold between people.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"But from that guy to the present day,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,"there have been about 400 beef eaters,"
00:12:02,00:12:06,and that is fewer than people who have been in space.
00:12:06,00:12:07,- Wow.
00:12:07,00:12:07,- Wow.
00:12:07,00:12:10,- Have any beef eaters been in space?
00:12:10,00:12:11,- Not to my knowledge.
00:12:11,00:12:13,(laughing)
00:12:13,00:12:14,"So the guy who was the constable,"
00:12:14,00:12:18,"he, historically, was allowed to keep all livestock"
00:12:18,00:12:20,that fell from Tower Bridge into the river.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"So anything that fell from the bridge into the river,"
00:12:23,00:12:24,he was allowed to keep it.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"- Again, that sitcom is gonna be a great episode"
00:12:27,00:12:29,where the constable is trying to push livestock off.
00:12:29,00:12:31,(laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:33,- And for every foot of livestock
00:12:33,00:12:35,"that stumbled into the Tower Moat,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,he received one penny.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"- Quite a lot to retrieve a cow from a moat,"
00:12:39,00:12:40,I would have thought.
00:12:40,00:12:42,I think you've earned it if you do that.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"- Wait, so if a donkey puts one foot into the moat,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,you get one penny.
00:12:45,00:12:47,"- One foot in the moat, it could be the neighborhood"
00:12:47,00:12:47,of the sitcom.
00:12:47,00:12:49,(laughing)
00:12:49,00:12:51,"- I believe that's right, yeah."
00:12:51,00:12:53,"- You mentioned Ravens before,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"the idea that they would be fed beef from,"
00:12:55,00:12:56,"and what was it, an East London--"
00:12:56,00:12:57,- Smithfield Market.
00:12:57,00:12:58,- Smithfield Market.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"- The Tower of London, one of the employees there,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,and I'm not sure if he counts technically
00:13:02,00:13:05,"as a yeoman wardo, but he's the Raven Master."
00:13:05,00:13:07,"- Yes, he is a beef eater."
00:13:07,00:13:10,"- So yeah, so they hire this guy who,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,"his whole family lives there, they have a house,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,and he just has to look after these Ravens
00:13:14,00:13:15,because of an enduring myth
00:13:15,00:13:18,"that if the Ravens left the Tower of London,"
00:13:18,00:13:19,England would fall.
00:13:19,00:13:23,That's basically a ceremonial role just to fulfill
00:13:23,00:13:24,this little men.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"And I've met him, he's a really cool guy."
00:13:26,00:13:27,I've done it and stand up with him.
00:13:27,00:13:28,- We did stand up with him.
00:13:28,00:13:30,"- Yeah, Chris, he was really cool."
00:13:30,00:13:32,- He must have a lot of very relatable stories.
00:13:32,00:13:34,(laughing)
00:13:34,00:13:37,- Did he bring his Ravens?
00:13:37,00:13:39,'Cause Ravens are very good at talking.
00:13:39,00:13:40,- Are they?
00:13:40,00:13:42,"- Yeah, COVIDs are famously the best birds"
00:13:42,00:13:45,"at kind of being able to form almost human sounding like words,"
00:13:45,00:13:46,and they're extremely clever.
00:13:46,00:13:47,- Oh.
00:13:47,00:13:49,- And so he's trained them up to do some quite cool stuff.
00:13:49,00:13:52,- I thought he was getting bigger laughs than I was.
00:13:52,00:13:53,- Random table four.
00:13:53,00:13:54,"- Yes, that's great!"
00:13:54,00:13:55,(laughing)
00:13:55,00:13:56,- Then that's my bed!
00:13:56,00:13:58,(laughing)
00:13:58,00:14:00,"- That was a genuine problem, wasn't it?"
00:14:00,00:14:04,When the Royal Astronomer was stationed
00:14:04,00:14:06,at the Tower of London while they were waiting
00:14:06,00:14:08,for the Greenwich Observatory to be built.
00:14:08,00:14:11,"And this was John Flamste, the first Royal Astronomer."
00:14:11,00:14:12,"And while the Observatory was being built,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,he was trying to do his astronomy at the Tower of London
00:14:15,00:14:17,and the Ravens kept pooing on the telescope.
00:14:17,00:14:20,"And so he said, ""Can you please remove all the Ravens?"""
00:14:20,00:14:22,"And King Charles was going to,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,"I think it was Charles II was going to,"
00:14:23,00:14:26,"and then said, ""Oh no, I've heard that the crown will fall."""
00:14:26,00:14:28,"- But for him, it will have been quite close"
00:14:28,00:14:29,"to the last time the crown fell, right?"
00:14:29,00:14:31,Charles II.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"- Yeah, I suppose it was."
00:14:32,00:14:35,"- So he's just come back, he's just restored the crown."
00:14:35,00:14:37,I can understand why he's worried.
00:14:37,00:14:38,- But he's worried. - That he's worried.
00:14:38,00:14:39,- You're right.
00:14:39,00:14:40,It's totally understandable.
00:14:40,00:14:42,"- Like these days, I think no one seriously expects"
00:14:42,00:14:45,"if the Ravens go, and he's looking to be like he does."
00:14:45,00:14:48,"- Well, this guy would be out of a house and a job."
00:14:48,00:14:49,"Chris, if they can."
00:14:49,00:14:51,"- Well, they do just be able to stand up"
00:14:51,00:14:52,for a career to fall back.
00:14:52,00:14:56,"I should add, it was a night of historical talks."
00:14:56,00:14:57,"He happened to be very funny,"
00:14:57,00:14:59,and it was mainly stand-ups doing it.
00:14:59,00:15:00,His talk was on Jack the Ripper.
00:15:00,00:15:01,"So it was a bit dark, actually."
00:15:01,00:15:03,- Jack do all the Ripper more like.
00:15:03,00:15:04,- Yeah.
00:15:04,00:15:05,- He's in that sweat and crows.
00:15:05,00:15:07,(laughing)
00:15:07,00:15:10,(upbeat music)
00:15:10,00:15:17,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:15:17,00:15:20,My fact is that the economic activity of the Roman Empire
00:15:20,00:15:23,can be measured by studying thousand-year-old ice
00:15:23,00:15:24,in Greenland.
00:15:24,00:15:25,- Wow.
00:15:25,00:15:26,- Wow.
00:15:26,00:15:27,- That's amazing.
00:15:27,00:15:28,- Amazing.
00:15:28,00:15:29,- It's so cool.
00:15:29,00:15:30,"Okay, so it takes a tiny bit of explaining."
00:15:30,00:15:32,"So a group of scientists have released a new study,"
00:15:32,00:15:36,which is all about measuring the Greenland ice sheet.
00:15:36,00:15:38,There's a miles thick ice sheet covering
00:15:38,00:15:39,a huge amount of Greenland.
00:15:39,00:15:43,"And we know when ice forms, because we know how much snow falls"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"and it packs down and it becomes ice,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,and it gradually gets deeper and deeper.
00:15:47,00:15:48,So the scientists have been studying the period
00:15:48,00:15:53,"between 1,100 BC, 3,000 years ago, and 800 AD."
00:15:53,00:15:56,And they've been measuring the chemicals in there.
00:15:56,00:15:58,And one thing we know from that time in history
00:15:58,00:16:00,"is that Rome was making lots of coins,"
00:16:00,00:16:03,"and the production of the coins, the coins were silver,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,"that they produced a lot of lead pollution,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,'cause they were using all which contained lead.
00:16:07,00:16:10,That lead wafted all the way across the world.
00:16:10,00:16:11,It ended up in Greenland.
00:16:11,00:16:14,"It gets rained down, packed into the ice."
00:16:14,00:16:16,"And since 1999, scientists have been measuring"
00:16:16,00:16:21,"the lead level, corresponding with exact years in history,"
00:16:21,00:16:25,"and they can produce documents now showing that, for example,"
00:16:25,00:16:30,"when Rome devalued its currency in 64 AD,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"there was less silver in each coin,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,"so there would have been less lead produced,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,so there's less lead in the ice.
00:16:36,00:16:37,- Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:38,- It's extraordinary. - It's nuts.
00:16:38,00:16:39,- It's really good.
00:16:39,00:16:41,It doesn't help people in ancient Rome
00:16:41,00:16:43,who want to know whether to invest in things.
00:16:43,00:16:44,"- No, it doesn't."
00:16:44,00:16:45,- Sadly.
00:16:45,00:16:47,(laughing)
00:16:47,00:16:49,"- But yeah, they follow, I think they've debunked"
00:16:49,00:16:52,"and thought that when the Roman Republic fell,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"the economy was booming, and they've actually worked out"
00:16:54,00:16:56,"that when it came to the fall of the Republic,"
00:16:56,00:16:59,the lead amounts in the ice actually show
00:16:59,00:17:01,that it was undergoing a bit of a recession.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"And stuff like when Rome took Carthage,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"they got all the Carthaginian mines,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"so suddenly they were mining a hell of a lot more silver,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,and you can see that exact year
00:17:09,00:17:11,of the Carthaginian invasion from looking at the ice.
00:17:11,00:17:15,- How far away is a distance that we're talking here
00:17:15,00:17:17,from the mines to the ice?
00:17:17,00:17:17,- It's thousands of miles.
00:17:17,00:17:18,- Thousands of miles.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"It just shows you how strong wind is, doesn't it?"
00:17:21,00:17:22,- That's my main takeaway.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"- Well, I just, if you think about it, no."
00:17:24,00:17:25,- I tell you what's weird.
00:17:25,00:17:28,The prevailing wind in the world
00:17:28,00:17:32,goes from Greenland to the east because of the jet stream.
00:17:32,00:17:34,So how is it going?
00:17:34,00:17:35,It must be going all the way around the world.
00:17:35,00:17:36,- All the way around the world.
00:17:36,00:17:37,"- I don't know about that, by the way."
00:17:37,00:17:38,- Wow.
00:17:38,00:17:39,"- It makes sense, right?"
00:17:39,00:17:40,"- But it's like, you know how as well,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,how there are sheep in whales
00:17:43,00:17:46,that have been affected by the Chernobyl radiation.
00:17:46,00:17:47,Like that's carried through the wind.
00:17:47,00:17:48,- That is the lake district.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"- And the lake district is just winders, you know."
00:17:51,00:17:55,- And that got there even faster than this 2000 years.
00:17:55,00:17:59,"- Wait a minute though, Chernobyl also to the east"
00:17:59,00:18:00,"of the lake districts and whales,"
00:18:00,00:18:02,but that didn't go all the way around the world.
00:18:02,00:18:04,So maybe my jet stream theory.
00:18:04,00:18:07,- It feels like wind might be more complicated
00:18:07,00:18:10,than just the one big gust going around the world.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- Thank you so much.
00:18:11,00:18:13,- It might be a couple of different directions.
00:18:13,00:18:15,- I think this is very powerful flat earth evidence.
00:18:15,00:18:16,- Yes.
00:18:16,00:18:20,- I'll probably be shouting down in the comments about this.
00:18:20,00:18:21,- One explanation for it going the wrong way
00:18:21,00:18:23,"is as one person pointed out,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,"this is the hypothesis at the moment,"
00:18:26,00:18:27,"but for instance, it ignores the fact"
00:18:27,00:18:30,that China existed and was doing quite well
00:18:30,00:18:31,around that time.
00:18:31,00:18:32,- I think Western scientists and historians
00:18:32,00:18:34,always have a tendency to do.
00:18:34,00:18:35,And it could well be that China was just producing
00:18:35,00:18:38,massive amounts of silver or lead or whatever
00:18:38,00:18:39,that was influencing it.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"- But we don't know, but it could be that"
00:18:42,00:18:44,something was coming from the east to affect it.
00:18:44,00:18:46,- But it does seem to fit in with these things in Rome.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- Yeah.
00:18:47,00:18:49,"- So for instance, there was a plague,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"the Antonin plague, which they think,"
00:18:51,00:18:52,"they're not sure what caused it,"
00:18:52,00:18:53,but lots of people died.
00:18:53,00:18:54,It might have been smallpox.
00:18:54,00:18:56,It might even have been Ebola.
00:18:56,00:19:00,"And this was in between 250 and 262,"
00:19:00,00:19:03,"when 5,000 people a day were said to be dying."
00:19:03,00:19:05,And the amount of lead being produced then
00:19:05,00:19:06,obviously went down because people
00:19:06,00:19:10,had more pressing things on their minds.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"But they assumed 250 AD, who was it?"
00:19:13,00:19:14,Christians.
00:19:14,00:19:17,Assumed it was to do the Christians.
00:19:17,00:19:19,And so they basically sought out as many scapegoats
00:19:19,00:19:21,as they could and they kind of executed
00:19:21,00:19:23,a load of clergy and stuff like that.
00:19:23,00:19:24,- Wow.
00:19:24,00:19:25,- Did it work?
00:19:25,00:19:27,- Did it work?
00:19:27,00:19:29,"- Well, we no longer have Christianity."
00:19:29,00:19:32,(laughing)
00:19:32,00:19:35,"- On that, a lot of people think"
00:19:35,00:19:38,"because it was so persecuted during this plague,"
00:19:38,00:19:42,that kind of made Christianity a lot more solid
00:19:42,00:19:43,as a religion.
00:19:43,00:19:45,And that's kind of one of the main things
00:19:45,00:19:47,that made it such a worldwide religion in the end.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- Wow.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"- There you go, bully someone and make them stronger."
00:19:50,00:19:51,- Yes.
00:19:51,00:19:53,"No, don't bully someone."
00:19:53,00:19:54,"No, don't bully someone."
00:19:54,00:19:57,"But if you are being bullied, you'll come out of it stronger."
00:19:57,00:19:58,- Okay.
00:19:58,00:19:58,- Is that right?
00:19:58,00:20:00,- That's a healthier message here.
00:20:00,00:20:05,"- So just quickly on this whole Greenland ice-led thing,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,have you guys heard of Claire Patterson?
00:20:07,00:20:09,(laughing)
00:20:09,00:20:11,"Does she, is she the Venn diagram?"
00:20:11,00:20:12,- She is.
00:20:12,00:20:13,- All those words.
00:20:13,00:20:16,(laughing)
00:20:16,00:20:16,- She's a he actually.
00:20:16,00:20:17,He was a scientist.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"- Ah, he was an amazing guy."
00:20:18,00:20:19,I wish we could do a whole podcast on him.
00:20:19,00:20:21,He was trying to find out how all the universe was
00:20:21,00:20:23,in the 1950s.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"Okay, so that involves calculating"
00:20:25,00:20:27,how fast uranium decays.
00:20:27,00:20:29,But he found massive lead contamination
00:20:29,00:20:30,everywhere he went.
00:20:30,00:20:31,And it drove him mad.
00:20:31,00:20:33,There was all this lead showing up
00:20:33,00:20:34,that shouldn't have been there.
00:20:34,00:20:35,He tried and tried and tried to build
00:20:35,00:20:38,"this incredibly lead-free lamp, basically."
00:20:38,00:20:39,He scrubbed everything.
00:20:39,00:20:41,He cleaned everything for years.
00:20:41,00:20:44,He founded basically the first ever clean laboratory.
00:20:44,00:20:49,And he proved that lead in petrol was bad.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"And that was, he-"
00:20:50,00:20:50,"- Ah, I saw him."
00:20:50,00:20:53,"- Yeah, he was the guy who demonstrated later in his career"
00:20:53,00:20:56,that modern Americans had 600 times as much lead
00:20:56,00:20:58,in their bodies as ancient Egyptians.
00:20:58,00:20:58,- Wow.
00:20:58,00:21:00,- All thanks to lead-ed petrol.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"Yeah, and so as part of this research,"
00:21:02,00:21:05,he went to remote spots in Greenland and Antarctica
00:21:05,00:21:07,and measured the lead much further down.
00:21:07,00:21:10,So this is one of the stories of the last two millennia
00:21:10,00:21:13,is massively increasing amounts of lead.
00:21:13,00:21:16,And that lead to all these efforts lead
00:21:16,00:21:18,"to all the efforts to cut lead out of petrol, for example."
00:21:18,00:21:19,- Really?
00:21:19,00:21:20,- Yeah.
00:21:20,00:21:21,- Because the person who invented putting lead in petrol
00:21:21,00:21:23,was Thomas Midgeley.
00:21:23,00:21:24,And that was a really good invention
00:21:24,00:21:26,'cause it stopped knocking and engines.
00:21:26,00:21:27,- Right.
00:21:27,00:21:28,"- But when it first happened, everyone thought,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"this is an amazing, oh, just putting lead in there"
00:21:30,00:21:32,that solves this massive problem.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"- Yeah, these to be all these little explosions"
00:21:33,00:21:36,and the car engine basically is when you put kerosene in.
00:21:36,00:21:38,"- Okay, and that's knocking."
00:21:38,00:21:39,- And there's good knocking.
00:21:39,00:21:40,And they try hundreds of different experiments
00:21:40,00:21:43,and chemicals to try and get rid of the knock.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"And once it did, that was huge."
00:21:45,00:21:46,It made cars a real thing.
00:21:46,00:21:48,(laughing)
00:21:48,00:21:49,- Wow.
00:21:49,00:21:50,This guy sounds awesome.
00:21:50,00:21:51,"- Yeah, he does."
00:21:51,00:21:52,- It was very bad for you.
00:21:52,00:21:53,"We should say, lead is bad."
00:21:53,00:21:54,- Lead is bad.
00:21:54,00:21:55,"- Well, isn't it true?"
00:21:55,00:21:58,"That the, a lot of people put the fall of the Roman Empire"
00:21:58,00:22:01,down to lead in the pipes.
00:22:01,00:22:02,- I pointed it out.
00:22:02,00:22:03,- The plumbing was that.
00:22:03,00:22:04,"- Yeah, the plumbing was made of lead."
00:22:04,00:22:05,And so they were lead poisoned
00:22:05,00:22:09,and that supposedly killed off a lot of the rich people.
00:22:09,00:22:10,- Don't know if that's true.
00:22:10,00:22:11,"- Well, I've heard, so Roman miners,"
00:22:11,00:22:12,they knew that lead was bad
00:22:12,00:22:13,'cause they shielded themselves
00:22:13,00:22:17,by covering their mouths with animal blood as incidentally.
00:22:17,00:22:18,"So a lot of people knew that lead was bad for you,"
00:22:18,00:22:22,but they still kept the pipes being out of lead.
00:22:22,00:22:23,"I think some people said, even at the time,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,are we sure about this lead stuff?
00:22:25,00:22:26,"- Yeah, right."
00:22:26,00:22:27,"- Everyone said no, no, no, it's fine."
00:22:27,00:22:30,"- Would people at the time have died a sort of,"
00:22:30,00:22:31,they would have just slowly got ill
00:22:31,00:22:32,"and it would have looked like,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"oh, you've got a flu and then it,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,or would it be instant lead lead?
00:22:36,00:22:37,- Not sure what sentence of lead poisoning.
00:22:37,00:22:37,"- Oh, yeah."
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- Then you go a bit mad, didn't you?"
00:22:39,00:22:40,- I just wonder how long it would take
00:22:40,00:22:43,"if someone, sinister, had re-plumbed."
00:22:43,00:22:44,- Rudolf Hess for instance.
00:22:44,00:22:47,- Rudolf Hess re-plumbed the city of London
00:22:47,00:22:48,with lead piping.
00:22:48,00:22:49,(all laughing)
00:22:49,00:22:50,- Wow.
00:22:50,00:22:52,Super bellied blood.
00:22:52,00:22:53,- It's a subtly trade.
00:22:53,00:22:54,- Sutterly.
00:22:54,00:22:55,- Every single one.
00:22:55,00:22:57,- How long must be better ways?
00:22:57,00:22:58,- But how long before we would notice it?
00:22:58,00:23:01,- Just the fat bugs alone in the ice.
00:23:01,00:23:02,- It can be done.
00:23:02,00:23:04,- A supervillain that rises to prominence
00:23:04,00:23:06,"in Thames water, right?"
00:23:06,00:23:06,- Yes.
00:23:06,00:23:09,- And slowly start saying all the replacement pipes
00:23:09,00:23:11,"have lead in them and then 40 years like,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,"no, it's really weird."
00:23:12,00:23:14,Your body thinks that lead is calcium.
00:23:14,00:23:16,"It mistakes the two, chemically."
00:23:16,00:23:18,And it absolutely shreds you on the inside.
00:23:18,00:23:20,It gets in the way of all your neurotransmitters
00:23:20,00:23:22,and sends them crazy.
00:23:22,00:23:23,It weakens the blood brain barrier
00:23:23,00:23:24,"so you're more vulnerable to,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,it has about 30 different horrible effects on your body.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"- Well, so your body tries to do the same stuff with it"
00:23:29,00:23:31,"as it does with calcium, like build your nails"
00:23:31,00:23:32,and things like that.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"- Yeah, do you have bones made of lead?"
00:23:34,00:23:36,- I start drawing with our fingers.
00:23:36,00:23:38,(all laughing)
00:23:38,00:23:39,- There's no lead in pencil stuff.
00:23:39,00:23:41,"- Okay, I'm not sure."
00:23:41,00:23:42,I don't know.
00:23:42,00:23:44,"I don't know the full details, anyway."
00:23:44,00:23:45,- It wouldn't be super efficient though.
00:23:45,00:23:48,You couldn't guarantee to wipe everyone out.
00:23:48,00:23:50,- What an infrastructure-based bond movie
00:23:50,00:23:52,that would be over a period of several decades.
00:23:52,00:23:54,- I just wonder what point would someone know?
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Like, hang on, I think what London is suffering from"
00:23:56,00:23:58,is everyone's being poisoned by lead.
00:23:58,00:24:00,"- I'm looking forward to this movie called ""led finger."""
00:24:00,00:24:02,(all laughing)
00:24:02,00:24:03,"He does all this in London,"
00:24:03,00:24:05,but also can write things when it's bigger.
00:24:05,00:24:07,(all laughing)
00:24:07,00:24:12,- I have a few things about great things found in ice.
00:24:12,00:24:18,"So in Southern Yukon, they have had ice melting recently"
00:24:18,00:24:21,and there's a big patch that's melted
00:24:21,00:24:23,"and underneath it, they found all this caribou dung"
00:24:23,00:24:25,that's been sitting there held in the ice.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"Now, what's interesting is there is no caribou"
00:24:28,00:24:31,"that exists in Southern Yukon, but what it's done"
00:24:31,00:24:34,is it's confirmed one of the oldest oral history stories
00:24:34,00:24:36,"that have passed down from the First Nations people,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,"as it says in the article,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,the First Nations people of the area
00:24:40,00:24:43,who claimed that the land used to be roamed by caribou.
00:24:43,00:24:44,So they did these tests on it
00:24:44,00:24:47,"and they've discovered that some of them are hundreds of years old,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,"the dunks, some are thousands of years old."
00:24:49,00:24:51,So an oral history that's made it all the way through
00:24:51,00:24:53,that was thought to be wrong has been confirmed.
00:24:53,00:24:54,- Yeah.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"Frozen deer in ice are actually a bit of a problem now though,"
00:24:57,00:24:58,aren't they?
00:24:58,00:25:00,"So there was that thing last year, I think,"
00:25:00,00:25:03,which was about the permafrost melting in Siberia
00:25:03,00:25:05,"and when the permafrost melts, then it starts to explode"
00:25:05,00:25:06,"and this is because of global warming,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,it exposes the dead bodies of things
00:25:08,00:25:09,that have died of bad diseases.
00:25:09,00:25:14,And I think it exposed a reindeer who had anthrax poisoning
00:25:15,00:25:18,"and it had anthrax poisoning in 1895,"
00:25:18,00:25:20,but it released the anthrax back into the atmosphere
00:25:20,00:25:22,and I think someone died of anthrax poisoning actually.
00:25:22,00:25:23,- Really?
00:25:23,00:25:24,"- Yeah, and now scientists are saying that, you know,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,it's as it melts in global warming advances on us
00:25:27,00:25:29,"and it's going to release all sorts of old stuff,"
00:25:29,00:25:31,like bubonic plague is going to...
00:25:31,00:25:32,- I've heard smallpox.
00:25:32,00:25:33,- I've heard smallpox.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"- I've heard smallpox is going to come back, yeah."
00:25:34,00:25:36,"- It's a good sequel for your movie, Dan."
00:25:36,00:25:37,- Yes.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"- Next movie, ""The Super Villain Mooster Siberia"""
00:25:39,00:25:41,with a hair dryer.
00:25:41,00:25:43,(laughing)
00:25:43,00:25:46,"- No, come on, just hair dryer in the world."
00:25:46,00:25:49,"- No, he comes back here selling ice cubes"
00:25:49,00:25:51,to everyone in London.
00:25:51,00:25:54,"They melt in the house, and everyone dies"
00:25:54,00:25:55,when they have a cup of water on us.
00:25:55,00:25:57,- Why do all these films set only in London?
00:25:57,00:25:58,(laughing)
00:25:58,00:26:00,"- 'Cause he's James Bond, he's British, yeah."
00:26:00,00:26:01,- Yeah.
00:26:01,00:26:02,"- I really like this fact, okay,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,because it's sort of a historical thing
00:26:05,00:26:07,being revealed by science and it's kind of an exciting
00:26:07,00:26:10,crossing of those two academic worlds
00:26:10,00:26:12,"and something quite similar to that,"
00:26:12,00:26:14,was you know the saddle worth more fires this year.
00:26:14,00:26:15,- Yep.
00:26:15,00:26:17,- So that was in the Manchester area obviously.
00:26:17,00:26:21,One side effect of those fires is that it's going to release
00:26:21,00:26:25,all of this long lost pollutant from the industrial revolution
00:26:25,00:26:27,"because it's, I know it's exciting."
00:26:27,00:26:28,(laughing)
00:26:28,00:26:30,We're all going to die in some way.
00:26:30,00:26:32,- I noticed the people in North Manchester.
00:26:32,00:26:33,- Yeah.
00:26:33,00:26:34,- Just my family really.
00:26:34,00:26:37,"- Yeah, I'm really sorry about that, you should give them a call."
00:26:37,00:26:39,But the reason for this is that the peat
00:26:39,00:26:40,is an unbelievably good store.
00:26:40,00:26:43,So you know people talk about peat being a really good carbon store.
00:26:43,00:26:45,So it holds it for hundreds of years.
00:26:45,00:26:47,It's also a good store of other substances and pollutants.
00:26:47,00:26:49,And then the fires just set fire to it all
00:26:49,00:26:50,and release them all into the air.
00:26:50,00:26:53,So we're getting to now inhale that deliciously
00:26:53,00:26:55,smoggy stuff that the Victorians are doing.
00:26:55,00:26:57,"- I want to kind of rain down, I guess, right?"
00:26:57,00:26:58,- I don't think you'll be able to see
00:26:58,00:27:01,sort of bits of 19th century coal falling out of the sky.
00:27:01,00:27:02,- What?
00:27:02,00:27:03,"- I mean, sometimes you get that."
00:27:03,00:27:06,"- Don't you like when it's been, like it picks up sand"
00:27:06,00:27:08,from the Sahara and it rains down in--
00:27:08,00:27:09,"- Yeah, might get a bit more smoggy."
00:27:09,00:27:11,"But you won't be able to tell it's 19th century coal,"
00:27:11,00:27:14,particularly there won't be a top hat raining down
00:27:14,00:27:16,with it or a pipe.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"Hey, that could be the third film you're trying to do then."
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Yes.
00:27:19,00:27:20,- Peat finger.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"- Peat finger, yeah."
00:27:21,00:27:24,"No, he's a sex offender from a nutshell, I think."
00:27:24,00:27:25,- Yeah.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"- No, this, you would need the villain"
00:27:27,00:27:31,to create a gust of wind that sends all the peat
00:27:31,00:27:35,"from Manchester to London, but could we do this"
00:27:35,00:27:37,with his giant hairdryer?
00:27:37,00:27:38,"- Yes, okay, so all right."
00:27:38,00:27:40,So the villain of the second film we survived
00:27:40,00:27:41,into the third.
00:27:41,00:27:44,- 'Cause last week we did mention that they're looking
00:27:44,00:27:46,for a new director of the Bond films.
00:27:46,00:27:47,(laughing)
00:27:47,00:27:50,I think we're only cementing our pledge to become that.
00:27:50,00:27:52,(laughing)
00:27:52,00:27:54,(upbeat music)
00:27:54,00:28:00,"- Time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:28:00,00:28:04,My fact this week is that the umlauts that are used
00:28:04,00:28:07,for the band Motley Crew are purely decorative.
00:28:07,00:28:10,They're not intended to have pronunciation.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"However, when Motley Crew first performed in Germany,"
00:28:13,00:28:15,"the crowd didn't know that and chanted,"
00:28:15,00:28:16,"""Motley Krug!"""
00:28:16,00:28:17,"""Motley Krug!"""
00:28:17,00:28:19,(laughing)
00:28:19,00:28:20,- This is fantastic.
00:28:20,00:28:24,Now this was tweeted by Quikipedia a couple of days ago
00:28:24,00:28:29,"since we recorded, and we needed proper verification on it,"
00:28:29,00:28:34,"and we got it from Tommy Lee, the drummer of Motley Crew"
00:28:34,00:28:37,"or Motley Krug, who said, ""Ha ha, Tra!"""
00:28:37,00:28:41,"Nick, to someone who asked him on behalf of us."
00:28:41,00:28:43,"So yeah, we've got confirmation,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"yeah, that they were Motley Krug."
00:28:45,00:28:46,It's very exciting 'cause the metal umlaut
00:28:46,00:28:47,is purely decorative.
00:28:47,00:28:50,Motohead had it as well.
00:28:50,00:28:55,"Maximo Park, Maximo Park, and yeah, so that's very,"
00:28:55,00:28:56,very exciting.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"It's a proper verification from a real source,"
00:29:00,00:29:01,which is also awesome.
00:29:01,00:29:03,I was looking into Tommy Lee if you don't know who he is.
00:29:03,00:29:04,So he is a drummer of Motley Crew.
00:29:04,00:29:06,- He's married to Pamela Anderson.
00:29:06,00:29:09,Responsible for the leaked porn video as well.
00:29:09,00:29:13,"I don't know if he leaked it, but famously her porn video,"
00:29:13,00:29:14,"there are two, he is one."
00:29:14,00:29:16,"- Oh, this is a real trip down memory lane."
00:29:16,00:29:17,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:29:17,00:29:20,- She is a first celebrity story of the world.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"- You were the boom operator for that film, didn't you?"
00:29:22,00:29:27,- I thought of about 15 years that Tommy Lee
00:29:27,00:29:28,was the same person as Tommy Lee Jones.
00:29:28,00:29:29,"- Yeah, and then I used to watch men in black"
00:29:29,00:29:31,"and be like, ""I can't believe this guy."""
00:29:31,00:29:33,"- With family, yeah."
00:29:33,00:29:35,"- He does have a surname, Tommy Lee."
00:29:35,00:29:37,But he doesn't use it.
00:29:37,00:29:39,And I only just learnt it before we started recording.
00:29:39,00:29:40,It's bass.
00:29:40,00:29:42,And I reckon he doesn't use it because he's the drummer.
00:29:42,00:29:45,So that would have just been confusing.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"- Very, yeah."
00:29:46,00:29:48,"Whereas just shoving umla, it was left right in center"
00:29:48,00:29:50,that all the first three pronounce is absolutely fine.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"- So it's just a convention in metal bands, right?"
00:29:53,00:29:54,"- Well, I guess not just metal bands,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,'cause I just learnt as well that JZ used to have
00:29:56,00:29:58,an umla in his name.
00:29:58,00:29:58,- What?
00:29:58,00:30:02,"- Yeah, he over, I guess, well, he doesn't specify."
00:30:02,00:30:03,He just said I used to have an umla.
00:30:03,00:30:06,And he uses punctuation quite oddly.
00:30:06,00:30:07,He had a hyphen to begin with.
00:30:07,00:30:09,He got rid of the hyphen.
00:30:09,00:30:10,His latest album came back.
00:30:10,00:30:11,"He not only came back with a hyphen,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,but in all caps as well.
00:30:13,00:30:15,So JZ is now shouting at you.
00:30:15,00:30:19,And he admitted that he used to have an umla out there.
00:30:19,00:30:21,- Do you know I think we should have an umla out in our name?
00:30:21,00:30:22,Or maybe some kind of punctuation?
00:30:22,00:30:23,- I think we definitely.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"It seems like a supply way to make yourself sound hard, basically."
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- No, no, such thing as a fish."
00:30:27,00:30:29,"- No, 'cause then we sound like we're from Yorkshire."
00:30:29,00:30:31,(laughing)
00:30:31,00:30:33,- There's no such thing as a fish.
00:30:33,00:30:35,(laughing)
00:30:35,00:30:37,- It's fine line between heavy metal and Yorkshire.
00:30:37,00:30:39,(laughing)
00:30:39,00:30:41,- Has JZ ever done an autobiography?
00:30:41,00:30:41,"- He has, yeah."
00:30:41,00:30:43,Is it called J2Z?
00:30:43,00:30:44,(laughing)
00:30:44,00:30:46,"- It's not, and it should be, why is it not?"
00:30:46,00:30:48,And I'm pretty sure it is an A to Z as well.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"- You're kidding, yeah?"
00:30:49,00:30:50,- No.
00:30:50,00:30:50,- No.
00:30:50,00:30:51,- I'm pretty sure.
00:30:51,00:30:53,- And who does a A to Z of their art and biography?
00:30:53,00:30:54,- It's quite a fun idea.
00:30:54,00:30:55,- Matt Lucas did it.
00:30:55,00:30:56,We should write an A to Z book.
00:30:56,00:30:59,"- Yeah, but you do have some B is Bond,"
00:30:59,00:31:00,but what do you do before that?
00:31:00,00:31:02,- Oh yeah.
00:31:02,00:31:03,"Antenatal, I guess."
00:31:03,00:31:04,- Nice.
00:31:04,00:31:05,- Yeah.
00:31:05,00:31:07,- It's not as good as the movie ideas.
00:31:07,00:31:08,- Interesting.
00:31:08,00:31:09,(laughing)
00:31:09,00:31:10,- Stick to another sequel of those.
00:31:10,00:31:13,"- So on the metal um-lout,"
00:31:13,00:31:16,the first band to have a num-lout was called
00:31:16,00:31:19,"Amon Dual, the second, that's A, M, O, N, D,"
00:31:19,00:31:23,"U, um-lout, U, um-lout, L, and then two eyes."
00:31:23,00:31:26,But that is fair enough because dual is a Turkish word
00:31:26,00:31:27,which has um-louts in it.
00:31:27,00:31:28,- Oh.
00:31:28,00:31:30,- And the first band to give itself a spurious
00:31:30,00:31:32,on-lout was Blue Eister cult.
00:31:32,00:31:33,- Oh yeah.
00:31:33,00:31:34,"- Oh, of course."
00:31:34,00:31:35,"- Yes, yeah."
00:31:35,00:31:36,- Over which?
00:31:36,00:31:37,- Lesson.
00:31:37,00:31:38,- Over the O in Eister.
00:31:38,00:31:39,- Mmm.
00:31:39,00:31:40,- Mmm.
00:31:40,00:31:44,- And the longest continuous um-louted word
00:31:44,00:31:49,"in the world is Ya, so J-A-A-A,"
00:31:49,00:31:53,all of which have um-louts above are.
00:31:53,00:31:56,It's Estonian and it means the edge of the ice.
00:31:56,00:31:57,"So when you get to the edge of the ice,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,- Yeah.
00:31:58,00:32:01,"- Oh, that was good."
00:32:01,00:32:02,"- So yeah, punctuation."
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:07,"- So, I think we've covered before the intera bang,"
00:32:07,00:32:10,"maybe on QI, which was that was something"
00:32:10,00:32:12,"that actually appeared on typewriters in the '60s,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,which was a question mark and an exclamation mark
00:32:14,00:32:17,"that were elided, which means you're asking a question,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,"but like, oh, we're going to the cinema today"
00:32:19,00:32:21,in a really excited way.
00:32:21,00:32:22,I had a really sad childhood.
00:32:22,00:32:25,I was the one who kind of think they got me excited.
00:32:25,00:32:27,But another thing that the language has always been
00:32:27,00:32:30,"hunting for is ways to show irony, right?"
00:32:30,00:32:34,So people have always been trying to invent bits of punctuation
00:32:34,00:32:36,that show you're being sarcastic.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"And actually, the first person who suggested a way of doing that"
00:32:38,00:32:40,was a guy called John Wilkins.
00:32:40,00:32:42,And do you remember John Wilkins?
00:32:42,00:32:42,"- Nope, no."
00:32:42,00:32:45,- He is the guy who also was the first person
00:32:45,00:32:48,to plan to put a man on the moon and design a rocket
00:32:48,00:32:49,"for it, Oliver Cromwell's brother."
00:32:49,00:32:50,- Yes.
00:32:50,00:32:52,- So was he suggesting that ironically?
00:32:52,00:32:54,- It was a one big joke.
00:32:54,00:32:55,(laughing)
00:32:55,00:32:56,Out of hand.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"Yeah, his main thing was he wrote this huge book"
00:32:58,00:32:59,on how to change the language.
00:32:59,00:33:02,And he said he should have an upside down exclamation mark
00:33:02,00:33:03,to show irony.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"- Well, they call that the sarc mark, don't they?"
00:33:05,00:33:06,"- They do, yes."
00:33:06,00:33:08,"- It's the sarcasm, yes."
00:33:08,00:33:11,- Just on another symbol that didn't kick off.
00:33:11,00:33:15,"I read this fact, and it's hard actually to verify it."
00:33:15,00:33:17,So it'd be interested to know if anyone can get
00:33:17,00:33:19,"to the bottom of this, but Hagrid Hawkes,"
00:33:19,00:33:22,"who's a fantastic Twitter account and has a few books,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"he put this up saying that in 1580,"
00:33:25,00:33:27,"English printer Henry Denham,"
00:33:27,00:33:29,"proposed using a reverse question mark,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,so a sort of mirror-imaged question mark
00:33:32,00:33:34,"to indicate when a question was rhetorical,"
00:33:34,00:33:38,which would be very useful if you were an author.
00:33:38,00:33:39,- Would it?
00:33:39,00:33:40,"- Yeah, it would."
00:33:40,00:33:40,"- No, no, no."
00:33:40,00:33:43,(laughing)
00:33:43,00:33:47,"- So we think that this might,"
00:33:47,00:33:48,"we're not sure if this is true, right?"
00:33:48,00:33:51,"Because we've not found anything earlier than the 1990s,"
00:33:51,00:33:55,"of evidence for it, although Denham,"
00:33:55,00:33:58,he did invent two different types of question mark.
00:33:58,00:34:00,"One for yes, no questions,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"and another one for questions that begin with WH,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,like why were what?
00:34:04,00:34:06,So he had two different questions marks for those.
00:34:06,00:34:08,- What was that for?
00:34:08,00:34:09,Why do you need a special question mark
00:34:09,00:34:11,to let you know the question begins with WH?
00:34:11,00:34:12,'Cause--
00:34:12,00:34:13,"- In case it's been such a long sentence,"
00:34:13,00:34:15,you can't remember the word of the handle.
00:34:15,00:34:18,- I think the reason that we don't still have them
00:34:18,00:34:20,is because they're not that useful.
00:34:20,00:34:23,But he was the first person also to use semi-colons
00:34:23,00:34:24,with any kind of regularity.
00:34:24,00:34:25,"He didn't invent them,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,but he was the first one to use them regularly.
00:34:27,00:34:28,- Nice.
00:34:28,00:34:30,- And consistently.
00:34:30,00:34:34,He also invented the word parathesis for brackets
00:34:34,00:34:35,which later became parentheses.
00:34:35,00:34:36,"- Oh, wow."
00:34:36,00:34:37,"- Oh, he had a huge influence."
00:34:37,00:34:41,"- Yeah, so he was a massive kind of punctuation, dude."
00:34:41,00:34:44,But huge in that world amongst all the greats.
00:34:44,00:34:46,"- Well, semi-colons, I didn't realize,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"some people really hate semi-colons, basically."
00:34:48,00:34:50,"So George Orwell, he hated them so much"
00:34:50,00:34:53,"then he wrote a novel called ""Coming Up for Air"""
00:34:53,00:34:54,"is one of his early ones, I think,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,and he put no semi-colons in.
00:34:56,00:34:58,But then he was a bit worried that no one would notice
00:34:58,00:34:59,that he hadn't put any in.
00:34:59,00:35:01,"So he wrote to his publisher, saying,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"""I haven't put any semi-colons in here."""
00:35:03,00:35:04,(laughing)
00:35:04,00:35:05,"Oh, man."
00:35:05,00:35:06,- So childish.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"- I know, one of the great writers."
00:35:08,00:35:09,- Yeah.
00:35:09,00:35:10,"- Hemingway as well, very much."
00:35:10,00:35:13,So played with the rules of punctuation.
00:35:13,00:35:16,But he only did so with the claim that he knew it's so well
00:35:16,00:35:19,that he was able to go beyond the acceptable rules.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- I think that's quite normal.
00:35:20,00:35:21,- Yeah.
00:35:21,00:35:22,"- I think that's quite standard, I would say people,"
00:35:22,00:35:25,"like Hillary Mantell and Rachel Cusk do that,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,but it's because you can feel they've got such a good grasp of it
00:35:28,00:35:31,that they're mastering it rather than just spewing nonsense
00:35:31,00:35:33,"onto a page and then going,"
00:35:33,00:35:35,"""Oh yeah, it's just so familiar with the art."""
00:35:35,00:35:36,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:35:36,00:35:38,So William Blake would sometimes put a full stop
00:35:38,00:35:39,in the middle of a word.
00:35:39,00:35:40,(laughing)
00:35:40,00:35:42,- What a maverick.
00:35:42,00:35:43,(laughing)
00:35:43,00:35:47,Is that because it was to be read and he wanted the punctuation
00:35:47,00:35:48,of a word to be broken up?
00:35:48,00:35:50,"- I don't know, he also saw a lot of angels."
00:35:50,00:35:54,"So, it might have been taking dictation from them."
00:35:54,00:35:58,"- Guys, the punctuation point I need all the time"
00:35:58,00:35:59,is a question mark colon.
00:35:59,00:36:01,And I can't believe this isn't a thing.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"When you're writing an email and you're like,"
00:36:03,00:36:04,"""What about these points?"""
00:36:04,00:36:06,And then you give a list and I always put a question mark
00:36:06,00:36:09,followed by a colon and it looks stupid.
00:36:09,00:36:12,"It's, I think that's the most essential piece of punctuation"
00:36:12,00:36:14,and no one's ever come up with one as far as I know.
00:36:14,00:36:16,"- Yeah, so how are we gonna fix it?"
00:36:16,00:36:18,- Is it a question mark with two dots at the bottom?
00:36:18,00:36:20,"- Sideways, I'm allowed to at the bottom."
00:36:20,00:36:22,I have a second dot underneath the first dot.
00:36:22,00:36:24,So it's a way to start.
00:36:24,00:36:26,"- Sideways, yeah, right."
00:36:26,00:36:27,- What about a second dot in the middle
00:36:27,00:36:29,of the round bit of the question mark?
00:36:29,00:36:30,Like an eyeball.
00:36:30,00:36:32,- Like an eyeball.
00:36:32,00:36:33,- Or a nipple?
00:36:33,00:36:36,Let's make the question mark a bit sexy.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"- I think dots at the bottom makes more sense, doesn't it?"
00:36:38,00:36:40,- We could call them question knocks.
00:36:40,00:36:41,"- Okay, no."
00:36:41,00:36:42,- Oh god.
00:36:42,00:36:43,- Let's just send it.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"That's actually being called a high brow point initially, I feel."
00:36:45,00:36:48,(laughing)
00:36:48,00:36:50,(upbeat music)
00:36:50,00:36:55,"- Okay, it's time for our final step to the show"
00:36:55,00:36:57,and that is Chazinski.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"- My fact this week is that traditionally,"
00:36:59,00:37:02,indigenous Hawaiians had personalized chance
00:37:02,00:37:03,for their genitals.
00:37:03,00:37:06,- That's unusual to be Hawaiians.
00:37:06,00:37:09,(laughing)
00:37:09,00:37:12,- This is so amazing.
00:37:12,00:37:14,All of this stuff about indigenous Hawaiians
00:37:14,00:37:17,"and the what they associated with their genitals,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,which I spent a lot of time reading about this week.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"But I should say, I read it initially on the BBC"
00:37:21,00:37:22,of such a cheat.
00:37:22,00:37:25,It was a series of amazing sex facts from around the world
00:37:25,00:37:27,and I saw that and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard it.
00:37:27,00:37:28,- That's not a cheat.
00:37:28,00:37:30,"- This, is that not a cheat?"
00:37:30,00:37:30,- No.
00:37:30,00:37:32,- I felt like a cheat.
00:37:32,00:37:34,- You're not allowed to get your facts from anywhere.
00:37:34,00:37:36,- I actually went to Hawaii to try and find something.
00:37:36,00:37:38,I didn't find anything.
00:37:38,00:37:39,"- I went to Hawaii, you stood in the air pot"
00:37:39,00:37:41,and did a chance about my genitals.
00:37:41,00:37:42,(laughing)
00:37:42,00:37:44,- Not allowed back in the United States.
00:37:44,00:37:46,(laughing)
00:37:46,00:37:49,This started being recorded from the 18th century
00:37:49,00:37:52,when cook and others went to Hawaii
00:37:52,00:37:55,"and yeah, it turns out that indigenous Hawaiians"
00:37:55,00:37:57,would give their genitals a name
00:37:57,00:37:58,or their parents would give their genitals a name
00:37:58,00:38:00,almost as soon as they were born
00:38:00,00:38:03,"and they'd also design, they'd also write a song for them"
00:38:03,00:38:06,and sort of have a story around their genitals
00:38:06,00:38:09,"and it's called the Mille Mai, the genital chant"
00:38:09,00:38:11,and it describes that individual's organ.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"- So you had to, sorry, you had to name your child"
00:38:13,00:38:15,and then you also had to name your child's genitals.
00:38:15,00:38:18,"- It's hard enough to find a good name for your child, isn't it?"
00:38:18,00:38:19,Have you reckon they had pucks?
00:38:19,00:38:21,(laughing)
00:38:21,00:38:23,The perfect name for your child's genitals.
00:38:23,00:38:24,(laughing)
00:38:24,00:38:28,I named my child's genitals after his grandpa's genitals.
00:38:28,00:38:30,(laughing)
00:38:30,00:38:36,- One example that I found was Queen Liliro Kulanis
00:38:36,00:38:39,Mille Mai was the story of her vagina
00:38:39,00:38:42,"and it was called anapal, which meant frisky"
00:38:42,00:38:44,and it was about her frolicing genitals
00:38:44,00:38:47,that went up and down apparently.
00:38:47,00:38:48,- Oh.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"- So yeah, they used to frolic it."
00:38:50,00:38:52,- I think the source of the b-barticle
00:38:52,00:38:54,was this paper by a guy called Milton Diamond
00:38:54,00:38:59,who studied a lot of Hawaiian sexual traditions and culture
00:38:59,00:39:01,and things about nudity as well.
00:39:01,00:39:03,So this is really weird.
00:39:03,00:39:08,"- Nudity was not sexual, in almost all contexts."
00:39:08,00:39:10,You only started wearing your clothes
00:39:10,00:39:12,over your genitals when you hit puberty
00:39:12,00:39:14,and that was out of respect for your genitals.
00:39:14,00:39:15,(laughing)
00:39:15,00:39:17,It's amazing.
00:39:17,00:39:20,But nudity for adults was symbolic of death
00:39:20,00:39:21,or punishment or lamentation.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"And if you were seen nude outside a ritual context,"
00:39:24,00:39:27,it was widely assumed that you had gone mad with grief.
00:39:27,00:39:27,- Yes.
00:39:27,00:39:29,- So it's not a sexy.
00:39:29,00:39:30,- It's really not.
00:39:30,00:39:34,"- Nude speeches, three sad places in Hawaii."
00:39:34,00:39:37,- It could also be used as an appeal for forgiveness
00:39:37,00:39:38,this paper said.
00:39:38,00:39:42,"So if someone's done you are wrong,"
00:39:42,00:39:43,then the way you ask for their forgiveness
00:39:43,00:39:45,is by taking all your clothes off
00:39:45,00:39:46,and following them around until they forgive you.
00:39:46,00:39:49,- Turn up outside their house at three in the morning.
00:39:49,00:39:50,(laughing)
00:39:50,00:39:51,- Please forgive me.
00:39:51,00:39:52,Please take me back.
00:39:52,00:39:53,- I've done that actually.
00:39:53,00:39:56,(laughing)
00:39:56,00:39:58,- It's normally just my Hawaiian heritage.
00:39:58,00:39:59,(laughing)
00:39:59,00:40:02,"- Is it, do we know if this is no longer being done?"
00:40:02,00:40:05,Was this for traditional old indigenous?
00:40:05,00:40:08,"- So what happened was when the Europeans came to Hawaii,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,"they saw all this stuff happening,"
00:40:10,00:40:11,but then they soon cut it all out
00:40:11,00:40:13,because it wasn't very Christian.
00:40:13,00:40:16,- So there was a lot of taking over Hawaiian culture
00:40:16,00:40:17,and enforcing Western.
00:40:17,00:40:21,And then Hawaiian indigenous people have tried to take
00:40:21,00:40:23,"a lot of it back, but I think it's obviously quite difficult"
00:40:23,00:40:25,'cause it was lost for about 50 years.
00:40:25,00:40:27,"- They said there was a basically where they go,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,"the penis chant, do we want that back here?"
00:40:29,00:40:31,- I'm good I think.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- So like for instance, Hula dancing is probably"
00:40:33,00:40:35,one of the most famous things in Hawaii
00:40:35,00:40:37,and Captain Cook said it was perfectly easy and graceful.
00:40:37,00:40:39,"He thought it was amazing,"
00:40:39,00:40:42,"but when the missionaries arrived, it was officially suppressed."
00:40:42,00:40:43,- Have you heard of penis blowing?
00:40:43,00:40:44,- Yes.
00:40:44,00:40:45,(laughing)
00:40:45,00:40:46,"- No, I don't think you have."
00:40:46,00:40:48,- I've seen that tummy leap in the eye.
00:40:48,00:40:49,(laughing)
00:40:49,00:40:51,- It's a signal to men in black.
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Okay.
00:40:52,00:40:54,(laughing)
00:40:54,00:40:55,- This is odd.
00:40:55,00:41:00,"This was a daily ritual for Hawaiian infant,"
00:41:00,00:41:02,which is where the members of the family would blow
00:41:02,00:41:06,"on the penis, just with a stream of air,"
00:41:06,00:41:09,"just, and it was to prepare the foreskin"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"for a kind of micro-circumcidian ceremony,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,and it would normally be an art or a grandmother
00:41:13,00:41:14,who did the blowing.
00:41:14,00:41:16,But lots of relatives were qualified to be the blower
00:41:16,00:41:18,"if you didn't have any art, so that's fine."
00:41:18,00:41:19,"- Wait, so what were they blowing onto it?"
00:41:19,00:41:21,"- Sort of Mike, or sort of a story of it?"
00:41:21,00:41:24,"- No, they just blow to protect it in their mythology."
00:41:24,00:41:25,"- Yeah, okay."
00:41:25,00:41:27,"- And this is a really common thing,"
00:41:27,00:41:29,"and there were lots of people even well into the 1980s,"
00:41:29,00:41:32,"for example, who had this done to them in their childhood."
00:41:32,00:41:33,"- Yeah, in fact, there was a story, wasn't there,"
00:41:33,00:41:37,"about a man who was totally non-sexual, we should say."
00:41:37,00:41:38,"- Yeah, completely."
00:41:38,00:41:40,There was a story about a man who was annoyed
00:41:40,00:41:41,"because he'd married a Hawaiian woman,"
00:41:41,00:41:44,"and he left her mom to babysit their child,"
00:41:44,00:41:46,and came back and found her doing this.
00:41:46,00:41:50,"It was like, why are you blowing on my child's penis?"
00:41:50,00:41:52,"And apparently the mother-in-law was like,"
00:41:52,00:41:55,"well, I have to, otherwise it's very bad luck,"
00:41:55,00:41:58,and was really worried about the baby's health if she didn't.
00:41:58,00:41:59,"But it does, it seemed weird, actually,"
00:41:59,00:42:00,if you haven't explained that before.
00:42:00,00:42:01,"- Yes, yeah."
00:42:01,00:42:03,"I like it's another gust of wind,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,"in fact, going into the,"
00:42:05,00:42:06,(laughing)
00:42:06,00:42:07,'cause maybe it does have it.
00:42:07,00:42:10,"Interestingly, you can tell the economic activity"
00:42:10,00:42:12,of the Reven Empire from discarded foreskins
00:42:12,00:42:14,of Hawaiian children.
00:42:14,00:42:19,- Oh my God.
00:42:19,00:42:24,"This, the author of this paper is called Milton Diamond,"
00:42:24,00:42:26,"as you mentioned before, and the only thing"
00:42:26,00:42:29,that I could find of an interest outside
00:42:29,00:42:31,of him writing this paper.
00:42:31,00:42:35,"So he wrote a lot about sex and gender, and so on."
00:42:35,00:42:37,"He had a big feud with a man called Money,"
00:42:37,00:42:40,"so Diamond and Money had a big feud,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,and they famously got into a punch-up
00:42:42,00:42:45,at a conference in Dubrovnik.
00:42:45,00:42:47,"So Money had written a book called,"
00:42:47,00:42:50,"as nature made him the boy raised as a girl,"
00:42:50,00:42:53,"and mentions it in this book, this fight."
00:42:53,00:42:56,"And there was a lot of chat about transgender at the time,"
00:42:56,00:42:59,and so that's where they fell foul
00:42:59,00:43:01,of what they thought definitions were.
00:43:01,00:43:02,"And yeah, there was a fight,"
00:43:02,00:43:05,although Diamond claims he doesn't recall being punched.
00:43:05,00:43:06,"But yeah, there's the only sort of thing."
00:43:06,00:43:08,"- The thing is, with Diamond, he is really hard, isn't he?"
00:43:08,00:43:10,(laughing)
00:43:10,00:43:16,- I have some stuff on chance.
00:43:16,00:43:17,- Right?
00:43:17,00:43:19,"- So this, I just thought this was really interesting."
00:43:19,00:43:20,"I'd never heard of it before,"
00:43:20,00:43:23,but have you guys heard fruit singing?
00:43:23,00:43:25,"- Oh, like Mongolian stuff, yeah."
00:43:25,00:43:27,"- Yeah, so I didn't know that--"
00:43:27,00:43:28,"- Actually, I'm sorry."
00:43:28,00:43:29,"- It sounded like that, but it's okay."
00:43:29,00:43:30,(laughing)
00:43:30,00:43:32,"- It actually does sound a bit like that,"
00:43:32,00:43:35,but I didn't realize that they're creating multiple notes.
00:43:35,00:43:36,"- Yeah, they do harmonies, don't they?"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"- Yeah, with one throat."
00:43:38,00:43:40,"So yeah, this is like Mongolians and some Inuits,"
00:43:40,00:43:43,and it's called a two-tooth and overtone technique
00:43:43,00:43:44,"when it's done in Mongolia,"
00:43:44,00:43:47,and they can get up to six simultaneous notes
00:43:47,00:43:50,to come out of their mouth by doing this special fruit singing
00:43:50,00:43:53,"technique, which I did not have time to look properly"
00:43:53,00:43:54,into how exactly it works.
00:43:54,00:43:56,"So all I can tell you is, it involves opening and closing"
00:43:56,00:44:00,"the vocal chords until harmonic resonances appear,"
00:44:00,00:44:02,"and I think if you go faster and faster,"
00:44:02,00:44:05,"different resonances come, and you make different noises,"
00:44:05,00:44:06,but it's really cool.
00:44:06,00:44:08,And then there's this one other really cool way
00:44:08,00:44:11,"of fruit singing, which is, this is an Inuit culture,"
00:44:11,00:44:15,"it's called the Katajak, and two women stand face to face,"
00:44:15,00:44:18,"but super close, so the lips almost touching each other,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,"and it's like a duel, a singing duel,"
00:44:21,00:44:23,"and so it goes really, really fast."
00:44:23,00:44:26,"One woman says one note or throat noise,"
00:44:26,00:44:27,"and then the other one has to respond to it,"
00:44:27,00:44:28,"and it goes faster and faster,"
00:44:28,00:44:32,"and they use each other's mouths as kind of resonators,"
00:44:32,00:44:35,"basically, and it only ends when one of them"
00:44:35,00:44:37,"like collapses, laughing, or runs out of breath,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,"and they can go on for hours, and it looks so cool."
00:44:39,00:44:42,- It's like tooling banjos. - Yeah.
00:44:42,00:44:46,"- But what you were saying is, so you got two people,"
00:44:46,00:44:48,"the mouths open, and I'm making good noise"
00:44:48,00:44:51,"into the other person's mouth, and because they've got a mouth,"
00:44:51,00:44:54,"there it's resonating the... - Exactly, and it makes a sound,"
00:44:54,00:44:57,- but they're resonating in your mouth at the same time.
00:44:57,00:45:00,"- Well straight after you, yeah, exactly. - Oh, right after you, right."
00:45:00,00:45:02,- So they're using your mouth as a musical instrument.
00:45:02,00:45:04,- That is so great. - That's weird.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"- I know, it's fun, isn't it?"
00:45:06,00:45:08,- Have you heard any? - Yeah.
00:45:08,00:45:09,- Wow. - It sounds cool.
00:45:09,00:45:11,- That sounds weird. - Yeah.
00:45:11,00:45:12,- It's not singing the normal stuff.
00:45:12,00:45:14,"The Mongolian stuff sounds a bit like, did you reduce, doesn't it?"
00:45:14,00:45:16,"- It does, yes. - Yeah."
00:45:16,00:45:17,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:45:17,00:45:19,- Who else? - Who else has got it?
00:45:19,00:45:20,(laughing)
00:45:20,00:45:22,"- Six, no, six. - It's not doing that in my mouth, darling."
00:45:22,00:45:25,(laughing)
00:45:25,00:45:29,"- Can I quickly mention, because naming of genitals"
00:45:29,00:45:32,is a practice that still does go on.
00:45:32,00:45:36,"There was a server that was done in 2015,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,"and it got reported in many places,"
00:45:38,00:45:40,"'cause it was a genuine survey,"
00:45:40,00:45:45,and they found that 73% of men have given their penis a nickname.
00:45:45,00:45:46,- Is that right? - Yeah.
00:45:46,00:45:50,59% say that it was a woman who came up with their nickname
00:45:50,00:45:52,for them. - Oh.
00:45:52,00:45:54,- So the survey was commissioned by a men's retailer
00:45:54,00:45:56,"called Jackamo, so this is a survey done through them."
00:45:56,00:46:00,"So, okay, let's, a few nicknames."
00:46:00,00:46:03,"- I can't think of anything that's not rude, Terry."
00:46:03,00:46:06,"- So the top five. - Give us, what letter does it begin with?"
00:46:06,00:46:08,- T for a... - I was a Terry.
00:46:08,00:46:09,(laughing)
00:46:09,00:46:12,- Is it one word? - It is one word.
00:46:12,00:46:13,- I think... - Terminator.
00:46:13,00:46:15,- I think sort of... - Terminator.
00:46:15,00:46:17,- Think what? - Gods.
00:46:17,00:46:18,- For? - No.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"- No, 'cause that's just someone with a lisp."
00:46:20,00:46:22,"- Sorry, I also have an aerial disease."
00:46:22,00:46:23,- I was trying not to. - My fetus is thought.
00:46:23,00:46:26,(laughing)
00:46:26,00:46:30,"- Sorry, this isn't a god."
00:46:30,00:46:31,I was trying to put us in the ancient Greeks.
00:46:31,00:46:32,"- All right, so what do you say that's a god?"
00:46:32,00:46:34,"- Oh, feces. - No, Troy."
00:46:34,00:46:36,So... - Troy?
00:46:36,00:46:37,"- Yeah, yeah, weird."
00:46:37,00:46:38,"- Doctor Doolittle, is that one?"
00:46:38,00:46:39,"- No, it's not. - That's shame."
00:46:39,00:46:40,- Russell the muscle is.
00:46:40,00:46:42,- Russell the muscle. - Yeah.
00:46:42,00:46:44,- It's not a muscle.
00:46:44,00:46:45,It's an organ.
00:46:45,00:46:46,- Oggons can have muscles in them.
00:46:46,00:46:49,"Your heart's an organ, it's loads of muscle."
00:46:49,00:46:51,- Good point. - But there isn't a muscle in the penis.
00:46:51,00:46:52,"- No, sir."
00:46:52,00:46:53,"- Well, I'd be working out."
00:46:53,00:46:56,(laughing)
00:46:56,00:46:59,- I've also been kicked out of the chair yet.
00:46:59,00:47:01,(laughing)
00:47:01,00:47:04,"- Okay, that's it."
