WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hey club fish members, welcome to your bonus bit of content. We've got an awesome bumper pack compilation for you today

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.900
 With the big names of the last nine months. You're gonna hear Beck Hill. You're gonna hear Maisie Adam

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.780
 You're gonna hear Jenny Colgan, David Mitchell, Sophie Juker, Ella Alshamahi

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.260
 And you won't hear Neil Gaiman, but you'll hear a clip from a show that he's on so technically he's on it because his breathing is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.000
 Probably softly in the background. So almost featuring Neil Gaiman as well such a brilliant collection of nerds

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.300
 We were so excited to have them on but Anna's back now

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.700
 So this will be the last time for a while that we're gonna have lots of guests on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.180
 Except for the fact that Andy's about to go away for a few weeks and so we'll have two more guests on but outside of that

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.420
 It's gonna be back to the original four, but we've massively enjoyed having all of our guests on

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.860
 So sit back now and enjoy some of the best bits that didn't make it onto the main show. Here we go

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 [Music]

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 In the 1990s Cliff Richard once brought Heath Cliff the Musical to the Hammersmith Apollo

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 Oh, that's cool. Where Kate Bush was soon to perform. Yeah, imagine that. Heath Cliff the Musical by Cliff Richard

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 He didn't call it Heath Cliff Richard

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 Oh

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.860
 No, he didn't. Come on Cliff, it's there for the takin'

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 [Laughter]

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.860
 See and seagrass is really interesting stuff. This is an initial diversion

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 But basically it's the only I think it's the only flowering plant that grows underwater

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 You get seaweed which kind of clings to things underwater and drifts about a bit

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 But seagrass actually has roots that gets nutrients from the roots and it flowers

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.860
 And it flowers and then the bees have to put on like scooby to go down there

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 But it's the best nectar and it's worth it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 And what's the point of the flowers if they don't because flowers are there to attract pollination aren't they from insects

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.860
 I think I guess there must be pollination from undersea creatures but with prawns

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 Could be prawns. It could be prawns. What was that?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.860
 No, currents aren't animals, they're spilt. They put them in a bun and they don't even squeal

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 [Laughter]

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.860
 The police chiefs in Romania in a city of Timosora sent their officers to ballet classes

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 In the hope of helping them manage the traffic with more grace

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 Oh, that's good. It is useful. There's a lot of NFL players who study ballet in their career

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 Like they weren't from ballet but they get into it because it helps them with movement, with fluidity, with stretch

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.860
 Yeah, there's quite a few. There's quite a few. There was one guy particularly who was drafted in 2022 for the Bears

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.860
 That's what he does. He does ballet and that helps to give him

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.860
 But I wonder how it would help a traffic cop

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.860
 It was meant to be that there were complaints about how their movements weren't being particularly well sort of clear

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.860
 If you're staccato, you're in a relationship with the traffic, aren't you? You're moving with it, you're guiding it, it's your partner

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.860
 Yeah, you've got four partners

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.860
 People need to understand what directions you're pointing in and if you're not clear with your movements or anything

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.860
 No, I got it. That makes sense

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.860
 Weirdly, when you're talking about the NFL players, I've started doing wrestling classes

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860
 Oh, cool

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 Because I want to get better at slapstick in comedy for kids

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.860
 Nice

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.860
 So I want to learn how to fall properly

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.860
 Oh, great. How's it going?

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.860
 I could fall on a mat

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.860
 But I haven't, but I'm not at floors yet

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.860
 Is it like you're supposed to turn as you fall and land on your shoulder or is that something else that I'm thinking of?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.860
 Well, it depends what you're doing, but most of the time it's called a bump and you go on your back to do a bump

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.860
 That's when they land on their back. You're basically landing between your shoulder blades

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.860
 And the key is you want to keep your hips sort of as high as possible so that your tailbone doesn't get hit

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.860
 Yeah

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.860
 What about your head?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.860
 Your head, they need incredible neck muscles

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.860
 So they actually do exercises to strengthen their neck muscles so that when you fall, your neck can support your head and your chin up

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.860
 So that your head doesn't go back and bounce

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.860
 A lot of the sound though, interestingly

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.860
 Because normally if you do that, you don't actually make that much noise

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.860
 But you know how it's like bang, like when they do it?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.860
 The sound comes from their arms

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.860
 So you put your arms out the same time that you fall and basically slap the floor as loud as you can

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 And it's genuinely pain, I know people go, oh yeah, but the ring, it's got springs and stuff

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 It's really not much at all, it's essentially made with car parts and plywood

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.860
 It is, yeah, it's painful

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.860
 What's your wrestling name?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 I haven't got one yet, but I quite like the idea of Big Heel

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 Big Heel, love it

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.860
 I used to wrestle as a kid, I was called Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 I had a song and everything

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.860
 When you say you used to do it as a kid, this is, it wasn't professionally already Finn

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.860
 No, no, we used to do

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.860
 Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine, doot doot, was the song, yeah

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.860
 Oh, that's the whole song, is it?

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.860
 It was kind of a repeat of the Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.860
 Sorry, is that a thing, Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.860
 Yeah, it's my name

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.860
 No, no, no, but is that an existing thing or is it a...

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.860
 Yeah, it's my existing wrestling

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.860
 No, did you take it from, were you inspired by something else or was it just a damn show?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.860
 Oh, there's a lot of wrestlers called like the Tugboat and stuff like that, yeah

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.860
 And I get you like Thomas a lot

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.860
 I didn't give myself the name, it was given to me

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.860
 By somebody who likes Thomas the Tank Engine

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.860
 Is the idea that you'll, like, you'll have to be pulled off unconscious after the wrestling bout is over?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.860
 No, because the Tugboat pulls other people off, don't they?

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.860
 Like, the Tugboat helps someone to get into the, into the plot

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.860
 Yeah, exactly, I pulled a lot of men off in my right time as a, as a wrestler

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.860
 Um, you know the Lumiere Brothers, who we've mentioned a couple of times in this

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.860
 So they, two of the big pioneers of film, they hired the basement of the Grand CafÃ© in Paris

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.860
 In 1895, right, for a demonstration

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.860
 And when people arrived in the room, they saw the screen had been set up

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.860
 And they thought, ah, it's going to be another slideshow

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.860
 Uh, and George Melios was in the room because he was a pioneer as well

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.860
 But he, he thought, oh god, it's a projection, eh?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.860
 Which kind of stationary images

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.860
 He said, I've been doing this for ten years

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.860
 And then the screen started moving

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.860
 And Melios said, we stared flabbergasted at this site, stupefied and surprised beyond all expression

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.860
 At the end of the show there was complete chaos

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.860
 Wow

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.860
 I just, imagine, I mean, it must have been an amazing moment

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.860
 Yeah

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 The first time that was truly demonstrated

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.860
 Yeah

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.860
 And then Lumiere Sr, so the Lumiere Brothers dad, he was involved in the same kind of business, photography and images

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.860
 He said he was not going to be selling the process

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.860
 He got immediate offers on the spot, you know, 10,000 francs, 50,000 francs to find out how to do it

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.860
 And supposedly, I love this, he told Melios, my son's invention is not for sale, it would ruin you

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.860
 It can be exploited for a short while as a scientific curiosity

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.860
 Beyond that, it has no commercial future

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.860
 Wow

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.860
 I know

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.860
 Amazing

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.860
 Yeah

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.860
 Gotta imagine seeing that being in the room for that

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.860
 It would have been incredible

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.860
 Yeah

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.860
 The greatest thing about Doctor Who is the fan base

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.860
 It really kind of does have the most extraordinary fan base to the point where the fans have become Doctor Who

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.860
 Like, that's, it's quite rare

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.860
 So

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.860
 How do you mean?

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.860
 Okay, so David Tennant basically became an actor because he wanted to be Doctor Who

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.860
 Peter Capaldi obsessed with Doctor Who to the point where the president of the fan club of Doctor Who

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.860
 When Peter Capaldi was a kid was sending messages to other people going, this Capaldi kid won't leave me alone

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.860
 He's so annoying

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.860
 Wow

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.860
 He's haunting my time as president of, he's demanding, he should be president, he keeps sending in letters

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.860
 He keeps sending in fan art, he keeps sending in corrections

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.860
 Capaldi was obsessed and he did go on to become a Doctor Who

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.860
 And then Tennant, of course, if you know Tennant's life well, you'll know that he is married to the daughter of a previous Doctor Who

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.860
 Which is Peter Davidson

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.860
 Is he?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.860
 Yeah, so

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.860
 Who also played his own daughter in the show Doctor Who?

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:05.860
 Yes, yeah, so George, George Mothlis is her name and she comes on to Doctor Who playing Doctor Who's daughter during David Tennant's, no, hang on

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.860
 What?

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.860
 No, sorry

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.860
 It's all tiny white stuff, it's a bit confusing

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.860
 So his wife plays his daughter?

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.860
 That's how they met, yeah, they met on set

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.860
 Yeah, he's married to one Doctor and the daughter of another

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:31.860
 My favourite social media post of all time is from George Mothlis as she's standing in her lounge room and both David Tennant and her dad, Peter Davidson are trying to change a lightbulb

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.860
 And the caption is "How many doctors does it take to change a lightbulb?"

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.860
 Nice

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.860
 If you've got a sonic screwdriver

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.860
 You can use it on your research

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.860
 Jesus, I'm so proud of you, this is great

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:52.860
 I read an article with Peter Capaldi from 1974 where they called him Scotland's biggest Doctor Who fan

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.860
 It's around online, you see it every now and then, don't you?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.860
 I have to say when I started writing for the show when I was 13, I entered a competition to meet Doctor Who

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:08.860
 When I entered was Tom Baker, so I must have been about 12, and then when I won it was Peter Davidson, which made me less happy, but made my mother quite a lot more happy

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.860
 So it kind of balanced out

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:17.860
 And having worked in Who and met lots of people from Who, everyone my age entered that competition

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:25.860
 The amount of people, yeah, absolutely, the amount of people David Tennant entered, lots of the writers entered, the amount of people I met when I go "I won that W. Smith competition"

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.860
 They're like "Oh no, it was you!"

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:34.860
 So I think there is a definite, I think particularly for the people that play the Doctor because it's in every territory in the world

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.860
 It's one of Britain's biggest exports, it's one of Britain's huge financial exports

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.860
 And so for the rest of your life, you're going to have to be the Doctor, so you're going to, you cannot

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.860
 Wait, so you won the competition?

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.860
 Yes, I did

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.860
 What are the odds? That's amazing

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.860
 I'm so very excited about it

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.860
 Yeah, that's awesome

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.860
 So yeah, so this picture is me with Peter Davidson and Monsters, and here's a really nice thing that happened

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.860
 I got an email out the blue from BBC Archives one day saying "We're doing some archive business"

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:11.860
 And we believe that you were present for the taping in front of us in like 1983

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.860
 Can you confirm it? Were you there on this day? And I was, and I was 12

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.860
 And I'm down in the official BBC archive on the production line

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.860
 Oh nice, an update

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.860
 The fans, the fans in Paris, the mantle of running the show

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.860
 They're always quite clicky butchers, especially if you go back into like the middle ages and stuff

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.860
 Being a butcher was a really important job obviously in the city

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.860
 But also you couldn't sell dodgy meat, so there were lots of laws basically for the butchers

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.860
 For what they could and they couldn't do

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.860
 I was reading some offences from the 14th century in London

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.860
 And you could be arrested if you're a butcher for cutting the meat improperly

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.860
 So too much or too little

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.860
 Selling measly pork

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.860
 And measly pork is pork which looks like it's got measles

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.860
 So it's got a disease on it and it's got little pock marks in it

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.860
 You weren't allowed to kill any animals on a Sunday

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.860
 And you weren't allowed to run around the town in a cloak but not a gown

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.860
 What? Even when you're off shift?

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.860
 Even at any stage if you're a butcher

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.860
 You can't wear a cloak? Why? What did a cloak have connotations on?

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.860
 I couldn't really work out exactly what the reasoning behind that was

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.860
 But it was definitely against the rules for butchers

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.860
 But there was this thing basically in London, you had the fishmongers and the butchers

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.860
 They were very clicky and they wouldn't hang out with each other

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.860
 It's like western storeys

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.860
 Exactly like that, exactly like that

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.860
 And so they would, if you had like let's say the two or three days before Easter

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.860
 They were the best times when you could sell your food

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.860
 Yeah

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.860
 Because you couldn't buy anything over Easter

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.860
 And they would have special places where the best places to buy your food are

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.860
 So over the bridges was one and stuff like that

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.860
 So there was really good places

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.860
 And they say only the fishmongers are allowed here or only the butchers are allowed here

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.860
 And whenever they said only the fishmongers are allowed here

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.860
 The butchers would kick off and they go in and they start smashing up the fishmongers places

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.860
 But they'd walk up clicking like that

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.860
 And in 1443 there was a battle of fishmongers versus butchers in London

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.860
 Of who would get the prime spots on Easter Eve

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.860
 Lovely

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.860
 And one fishmonger was very badly wounded

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.860
 Yeah

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.860
 But yeah, the fishmongers were usually royalists

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.860
 The butchers were usually parliamentarians

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.860
 Really?

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.860
 Later on

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.860
 Oh my god, it's like Celtic Rangers

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.860
 It really is

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.860
 And like there were three fishmongers who became Lord Mayor of London

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.860
 And no butchers did and that was a really

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.860
 That feels sus, doesn't it?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.860
 Yeah, exactly

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.860
 It was like a big deal whether you're on the butcher side or the fishmonger side

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.860
 Wow

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.860
 Isn't that amazing?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.860
 That is really cool, I had never heard that

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.860
 I was reading about the clothes that they had to wear

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.860
 So you know they have this stripey

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.860
 Oh yes

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.860
 So

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.860
 Like Fred Elliott

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.860
 Literally I was just about to say I was like Fred and Ashley

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.860
 In Coronation Street

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.860
 Coronation Street

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.860
 I'm just moving things back to my home turf now

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.860
 Right, I don't believe this before I say it to you

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.860
 Why are butchers apron striped?

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.860
 I think I got this from a workwear website

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.860
 Well, can I say are they red and white stripes?

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.860
 Yeah

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.860
 No, I think they're blue and white

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.860
 Oh are they?

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.860
 I was thinking like it would cover the blood but yeah

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.860
 Oh yeah, some are blue and white

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.860
 Sometimes they wear all white to show how clean the place is

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860
 Oh that makes sense

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.860
 Because otherwise they'd be covered in blood

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.860
 Oh yeah

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.860
 And that's a really bad sign

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.860
 So no, these are the blue and white ones

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.860
 Is it because they're on Man City fans?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.860
 That's right

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.860
 Is it slimming?

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.860
 It's slimming

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.860
 The stripe design and I'm just quoting here

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.860
 The stripe design and number of stripes signify the level of skill of the butcher

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.860
 A broad stripe means the butcher is master of their trade

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.860
 Wow

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.860
 A single stripe means the butcher works without apprenticeship

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.860
 So it's like getting a new belt and karate, you get a new apron

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.860
 Yeah

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.860
 With the status symbol

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.860
 And I don't think that still is the case

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.860
 No, I don't think, I've never heard that before

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.860
 On the karate thing, I heard on another podcast lateral

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:52.860
 That the reason that the, it goes from white belts to black belts

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.860
 It goes like yellow doesn't it

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.860
 Yeah

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860
 And then something else and brown then black

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.860
 It's supposed to be a snooker

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.860
 You have to have a red fight between all of the others

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.860
 And wear a waistcoat

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.860
 That sounds way better than my version

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.860
 But what I think it is is it's like they would get dirtier

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.860
 So the more fights you would have, the more dirty your belts would get

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.860
 And so it would be, I'm not sure why yellow would be the first one

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.860
 You'd piss yourself

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.860
 You'd piss yourself of the fear after you

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.860
 But eventually your belt would be

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.860
 Dan's got a brown belt

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:33.860
 There's that famous one about what animals do you think you could fight

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.860
 Where we have mentioned it before

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.860
 6% of Americans think they could beat a grizzly bear in a fight

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.860
 Only half of those surveyed thought they could beat a medium-sized dog

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.860
 That's interesting

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.860
 I do think I could beat a medium-sized dog

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.860
 Well, it's hard to

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.860
 What's a medium-sized dog?

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.860
 Labrador

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.860
 Labrador

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.860
 Oh, it's just a dog

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.860
 It's just a dog, yeah

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.860
 But there were other surveys done about, let's say for example

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.860
 Sorry, I just say that those people who don't think they could beat them

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.860
 Maybe they feel I can't bring it in myself to fight a medium-sized dog

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.860
 I would also say no to that question

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.860
 I actually just realised what we've implied is that I think I could beat up a Labrador

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.860
 I actually don't want to do that

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.860
 Especially not for the blind person

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:20.860
 Can I say a couple of things quickly because I was very impressed that

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.860
 Both Oxygen and Fizzy Drinks came out of Leeds

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.860
 I thought, what else came out of Leeds?

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.860
 Mel B

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.860
 Mel B came out of Leeds

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.860
 That's our holy trinity

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.860
 Oxygen, big wee

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.860
 Scary Spice

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.860
 Scary Spice

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.860
 Yeah, so yes, absolutely correct

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.860
 And maybe you'll know all of these actually, Maisie, being from there

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.860
 Go on

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.860
 What famous board game came out of Leeds?

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.860
 Oh, is it?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.860
 It's not Cludo, is it?

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.860
 It is Cludo, yeah

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.860
 Is it Cludo? I thought that was Cludo

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.860
 Cludo was invented in Leeds

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.860
 But it was a game that was bought by the founders there, Wallingtons

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.860
 And it was a different game, it was originally called Murder

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.860
 And it was repackaged and it was turned around, named Cludo Popdown

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.860
 So that was in Leeds, yeah

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.860
 What famous American building was designed

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.860
 Was built in Leeds

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.860
 No, was designed by someone from Leeds

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.860
 Oh

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.860
 Yeah, from Pudsy, I should say

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.860
 Oh, okay, well

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.860
 It's definitely, it's not the Empire State, I feel like I'd know that

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.860
 Oh, that's a good one

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.860
 Is it that one in Chicago?

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.860
 No, it's built in 1800, completed in 1800

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.860
 Completed in 1800, that's very old

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.860
 Yeah

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.860
 It's really old

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.860
 What's that old in America?

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.860
 Well, the White House

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.860
 What state is it in?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.860
 Hang on, hang on, they couldn't have designed a new White House

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.860
 12 years before the White House was burned down in the war of 1812

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.860
 But I'm talking about the original White House

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.860
 Oh, you're saying they built it, and then it got burned down

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.860
 And then they built another one

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860
 I think that's what happened

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.860
 That is the timeline, isn't it?

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.860
 You fiction on in Leeds designed the OG White House

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.860
 I don't know

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.860
 No

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:53.860
 It was Melby

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.860
 It's not that, but someone from Leeds, from Pudsy, designed the US Capitol building

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.860
 Oh, really?

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.860
 Yeah, yeah

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.860
 Okay

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.860
 Yeah, Benjamin La Trobe

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.860
 Is Pudsy the bear?

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.860
 Yes

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.860
 From Pudsy

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:06.860
 Pudsy, yeah

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.860
 From Pudsy and Leeds

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.860
 Oh, really?

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.860
 Yeah

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.860
 Oh, Pudsy was not on notable people from Leeds Wikipedia

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.860
 Wow

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.860
 Entry needs to get in there

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.860
 That's why he's called Pudsy

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.860
 Yeah

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:18.860
 Because he's from Pudsy and Leeds

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.860
 And then just last thing, Grand Theft Auto is from Leeds

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.860
 One of the biggest franchise video games of all time

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.860
 Grand Theft Auto

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.860
 Well, the first edition is Leeds

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.860
 The first edition

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.860
 I don't know what kind of set it is

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.860
 I was going to say, there's some parts of Leeds where it's like being in the game yourself

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:36.860
 It's just probably better for the video game aesthetically to look like Miami

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.860
 Yeah, but the concept was Leeds

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.860
 It was a Leeds company, Rockstar Leeds, who created it

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.860
 How interesting

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.860
 I got two last bungling criminals

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.860
 One guy called Derek Mosley

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.860
 He went into a store, not armed with anything but a baseball bat, attempting to rob it

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.860
 Unfortunately, it was a gun shop

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.860
 The manager immediately pulled out a gun

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.860
 and held him there until the police came

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.860
 And then this one, my favorite one

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.860
 1996, a store manager in California, robs a store

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.860
 The store that he's the manager of

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.860
 He then reports the robbery

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.860
 and then the police come

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.860
 The police then ask him to give a detailed description of the criminal

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.860
 bringing a sketch artist in

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.860
 And unfortunately, due to incredible lack of imagination

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.860
 he details his exact face

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.860
 and they look at it and go, "But that's you!"

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.860
 and he went, "Oh shit, yeah, I did it!"

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:36.860
 I can't think of any face

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.860
 Just give him a different nose

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.860
 Think of it, there must be more than one kind of nose

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.860
 His nose was unlike this

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.860
 Quickly back to Kate Bush before we finish

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.860
 She's got a song called "Pie"

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.860
 where she sings the number "Pie" to 78 decimal places

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.860
 There's other words as well, it's like the chorus is the numbers

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.860
 And the problem is she gets the 54th decimal place wrong

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.860
 No!

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.860
 Okay, if you're gonna do a song about pie

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.860
 you've either gotta get it right

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.860
 or it's gonna be tongue-in-cheek

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.860
 but don't actually sing it

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.860
 In fact, she goes to 78 and then she misses out from 78 to 101

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.860
 Oh god, it gets worse!

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.860
 Yeah, it's really bad

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.860
 But more or less on the BBC, they looked at this

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.860
 and they said, "Actually there's a theory

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.860
 that if you look at pie, because it goes on forever, the number

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.860
 every sort of list of numbers will be in there somewhere"

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.860
 And so they think that even maybe she wasn't reading the first hundred and something

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.860
 She was just reading a section of pie

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.860
 From an area that we haven't even got to yet

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.860
 But does she start by saying "three point"?

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.860
 Because then that's like...

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.860
 Yeah, that's a good point

00:19:54.860 --> 00:20:00.860
 But we actually don't know whether every single string of numbers is in pie or not

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.860
 That's an unproven bit of maths that people are still trying to work out

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.860
 Which more or less called the "Catebush Conjecture"

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.860
 Because if it's true, then she didn't get it wrong after all

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.860
 That's great, that's really funny

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.860
 I think you've completely knocked out the theory with the "three point"

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.860
 It's at the beginning of the song

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.860
 It's a lot holding on that first verse

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.860
 She might have been talking about Newcastle winning in the Champions League

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.860
 They got three points yesterday

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.860
 Oh yeah, she voted a song about Newcastle's winning in the Champions League

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.860
 And then immediately goes into reciting patterns

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.860
 That's classic Bush

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.860
 Yes, exactly

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:41.860
 You know that thing of when people take bagels

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.860
 When people have a bagel and then it's got poppy seeds on it

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.860
 And then they fail a drugs test

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.860
 I think we probably have mentioned that in this podcast before

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.860
 Because it can make athletes fail tests if they've had poppy seed bagels

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.860
 Here's a thing that happened a few years ago

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.860
 In 2013, a hospital took a newborn baby away from its mum

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.860
 For five days because she'd failed an opiate test

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.860
 Which was entirely because she'd had a bagel

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.860
 She just had a bagel and then she'd had a urine test or something while in hospital

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.860
 And the last thing she'd eaten before giving birth was a poppy seed bagel

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.860
 Wow, that's amazing

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.860
 It's awful, I don't think it's amazing Dan, I think it's really bad

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.860
 No, it's amazing that that package is what I mean

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.860
 I should start doing that and taking babies away

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.860
 But that's pretty amazing that that's not on the walls of hospitals saying

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.860
 Make sure not to have a bagel prior to birth or something like that

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.860
 No, you're allowed to eat the bagels, it's just that the test shouldn't have found it

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.860
 I think so

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.860
 Because I mean, I don't know if you're aware of this because you do have three kids

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.860
 But they give you a ton of drugs when you're having kids

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.860
 Yeah, yeah, I took a lot

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:52.860
 My wife did natural, but I was absolutely off my head

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.860
 When you write one of the novels for it, Jenny

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.860
 Are you allowed to make up any monster or do they sometimes say

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.860
 No, a monster made of 50 million bees is a silly monster to have

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.860
 Funnily enough, a monster made of 50 million bees or anything that's very difficult to do on television

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.860
 Is very good to do in a novel

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:18.860
 So one of the last stories I wrote was about a creature that sucked up all the oceans

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.860
 Because it was impossible to film and the whole thing is done when they're trying to run from boat to boat

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:29.860
 So anything that's out and in fact, my first novel from that was again it's set entirely in the water in the Viking seas

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.860
 Anything that's really hard to shoot, putting the tARDIS on water on screen is a nightmare

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:40.860
 So anything that's very difficult to do and big and expensive needs to go in a novel

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.860
 It's the old, you know, Simpsons crashing 50 helicopters into house

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.860
 It costs them no more money than someone walking into a room

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.860
 So you do have to be a bit...

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.860
 At one point I had Matt Smith diving to save someone from the water

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.860
 And he removed his trousers and shoes

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.860
 Oh here we go, here's the wrong comm element

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.860
 Well no no, he came back and said the doctor never takes his trousers off

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.860
 So that's our red line

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.860
 Did you have the doctor take his trousers off?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.860
 Well, if you're running to save someone in the water, then take off your shoes and trousers

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.860
 It's common sense

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.860
 And so I'd written it without thinking about it, it was just like what do you do?

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.860
 And you're running into the water and it just came back with the big mic going

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.860
 No, the doctor does not know if they're crowds or is never

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.860
 I never knew Andrew

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.860
 Do you remember the, do we talk about this, the Anthony Horowitz thing?

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.860
 Because he wrote the J, Anthony Horowitz wrote the Bond books

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.860
 And he wrote one where Bond is naked

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.860
 And yeah, we did mention this I think, but he wrote one where Bond is like

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.860
 He springs out of bed naked because there's a killer or someone at the door or whatever

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:51.860
 And the note came back from the estate saying "No, he needs to be wearing formal pyjamas which button to the neck"

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.860
 And that's so unsexy

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.860
 It's like a moral beacon for children, I'd have thought, but good

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.860
 Have you guys heard of mutton Jeff?

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.860
 It means deaf

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.860
 Comedy double-act?

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.860
 Well, like really old comedy double-act from the 40s or 30s

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.860
 Yeah

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.860
 It's a pairing that's been used quite a lot

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.860
 The first instance of it as far as I could find was from Bud Fisher

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.860
 He did it as two cartoon characters, it was the first ever

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:25.860
 He's a cartoonist, Bud Fisher, and he created these two characters, mutton Jeff

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.860
 Oh, I thought you said mutton Jeff, like "Oh, the guy gets me my lamb down the ride"

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.860
 It was beefy Bill, Larry the lamb

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.860
 The dodgy butcher, like "Yeah, I just got this off the back of a trombone"

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.860
 Where were you last night, mutton Jeff?

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.860
 Yeah, no, it was the first daily comic strip in the States, supposedly

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.860
 When historians are trying to pin that down, it always comes up, 1907

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.860
 And mutton Jeff is what you actually call good cop/bad cop

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:56.860
 It's what that dynamic is based on these two characters who were two mismatched tin horns, they were called

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:01.860
 And mutton Jeff, it's used everywhere now to sort of describe that dynamic

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.860
 But yeah, good cop/bad cop is mutton Jeff

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.860
 Wow

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.860
 Which doesn't work, good cop/bad cop

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.860
 Does it not?

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:13.860
 No, and they've done experiments of, you know, scientists have carried out experiments to sort of emotionally destabilize the subjects

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.860
 And then ask them questions

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.860
 Okay, here's one, there was students being asked to answer questions about their work in an interview setting

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.860
 Or to lie about a fictional job

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.860
 And they were interviewed by a neutral interviewer

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.860
 And then there was someone else in the corner taking notes, a second interviewer

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.860
 And that second interviewer either looked supportive as they were taking notes or they looked hostile and suspicious

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:39.860
 And basically people who were telling the truth gave detailed answers if that second person looked supportive

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.860
 You know, they gave better answers, more informative

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.860
 So it became easier to tell who's lying

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.860
 So you sort of just need good cop/normal cop

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.860
 Okay, right

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.860
 Or normal cop/good cop, you know, but there's not much use for

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.860
 Just a good cop

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.860
 Just a good cop

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.860
 Probably

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.860
 But does the bad cop not just make the good cop seem gooder?

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.860
 No

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:08.860
 Well, I think that's the thinking behind it, but actually it just stresses people out and I think makes them more likely to lie

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:16.860
 So Byron's thing was, he said a line that was so potently harsh that it sort of became the reason for Keats dying

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.860
 Which was that he, what did he say, the critics killed him basically

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.860
 Oh yeah, there was this idea

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.860
 He got some really crunching bad reviews for a couple of his epic poems, there's one called Endymion

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.860
 Which, and he got a terrible review and the consensus later was, well, he died of reviews

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.860
 And he didn't, he died of tuberculosis

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.860
 Yeah

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.860
 And the reviews were years before he got the TB as well

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.860
 Is it possible though to die of reviews?

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.860
 Because I...

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.860
 Are you doing it again with this shit?

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.860
 No, my doctor says it's better to die

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:52.860
 But no, so after Keats died, so he dies in Rome, in the arms of his friend, Joseph Severn, who's a painter

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.860
 And then he, Keats, in his dying days, he says, I don't want my name even to go on my tombstone

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.860
 So the famous line on his tombstone is, here lies one whose name was writ in water

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.860
 He knows this very amazing talent, but ephemeral, that he's passed, you know, he's passed out of the world

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.860
 And it's a little bit, kind of, poor me, but his friends, they did that, they put that

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.860
 Here lies one whose name was writ in water

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.860
 They decided, no, we think he deserves a bit more than that, so they added, above it

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:28.860
 Wow

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.860
 Which, I think, removes the power of the beautiful, no more fragrant message that he thought of

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:40.860
 It's even worse than that, because if you go and visit Keats's grave, and as you say, he wanted it to be anonymous, you know, when no one's there

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.860
 The grave right next to him basically says, I'm with Keats

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.860
 No

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.860
 It does, because it's his mate, Joseph Severn, who was buried there

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.860
 That's so funny

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:56.860
 Says, to the memory of Joseph Severn, devoted friend and deathbed companion of John Keats

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.860
 And so everyone now knows that it's right next door

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.860
 Wow

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.860
 All the graves in that grave, I was just saying, like Keats, three down

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:14.860
 Yes, it's odd, there's a lot of kings getting bits of them buried in a different place, and the Habsburgs were mad for it

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:20.860
 I think they had almost like a tradition, I can't remember where, I'm afraid, but like the body in one place and the heart somewhere else

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.860
 There's a place in Vienna that I started reading about, hearts being buried separately to the rest of the individual

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.860
 And the hearts, there are 54 Habsburg hearts in one crypt in Vienna

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.860
 Wow

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.860
 That's quite romantic

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.860
 And they've all got their own hearts

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.860
 Yeah, yeah, I suppose it is, yeah

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.860
 I'll spend Valentine's Day with you next week

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.860
 Well actually, he was like quite pedantic, wasn't he?

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.860
 Was he?

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.860
 Because he had that book that you mentioned, The Style?

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.860
 Oh yeah, the Elements of Style

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.860
 Elements of Style

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.860
 And if you read that, it's all about how everyone's grammar is terrible

00:28:53.860 --> 00:29:00.860
 And, you know, for instance, the word "non" is in the singular, so you should say "none of us is ready" rather than "none of us are ready"

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:10.860
 Or you should never start a sentence with "however", and you should never turn a noun into a verb, so you shouldn't say "I was hosting a party"

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:16.860
 Because that's turning, you know, the host is a noun and you shouldn't turn it into a verb

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:26.860
 I absolutely hated the passive voice, so you know, like, you should say "the dog bit the man" and not "the man was bitten by the dog", that's what he thought

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:35.860
 Although the first sentence of his book says "this book is intended for use in English courses in which the practice of composition is combined with a study of literature"

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.860
 Which has got two examples of the passive voice in the first sentence

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.860
 That's really good

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.860
 That's such an interesting book because it was originally written by someone else, it was called William Strunk Jr.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:56.860
 And then E.B. White came in and did a revised expanded edition, but he gets as much of the credit of the book, but it's a weird example of a book sort of getting second

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.860
 He liked it a second edition, almost like adding loads of extra stuff

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.860
 Yeah, exactly

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:10.860
 Well, in his Sex Necessary book that he did with James Thurber, who then went on to become one of the cartoonists for the New Yorker

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:16.860
 In 1950, Thurber was supposed to write an introduction to the book's latest edition at that point

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.860
 And he contributed just a couple of paragraphs, then wrote to White on the side

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.860
 "If you know anything about sex, let me know"

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:29.860
 Do you know what the rainbow bridge is, if I say that phrase?

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.860
 No, no

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.860
 Ah, well, that completely...

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.860
 Oh, should we know it?

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.860
 Well, the rainbow bridge is an extremely well-known phrase for when your pet dies

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.860
 Oh

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:47.860
 And it's from a kind of poem which is known all over the world about how your dog crosses the rainbow bridge

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.860
 And it becomes young again, and it's in a lovely place with lots of dogs to play with

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.860
 And then one day it'll peel off because it can smell you coming

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.860
 You see, so it's been a source of comfort and joy all over the world, and most people have heard of it

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:06.860
 And the woman who wrote it is 82, and she wrote it when she was about 13, and she lives in Inverness

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:13.860
 And they found her this year, her name is Edna, and she had written that when she was a teenager

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.860
 Somebody in her family had passed it on to somebody else

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.860
 Who'd passed on, and eventually her husband got hold of it when they were married

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:27.860
 And he'd given it to someone who went to America, where they published it in the Dear, one of those American columns

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:35.860
 Ask Abbey, where it had been read by 100 million Americans, because it was a syndicated column

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.860
 How was it like just anonymous at the time?

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.860
 They didn't, they had no idea who it was

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.860
 And you can even see in the original Ask Abbey, she says "Oh, I don't know who this is from"

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.860
 And it's just full of letters from Americans in tears and so on

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:54.860
 It spread everywhere, and when we had a dog that died, we got a lot of commiserations and said they're at the rainbow bridge

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.860
 It's the kind of way that you say "I'm sorry that your animal died"

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.860
 And until about last year, she had no idea

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.860
 And then it came up and she went up to her attic and she said "Yeah, here it is"

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.860
 It was the original piece of paper in a book

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.860
 That's so cool

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.860
 That's amazing, you should go visit, you're so close to her, you should go meet her

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:19.860
 I think it would be, I kind of work quite heavily off getting paid for writing that idea

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:25.860
 This is one of the most published poems in the world, and she did not even know

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.860
 That's incredible

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.860
 Neanderthals, I think we can say they were a bit like reindeer in one respect

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.860
 Really, can we?

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.860
 Yeah, please tell me

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.860
 They're big noses, which they use to heat up cold air

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.860
 And reindeer do that

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.860
 As in they had great big sinuses and chambers and just a warm up freezing cold air

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.860
 So actually that's highly debated now

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.860
 Oh man, why don't you have experts on this?

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.860
 That was the, it's contentious

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.860
 So some people think it's more about the amount of oxygen they needed to take in

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.860
 Because loads of them were living in, they were cold adapted

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.860
 But loads of them were living in Iraq and the Iberian Peninsula

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.860
 When it wasn't necessarily cold, so it's not straightforward

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.860
 Because they did have very very shiny noses, didn't they?

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.860
 Yeah, okay

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.860
 And there were elves at the time

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.860
 Actually, I think they were because there were hobbits around on a different continent

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.860
 Is that the homo, what they call it?

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.860
 Homo floresiensis

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:38.860
 Yeah, apparently in the original paper they were called Sudanthropus florensianus

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.860
 Which means they thought it meant a man from the Sunda region of Flores

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.860
 But actually it translated as flowery anus

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.860
 Wow

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.860
 Does anyone know what Marxist glue is?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.860
 What might that be?

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.860
 Marxist glue

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.860
 It sticks to everybody according to their need

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.860
 No, no, no

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.860
 It was a good try and what was a very difficult prompt

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:12.860
 I don't like this live-reviewing feature we've just enabled

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.860
 Marxist glue

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.860
 Is it a special kind of Soviet glue that was used only in Russia?

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.860
 Actually, no, used in the West by Marxists

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.860
 Oh, is it for like protests?

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.860
 Yes, glue is used in protests

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.860
 Like the suffragettes manacled themselves to things, but other people glue themselves to things

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.860
 Very less strong glue made from wheat and water

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.860
 So it's very cheap, not used to glue yourself to something

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.860
 Do you glue something else to something?

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.860
 Posters

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.860
 Be more communist, please

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.860
 Very cheap

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.860
 This isn't the idea at all

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.860
 Pop it up there straight away

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.860
 You're not giving anything to international capitalism

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.860
 You're not giving anything to big print

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.860
 You're just a bit of wheat

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.860
 Yeah, absolutely

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.860
 The thing is it just sticks to what?

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.860
 It's very, very easy and cheap to make

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.860
 But once you put it on a wall

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.860
 You really can't get it off unless you really scrape it off

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.860
 And they used it quite a lot in history

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.860
 To lose the Trek, for instance

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.860
 He would put all of his posters up using this stuff

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.860
 And his posters became really popular and really expensive

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.860
 And people would pay a lot of money for his posters

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.860
 For the Moulin Rouge or whatever

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.860
 And so you would get people who would follow him around Paris

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.860
 Trying to grab his posters off as soon as he put them on

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.860
 Because they knew as soon as this Marxist glue had dried

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.860
 They would not be able to get it off anymore

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.860
 That's great

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.860
 It's a bit banksy-ish, isn't it?

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.860
 Yeah, it is, I guess

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.860
 That's very cool

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.860
 Does anyone want a Japanese soft drink?

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.860
 This is children's beer

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.860
 It's a soft drink that I've got from Japan

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.860
 Wow

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.860
 And you pour, on the front it's got a picture of a beer

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.860
 And a drunk looking child

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.860
 And you put it in a glass and you pour water on it

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.860
 And apparently it looks and tastes like, well it doesn't taste much like beer, I don't think

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.860
 I'm so up for this, this is amazing

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.860
 That sounds so good

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.860
 It's like a normal white powder

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.860
 Just a normal white powder

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.860
 It looks very saucy, someone's to walk in right now

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.860
 It does look saucy

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.860
 Okay

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.860
 Does this look like beer or not?

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.860
 It doesn't look like you're pulling a pint

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.860
 What an advertising way that would be if you were pulling a pint

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.860
 It looks more like pig weight

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860
 Have you got a mixer?

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.860
 Should we stir it?

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.860
 Yeah

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.860
 We're going to stir it with a ruler

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.860
 Oh this is very disappointing

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.860
 Oh come on, if you went to a pub and you got a pint looking like that

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:46.860
 You'd send it back

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.860
 For the listeners, it's looking like...

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.860
 I would describe its colour as yakult

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.860
 Yes

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.860
 Yes

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.860
 It's very...

00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.860
 Hang on

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.860
 Yeah

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.860
 There's not much of a head on it

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.860
 Well that's what that's supposed to happen, I think if you give it a few minutes

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.860
 Maybe it looks like it's getting darker

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.860
 Oh it's like a Guinness, you've got to let it rest for a bit

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.860
 There you go

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.860
 Wow

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.860
 It is getting darker

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.860
 So this is like the old candy cigarettes

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.860
 Well that's what I was thinking

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.860
 The alcohol equivalent of that, that's awesome

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.860
 You could have this, it's like children's beer

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.860
 And then some children's cigarettes as well

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.860
 They first ever detention for having candy cigarettes

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.860
 Did you?

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.860
 Yes

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.860
 Yeah, I sat at the back holding it like this

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.860
 Like a sort of...

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.860
 How would you describe this pose for the listener?

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.860
 Like a 1920s sort of...

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.860
 Yeah, like a Lana Turner

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:41.860
 Yes, I was holding it as if it was as long as Cruella de Vil's cigarette

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.860
 And I've quite understandably got sent out to a detention

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.860
 I think maybe momentarily she thought it was a real cigarette

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.860
 Probably if you're at school and there's quite a lot of people are actually smoking cigarettes

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.860
 Seems a little bit harsh

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.860
 I was also doing donuts in my car because it was Grand Theft Auto

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.860
 Oh it's looking more beer right now

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.860
 That's done, she said that looks like beer

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.860
 Yeah, definitely it's got the frothy head

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.860
 It's got the...

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.860
 It's a light

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.860
 It's gone from Yakult to...

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:10.860
 It's still quite...

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.860
 It's a bit carling, isn't it?

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.860
 Yes, I would say

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.860
 Oh that's very nice

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.860
 Is that?

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.860
 It's sort of sweet, it's slightly sherbet-y, refreshing

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.860
 Maisie, do you want some?

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.860
 I'm alright

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.860
 I like that more than I like any actual beer

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.860
 Yeah, it tastes like cream soda to me

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.860
 Oh yeah, cool

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.860
 That's what that tastes like

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860
 Delicious

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.860
 Okay, great

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.860
 Even the way it clings to the glass is very beer-like, isn't it?

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.860
 Yeah, they've absolutely nailed it

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.860
 Except for the taste

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:44.860
 Well, we were doubters at first but it's very far away from Yakult now, isn't it?

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.860
 Yeah

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.860
 I'm a convert, I like that

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.860
 Is anyone going to...

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.860
 No, you can have it, yeah

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.860
 Yeah

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.860
 Can I tell you a headline from this spring?

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.860
 Yeah

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.860
 Florida Man uses chat GPT to land plane

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.860
 Oh no

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.860
 What?

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.860
 Really?

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.860
 This is a passenger called John Williams

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.860
 It was a Boeing 737, quite a big plane

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.860
 The plane got into difficult, the pilot got into difficulties rather

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.860
 Anyway, I got to the end of this article, was staggered by it

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.860
 and found this little footnote at the end

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.860
 We thought it would be fun to share a light-hearted article that is not meant to be taken seriously

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.860
 It was an April Fool

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.860
 It was published on the first...

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.860
 And then you look back in the tiny, tiny font they've said published first of April

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:30.860
 But imagine being in a plane, the pilot's taken unwell, you Google it, this is on the first page of results

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.860
 Brilliant, you're like, "Thank God!"

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.860
 Okay, I'll just get on the chat GPT

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.860
 And then getting to the end of the article

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.860
 And then you just say, "How do you fly a plane?"

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.860
 And it just goes, "A plane?"

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.860
 It's a plane, it's a transport instrument

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.860
 Ron Atkinson almost had to land a plane once

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.860
 Did he?

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.860
 Yeah, he was in a flight

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.860
 Well, that's what he did

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.860
 Oh, Teddy is co-pilot

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.860
 God, you're worried chat GPT is landing

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.860
 Imagine Mr Bean coming over the tunnel

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.860
 So he was flying, I think, with his family

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.860
 or certainly a small group of people

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.860
 and the plane's pilot sort of just conked out

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.860
 and he had to take controls

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.860
 and he was flying the plane, they were talking to ground control

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.860
 and fortunately they got the pilot back awake

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.860
 so he could land it, but potentially

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.860
 Wow

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.860
 Rowan would have had to have landed his own plane

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.860
 God, that would have been a weird awe-haul

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:32.860
 Alright, there you have it, there are all of our outtakes

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.860
 If you want to get in touch with me, Andy, James or any of the guests

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.860
 Once again, that's Beck Hill, Maisie Adam, Jenny Colgan, David Mitchell

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.860
 Sophie Duker, LL Shemahi and almost Neil Gaiman

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.860
 You can find them at multiple places

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.860
 Be it Twitter, Blue Sky, Threads, Instagram

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.860
 Most of them have accounts on those places

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.860
 So check them out, go say hi

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.860
 and we'll be back again with more Clubfish bonus features

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.860
 very soon in the near future, okay

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.860
 See you then everyone, have a good one, goodbye

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:07.860
