00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 Hey club fish members, welcome to your bonus bit of content. We've got an awesome bumper pack compilation for you today

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,900
 With the big names of the last nine months. You're gonna hear Beck Hill. You're gonna hear Maisie Adam

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,780
 You're gonna hear Jenny Colgan, David Mitchell, Sophie Juker, Ella Alshamahi

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,260
 And you won't hear Neil Gaiman, but you'll hear a clip from a show that he's on so technically he's on it because his breathing is

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,000
 Probably softly in the background. So almost featuring Neil Gaiman as well such a brilliant collection of nerds

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,300
 We were so excited to have them on but Anna's back now

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,700
 So this will be the last time for a while that we're gonna have lots of guests on

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,180
 Except for the fact that Andy's about to go away for a few weeks and so we'll have two more guests on but outside of that

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,420
 It's gonna be back to the original four, but we've massively enjoyed having all of our guests on

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,860
 So sit back now and enjoy some of the best bits that didn't make it onto the main show. Here we go

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:58,860
 [Music]

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:07,860
 In the 1990s Cliff Richard once brought Heath Cliff the Musical to the Hammersmith Apollo

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,860
 Oh, that's cool. Where Kate Bush was soon to perform. Yeah, imagine that. Heath Cliff the Musical by Cliff Richard

14
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,860
 He didn't call it Heath Cliff Richard

15
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,860
 Oh

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,860
 No, he didn't. Come on Cliff, it's there for the takin'

17
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,860
 [Laughter]

18
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,860
 See and seagrass is really interesting stuff. This is an initial diversion

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,860
 But basically it's the only I think it's the only flowering plant that grows underwater

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,860
 You get seaweed which kind of clings to things underwater and drifts about a bit

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,860
 But seagrass actually has roots that gets nutrients from the roots and it flowers

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,860
 And it flowers and then the bees have to put on like scooby to go down there

23
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,860
 But it's the best nectar and it's worth it

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,860
 And what's the point of the flowers if they don't because flowers are there to attract pollination aren't they from insects

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,860
 I think I guess there must be pollination from undersea creatures but with prawns

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,860
 Could be prawns. It could be prawns. What was that?

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,860
 No, currents aren't animals, they're spilt. They put them in a bun and they don't even squeal

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
 [Laughter]

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,860
 The police chiefs in Romania in a city of Timosora sent their officers to ballet classes

30
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,860
 In the hope of helping them manage the traffic with more grace

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,860
 Oh, that's good. It is useful. There's a lot of NFL players who study ballet in their career

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,860
 Like they weren't from ballet but they get into it because it helps them with movement, with fluidity, with stretch

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,860
 Yeah, there's quite a few. There's quite a few. There was one guy particularly who was drafted in 2022 for the Bears

34
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,860
 That's what he does. He does ballet and that helps to give him

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,860
 But I wonder how it would help a traffic cop

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:51,860
 It was meant to be that there were complaints about how their movements weren't being particularly well sort of clear

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:03:00,860
 If you're staccato, you're in a relationship with the traffic, aren't you? You're moving with it, you're guiding it, it's your partner

38
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,860
 Yeah, you've got four partners

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,860
 People need to understand what directions you're pointing in and if you're not clear with your movements or anything

40
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,860
 No, I got it. That makes sense

41
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,860
 Weirdly, when you're talking about the NFL players, I've started doing wrestling classes

42
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,860
 Oh, cool

43
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,860
 Because I want to get better at slapstick in comedy for kids

44
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,860
 Nice

45
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,860
 So I want to learn how to fall properly

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
 Oh, great. How's it going?

47
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,860
 I could fall on a mat

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,860
 But I haven't, but I'm not at floors yet

49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,860
 Is it like you're supposed to turn as you fall and land on your shoulder or is that something else that I'm thinking of?

50
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,860
 Well, it depends what you're doing, but most of the time it's called a bump and you go on your back to do a bump

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,860
 That's when they land on their back. You're basically landing between your shoulder blades

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,860
 And the key is you want to keep your hips sort of as high as possible so that your tailbone doesn't get hit

53
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,860
 Yeah

54
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
 What about your head?

55
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,860
 Your head, they need incredible neck muscles

56
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,860
 So they actually do exercises to strengthen their neck muscles so that when you fall, your neck can support your head and your chin up

57
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
 So that your head doesn't go back and bounce

58
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,860
 A lot of the sound though, interestingly

59
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,860
 Because normally if you do that, you don't actually make that much noise

60
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
 But you know how it's like bang, like when they do it?

61
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,860
 The sound comes from their arms

62
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,860
 So you put your arms out the same time that you fall and basically slap the floor as loud as you can

63
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,860
 And it's genuinely pain, I know people go, oh yeah, but the ring, it's got springs and stuff

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,860
 It's really not much at all, it's essentially made with car parts and plywood

65
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,860
 It is, yeah, it's painful

66
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
 What's your wrestling name?

67
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,860
 I haven't got one yet, but I quite like the idea of Big Heel

68
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
 Big Heel, love it

69
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,860
 I used to wrestle as a kid, I was called Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine

70
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,860
 I had a song and everything

71
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,860
 When you say you used to do it as a kid, this is, it wasn't professionally already Finn

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,860
 No, no, we used to do

73
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,860
 Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine, doot doot, was the song, yeah

74
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
 Oh, that's the whole song, is it?

75
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,860
 It was kind of a repeat of the Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine

76
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,860
 Sorry, is that a thing, Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine?

77
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,860
 Yeah, it's my name

78
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,860
 No, no, no, but is that an existing thing or is it a...

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
 Yeah, it's my existing wrestling

80
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,860
 No, did you take it from, were you inspired by something else or was it just a damn show?

81
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,860
 Oh, there's a lot of wrestlers called like the Tugboat and stuff like that, yeah

82
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,860
 And I get you like Thomas a lot

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
 I didn't give myself the name, it was given to me

84
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,860
 Danny the Tugboat Steam Engine

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,860
 By somebody who likes Thomas the Tank Engine

86
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,860
 Is the idea that you'll, like, you'll have to be pulled off unconscious after the wrestling bout is over?

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
 No, because the Tugboat pulls other people off, don't they?

88
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,860
 Like, the Tugboat helps someone to get into the, into the plot

89
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,860
 Yeah, exactly, I pulled a lot of men off in my right time as a, as a wrestler

90
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,860
 Um, you know the Lumiere Brothers, who we've mentioned a couple of times in this

91
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,860
 So they, two of the big pioneers of film, they hired the basement of the Grand CafÃ© in Paris

92
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,860
 In 1895, right, for a demonstration

93
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,860
 And when people arrived in the room, they saw the screen had been set up

94
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,860
 And they thought, ah, it's going to be another slideshow

95
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,860
 Uh, and George Melios was in the room because he was a pioneer as well

96
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,860
 But he, he thought, oh god, it's a projection, eh?

97
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,860
 Which kind of stationary images

98
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
 He said, I've been doing this for ten years

99
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
 And then the screen started moving

100
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,860
 And Melios said, we stared flabbergasted at this site, stupefied and surprised beyond all expression

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,860
 At the end of the show there was complete chaos

102
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
 Wow

103
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
 I just, imagine, I mean, it must have been an amazing moment

104
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
 Yeah

105
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,860
 The first time that was truly demonstrated

106
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
 Yeah

107
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,860
 And then Lumiere Sr, so the Lumiere Brothers dad, he was involved in the same kind of business, photography and images

108
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,860
 He said he was not going to be selling the process

109
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,860
 He got immediate offers on the spot, you know, 10,000 francs, 50,000 francs to find out how to do it

110
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,860
 And supposedly, I love this, he told Melios, my son's invention is not for sale, it would ruin you

111
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,860
 It can be exploited for a short while as a scientific curiosity

112
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,860
 Beyond that, it has no commercial future

113
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,860
 Wow

114
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
 I know

115
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
 Amazing

116
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
 Yeah

117
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,860
 Gotta imagine seeing that being in the room for that

118
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,860
 It would have been incredible

119
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
 Yeah

120
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,860
 The greatest thing about Doctor Who is the fan base

121
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,860
 It really kind of does have the most extraordinary fan base to the point where the fans have become Doctor Who

122
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
 Like, that's, it's quite rare

123
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,860
 So

124
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
 How do you mean?

125
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,860
 Okay, so David Tennant basically became an actor because he wanted to be Doctor Who

126
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,860
 Peter Capaldi obsessed with Doctor Who to the point where the president of the fan club of Doctor Who

127
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,860
 When Peter Capaldi was a kid was sending messages to other people going, this Capaldi kid won't leave me alone

128
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
 He's so annoying

129
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
 Wow

130
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,860
 He's haunting my time as president of, he's demanding, he should be president, he keeps sending in letters

131
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,860
 He keeps sending in fan art, he keeps sending in corrections

132
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,860
 Capaldi was obsessed and he did go on to become a Doctor Who

133
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,860
 And then Tennant, of course, if you know Tennant's life well, you'll know that he is married to the daughter of a previous Doctor Who

134
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
 Which is Peter Davidson

135
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,860
 Is he?

136
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,860
 Yeah, so

137
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,860
 Who also played his own daughter in the show Doctor Who?

138
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:05,860
 Yes, yeah, so George, George Mothlis is her name and she comes on to Doctor Who playing Doctor Who's daughter during David Tennant's, no, hang on

139
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
 What?

140
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
 No, sorry

141
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
 It's all tiny white stuff, it's a bit confusing

142
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
 So his wife plays his daughter?

143
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,860
 That's how they met, yeah, they met on set

144
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,860
 Yeah, he's married to one Doctor and the daughter of another

145
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:31,860
 My favourite social media post of all time is from George Mothlis as she's standing in her lounge room and both David Tennant and her dad, Peter Davidson are trying to change a lightbulb

146
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,860
 And the caption is "How many doctors does it take to change a lightbulb?"

147
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
 Nice

148
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,860
 If you've got a sonic screwdriver

149
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,860
 You can use it on your research

150
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,860
 Jesus, I'm so proud of you, this is great

151
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:52,860
 I read an article with Peter Capaldi from 1974 where they called him Scotland's biggest Doctor Who fan

152
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,860
 It's around online, you see it every now and then, don't you?

153
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,860
 I have to say when I started writing for the show when I was 13, I entered a competition to meet Doctor Who

154
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:08,860
 When I entered was Tom Baker, so I must have been about 12, and then when I won it was Peter Davidson, which made me less happy, but made my mother quite a lot more happy

155
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,860
 So it kind of balanced out

156
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,860
 And having worked in Who and met lots of people from Who, everyone my age entered that competition

157
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:25,860
 The amount of people, yeah, absolutely, the amount of people David Tennant entered, lots of the writers entered, the amount of people I met when I go "I won that W. Smith competition"

158
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
 They're like "Oh no, it was you!"

159
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,860
 So I think there is a definite, I think particularly for the people that play the Doctor because it's in every territory in the world

160
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,860
 It's one of Britain's biggest exports, it's one of Britain's huge financial exports

161
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,860
 And so for the rest of your life, you're going to have to be the Doctor, so you're going to, you cannot

162
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
 Wait, so you won the competition?

163
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
 Yes, I did

164
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,860
 What are the odds? That's amazing

165
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
 I'm so very excited about it

166
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
 Yeah, that's awesome

167
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,860
 So yeah, so this picture is me with Peter Davidson and Monsters, and here's a really nice thing that happened

168
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,860
 I got an email out the blue from BBC Archives one day saying "We're doing some archive business"

169
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,860
 And we believe that you were present for the taping in front of us in like 1983

170
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,860
 Can you confirm it? Were you there on this day? And I was, and I was 12

171
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,860
 And I'm down in the official BBC archive on the production line

172
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,860
 Oh nice, an update

173
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,860
 The fans, the fans in Paris, the mantle of running the show

174
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,860
 They're always quite clicky butchers, especially if you go back into like the middle ages and stuff

175
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,860
 Being a butcher was a really important job obviously in the city

176
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,860
 But also you couldn't sell dodgy meat, so there were lots of laws basically for the butchers

177
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,860
 For what they could and they couldn't do

178
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,860
 I was reading some offences from the 14th century in London

179
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,860
 And you could be arrested if you're a butcher for cutting the meat improperly

180
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
 So too much or too little

181
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
 Selling measly pork

182
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,860
 And measly pork is pork which looks like it's got measles

183
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,860
 So it's got a disease on it and it's got little pock marks in it

184
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
 You weren't allowed to kill any animals on a Sunday

185
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,860
 And you weren't allowed to run around the town in a cloak but not a gown

186
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
 What? Even when you're off shift?

187
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
 Even at any stage if you're a butcher

188
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,860
 You can't wear a cloak? Why? What did a cloak have connotations on?

189
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,860
 I couldn't really work out exactly what the reasoning behind that was

190
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,860
 But it was definitely against the rules for butchers

191
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,860
 But there was this thing basically in London, you had the fishmongers and the butchers

192
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,860
 They were very clicky and they wouldn't hang out with each other

193
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,860
 It's like western storeys

194
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
 Exactly like that, exactly like that

195
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,860
 And so they would, if you had like let's say the two or three days before Easter

196
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,860
 They were the best times when you could sell your food

197
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,860
 Yeah

198
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,860
 Because you couldn't buy anything over Easter

199
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,860
 And they would have special places where the best places to buy your food are

200
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,860
 So over the bridges was one and stuff like that

201
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
 So there was really good places

202
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,860
 And they say only the fishmongers are allowed here or only the butchers are allowed here

203
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,860
 And whenever they said only the fishmongers are allowed here

204
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,860
 The butchers would kick off and they go in and they start smashing up the fishmongers places

205
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
 But they'd walk up clicking like that

206
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,860
 And in 1443 there was a battle of fishmongers versus butchers in London

207
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,860
 Of who would get the prime spots on Easter Eve

208
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
 Lovely

209
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
 And one fishmonger was very badly wounded

210
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
 Yeah

211
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
 But yeah, the fishmongers were usually royalists

212
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
 The butchers were usually parliamentarians

213
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,860
 Really?

214
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
 Later on

215
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
 Oh my god, it's like Celtic Rangers

216
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
 It really is

217
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,860
 And like there were three fishmongers who became Lord Mayor of London

218
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
 And no butchers did and that was a really

219
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,860
 That feels sus, doesn't it?

220
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
 Yeah, exactly

221
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,860
 It was like a big deal whether you're on the butcher side or the fishmonger side

222
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
 Wow

223
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
 Isn't that amazing?

224
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
 That is really cool, I had never heard that

225
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
 I was reading about the clothes that they had to wear

226
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,860
 So you know they have this stripey

227
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
 Oh yes

228
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
 So

229
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
 Like Fred Elliott

230
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,860
 Literally I was just about to say I was like Fred and Ashley

231
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,860
 In Coronation Street

232
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
 Coronation Street

233
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
 I'm just moving things back to my home turf now

234
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,860
 Right, I don't believe this before I say it to you

235
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,860
 Why are butchers apron striped?

236
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,860
 I think I got this from a workwear website

237
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
 Well, can I say are they red and white stripes?

238
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
 Yeah

239
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
 No, I think they're blue and white

240
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
 Oh are they?

241
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
 I was thinking like it would cover the blood but yeah

242
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
 Oh yeah, some are blue and white

243
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,860
 Sometimes they wear all white to show how clean the place is

244
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
 Oh that makes sense

245
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
 Because otherwise they'd be covered in blood

246
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
 Oh yeah

247
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
 And that's a really bad sign

248
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
 So no, these are the blue and white ones

249
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,860
 Is it because they're on Man City fans?

250
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
 That's right

251
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
 Is it slimming?

252
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
 It's slimming

253
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,860
 The stripe design and I'm just quoting here

254
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,860
 The stripe design and number of stripes signify the level of skill of the butcher

255
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,860
 A broad stripe means the butcher is master of their trade

256
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
 Wow

257
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
 A single stripe means the butcher works without apprenticeship

258
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,860
 So it's like getting a new belt and karate, you get a new apron

259
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
 Yeah

260
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
 With the status symbol

261
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,860
 And I don't think that still is the case

262
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,860
 No, I don't think, I've never heard that before

263
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,860
 On the karate thing, I heard on another podcast lateral

264
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,860
 That the reason that the, it goes from white belts to black belts

265
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
 It goes like yellow doesn't it

266
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
 Yeah

267
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
 And then something else and brown then black

268
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
 It's supposed to be a snooker

269
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,860
 You have to have a red fight between all of the others

270
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,860
 And wear a waistcoat

271
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,860
 That sounds way better than my version

272
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,860
 But what I think it is is it's like they would get dirtier

273
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,860
 So the more fights you would have, the more dirty your belts would get

274
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,860
 And so it would be, I'm not sure why yellow would be the first one

275
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
 You'd piss yourself

276
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,860
 You'd piss yourself of the fear after you

277
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
 But eventually your belt would be

278
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
 Dan's got a brown belt

279
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,860
 There's that famous one about what animals do you think you could fight

280
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,860
 Where we have mentioned it before

281
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,860
 6% of Americans think they could beat a grizzly bear in a fight

282
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,860
 Only half of those surveyed thought they could beat a medium-sized dog

283
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,860
 That's interesting

284
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,860
 I do think I could beat a medium-sized dog

285
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
 Well, it's hard to

286
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
 What's a medium-sized dog?

287
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
 Labrador

288
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
 Labrador

289
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
 Oh, it's just a dog

290
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
 It's just a dog, yeah

291
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,860
 But there were other surveys done about, let's say for example

292
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,860
 Sorry, I just say that those people who don't think they could beat them

293
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,860
 Maybe they feel I can't bring it in myself to fight a medium-sized dog

294
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,860
 I would also say no to that question

295
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,860
 I actually just realised what we've implied is that I think I could beat up a Labrador

296
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,860
 I actually don't want to do that

297
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,860
 Especially not for the blind person

298
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,860
 Can I say a couple of things quickly because I was very impressed that

299
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,860
 Both Oxygen and Fizzy Drinks came out of Leeds

300
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,860
 I thought, what else came out of Leeds?

301
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
 Mel B

302
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
 Mel B came out of Leeds

303
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,860
 That's our holy trinity

304
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,860
 Oxygen, big wee

305
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
 Scary Spice

306
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,860
 Scary Spice

307
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
 Yeah, so yes, absolutely correct

308
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,860
 And maybe you'll know all of these actually, Maisie, being from there

309
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
 Go on

310
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
 What famous board game came out of Leeds?

311
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,860
 Oh, is it?

312
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
 It's not Cludo, is it?

313
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
 It is Cludo, yeah

314
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
 Is it Cludo? I thought that was Cludo

315
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
 Cludo was invented in Leeds

316
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,860
 But it was a game that was bought by the founders there, Wallingtons

317
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,860
 And it was a different game, it was originally called Murder

318
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,860
 And it was repackaged and it was turned around, named Cludo Popdown

319
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
 So that was in Leeds, yeah

320
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,860
 What famous American building was designed

321
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
 Was built in Leeds

322
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,860
 No, was designed by someone from Leeds

323
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
 Oh

324
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
 Yeah, from Pudsy, I should say

325
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,860
 Oh, okay, well

326
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,860
 It's definitely, it's not the Empire State, I feel like I'd know that

327
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
 Oh, that's a good one

328
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
 Is it that one in Chicago?

329
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,860
 No, it's built in 1800, completed in 1800

330
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,860
 Completed in 1800, that's very old

331
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
 Yeah

332
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
 It's really old

333
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
 What's that old in America?

334
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,860
 Well, the White House

335
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
 What state is it in?

336
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
 Hang on, hang on, they couldn't have designed a new White House

337
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,860
 12 years before the White House was burned down in the war of 1812

338
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
 But I'm talking about the original White House

339
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,860
 Oh, you're saying they built it, and then it got burned down

340
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
 And then they built another one

341
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,860
 I think that's what happened

342
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
 That is the timeline, isn't it?

343
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,860
 You fiction on in Leeds designed the OG White House

344
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
 I don't know

345
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
 No

346
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
 It was Melby

347
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,860
 It's not that, but someone from Leeds, from Pudsy, designed the US Capitol building

348
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
 Oh, really?

349
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
 Yeah, yeah

350
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
 Okay

351
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
 Yeah, Benjamin La Trobe

352
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
 Is Pudsy the bear?

353
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
 Yes

354
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
 From Pudsy

355
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
 Pudsy, yeah

356
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
 From Pudsy and Leeds

357
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
 Oh, really?

358
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
 Yeah

359
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,860
 Oh, Pudsy was not on notable people from Leeds Wikipedia

360
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
 Wow

361
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
 Entry needs to get in there

362
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
 That's why he's called Pudsy

363
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
 Yeah

364
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
 Because he's from Pudsy and Leeds

365
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
 And then just last thing, Grand Theft Auto is from Leeds

366
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
 One of the biggest franchise video games of all time

367
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
 Grand Theft Auto

368
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
 Well, the first edition is Leeds

369
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
 The first edition

370
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
 I don't know what kind of set it is

371
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,860
 I was going to say, there's some parts of Leeds where it's like being in the game yourself

372
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,860
 It's just probably better for the video game aesthetically to look like Miami

373
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,860
 Yeah, but the concept was Leeds

374
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,860
 It was a Leeds company, Rockstar Leeds, who created it

375
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
 How interesting

376
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,860
 I got two last bungling criminals

377
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,860
 One guy called Derek Mosley

378
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,860
 He went into a store, not armed with anything but a baseball bat, attempting to rob it

379
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
 Unfortunately, it was a gun shop

380
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,860
 The manager immediately pulled out a gun

381
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,860
 and held him there until the police came

382
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
 And then this one, my favorite one

383
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,860
 1996, a store manager in California, robs a store

384
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
 The store that he's the manager of

385
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
 He then reports the robbery

386
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,860
 and then the police come

387
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
 The police then ask him to give a detailed description of the criminal

388
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,860
 bringing a sketch artist in

389
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,860
 And unfortunately, due to incredible lack of imagination

390
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
 he details his exact face

391
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,860
 and they look at it and go, "But that's you!"

392
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,860
 and he went, "Oh shit, yeah, I did it!"

393
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,860
 I can't think of any face

394
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,860
 Just give him a different nose

395
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,860
 Think of it, there must be more than one kind of nose

396
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
 His nose was unlike this

397
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
 Quickly back to Kate Bush before we finish

398
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,860
 She's got a song called "Pie"

399
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,860
 where she sings the number "Pie" to 78 decimal places

400
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,860
 There's other words as well, it's like the chorus is the numbers

401
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,860
 And the problem is she gets the 54th decimal place wrong

402
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
 No!

403
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,860
 Okay, if you're gonna do a song about pie

404
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,860
 you've either gotta get it right

405
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
 or it's gonna be tongue-in-cheek

406
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
 but don't actually sing it

407
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,860
 In fact, she goes to 78 and then she misses out from 78 to 101

408
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
 Oh god, it gets worse!

409
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860
 Yeah, it's really bad

410
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,860
 But more or less on the BBC, they looked at this

411
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
 and they said, "Actually there's a theory

412
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,860
 that if you look at pie, because it goes on forever, the number

413
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,860
 every sort of list of numbers will be in there somewhere"

414
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,860
 And so they think that even maybe she wasn't reading the first hundred and something

415
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
 She was just reading a section of pie

416
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,860
 From an area that we haven't even got to yet

417
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
 But does she start by saying "three point"?

418
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
 Because then that's like...

419
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,860
 Yeah, that's a good point

420
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,860
 But we actually don't know whether every single string of numbers is in pie or not

421
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,860
 That's an unproven bit of maths that people are still trying to work out

422
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,860
 Which more or less called the "Catebush Conjecture"

423
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,860
 Because if it's true, then she didn't get it wrong after all

424
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860
 That's great, that's really funny

425
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,860
 I think you've completely knocked out the theory with the "three point"

426
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
 It's at the beginning of the song

427
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,860
 It's a lot holding on that first verse

428
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,860
 She might have been talking about Newcastle winning in the Champions League

429
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,860
 They got three points yesterday

430
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,860
 Oh yeah, she voted a song about Newcastle's winning in the Champions League

431
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,860
 And then immediately goes into reciting patterns

432
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
 That's classic Bush

433
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
 Yes, exactly

434
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,860
 You know that thing of when people take bagels

435
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,860
 When people have a bagel and then it's got poppy seeds on it

436
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,860
 And then they fail a drugs test

437
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,860
 I think we probably have mentioned that in this podcast before

438
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,860
 Because it can make athletes fail tests if they've had poppy seed bagels

439
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,860
 Here's a thing that happened a few years ago

440
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,860
 In 2013, a hospital took a newborn baby away from its mum

441
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,860
 For five days because she'd failed an opiate test

442
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,860
 Which was entirely because she'd had a bagel

443
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,860
 She just had a bagel and then she'd had a urine test or something while in hospital

444
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,860
 And the last thing she'd eaten before giving birth was a poppy seed bagel

445
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
 Wow, that's amazing

446
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,860
 It's awful, I don't think it's amazing Dan, I think it's really bad

447
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
 No, it's amazing that that package is what I mean

448
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,860
 I should start doing that and taking babies away

449
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,860
 But that's pretty amazing that that's not on the walls of hospitals saying

450
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,860
 Make sure not to have a bagel prior to birth or something like that

451
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,860
 No, you're allowed to eat the bagels, it's just that the test shouldn't have found it

452
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
 I think so

453
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,860
 Because I mean, I don't know if you're aware of this because you do have three kids

454
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
 But they give you a ton of drugs when you're having kids

455
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,860
 Yeah, yeah, I took a lot

456
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,860
 My wife did natural, but I was absolutely off my head

457
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,860
 When you write one of the novels for it, Jenny

458
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,860
 Are you allowed to make up any monster or do they sometimes say

459
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,860
 No, a monster made of 50 million bees is a silly monster to have

460
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,860
 Funnily enough, a monster made of 50 million bees or anything that's very difficult to do on television

461
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,860
 Is very good to do in a novel

462
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:18,860
 So one of the last stories I wrote was about a creature that sucked up all the oceans

463
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,860
 Because it was impossible to film and the whole thing is done when they're trying to run from boat to boat

464
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:29,860
 So anything that's out and in fact, my first novel from that was again it's set entirely in the water in the Viking seas

465
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,860
 Anything that's really hard to shoot, putting the tARDIS on water on screen is a nightmare

466
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:40,860
 So anything that's very difficult to do and big and expensive needs to go in a novel

467
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,860
 It's the old, you know, Simpsons crashing 50 helicopters into house

468
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,860
 It costs them no more money than someone walking into a room

469
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,860
 So you do have to be a bit...

470
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,860
 At one point I had Matt Smith diving to save someone from the water

471
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,860
 And he removed his trousers and shoes

472
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,860
 Oh here we go, here's the wrong comm element

473
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,860
 Well no no, he came back and said the doctor never takes his trousers off

474
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,860
 So that's our red line

475
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
 Did you have the doctor take his trousers off?

476
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,860
 Well, if you're running to save someone in the water, then take off your shoes and trousers

477
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
 It's common sense

478
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,860
 And so I'd written it without thinking about it, it was just like what do you do?

479
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
 And you're running into the water and it just came back with the big mic going

480
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,860
 No, the doctor does not know if they're crowds or is never

481
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
 I never knew Andrew

482
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,860
 Do you remember the, do we talk about this, the Anthony Horowitz thing?

483
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,860
 Because he wrote the J, Anthony Horowitz wrote the Bond books

484
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,860
 And he wrote one where Bond is naked

485
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,860
 And yeah, we did mention this I think, but he wrote one where Bond is like

486
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,860
 He springs out of bed naked because there's a killer or someone at the door or whatever

487
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,860
 And the note came back from the estate saying "No, he needs to be wearing formal pyjamas which button to the neck"

488
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,860
 And that's so unsexy

489
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,860
 It's like a moral beacon for children, I'd have thought, but good

490
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,860
 Have you guys heard of mutton Jeff?

491
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
 It means deaf

492
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,860
 Comedy double-act?

493
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,860
 Well, like really old comedy double-act from the 40s or 30s

494
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
 Yeah

495
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,860
 It's a pairing that's been used quite a lot

496
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,860
 The first instance of it as far as I could find was from Bud Fisher

497
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,860
 He did it as two cartoon characters, it was the first ever

498
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,860
 He's a cartoonist, Bud Fisher, and he created these two characters, mutton Jeff

499
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,860
 Oh, I thought you said mutton Jeff, like "Oh, the guy gets me my lamb down the ride"

500
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
 It was beefy Bill, Larry the lamb

501
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,860
 The dodgy butcher, like "Yeah, I just got this off the back of a trombone"

502
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,860
 Where were you last night, mutton Jeff?

503
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,860
 Yeah, no, it was the first daily comic strip in the States, supposedly

504
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,860
 When historians are trying to pin that down, it always comes up, 1907

505
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,860
 And mutton Jeff is what you actually call good cop/bad cop

506
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,860
 It's what that dynamic is based on these two characters who were two mismatched tin horns, they were called

507
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,860
 And mutton Jeff, it's used everywhere now to sort of describe that dynamic

508
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,860
 But yeah, good cop/bad cop is mutton Jeff

509
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
 Wow

510
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
 Which doesn't work, good cop/bad cop

511
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
 Does it not?

512
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,860
 No, and they've done experiments of, you know, scientists have carried out experiments to sort of emotionally destabilize the subjects

513
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
 And then ask them questions

514
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,860
 Okay, here's one, there was students being asked to answer questions about their work in an interview setting

515
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,860
 Or to lie about a fictional job

516
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,860
 And they were interviewed by a neutral interviewer

517
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,860
 And then there was someone else in the corner taking notes, a second interviewer

518
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,860
 And that second interviewer either looked supportive as they were taking notes or they looked hostile and suspicious

519
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:39,860
 And basically people who were telling the truth gave detailed answers if that second person looked supportive

520
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,860
 You know, they gave better answers, more informative

521
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,860
 So it became easier to tell who's lying

522
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,860
 So you sort of just need good cop/normal cop

523
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
 Okay, right

524
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,860
 Or normal cop/good cop, you know, but there's not much use for

525
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
 Just a good cop

526
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
 Just a good cop

527
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
 Probably

528
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,860
 But does the bad cop not just make the good cop seem gooder?

529
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
 No

530
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:08,860
 Well, I think that's the thinking behind it, but actually it just stresses people out and I think makes them more likely to lie

531
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:16,860
 So Byron's thing was, he said a line that was so potently harsh that it sort of became the reason for Keats dying

532
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,860
 Which was that he, what did he say, the critics killed him basically

533
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
 Oh yeah, there was this idea

534
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,860
 He got some really crunching bad reviews for a couple of his epic poems, there's one called Endymion

535
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,860
 Which, and he got a terrible review and the consensus later was, well, he died of reviews

536
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
 And he didn't, he died of tuberculosis

537
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
 Yeah

538
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
 And the reviews were years before he got the TB as well

539
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,860
 Is it possible though to die of reviews?

540
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,860
 Because I...

541
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
 Are you doing it again with this shit?

542
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,860
 No, my doctor says it's better to die

543
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:52,860
 But no, so after Keats died, so he dies in Rome, in the arms of his friend, Joseph Severn, who's a painter

544
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,860
 And then he, Keats, in his dying days, he says, I don't want my name even to go on my tombstone

545
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,860
 So the famous line on his tombstone is, here lies one whose name was writ in water

546
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,860
 He knows this very amazing talent, but ephemeral, that he's passed, you know, he's passed out of the world

547
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,860
 And it's a little bit, kind of, poor me, but his friends, they did that, they put that

548
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
 Here lies one whose name was writ in water

549
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,860
 They decided, no, we think he deserves a bit more than that, so they added, above it

550
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:28,860
 Wow

551
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,860
 Which, I think, removes the power of the beautiful, no more fragrant message that he thought of

552
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,860
 It's even worse than that, because if you go and visit Keats's grave, and as you say, he wanted it to be anonymous, you know, when no one's there

553
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,860
 The grave right next to him basically says, I'm with Keats

554
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
 No

555
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,860
 It does, because it's his mate, Joseph Severn, who was buried there

556
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,860
 That's so funny

557
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,860
 Says, to the memory of Joseph Severn, devoted friend and deathbed companion of John Keats

558
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,860
 And so everyone now knows that it's right next door

559
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
 Wow

560
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,860
 All the graves in that grave, I was just saying, like Keats, three down

561
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:14,860
 Yes, it's odd, there's a lot of kings getting bits of them buried in a different place, and the Habsburgs were mad for it

562
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,860
 I think they had almost like a tradition, I can't remember where, I'm afraid, but like the body in one place and the heart somewhere else

563
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,860
 There's a place in Vienna that I started reading about, hearts being buried separately to the rest of the individual

564
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,860
 And the hearts, there are 54 Habsburg hearts in one crypt in Vienna

565
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
 Wow

566
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,860
 That's quite romantic

567
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
 And they've all got their own hearts

568
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,860
 Yeah, yeah, I suppose it is, yeah

569
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,860
 I'll spend Valentine's Day with you next week

570
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,860
 Well actually, he was like quite pedantic, wasn't he?

571
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
 Was he?

572
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,860
 Because he had that book that you mentioned, The Style?

573
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
 Oh yeah, the Elements of Style

574
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
 Elements of Style

575
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,860
 And if you read that, it's all about how everyone's grammar is terrible

576
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:00,860
 And, you know, for instance, the word "non" is in the singular, so you should say "none of us is ready" rather than "none of us are ready"

577
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:10,860
 Or you should never start a sentence with "however", and you should never turn a noun into a verb, so you shouldn't say "I was hosting a party"

578
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,860
 Because that's turning, you know, the host is a noun and you shouldn't turn it into a verb

579
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:26,860
 I absolutely hated the passive voice, so you know, like, you should say "the dog bit the man" and not "the man was bitten by the dog", that's what he thought

580
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:35,860
 Although the first sentence of his book says "this book is intended for use in English courses in which the practice of composition is combined with a study of literature"

581
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,860
 Which has got two examples of the passive voice in the first sentence

582
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,860
 That's really good

583
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,860
 That's such an interesting book because it was originally written by someone else, it was called William Strunk Jr.

584
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:56,860
 And then E.B. White came in and did a revised expanded edition, but he gets as much of the credit of the book, but it's a weird example of a book sort of getting second

585
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,860
 He liked it a second edition, almost like adding loads of extra stuff

586
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
 Yeah, exactly

587
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:10,860
 Well, in his Sex Necessary book that he did with James Thurber, who then went on to become one of the cartoonists for the New Yorker

588
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:16,860
 In 1950, Thurber was supposed to write an introduction to the book's latest edition at that point

589
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,860
 And he contributed just a couple of paragraphs, then wrote to White on the side

590
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,860
 "If you know anything about sex, let me know"

591
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:29,860
 Do you know what the rainbow bridge is, if I say that phrase?

592
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
 No, no

593
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,860
 Ah, well, that completely...

594
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
 Oh, should we know it?

595
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,860
 Well, the rainbow bridge is an extremely well-known phrase for when your pet dies

596
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
 Oh

597
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,860
 And it's from a kind of poem which is known all over the world about how your dog crosses the rainbow bridge

598
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,860
 And it becomes young again, and it's in a lovely place with lots of dogs to play with

599
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,860
 And then one day it'll peel off because it can smell you coming

600
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,860
 You see, so it's been a source of comfort and joy all over the world, and most people have heard of it

601
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:06,860
 And the woman who wrote it is 82, and she wrote it when she was about 13, and she lives in Inverness

602
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:13,860
 And they found her this year, her name is Edna, and she had written that when she was a teenager

603
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,860
 Somebody in her family had passed it on to somebody else

604
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,860
 Who'd passed on, and eventually her husband got hold of it when they were married

605
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:27,860
 And he'd given it to someone who went to America, where they published it in the Dear, one of those American columns

606
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:35,860
 Ask Abbey, where it had been read by 100 million Americans, because it was a syndicated column

607
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,860
 How was it like just anonymous at the time?

608
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,860
 They didn't, they had no idea who it was

609
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,860
 And you can even see in the original Ask Abbey, she says "Oh, I don't know who this is from"

610
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,860
 And it's just full of letters from Americans in tears and so on

611
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,860
 It spread everywhere, and when we had a dog that died, we got a lot of commiserations and said they're at the rainbow bridge

612
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,860
 It's the kind of way that you say "I'm sorry that your animal died"

613
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,860
 And until about last year, she had no idea

614
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,860
 And then it came up and she went up to her attic and she said "Yeah, here it is"

615
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
 It was the original piece of paper in a book

616
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
 That's so cool

617
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,860
 That's amazing, you should go visit, you're so close to her, you should go meet her

618
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:19,860
 I think it would be, I kind of work quite heavily off getting paid for writing that idea

619
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:25,860
 This is one of the most published poems in the world, and she did not even know

620
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
 That's incredible

621
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,860
 Neanderthals, I think we can say they were a bit like reindeer in one respect

622
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
 Really, can we?

623
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,860
 Yeah, please tell me

624
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,860
 They're big noses, which they use to heat up cold air

625
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
 And reindeer do that

626
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,860
 As in they had great big sinuses and chambers and just a warm up freezing cold air

627
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,860
 So actually that's highly debated now

628
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,860
 Oh man, why don't you have experts on this?

629
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,860
 That was the, it's contentious

630
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,860
 So some people think it's more about the amount of oxygen they needed to take in

631
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,860
 Because loads of them were living in, they were cold adapted

632
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,860
 But loads of them were living in Iraq and the Iberian Peninsula

633
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,860
 When it wasn't necessarily cold, so it's not straightforward

634
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,860
 Because they did have very very shiny noses, didn't they?

635
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
 Yeah, okay

636
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
 And there were elves at the time

637
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,860
 Actually, I think they were because there were hobbits around on a different continent

638
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
 Is that the homo, what they call it?

639
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
 Homo floresiensis

640
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:38,860
 Yeah, apparently in the original paper they were called Sudanthropus florensianus

641
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,860
 Which means they thought it meant a man from the Sunda region of Flores

642
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,860
 But actually it translated as flowery anus

643
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,860
 Wow

644
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,860
 Does anyone know what Marxist glue is?

645
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,860
 What might that be?

646
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
 Marxist glue

647
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,860
 It sticks to everybody according to their need

648
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
 No, no, no

649
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,860
 It was a good try and what was a very difficult prompt

650
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:12,860
 I don't like this live-reviewing feature we've just enabled

651
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,860
 Marxist glue

652
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,860
 Is it a special kind of Soviet glue that was used only in Russia?

653
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,860
 Actually, no, used in the West by Marxists

654
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
 Oh, is it for like protests?

655
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
 Yes, glue is used in protests

656
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,860
 Like the suffragettes manacled themselves to things, but other people glue themselves to things

657
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,860
 Very less strong glue made from wheat and water

658
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,860
 So it's very cheap, not used to glue yourself to something

659
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
 Do you glue something else to something?

660
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
 Posters

661
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,860
 Be more communist, please

662
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
 Very cheap

663
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
 This isn't the idea at all

664
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,860
 Pop it up there straight away

665
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
 You're not giving anything to international capitalism

666
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,860
 You're not giving anything to big print

667
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
 You're just a bit of wheat

668
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,860
 Yeah, absolutely

669
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
 The thing is it just sticks to what?

670
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
 It's very, very easy and cheap to make

671
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,860
 But once you put it on a wall

672
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,860
 You really can't get it off unless you really scrape it off

673
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
 And they used it quite a lot in history

674
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
 To lose the Trek, for instance

675
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
 He would put all of his posters up using this stuff

676
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,860
 And his posters became really popular and really expensive

677
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
 And people would pay a lot of money for his posters

678
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
 For the Moulin Rouge or whatever

679
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,860
 And so you would get people who would follow him around Paris

680
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
 Trying to grab his posters off as soon as he put them on

681
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,860
 Because they knew as soon as this Marxist glue had dried

682
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,860
 They would not be able to get it off anymore

683
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
 That's great

684
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
 It's a bit banksy-ish, isn't it?

685
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,860
 Yeah, it is, I guess

686
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
 That's very cool

687
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,860
 Does anyone want a Japanese soft drink?

688
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,860
 This is children's beer

689
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
 It's a soft drink that I've got from Japan

690
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,860
 Wow

691
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,860
 And you pour, on the front it's got a picture of a beer

692
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,860
 And a drunk looking child

693
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,860
 And you put it in a glass and you pour water on it

694
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,860
 And apparently it looks and tastes like, well it doesn't taste much like beer, I don't think

695
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,860
 I'm so up for this, this is amazing

696
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
 That sounds so good

697
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
 It's like a normal white powder

698
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,860
 Just a normal white powder

699
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,860
 It looks very saucy, someone's to walk in right now

700
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,860
 It does look saucy

701
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
 Okay

702
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
 Does this look like beer or not?

703
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
 It doesn't look like you're pulling a pint

704
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,860
 What an advertising way that would be if you were pulling a pint

705
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
 It looks more like pig weight

706
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
 Have you got a mixer?

707
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
 Should we stir it?

708
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
 Yeah

709
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,860
 We're going to stir it with a ruler

710
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,860
 Oh this is very disappointing

711
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,860
 Oh come on, if you went to a pub and you got a pint looking like that

712
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
 You'd send it back

713
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,860
 For the listeners, it's looking like...

714
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,860
 I would describe its colour as yakult

715
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
 Yes

716
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
 Yes

717
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
 It's very...

718
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,860
 Hang on

719
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
 Yeah

720
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
 There's not much of a head on it

721
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,860
 Well that's what that's supposed to happen, I think if you give it a few minutes

722
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
 Maybe it looks like it's getting darker

723
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,860
 Oh it's like a Guinness, you've got to let it rest for a bit

724
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
 There you go

725
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
 Wow

726
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
 It is getting darker

727
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
 So this is like the old candy cigarettes

728
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,860
 Well that's what I was thinking

729
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
 The alcohol equivalent of that, that's awesome

730
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,860
 You could have this, it's like children's beer

731
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,860
 And then some children's cigarettes as well

732
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,860
 They first ever detention for having candy cigarettes

733
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,860
 Did you?

734
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,860
 Yes

735
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
 Yeah, I sat at the back holding it like this

736
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
 Like a sort of...

737
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
 How would you describe this pose for the listener?

738
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
 Like a 1920s sort of...

739
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,860
 Yeah, like a Lana Turner

740
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,860
 Yes, I was holding it as if it was as long as Cruella de Vil's cigarette

741
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,860
 And I've quite understandably got sent out to a detention

742
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,860
 I think maybe momentarily she thought it was a real cigarette

743
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,860
 Probably if you're at school and there's quite a lot of people are actually smoking cigarettes

744
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
 Seems a little bit harsh

745
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,860
 I was also doing donuts in my car because it was Grand Theft Auto

746
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
 Oh it's looking more beer right now

747
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
 That's done, she said that looks like beer

748
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
 Yeah, definitely it's got the frothy head

749
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,860
 It's got the...

750
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
 It's a light

751
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,860
 It's gone from Yakult to...

752
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,860
 It's still quite...

753
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
 It's a bit carling, isn't it?

754
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,860
 Yes, I would say

755
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,860
 Oh that's very nice

756
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,860
 Is that?

757
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,860
 It's sort of sweet, it's slightly sherbet-y, refreshing

758
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,860
 Maisie, do you want some?

759
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,860
 I'm alright

760
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
 I like that more than I like any actual beer

761
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,860
 Yeah, it tastes like cream soda to me

762
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,860
 Oh yeah, cool

763
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
 That's what that tastes like

764
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,860
 Delicious

765
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
 Okay, great

766
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,860
 Even the way it clings to the glass is very beer-like, isn't it?

767
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,860
 Yeah, they've absolutely nailed it

768
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,860
 Except for the taste

769
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,860
 Well, we were doubters at first but it's very far away from Yakult now, isn't it?

770
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
 Yeah

771
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
 I'm a convert, I like that

772
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
 Is anyone going to...

773
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
 No, you can have it, yeah

774
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,860
 Yeah

775
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,860
 Can I tell you a headline from this spring?

776
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,860
 Yeah

777
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,860
 Florida Man uses chat GPT to land plane

778
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,860
 Oh no

779
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,860
 What?

780
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,860
 Really?

781
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
 This is a passenger called John Williams

782
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,860
 It was a Boeing 737, quite a big plane

783
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
 The plane got into difficult, the pilot got into difficulties rather

784
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,860
 Anyway, I got to the end of this article, was staggered by it

785
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,860
 and found this little footnote at the end

786
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,860
 We thought it would be fun to share a light-hearted article that is not meant to be taken seriously

787
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,860
 It was an April Fool

788
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
 It was published on the first...

789
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,860
 And then you look back in the tiny, tiny font they've said published first of April

790
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,860
 But imagine being in a plane, the pilot's taken unwell, you Google it, this is on the first page of results

791
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
 Brilliant, you're like, "Thank God!"

792
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
 Okay, I'll just get on the chat GPT

793
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,860
 And then getting to the end of the article

794
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,860
 And then you just say, "How do you fly a plane?"

795
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,860
 And it just goes, "A plane?"

796
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,860
 It's a plane, it's a transport instrument

797
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,860
 Ron Atkinson almost had to land a plane once

798
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,860
 Did he?

799
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
 Yeah, he was in a flight

800
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
 Well, that's what he did

801
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,860
 Oh, Teddy is co-pilot

802
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
 God, you're worried chat GPT is landing

803
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,860
 Imagine Mr Bean coming over the tunnel

804
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,860
 So he was flying, I think, with his family

805
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
 or certainly a small group of people

806
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,860
 and the plane's pilot sort of just conked out

807
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
 and he had to take controls

808
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
 and he was flying the plane, they were talking to ground control

809
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,860
 and fortunately they got the pilot back awake

810
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,860
 so he could land it, but potentially

811
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
 Wow

812
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,860
 Rowan would have had to have landed his own plane

813
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
 God, that would have been a weird awe-haul

814
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:32,860
 Alright, there you have it, there are all of our outtakes

815
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,860
 If you want to get in touch with me, Andy, James or any of the guests

816
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,860
 Once again, that's Beck Hill, Maisie Adam, Jenny Colgan, David Mitchell

817
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,860
 Sophie Duker, LL Shemahi and almost Neil Gaiman

818
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
 You can find them at multiple places

819
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,860
 Be it Twitter, Blue Sky, Threads, Instagram

820
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,860
 Most of them have accounts on those places

821
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,860
 So check them out, go say hi

822
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,860
 and we'll be back again with more Clubfish bonus features

823
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
 very soon in the near future, okay

824
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,860
 See you then everyone, have a good one, goodbye
