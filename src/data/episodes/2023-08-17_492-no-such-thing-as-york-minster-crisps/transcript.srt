00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we started this week's show, wanted to

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,920
 introduce our very special guest who was live at the Soho Theatre with us a

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,000
 couple of weeks ago when we recorded this. He is none other than the mighty

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,080
 Richard Osman. You might know him from Pointless, you might know him from

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,060
 Richard Osman's House of Games, his appearances on QI, his appearances on

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,280
 every other brilliant British comedy panel show ever made, and he is also the

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,480
 author of a series of books called The Thursday Murder Club. And if you have

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,960
 read a book in the last few years, there is a pretty good chance that it was one

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,920
 of the Thursday Murder Club novels because they are absolutely titanic.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,240
 They have broken so many records they have sold millions of copies. The first

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,080
 three in the series are called The Thursday Murder Club, The Man Who Died

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,800
 Twice, and The Bullet That Missed. They're about a gang of retired sleuths who live

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,880
 in a retirement village in Kent. They like going through case notes of old

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,360
 murders and then they find crimes start happening a little closer to home.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,680
 They're honestly such good books. They managed to pull off the trick of being

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,960
 simultaneously gripping and thrilling and they are page turners. You have to keep

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,440
 reading, you have to find out what comes next, and also being heartwarming and

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,360
 joyful and very human. And the characters are beautifully drawn. There is a reason

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,720
 they have sold so many millions of copies around the world and that's

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,200
 because they're really good. We are all huge fans of them and the next in the

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,120
 series is called The Last Devil to Die, very exciting title, and it is out soon.

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,120
 It's out on the 14th of September. It is available to pre-order now from

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,080
 wherever you get your books. It is a safe bet that anywhere that sells books

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,840
 will be selling The Last Devil to Die and they will have lots of copies. So

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,720
 that's it. We just wanted to say we're super excited to have Richard on. We've

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,160
 been trying to get him for years and finally he's free, so we really hope you

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,320
 enjoy this show. We had a blast recording it. We hope you like it too.

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320
 On with the podcast.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:02:05,080
 [Applause and music playing]

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:13,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,160
 This week, coming to you live from the Soho Theater!

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,120
 and Richard Osman, and once again we have gathered round the microphones with

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,360
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,800
 here we go. It's already with fact number one and that is Richard.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,520
 Tumbridge Wells does not have a Waitrose.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,600
 For anyone who's not from England, I should explain, Waitrose is a

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,560
 very high-end supermarket and Tumbridge Wells is the sort of town you would be

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,920
 absolutely fucking insane to think didn't have one.

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,000
 And when you write a novel there's a wonderful group of people called

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
 copy editors and they're the greatest people in the whole world and copy

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,960
 editors pick up on every single little thing in a book.

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,200
 I wrote in one of my books that Joyce, who's the head of the Thursday Murder

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,320
 Club or one of them, she gets a drink from a trolley

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,120
 on a train from Polgate to Victoria and the copy editor says,

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,680
 they stock trolley service on that route in 2008. So just to give you an idea

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,960
 of how good they can be, they pick up on every

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,480
 single thing ever. The one thing they didn't pick up on,

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,240
 I sent someone to Waitrose and Tumbridge Wells and nobody

50
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,480
 even bothered to check because why would you?

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,440
 And now people at Tumbridge Wells are furious with me.

52
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,120
 That's incredible. I reckon it's like a dirty secret of the people in Tumbridge

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,160
 Wells that they don't have a Waitrose, right? Well no, because Richard's told

54
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,400
 them they do, so it's kind of... No, but I think Richard picked a really sore

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,120
 subject for them. So I started looking into this. Yeah.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,800
 There has been a sort of decade-long campaign in Tumbridge Wells

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,360
 to get a Waitrose and for whatever corporate reasons, maybe they're just

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,120
 doing it for the fun, Waitrose keeps saying, I'm so sorry, we just can't find

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,200
 a space. We just can't find a site. Like 2016, this story

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,400
 ran, shoppers in Tumbridge Wells are fuming after a new

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,440
 store to open in the town was revealed to be a Wilco.

62
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,280
 Imagine they put up the W and everyone's like, whoa!

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,040
 Look, it's tight and they get their fear, because Tom Bridge,

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,040
 just a few miles away, they've got a Waitrose.

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,600
 Yeah. They've only got 8,000 people. Tumbridge Wells, as we all know, has 56,000

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,720
 people. So good. Weirdly, my wife's family

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,720
 live down in Heathfield. That is weird. And I get...

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,640
 Whoa! Why has he never mentioned that before?

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,720
 Nine years, nine years, I've been sitting on that, but I thought Richard's brought

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,280
 the Waitrose Tumbridge Wells fact, and so I get off at Polegate all the time.

71
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,720
 And I know there's no trolley service. So hold on, right, two

72
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,120
 questions. A, are you my fact-checker? B, why didn't you pick up on the

73
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,160
 Tumbridge Wells thing when you were my fact-checker? I think if Dan was your

74
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,400
 fact-checker, you would know about it by now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,400
 This book is much longer than when I sent it in.

76
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,080
 Also my three sons were born in Tumbridge Wells, so I'm really rooted there as a

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,680
 kind of... Yeah, my history now is... Did you pop down to the Willco to buy a

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,840
 celebratory? I did! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,840
 Well, we did a gig in Tumbridge Wells, and I got to meet the daughter of a

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,160
 barbershop guy. He's passed away, he ran a salon there, and he was the seventh son

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,640
 of a seventh son, which means he's a wizard,

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,720
 and he had the Guinness World Record for shaving most faces

83
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,640
 in the shortest space of time. He did like a hundred faces in something like 10

84
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,960
 minutes. They just came... Do you remember, he was a military guy, and he just went

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,320
 and he kept... He was covered in blood. I was a very member.

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,200
 Weirdly, the next day, the local morgue broke the record.

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,440
 I think another name for a barbershop guy is Barber.

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,720
 I was confused when Dan said barbershop guy. I was thinking... And both my parents are

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,560
 hairdressers, I don't know why that came out like that.

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,400
 I was thinking, is he the baritone?

91
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,840
 I did. In the most recent book that I bought out, I sort of did an apology of

92
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,960
 sorts. Joyce, who writes a diary through the books,

93
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 she goes to Tumbridge Wells, and she said, "I had read somewhere

94
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,320
 there was a Waitrose, but there isn't, so whoever wrote that had got it wrong."

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,760
 Oh, wow. And that's my apology to the people of Tumbridge Wells.

96
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,280
 I have a little quiz for you, Richard. Okay. How many times do you mention

97
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,040
 Waitrose in the Thursday murder club? Just in the first book?

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,000
 Yeah, in the first book. I mean, is it over a hundred or less than a hundred?

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,200
 I'm going to say I mention Waitrose, the word Waitrose. Yeah.

100
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,440
 Eight times? Five times. Okay, okay. Sainsbury's?

101
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,040
 Okay. Three times? Twice. Okay. Starbucks?

102
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,320
 Starbucks. I think they definitely go to a Starbucks in an airport at one point.

103
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,680
 Oh, and they go to... There's a lot of Starbucks.

104
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,120
 I'm going to say four times. Three. Dan, are we going to go through all the words,

105
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:29,000
 just a super line. I've only got Tesco, Azda, Lidl, Acosta and Aldi to go through.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,640
 I mean, I do need people to buy these books. There's murders as well.

107
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,760
 It's not all just shops. I'm just saying for the next book,

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,120
 if you need the fact checker, I kind of know all the shops you mentioned.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,600
 That's very kind. My daughter, who speaks Chinese, was reading the Chinese version

110
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,440
 of the book, and literally the footnotes are longer than the actual book itself.

111
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,400
 She said, "Even on the first three pages, they'd had a footnote explaining what

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,200
 Oliver Bonus was, who Mark Duggan was, and what Lilt is."

113
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:05,160
 I can speak Chinese. So if you need somebody to speak Chinese to fact check that book,

114
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,320
 I am also available. I mean, we're going to have to take your word for that.

115
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,520
 I definitely did speak Chinese. Just said that would have been fucking out there if I did.

116
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,320
 What a way to get cancelled. I feel like I need to help the

117
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,720
 non-English listener about these supermarkets in the UK.

118
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,960
 So a little bit of information. I read there was some research done by the Sex Education Show,

119
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,840
 which was a channel for classic, and they looked at people who went to different supermarkets,

120
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,280
 and they found that people who shop at Mark's and Spencer's are big fans of sex parties.

121
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,960
 They do such big cakes, don't they?

122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,960
 Is that Colin Caterpillar in your pocket, or are you just going to see me?

123
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:59,320
 I should say it's double the national average, which particularly isn't that high in the first

124
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,560
 place. Or people who like sex parties. People who go to Iceland are more likely to be involved in

125
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,600
 cosplay, and people who go to Waitrose are more likely to use nipple clamps.

126
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,240
 So just a little bit of context for the... And people who go to Lidl like it up the middle aisle.

127
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:25,160
 You never know what you're going to find in there, do you? You never know what you're going to find.

128
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,200
 Hey, baby, I've come back with a kayak.

129
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:36,760
 So mistakes in books. There were some which are, you know, you get your typos, you get your small

130
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,080
 factual ones. I think my favourite one that I found out was there was the Bridget Jones book,

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,600
 the return of Bridget Jones after a long, long gap for the third book was called Mad About the Boy.

132
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,760
 And there was a bit of a typo in that book, because readers when they bought it suddenly

133
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,720
 started reporting back to the shops that about a quarter to halfway through the book there was

134
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,800
 suddenly 40 whole pages of David Jason from Only Fools and Horses order biography in there.

135
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:09,560
 Just 40 pages of him talking about his Uncle Albert. And was that Helen Fielding just absolutely

136
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,400
 phoning it in and thinking, no, what if Bridget just read someone else's book for 40 pages?

137
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,120
 What a great idea. Let's just call it Mad About the Delboy, no one will notice.

138
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,840
 Well, it's just a printing cock up. Yeah, so they had to return in pulp and all that sort of stuff.

139
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,600
 There was a thing, this might, this is maybe an author's nightmare, something that happened to

140
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,480
 Jonathan Franzen, the big American novelist. He was recording a reading for Newsnight of his book

141
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,920
 Freedom, which was absolutely massive as a mega book. And he stopped halfway through the reading

142
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,960
 and he said, I'm sorry, I'm realizing to my horror here that there's a mistake here that was

143
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,000
 corrected early. And they printed the wrong version of the book. They printed an early file of book.

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And it was obviously, you know, full of all the bits he didn't want to be read. And yeah,

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,840
 just sounds like it was a British version. And this this was like called The Book of the Century.

146
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,000
 He'd been working 10 years on it. It was a massive book. And they published like something

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,360
 like 80,000 copies. Wasn't this previous book called The Corrections? Yeah.

148
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:14,680
 Oh, that's a that's a nightmare. You wake up in a cold sweat when you've handed a book in,

149
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,560
 thinking just little things like about, could he've got there on Tuesday if he was there on

150
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,680
 Friday? You just think you've missed something. Because by the time it gets printed, maybe 10

151
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,160
 people have read it, maybe 12, something like that. So it's not many. So if we all miss the same

152
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,240
 thing, yeah, that's it. You could get this book when everyone just goes, why did you not notice

153
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,960
 that the yeah, I think, oh, my God, it literally. Yeah. Can you tell I've got a book coming out

154
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,440
 really soon? Yeah. So you're terrified. Remember that when our first book was just going to the

155
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:49,320
 printers, you literally rang our produce. I had a lucid dream the night before the book went to

156
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:57,320
 print. Bullshit. You've never had a lucid thought in your life. So I honestly, I was really sweating.

157
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,880
 We did a book where it was called The Book of the Year. And in it, we made references to all

158
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,240
 all over the book. So you would say, see this article and you would go to it. And

159
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,320
 the introduction was full of these things. So I was having a dream. And this was I was down in

160
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,880
 Tumbridge Wells. So I just got the pole gate. I mean, I was in sorry in Heathfield. Yeah, yeah.

161
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,880
 So my in-laws picked me up from pole gate. I'm starving because the trolley service is gone.

162
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,480
 So I'm so off I go to the Heathfield Costa anywhere.

163
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,640
 So in the dream, I'm and this is true. I'm showing Frank Skinner our book. And I'm saying,

164
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,480
 look, Frank, this is how the intro is and all these words. And and I read in the book a reference

165
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,800
 to something that I knew was not in the book. And then I kept reading. And this is I'm now

166
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,720
 awake in the book reading the book going, that's not in there as well. That's not in there as well.

167
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,880
 I wake up and I grab a PDF of the book. And it turns out I'm completely right. We forgot to

168
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,840
 change the new articles. And I managed to get through to Nigel, our editor, in the morning.

169
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,520
 And he stopped it from going to print, had to be printed within the next two hours. And he sent

170
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,480
 a new PDF in the little thing. And I managed to change it the last second. Yeah, a lucid dream

171
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:10,840
 with Frank Skinner. One of the world's great heroes, my friend. Can you imagine what would have

172
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,640
 happened to us as a nation? Wow. Things, things could have been really going to shit now. Yeah.

173
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,560
 I was reading about some errors in rap songs. So this is rap songs that could have done with a

174
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,440
 fact check. All right. I've removed some of the more choice words from these. But there's a song by

175
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:41,480
 Common featuring Cannabis. And they said, I'm your worst nightmare squared. That's double for those

176
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:58,360
 who ain't mathematically aware. Although, if your worst nightmare is two, there's a song by Drake

177
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,760
 who says, I could wrap around those others like a cobra snake. Cobras are venomous. They're not

178
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:12,920
 constrictors. Major laser said, make yourself bigger like mushroom Mario Kart. He's referring to

179
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,960
 Super Mario, not Mario Kart where they make you go faster. And Nelly once wrote, I'm a sucker for

180
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:31,880
 cornrows and manicure toes. And he meant pedicures. That's nice. Amazing. I hope we have beef with all

181
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,360
 of them now when this goes out. Come at me, Major laser. Let's see where the fuck you are.

182
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,840
 Let's see. The very first, very first thing I ever had published in my life had a typo in it.

183
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,640
 I was like 15 years old and there was a magazine in Brighton called The Punter. And at one point

184
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,720
 they said, oh, we want someone to write just a little small thing about some of the towns outside

185
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 Brighton. And I lived in a place called Haven Seath. So I said, I'll do Haven Seath and Burgess Hill.

186
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,080
 I said, I'll do both of them because I think it was seven pound each. So I wasn't just going to

187
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,280
 do one of them. So I wrote this thing and it came out. It's the first time my name's ever been

188
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,760
 in print. First thing I ever saw. And it said at one point, Burgess Hill is like Haven Seath

189
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,560
 with anemia. And my mum read that, she went, that's pretty good. I went, yeah. Yeah, it's not bad,

190
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,880
 is it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Burgess Hill is like Haven Seath with anemia. And one of my teachers,

191
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,640
 he lived in Brighton, said, I read your thing. Burgess Hill is like Haven Seath with anemia.

192
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,280
 He said, that's pretty good. That's not bad. I go, well, listen, just stuff comes into my head.

193
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,440
 What I'd actually written was Burgess Hill is like Haven Seath with a cinema.

194
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:39,720
 Which was factually correct.

195
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:53,160
 It is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that after successful amnesties on

196
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,440
 knives and guns in 2016, a Scottish council offered an amnesty on Zimmer Frames.

197
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,280
 And this is the thing, you get happens all the time that they have these amnesties,

198
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,280
 because everyone's got old Zimmer Frames in their house or all walking sticks. Everyone.

199
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:18,280
 Fact check. Have a look. Yeah. Well, no, you're right. But a lot of money is tied up hundreds of

200
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,840
 thousands of pounds in walking sticks that are given out or Zimmer Frames. And then like you

201
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,920
 injure yourself, they give you on after a little while, you get better. You don't need it anymore.

202
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,840
 You use it as a clothes toss. Yeah, yeah. They reckon there's something like 160,000 pieces

203
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,880
 of equipment that are needing to come back that haven't come back. Yeah. Yeah. So they had this

204
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,000
 amnesty and they got lots handed back in crutches to walking sticks walking. So like an amnesty is

205
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,480
 one of those things to say, look, if you deliver your knife or gun, you will not be prosecuted.

206
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,160
 Yeah. We will not send you to prison. You know, if you delivered a Zimmer frame like two years

207
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,400
 later said, I'm so sorry, we found this in my mother's house and we've tracked you down. We

208
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,640
 realized this is where it's come from. You're not going to get a prison. Yeah. They actually,

209
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,440
 a lot of a lot of people, a lot of people were wrongly banged up. Oh, rightly. If you look at it

210
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,720
 that way, I think so. Yeah. Um, no, you're right. It was, yeah, yeah, amnesty was a kind of sexing

211
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,760
 up way of putting it, but, uh, yeah, they were no punishments. Yeah. They had a load of them in

212
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,640
 the 80s and 90s. I was reading in the newspaper archives. Um, in Hull, they said that people

213
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,960
 using them to hang clothes on, like I said, and that's why they, they all got missing in the

214
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:34,280
 world. They said people using them to grow climbing plants. Uh, Torbay made a special

215
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,920
 Zimmer frame bin so you could return them anonymously if you were a bit worried about

216
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,760
 handing them in that you might get. That's a big, big, huge bin. I was really waiting for you to say,

217
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,920
 and in Tombridge, they used them for their sex parties. Well, I got one link with Tombridge

218
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,920
 Wells slightly, uh, and that is that the stairlift was invented in Tombridge Wells. Was it? Get away.

219
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:04,600
 Yeah. Um, like, so, wow. It's the navel of the universe. Yeah. So they, I mean, there have been

220
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,640
 old ones. I think Henry VIII might have had one, but that was just sort of like pulled up. Yeah,

221
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,480
 a stairlift. Oh, yes. Yeah, it was pulled up by people because he was so big at the end of his

222
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,120
 life. He couldn't get up the stairs. Uh, but this is an invalid chair with tramway for use on

223
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,520
 staircases that was patented in 1931, uh, enrolled Tombridge Wells by a guy called Walter Muffett.

224
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,760
 Okay. And the only other thing I could find about him is that he was once the oldest St

225
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,440
 John's ambulance member in the world. That's really good. That's very cool. I wasn't going to get

226
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,480
 out my stairlift fact right, like right at the beginning of this fact because it's incredibly

227
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:49,480
 boring, my one. Do you want to hear it? Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Okay. It's so shit. I got to

228
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,160
 stand on out because we have a discord for, um, people who are members of Club Fish who, uh,

229
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,400
 subscribers. Yeah. And they have a big conversation about the most boring fact you've ever said on

230
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,000
 fish. Yeah. This fact is going to, it's going to shove the others aside for the podium. I swear.

231
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,200
 Right. The 500,000th Stanner Stairlift ever made was produced in part by Prince Charles,

232
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,920
 who pressed the button to start the procedure. Oh, and he, I told you, I told you it was bad.

233
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,000
 Then he said, I'm someone who is a great admirer of family companies, particularly hereditary

234
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,880
 lift makers. Anyway, I started telling my wife this fact and she said, literally, wait, think to

235
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,440
 yourself, is this interesting? Think about it. That could literally be the title of the podcast.

236
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:48,920
 Have you got anything better than that? I've got something worse than that. I think I was looking,

237
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,360
 when, when I saw you talking about Zimmer frames, I'm always fascinated about, you know,

238
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 who Zimmer might have been because when you look inside companies, it's interesting. And I assumed

239
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,160
 he was German. He's not, he's American. And it's called Justin Zimmer. And it was a sort of post war,

240
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,840
 I think that he set up this company. It's one of the biggest companies in the world now,

241
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,720
 this company that he set up. So I was Googling him, but unfortunately, there's also a defensive

242
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,840
 linebacker for the Miami Dolphins called Justin Zimmer. So I literally gave up because everything

243
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,840
 was about him. So I can tell you that Justin Zimmer, the linebacker is now a free agent. He is now

244
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:26,680
 available because the Miami Dolphins cut him in preseason. So he's 30, but you know, still,

245
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,480
 I think he's got something in his legs. He's got time. Yeah, that's very cool. He, just in O Zimmer

246
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,960
 of Warsaw, Indiana, he also invented the aluminium splint for broken arms. The advantage of that was

247
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,760
 the old ones were like papier mache and the new ones just covered part of your arms. You could put

248
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,720
 it in a x-ray machine and you could still x-ray your arm, your broken arm without taking the cast

249
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,320
 off. So that was a good thing. That's very cool. I prepared a little quiz game quiz for you. Oh,

250
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,640
 great. Let's do it. Play your Canes, right? Yep. That's clear. What about Richard Osman's House of

251
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,240
 Canes? Yeah. There you go. All right. That would have been a lot better, hadn't it? That would have been,

252
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,080
 yeah, all right. Not getting invited back on that show. Right, I'll give you a cane and you have

253
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,400
 to tell me if it's worth more or less than the previous celebrity owned cane. Okay, cool. Oscar

254
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,200
 Wilde. Oh, it's all right. I'm going to say higher. Is it higher? It's harder than it looks,

255
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,760
 isn't it, Richard, this quiz show? Higher than zero, I'm going for. All right, Richard's off the

256
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,120
 blocks early. Yeah, Oscar Wilde with Inkwell, interesting, is walking stick a little Inkwell

257
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:38,040
 built into the top. Oh, that's nice. Cool. $7,700. Roughly. Okay. So James Craig, who was, of course,

258
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,240
 the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Okay. I mean, less, obviously. I'm going to go more.

259
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,880
 It's more. No. So James Craig's walking stick was sold for £10,000 at auction. It was full of

260
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:59,720
 cocaine. Oscar Wilde's cane was sold for $7,000. Yes. No. Yeah. What year? Like the 1800s? No,

261
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,360
 recently, this century. I don't think people have that. I think they like his writing.

262
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,520
 Yeah. I'm not sure the cane is the thing there. He had an Inkwell on talk. Like Oscar Wilde would

263
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,960
 have done. He had an Inkwell. That's a historical artifact. Michael Collins.

264
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,040
 The space. I doubt so. The Irish Republican leader.

265
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:28,920
 Sorry, it's an Irish theme. Play your canes right. Yeah, yeah. Right. Wow. More or less than £10,000

266
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,520
 for Sir James Craig. More. I'm going to say more. Yeah, it must be more. It is more.

267
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,160
 It's 50. So, again, that's a format problem because we all gave the same answer, didn't we?

268
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,680
 It's more. It's £52,000. Last one. Yeah, a lot. Oscar Wilde must be gutted.

269
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:54,760
 Labour leader Michael Foote. Oh, not Irish. Oscar Wilde always had a cane. Stephen Fry,

270
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,880
 the poster. He had a cane. I'm sorry. This is a historically important cane. Richard,

271
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,240
 if you want to get Dan angry at any point, just tell him that an item of very

272
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,080
 recondite celebrity memorabilia sold for less than Dan would have paid for it. He has steam

273
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,320
 coming out of his ears. Me and my friends just equally, like we've put in together,

274
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,480
 paid a lot of money for Sir Edmund Hillary's backpack. He's the one who got to the top of

275
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,120
 Everest Forest, but for his second expedition when he looked for the Yeti and we bought it

276
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,520
 and no one else bid, but... Wow. But you went straight in there at 50 grand, didn't you?

277
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,760
 How much did you pay for it? New Zealand dollars, it was 12,000. But in actual money.

278
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,480
 I think that's what, six quid? That is a translator. No, I think it's a few thousand.

279
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,840
 It is. But there was three of us and yeah. But no one else bid. Well, we accidentally,

280
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,280
 one of us outbid each other. We got two incredibly motivated buyers. It's so weird.

281
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,520
 I feel like that was taking your quiz seriously. Yeah, it does feel like no one's...

282
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,160
 No one's interested how much Michael Foote's cane was auctioned for. Okay, lower, lower, lower.

283
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,200
 Yeah, lower. I'm going to say lower. Thank... Oh. But what do you want to do? All right,

284
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,400
 I'll say higher for a bit of difficulty. Well, thank you. That's really kind of Richard.

285
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,520
 Yeah, it was obviously much less than it is. It was 650 pounds.

286
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:21,880
 Don't you interested? That's a bargain. Michael Foote. Foot, foot, cane, yeah? Yeah, okay.

287
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,920
 Bigfoot, they used to call him. Edmund Hillary found him. There was a cane up for auction

288
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,680
 recently for half a million dollars. Okay. You know what cane that was? Charlie Chaplains.

289
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,200
 Charlie Chaplains cane from Modern Times sold for $420,000. This one went for more?

290
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,480
 It was listed at more. Did Yoda have a cane or am I? Yoda has a cane, yeah. Who has a more famous

291
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:55,400
 cane? No, who is it? Michael Cain, no. It was Michael Cain. No, it wasn't Michael Cain. It was,

292
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,280
 it was a very normal cane but had a light on the end with batteries and it lit up and flashed. Oh,

293
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:06,600
 the lightsaber? It wasn't a lightsaber. It was used by a survivor of the Titanic. Oh,

294
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,400
 yes! On the Lifeboats. This is incredible. And she used it to signal. And it was essentially a cane,

295
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,800
 but I don't know why she thought to take it on the boat. Because what else is she using it for?

296
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,840
 Oh, on to the Lifeboats? Yeah, she took it on to the Lifeboats. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She

297
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,600
 signalled with it. And it was, it was the, the guide price was $500,000 and it went for $50,000.

298
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,320
 It went for $50,000? It went for $50,000. That's not even as much as...

299
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,240
 Michael Collins' cane. Well, he's been to space.

300
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:42,120
 So, come on. That's where he got the idea for United Island. Yeah, he looked down.

301
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,480
 But it was to be shared between 11 of her heirs and that they thought they were going to get

302
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,520
 half a million. They got, what's that, like 4,500 each they got in the end. Hey, here's the most

303
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,200
 significant walking stick in history. This, I think this genuinely has a claim to be the most

304
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:03,800
 important one. It was wielded by the Archbishop of Milan in 2005. Okay. So, come on, think of

305
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 your church history, what's happening in 2005. Roberto Baggio's Milan, was it that?

306
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,200
 And New Pope? New Pope. Yeah. And he was a, he was a very significant Catholic leader.

307
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:21,560
 Wow. You have gone downhill. What did bears do? Tell me, Andrew.

308
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,640
 Sorry, the Archbishop of Milan was a senior guy.

309
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:34,840
 And he might, he, like, I dread to think what my wife would say of that fact.

310
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,800
 The Archbishop of Milan was very senior. He could have, he could have been a contender,

311
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,200
 if you know, he could have, he could have made it to be Pope. And he appeared in public at the

312
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,920
 conclave, whatever it is, walking with a stick. And it was seen as a sign by the people, by the

313
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,440
 other cardinals who might have voted for him on block. He's saying, no, I'm sorry. Because they

314
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,640
 always vote for such youthful people, don't they? Right. They voted for Cardinal Ratzinger,

315
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,280
 who was the mid 80s. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah. Well, he would have been a very secret

316
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,160
 sign to say, like, I don't want to do it. Well, that's how it was interpreted. Yeah. And he would

317
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,360
 have been a very radical Pope. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Why? He was, he was pro contraception,

318
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,000
 pro, no, he wasn't. He was none of that. But he was, he was slightly more progressive, maybe,

319
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,280
 than the, the Benedict XVI ended up being. So, you know, I need to move us on in a second.

320
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,160
 Oh, some amnesties quickly, very quickly. So they quite often have these things where you

321
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:33,080
 can give in your weapons or whatever. And there was one quite recently where there was a rocket

322
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,480
 launcher was handed in in Cleveland. In Guernsey, they handed in a Klingon war sword.

323
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,400
 Oh, wow. In Birmingham, they handed in a three foot cannon.

324
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,680
 And in Hertfordshire, they handed in a herb cutter and a fondue fork.

325
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,080
 All right, we need to move on to our next fact. It is time for fact number three. And that is my

326
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,360
 fact. My fact this week is that in 2010, the annual Liars Club Lie of the Year award was marred

327
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,400
 with controversy when the winning liar was accused of having lied about his lie.

328
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:30,280
 Huge news. It's big. In Burlington, Wisconsin. So this is a club that began in 1929,

329
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,960
 because of a lie as well. The story is that two journalists basically decided to announce that

330
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,920
 there was a local lie of the year that happened. And they sent it out as a news story. And they

331
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,680
 thought it would disappear. But then the country picked up on it and it got spread around the

332
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,360
 country. And then as the next year was approaching, they were getting all these messages saying,

333
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,440
 "We're so excited for the Lie of the Year competition from the Liars Club." And so they had

334
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,160
 to then actually invent the Liars Club in order to have the Lie of the Year. So it's been going

335
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,200
 since 1929. And it's effectively, if anyone was reading every year, Edinburgh does the funniest

336
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,880
 jokes of the fringe, right? It's that kind of thing. It's that kind of thing. It's usually a

337
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,960
 bit of a joke. Exactly. So the lie was sent in by someone called David Mills. And he said,

338
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,720
 his lie was, "I almost had a psychic girlfriend, but she left me before we met." That was the lie.

339
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,800
 That's not a good lie. And every single lie that you read of the modern day Liars Club,

340
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,760
 it's just these one-liners. And it was discovered that that wasn't an original lie. That was

341
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,760
 someone, possibly Stephen Wright, the comedian. Oh, yeah. And then the two runner-ups were also

342
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,560
 stolen lies. So people were allegedly just taking funny lines off the internet and saying,

343
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,680
 "This is my lie." Exactly. Yeah. So the times have changed.

344
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,400
 So the Liars Club obviously had to deal with this. And they just came out and said,

345
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,360
 "Well, we don't care. That's fine." And so it just went on and they kept their championship. But

346
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,920
 yeah, it made me realise that there's a lying club. And it's not the good one. The good one is the

347
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,920
 British one. Did you read about the British one? The one in Cumbria. Yeah. Yeah. So this one in

348
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,680
 America has been going since the '20s. The one in Cumbria has been going since the '70s. And it

349
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:14,520
 was held in honour of a former landlord at the Bridge Inn. It was revived by his grandson,

350
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:22,600
 who was a 160-year-old former cesspit cleaner from Hungary. But it is essentially just the same

351
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 thing, isn't it? Although I think the Cumbria one, they tend to tell a bit more of a long story.

352
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,920
 You get five to seven minutes and you go up and you build this long story. So someone who won at

353
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,400
 one year has said that they took a wheelie bin as a submarine and travelled under the ocean.

354
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:43,000
 And it's a real whimsical tall tale. Yeah. Yeah. There was one in 2011, Glenn Boylan one,

355
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,880
 after telling a tale about crossing a whippet with a mink. But Paul Burroughs failed to defend

356
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:55,000
 his title with the story about a bishop and a magical sausage. The one in 1929 was supposedly

357
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,360
 won by someone who said that they'd seen a three-mile-long whale. And then the second year,

358
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,760
 they rang up and said to the people, "Okay, live the year. Last year was this thing. What's the

359
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,240
 live the year this year?" And they didn't have an answer because they didn't have a competition.

360
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:16,840
 And so they said that the local police chief had said, "I never tell a lie." And that was their lie.

361
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,960
 They kind of do a few things like that. So there was one year, a few years in,

362
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,000
 they had a thousand entries. So this was the fourth year in. And they had one from Canada.

363
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,160
 And they disqualified it because they didn't want it to be an international contest. And the head

364
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:37,000
 of the contest said, "Let the foreign countries pay up their war debts if they want to get in the

365
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,640
 Liars contest." That is a huge leap. You can imagine like Germany and Britain and Frasgar,

366
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,480
 we might as well pay up then. Yeah. Is there a war debt from Canada? Not as far as I knew, but you

367
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,240
 know. He knows about something, why me. Sue Perkins did it one year, the British one. And one.

368
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,480
 Yeah. Is she? Yeah, she's a winner of the Liars Club. Oh, I was. I told you he was a nice guy,

369
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,280
 Paul Hollywood. That's a joke. He is a nice guy. That's a joke. No, it was Mary Berry. It was Mary

370
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,000
 Berry. But there is a thing about what men and women lie about. Because I think there are

371
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,600
 surveys, various surveys that say, "Oh, women lie more." Or, "Oh, men lie more." And I'm sure

372
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,240
 there's almost nothing between it. But there seems to be a bit of evidence that women tend to lie

373
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:29,400
 more about positive feelings. You know, like, "Oh, no, it's nice." Or whatever. That's a really

374
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:38,360
 interesting fact, honey. You should do that on the show, absolutely. No, it's completely average,

375
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:49,480
 darling. And, you know, like, men, like, sort of boast lie more, you know. No, it's completely

376
00:32:49,480 --> 00:33:03,880
 average, darling. There is a thing that if children lie early on in their life, then it's supposed

377
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:10,280
 to be a sign of intelligence. So they did a thing where they gave kids a toy and put it behind them,

378
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,680
 and then they said, "Whatever you do, don't look at it." And then they left the room,

379
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,800
 and some of the kids looked at it, and some of them didn't, and some of them lied about it,

380
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,880
 and some of them didn't. And they found that when they looked in the future, or they didn't look in

381
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:30,200
 the future, in the future, in the future, when they looked back, they found that the ones who

382
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,920
 kind of lied about it had a higher IQ. The absolute best ones were the ones who didn't look at it

383
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,760
 and didn't lie about it. They tended to do better in future life. Someone at my primary school said

384
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:47,400
 that he wrote "Golden Brown" by the Stranglers. That's amazing. And he was, he was convincing,

385
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,280
 because actually if you think of the lyric, I was thinking, "Yeah, I could, yeah, I can see that."

386
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:57,800
 I was absolutely fooled. I found out the truth somewhere around 2017. Did you guys hear about

387
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,200
 Theodore Scharshmit? No, who's that? This is great. This is just a, he's a doctor, and he had, he was

388
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,520
 writing a report about lying, and a patient he'd treated who had a particular condition to do

389
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,920
 with lying. And this is amazing, right? In the 1990s, he had a patient who he nicknamed, because you

390
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,760
 know, when you write up patients, you don't give their name, you give a student name for them,

391
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,840
 he had a patient who he called Mr Pinocchio. And the reason for that was, if Mr Pinocchio ever tried

392
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:28,440
 to lie, if he tried to lie, he would pass out and have convulsions. Okay? There was something in

393
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,800
 his neural chemistry, which meant he couldn't do it. The only problem was he was a high-ranking

394
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:42,440
 European official constantly involved in negotiations. Every time he even so much as tried to lie,

395
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,440
 he would start having convulsions and passing out. And so it was a nightmare. Has he been involved

396
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,640
 in Brexit? Yes, on our side. And it's, yeah, and it's, he, he, it was a form of epilepsy. He had

397
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,280
 this tiny tumor. That is incredible. Tiny tumor inside his brain. It was operated on successfully.

398
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,960
 Is it a superhero thing, in a way? He'd be amazing Prime Minister, right? Yeah. You know

399
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,520
 he's telling the truth. I cannot tell lie. Prime Minister admitted hospital for 50th day running.

400
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,880
 It is like, if everyone knows that if you ever lie, you're going to do this, then they know

401
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,120
 that what you're saying is the truth. Yes. Except that he had the operation, had the tumor removed.

402
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:29,320
 Or did he? Those are the only people who aren't allowed to enter the Lies Club,

403
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,000
 isn't it? It's politicians. Politicians. Yeah, yeah. People with incredibly rare

404
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,960
 tumors. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Them as well. Yeah, yeah. It's a weird, yeah. It's a weird thing.

405
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,640
 Isn't it great? I'm just remembering an old childhood story when you're lied to as a kid,

406
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,240
 and you don't realize it until you're in your 20s. In this case, for me, I got told a story

407
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,880
 at school. I was at my friend Tom's house and I went to the toilet and there was no toilet paper

408
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,480
 there. And I, and I came out afterwards and I said to my friends, oh, they've got no toilet paper

409
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,880
 there. And then one of my friends said, oh yeah, none of them in the family wiped their bums. And I

410
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,600
 went, what do you mean they don't wipe their bums? And they said, they're all clean shitters. It just,

411
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,080
 it just happens. So they don't have toilet paper here. And then my other friend went, did you not

412
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,440
 know that about Tom? And I said, I know, I didn't know that about Tom. That's amazing. And so I believed

413
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,160
 for about 10 years. More than 10 years. No, no, no. You told us, you told us this anecdote at a time

414
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,200
 when you still believed it. Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. No, no, no. I remember this, I remember this

415
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:36,360
 clearly. Here's what I mean. Ten years in, the logic broke down for me because I thought that can't

416
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,800
 be possible. And instead of accepting the truth, I went, hang on, this is incredible. Are you telling

417
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:49,240
 me that the parents who are not related, because this could be genetic, they both don't need to wipe

418
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,120
 their ass? They must have been dating. And then they moved in and they just noticed the one toilet

419
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,680
 roll just kept hanging there. And then they produced non ass wiping children. That's what happened

420
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,520
 10 years after I continued the logic outside of it. And then it was, yeah, late 20s. It clicked. I

421
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:11,720
 was like, hang on a second, I think they were lying to me. Dan, does your wife ever give you

422
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,360
 advice about which facts to say on the show? She's never heard the show.

423
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:31,640
 It is time for our final fact of the show. And that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that

424
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,560
 unusual crisp flavours in history include prosecco, fish curry, buttered garlic scallop,

425
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,800
 vagina, and, and Arthur Scargill.

426
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:51,640
 Almost didn't let me get to the end of that one guys. This is, I know Richard, you're a big fan of

427
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:58,360
 crisps. I'm just, at some point you must have made a choice about which order to put those last two crisps in.

428
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:06,200
 Is it vagina, Arthur Scargill, or is it Arthur Scargill, vagina? Which of those is, which of those

429
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,880
 is funnier? I think, I think he made the right choice. Oh, thank you. Who is Arthur Scargill? I don't

430
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,800
 actually know. That's not really the important part of the fact. Okay. He was, what's a, what's a vagina?

431
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:27,800
 Arthur Scargill was basically the main guy in the minor strike in the 80s, I suppose it was. Yeah.

432
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,720
 And basically it was a guy who made some human flavoured cannibal crisps and they came in traffic

433
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,600
 ward and bank manager and Arthur Scargill flavour in the 80s. And he was going back because there

434
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,280
 were hedgehog crisps. And hedgehog crisps were really famous in the 80s. And he was kind of going

435
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,120
 in a slight sort of animal welfare thing and saying, well, you shouldn't really be eating

436
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:56,120
 hedgehog crisps, but why not eat Arthur Scargill crisps instead? Do you remember hedgehog crisps,

437
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,120
 Richard? I remember hedgehog crisps. I remember Arthur Scargill very well. I remember, yeah,

438
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,360
 hedgehog crisps was like everyone, it blew everyone's mind. And I was like about 10 or something

439
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:11,880
 and everyone just went, oh, you're kidding me. You, hedgehog crisps. It's like the funniest thing

440
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,120
 anyone had ever done in the history of the world. Someone had invented hedgehog crisps. They were

441
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,960
 just like, beef really, as anyone who's ever eaten hedgehog will know. So I don't think they had

442
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,920
 real hedgehog in them anymore than Arthur Scargill crisps had real Arthur Scargill. Now that was

443
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,400
 the problem, actually, because they called them hedgehog crisps and then trade descriptions said

444
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,480
 they couldn't use the name because they didn't have actual hedgehogs in them. And then later they

445
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,760
 called them hedgehog flavor crisps. Because this was actually in the early days of like proper crazy

446
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,800
 flavors of crisps. Yeah, right. And do we know what, do we know what Arthur Scargill, what he would

447
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,240
 have tasted like what the flavor was? To be honest, I think they were just branded like that. I think

448
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,720
 they just tasted of random beefy meat. Okay, right. He would have tasted like the solidarity of the

449
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:03,720
 working man, my friend, what he would have tasted like. He would have tasted a social justice

450
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,720
 Arthur Scargill. Have you heard, did you hear of Virgin Mary flavored crisps? So these were

451
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,200
 released in the last decade. This was 2013 by Pretta Monge. They released and they got a lot of

452
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,160
 complaints, obviously, from Christian and Catholic groups. And what Pretta Monge had intended was

453
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,200
 the non-alcoholic version of a Bloody Mary, Virgin Mary, tomato juice. It was basically

454
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,840
 a tomato flavor crisps, but they called them Virgin Mary flavor crisps. That's very funny.

455
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,960
 Is that the sort of thing the Pope would have been unhappy about or would he have been fine?

456
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,200
 If it had been the Archbishop of Milan, he probably... I wonder if the vagina crisps would have been

457
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,600
 available in the UK, because I was looking up what you're allowed to do as a product and release

458
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,880
 it. And there's so many rules with, particularly, companies' house. Tan feverishly got 15 tabs open,

459
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,480
 trying to find anywhere that'll ship these to you. I was just trying to find out about the

460
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,120
 trade's description rules, actually. It's a vagina. It's a hub. It's a New Zealand hub.

461
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:12,600
 But it's amazing. So there's been a list that's been revealed of all the company's names that have

462
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:18,520
 been rejected since 2019, and it's over 56,000 names. So I don't think vagina crisps would have

463
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:24,600
 made it into. So these are a few of the names that were applied for to say, "Can we be a business in

464
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,880
 the UK that we're rejected?" So you've got Anus Ale Limited, not allowed, Ass Cleaning Limited,

465
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:41,320
 rejected twice, Mick Shagger Limited, Bell End Holdings, and Little Prick's Acupuncture.

466
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:49,240
 None were allowed. Wow. That feels nice. The vagina crisps are made actually by a Lithuanian

467
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,720
 company, so you're right to be doubtful. They're called chas, and they look to the ingredients.

468
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:00,840
 So to get a vagina flavour, they use salt, onions, garlic, sugar, cream powder, yeast extract,

469
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,880
 lemon powder, parsley, black pepper, sour cream, and bay leaves. And they also come

470
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:15,240
 penis flavoured. Oh. And when I say come, I mean... And their flavouring comes from smoked salt,

471
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:22,360
 tomato powder, sugar, yeast extract, again, maybe some cross-contamination there, and spices.

472
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:28,120
 And they also sell Bosch flavour crisps, where all the money goes to Ukraine.

473
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,200
 So yeah, that kind of cool company I think. Wow. But is that... Do you think they've

474
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,480
 actually worked out that the average penis and vagina smells what those ingredients make up?

475
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,640
 And taste rather than smells, usually crisps.

476
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:49,080
 Oh, yes. Dan, you're about to lose your mind when you first taste a crisp. It's so exciting.

477
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:55,800
 I snort my crisps. Smell is very integral to taste.

478
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,160
 What they claim is that that did happen, that they got a load of experts in the field.

479
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,920
 Yeah. Which field was this?

480
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:10,120
 And they went to some flavouring experts and put the two together and they came up with this.

481
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,840
 Crikey. I haven't tasted them, so I couldn't possibly say.

482
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,360
 And they just... They left one packet of vagina crisps and one packet of penis crisps

483
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,480
 in the factory overnight. Next morning, a million packets.

484
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,000
 So, I found a slightly old claim, it was from about 10 or 15 years ago, and it was that

485
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,600
 half the crisps eaten in the EU, or what was the EU, are people eating crisps in Britain.

486
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,560
 That Britain ate half the crisps in the EU. That's a huge difference.

487
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,480
 Because crisps are not as much of a thing nearly on the continent. And they...

488
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,160
 Like, you might have an olive. You might have some sort of very civilised...

489
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,200
 They have laze, don't they? That's why I always notice when I go abroad.

490
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,440
 Yeah, but who buys the laze? It's British people on holiday, isn't it?

491
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,440
 It's British people abroad. Yeah.

492
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,840
 This goes right to the top, James.

493
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:59,080
 Is that why they call them late? Because it's kind of funny, it sounds a bit like having sex.

494
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,920
 And they think they're going to get English people to buy those.

495
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,600
 That's right. That's why they do it. Yeah.

496
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,200
 Wow. That's why I bought those biscuits in Montenegro called knob lice, isn't it?

497
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,120
 Wow. Anything to declare, sir?

498
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,720
 I have nothing to declare except this cane and these knob lice.

499
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,720
 But in Europe, they're paprika crisps, right? That's their favourite thing.

500
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,240
 Whereas we're the geniuses behind corn maze snacks, is the truth,

501
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,400
 which we always think of as crisps.

502
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,880
 And the 1970s was such an extraordinary era.

503
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,600
 It was like the '90s for the internet, but for corn maze snacks.

504
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,120
 1970... Sorry, what is it called? Can you give me an example?

505
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,560
 Oh, I'm about to. Okay, sorry.

506
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,840
 Oh. Don't you worry about that.

507
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,360
 By the end of this little bit, you will be in no doubt as to what a corn maze snack is,

508
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,440
 I promise you. Carry on, Professor.

509
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,240
 1970, they invent watsits. Oh, yeah.

510
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,080
 Okay. Wow. 1973, they invent skips.

511
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,320
 1974, they invent frazzles.

512
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,840
 1977, they invent monster munch.

513
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,000
 All within seven years. Wow.

514
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,160
 The big hitters, all within seven years.

515
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,400
 Who were they? You're saying it's like NASA.

516
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,880
 Well, do you know what?

517
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,160
 Quavers were invented in 1968 before man walked on the moon.

518
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,480
 One before the Beatles broke up. Yeah, exactly.

519
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,600
 Gosh, you could have had...

520
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
 You could have been eating some quavers as you heard the news

521
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,200
 that the Beatles have broken up.

522
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,880
 That is striking. That is striking.

523
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,240
 Thank you. It is striking, isn't it?

524
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,560
 They could have had quavers on the moon. That would have been amazing.

525
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,480
 That would have been amazing. Yeah, yeah.

526
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,960
 Do you know, listen, I know you love an undiscovered hero on the show.

527
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,480
 You know what Leslie Ivy did?

528
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,080
 No. 1974, Leslie Ivy.

529
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,400
 OK, something snack-related?

530
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,920
 Yeah, very much so. OK.

531
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,400
 Invented a new flavour?

532
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,480
 He's... Leslie Ivy is a machinist.

533
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,600
 He was a machinist at the Smith's Crisp factory,

534
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,360
 and he is the guy who invented how to put stripes on frazzles.

535
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,800
 Wow. Yeah. Wow.

536
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,640
 And he's here tonight.

537
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,640
 That's a weird suntan you've got, Leslie, sort of.

538
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,080
 The first two-ever flavours, do you know that...

539
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,000
 You used to just be ready-sorted.

540
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,680
 And it was Tato Crisp who came up with flavours for the first time.

541
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,600
 OK. A guy called Joe Murphy, he ran it,

542
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,080
 and Seamus Burke, who was his chief technician.

543
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,840
 And they thought, "We found a way to get flavour onto a crisp."

544
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,680
 And they experimented with two flavours.

545
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,680
 They thought, "We're going to start with just experiment,

546
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,360
 "with just in the lab, or just experiment."

547
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,120
 And those two flavours, the first two flavours ever in the history of crisps,

548
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,120
 cheese and onion, salt and vinegar.

549
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,880
 Ah. Wow. How about that?

550
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,080
 They've got the stranglehold on the flavour market,

551
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,760
 because they are the two Tatoes.

552
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,320
 Yeah, exactly. They were literally the first two they ever tried.

553
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,680
 I was reading that they thought of crisps in the old days as potatoes,

554
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,120
 because they're made of potatoes.

555
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,040
 What? So...

556
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,560
 Well, no, but then you would...

557
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,920
 We always like to throw something you don't know into this show.

558
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,120
 Oh, my God. I don't know.

559
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,480
 First the pope now, this.

560
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,560
 Stop it. This is terrified.

561
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,920
 It's because... That's that kind of place.

562
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,440
 Please, go on, Professor.

563
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,960
 Like, sorry, but the potatoes are made...

564
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,440
 Look, so crisps are made of potatoes, right?

565
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,720
 That's... Right.

566
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,400
 They thought, you know, only things that go with potatoes,

567
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,720
 cheese and onion, you'd have a potato dish, you know,

568
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,800
 and you'd have some cheese and onions on the side of it,

569
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,520
 or you'd slice potatoes and boil them up with some cheese and onions.

570
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,800
 So those were the natural things.

571
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,560
 And they hadn't freed their minds yet, using the process.

572
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,640
 It was called gas chromatography.

573
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,680
 And that was a very...

574
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,320
 That was a new procedure after the war, they invented that.

575
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,600
 Basically, in the old days, to get an apple flavouring,

576
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,360
 you would have to start with a ton of apples,

577
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,520
 then you'd end up with two grams of apple flavour.

578
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,000
 And then gas chromatography meant you could identify the compounds

579
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,480
 that made that flavour and recreate it.

580
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,840
 Yeah. Another hero from the history of crisps,

581
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,000
 Laura Scudder, she invented bags of crisps.

582
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,160
 OK, so before her, you would get a big barrel of crisps

583
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,320
 or potato chips in America,

584
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,440
 or you'd be tins or display cases, and you'd go in

585
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,680
 and they'd kind of shovel them into something

586
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,120
 and you would take them out... A bag?

587
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,000
 A bag. A bag.

588
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,960
 There's no... You're getting around it. It was a bag.

589
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,520
 But what she did is she got her workers to take home sheets of wax paper,

590
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,680
 they ironed them in the shape of what we would now today know as crisp bags,

591
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,000
 and then they would take them to the factory the next day,

592
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,880
 and then it would put actual crisps in crisps bags,

593
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,960
 and we never had that before then. Right.

594
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,960
 And she was also the first person to put fresh buy dates on any products,

595
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
 as in these would be fresh for this... Fresh buy.

596
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,440
 Fresh buy. You know, like, has it best before ends. Use buy.

597
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,360
 In America, yeah, fresh buy dates. They call it fresh buy.

598
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,320
 Yeah, well, let's say yes.

599
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,120
 So...

600
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,120
 Fresh buy. She was really interesting,

601
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,880
 because she only got into crisps because she had a shed

602
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,880
 and she wanted to rent it out to me.

603
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,000
 That was the obvious next step, wasn't it?

604
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,280
 She was selling it to people to work in,

605
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,280
 and there was a guy who claimed to be a barber,

606
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,520
 but he was actually selling bootleg alcohol,

607
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,840
 and she was very religious and she didn't like this,

608
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,120
 so she kicked him out, and she was like,

609
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,720
 "Well, what am I going to do with this shed?

610
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,520
 I might as well make crisps."

611
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,840
 Sorry, can I ask a question? Just a point of order.

612
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,400
 Buy barber. Do you mean barbershop guy?

613
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,240
 LAUGHTER

614
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:37,480
 Yeah, she couldn't get insurance for her delivery trucks

615
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,160
 because she was a woman,

616
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,800
 and so she had to find a special insurance company,

617
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,760
 and she once turned down a $9 million offer for her company

618
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,400
 because the buyer wouldn't guarantee her employer's jobs.

619
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,120
 - Wow. - So Arthur Skaggle would be proud.

620
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,120
 Yeah.

621
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,800
 - And quavers. - Yes.

622
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,040
 Is it true, and I'm looking at you, Richard, when I ask this,

623
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,360
 is it made of the leftovers from potatoes

624
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,040
 which have not made it into crisps?

625
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,880
 So, basically, it's the starch that gets...

626
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,680
 The Walker's factory has a log flume that the potatoes all go down.

627
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,240
 - Right. - Which washes out some of the starch.

628
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,640
 They all get their photo taken, don't they?

629
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,960
 LAUGHTER

630
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,040
 Oh, I want that one. Look at you.

631
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,400
 Oh, I definitely want that one.

632
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,000
 LAUGHTER

633
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,360
 It's above the mountelpiece.

634
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,520
 Every time I remember, "Look at his face there!"

635
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,040
 - Look at his eyes. - It's dead now, of course.

636
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
 It's dead now.

637
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,880
 - Ooh! - A good question.

638
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,440
 I don't know. I thought that they were corn, but perhaps they're not.

639
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,040
 - Perhaps they're potatoes. - I think the starch is...

640
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,280
 - Perhaps that's why they got invented a bit earlier. - Maybe, yeah.

641
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,760
 I read that the starch has turned into quavers from the potatoes.

642
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,080
 So, it's a way of using everything that they have, basically.

643
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,320
 - Like nose-to-tail eating. - Yes.

644
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,480
 - But for potatoes. - Yeah, exactly.

645
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,040
 That's good. I know that Monster Munch

646
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,040
 were not originally called Monster Munch.

647
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,640
 They essentially got released a year earlier.

648
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,960
 I think this is the best-ever name change.

649
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,400
 That a product has had.

650
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,720
 So, in 1977, they came out as Monster Munch and were a huge hit.

651
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,960
 But to the year before, yeah, they were called something else.

652
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,560
 I would say... I think they look like hands, to me.

653
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,120
 I would say "hands", was the name.

654
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,360
 Yeah. Do you know what?

655
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,480
 When they first came out, they were called hands, yeah.

656
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,960
 That's right. They were called hands.

657
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,080
 - Good name. - Yeah.

658
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,360
 - Good name. - What were they called?

659
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,440
 They'd also look a bit like if you had tiny hands,

660
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,280
 like knuckle dusters, right? Like, you can fit your...

661
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,600
 You can fit two fingers in and maybe...

662
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,200
 Wow.

663
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,000
 And they thought I was talking about the vagina, Chris.

664
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,920
 So, I was talking about...

665
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,200
 Oh, God.

666
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,280
 I assume it must have had some monster in their originality.

667
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,560
 So, yeah, the...

668
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,720
 Was it to do with the dance? There was that big dance craze.

669
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,440
 The monster stance, the mash.

670
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,720
 - Monster mash? - Yeah.

671
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,480
 No, all they know is not that. It's a really bad pun.

672
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,160
 Oh, monster...

673
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,800
 So, I tell you, you won't get it if you're thinking of puns.

674
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,040
 I don't think you are capable of doing a pun this bad.

675
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,440
 York Minster. York Minster.

676
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,640
 Oh, yeah, nice.

677
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,960
 - Not a million miles away. - Yeah, he is capable.

678
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,440
 Yeah, yeah.

679
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,400
 - I'll take it back. - That's the worst.

680
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,920
 - I stand corrected. - Welcome to the world, our new brand,

681
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,920
 York Minster.

682
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,160
 We were told it was a bad brand, too, yeah.

683
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,280
 They were called Prime Monsters.

684
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,440
 I literally was about to say that.

685
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,360
 And I thought that's so shit, I'm not going to say that.

686
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,840
 You know what, Richard, if someone says that I'm pointless,

687
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,360
 - do they still get the point? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,680
 Well, I don't do pointless anymore,

689
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,160
 but, yes, if I look in their eyes and believe them...

690
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,640
 Oh, my God, I didn't even get the...

691
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,280
 - ...pun I'm afraid. - The Prime Minister.

692
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,920
 Prime Minister. Richard, that's genuinely good to go down

693
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,600
 as one of the most disappointing moments of my life.

694
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,360
 - And you've had a few, right? - Yeah.

695
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,360
 My kids will hear this episode, not my wife, obviously.

696
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,120
 She doesn't listen, but...

697
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,320
 Let's do a little edit.

698
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,080
 Anybody? Anyone guess it, Dan?

699
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,080
 - Prime Monster? - It's the right answer.

700
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,560
 - CHEERING AND APPLAUSE - Oh.

701
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,280
 And that's all the time we have.

702
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,520
 That's it. That is all of our facts.
