00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah, um, which was there's no such thing as a fish

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:12.600
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of underwater life. He says it right that first paragraph. No such thing as a fish

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:25.400
 Hello and welcome to no such thing as a fish. This is a QI elf podcast coming to you from our offices in Covenant Garden

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.860
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with three other QILs James Harkin and Ange Zinsky and Andy Murray and once again

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.840
 We're huddled around our microphone and these are the best facts that we found out from the last seven days

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 So in no particular order. Here we go

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.520
 Okay, fact number one. We're going to start with you James

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.000
 Okay, yeah, my fact this week is a computer game has been invented that takes more than a lifetime to complete

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.160
 Is it digitized normally?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.660
 Oh, yeah, because remember that thing we found there was a computer simulation of monopoly and they found that something like 12% of all games will go on indefinitely

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.120
 Which is not true because it's much more than that

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.420
 What do you mean so with monopoly? How would it go on everyone with illness certain portion of the body?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.680
 Yeah, just keep going. Terry Pratchett has a computer game in his book, which is called Journey to Alpha Centauri

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.920
 which takes over 3,000 years to play and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.440
 It's just you know the screen save the very old passion screen save with just the moving dots for a spaceship

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.400
 It's that with a counter counting down for three thousand years and at the end the dot appears in the middle of the screen

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.540
 It says welcome to Alpha Centauri now go home and someone has actually made that it's a very rough game

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.040
 We're going to find out about this. No, we're talking about game. Okay, and this this came from the design museum

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 I went there this weekend

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.820
 It's the design of the year 2014 is competition for all the best design things and this was that thing that I thought was most interesting

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.580
 But the idea is it's kind of an art installation and they're asking questions like what happens to digital things after you die

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.200
 If you die halfway through that game

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.760
 Can you pass it on to another person to finish off the game is that possible or maybe this game is designed for mobile phones

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.880
 What happens when mobile phones and obsolete will the game carry on and so they're asking those kind of questions

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.320
 We're going to be dispiriting to you know to find out that your great uncle have bequeathed you his high score

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.520
 So far in this game that you just had to keep on playing it for the rest of your life

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.480
 To my first son I leave all the property and for my second son I leave this game

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.280
 Hey, you guys know how many hours of games are played per week on earth by humans if you tallyed up over hours

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.720
 I'll say a hundred million a hundred million hours. Yeah, I would say I'm gonna go for

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.140
 Two billion. Okay, I'm gonna go for just 24 hours 24 hours. Yeah, and I think most of humanity's out on a walk

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.560
 The answer is three billion hours

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.000
 Oh, yes, I say I'm close, but actually I'm a billion out

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.400
 Feels close. So gamers are supposed to be good at using drones aren't they for war? Yeah, and also

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.400
 Searching a tree. Yeah, if they play computer games it's supposed to help them with keyhole surgery and stuff like this

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.440
 There's a lot of job opportunities coming up for gamers now, which didn't exist before

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.320
 When Robert Ballard discovered the record of Titanic probably in your head you have an image that he was in a submersible

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.440
 But he wasn't a submarine, but they would send down drone submarines as it were and obviously you need someone to operate them

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.000
 This this is a quote from he said I would not let an adult drive my robot. They don't have enough gaming experience

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.680
 So with this game did you actually play it?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.000
 I I prodded at the screen a few times, but I couldn't really work out how to play it. Oh, okay. Maybe that's why it takes lifetimes the first

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.440
 Just some of the other things of this design of the year they had the first car that's been able to drive

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.840
 100 kilometers on one liter of petrol. It looks really cool

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.720
 It's a bit like James Bond car. It's very sleek and in order to help their

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.800
 Aerodynamics, they don't have wing mirrors and instead they have tiny cameras

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.760
 They had talking lamp posts. Is that useful? They were popular stop that stop that bad dog

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.840
 They were in Bristol last year of the year before I think and the idea is that say you had a rubbish bin and it was full

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.080
 Then you would be able to talk to your rubbish bin and say you're a bit full and he got oh, sorry

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.640
 I'll make sure I sought that out and then we get emptied

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.800
 So it's a way of the community kind of dealing with stuff like that. Yes, it's really interesting thing, isn't it?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.540
 There's this guy and you guys heard of Demetri its cove. No, so he set up this thing called the 2045 initiative

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.360
 Basically it's a Russian mogul who thinks that we who wants to remove our minds from our bodies essentially so our mind's gonna forever

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 Well, that's never gone wrong in any films

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.360
 I think it seems very promising

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.840
 So by 2045 he really thinks that we'll have our mind to do a couple from our bodies and he's gonna live forever

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.360
 And he's a hundred percent certain of this and we'll have holograms and we'll be able to like

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.840
 Shop in department stores for the body that we want that most suits our purposes and

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.720
 Live for eternity and he met the Dalai Lama to discuss it

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.160
 He apparently was really supportive according to their website

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.600
 The thing is at the moment the computer capabilities isn't enough to simulate human brain is it? Yeah 2045 scenes

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.680
 Ambitious so if I have something about things that run for longer than you'd expect

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.280
 Okay, because off the back of the computer game

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.480
 One of Norway's most popular recent TV shows has been a seven-hour train journey in real-time

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.960
 across Norway

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.600
 It might be quite beautiful actually. Yeah, it was and so they broadcasted in 2009 and over 20% of the population tuned in at some point at the show

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.600
 Wow, I'm Britain. That would just be like 45 minutes of set outside Milton Keynes

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.360
 I've watched that I've seen shots of the Norwegian one. It's gorgeous rolling countryside the snow in the first and it's all beautiful

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.200
 And yeah, here would not be so and they keep doing this. They've done 18 hours of fishing for salmon

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.200
 And then they had a 12-hour knitting night and my favorite is national firewood night which was in February last year

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:13.160
 Which was inspired by a Norwegian book solid wood all about chopping drying and stacking wood which sold as many copies as 50 shades of gray in Norway

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.840
 Oh, there are different kind of people

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.680
 And the first four hours of national firewood night was a discussion of firewood

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.800
 And then the next eight hours was shot was a live fireplace being filmed for eight hours and they had 60 complaints

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.520
 Half were complaining that the bark had been put facing up and the other half of being complaining it was put facing down

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:42.680
 Just picking up on this idea of things that go on for an extended amount of time

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.720
 There's so there's obviously the game where it takes a lifetime or more than a lifetime to play

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.920
 There's a lot of musical pieces that do exactly that as well John Cage famously has a piece

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.320
 It's called Oregon squared slash ASL SP as a musical piece

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.840
 Which was written in 1987 for an Oregon

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.160
 The piece itself lasts 20 to 70 minutes

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.760
 But it's gonna finish it's gonna go for about 639 years ending in the year

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:16.360
 2640 and people you know the next note is gonna be played in a few years time and people will go and watch that note be played in this continuing piece

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.040
 That sounds good. Yeah, they use John Cage to teach like beginners piano because a lot of his pieces are very easy

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.800
 Technically speaking like piece number one don't play anything. Yeah, especially for minutes

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.240
 That's one of the easiest things to play. There's a lot of people who accidentally play a note during that four-minute

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.040
 See what you've gone wrong here

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.320
 Classic mistake

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.440
 Did you guys know that this game called ESP and I don't know if that's actually exists anymore

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.920
 I couldn't get the website to open, but basically two people simultaneously like tag a picture with keywords

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.400
 And if you tag it with the same word then you get a point and that's how they tied a whole bunch of Google images

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.920
 Wow

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.200
 I thought what you're gonna say is that people around the world are all playing this game

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.200
 And they're gonna see if two people say the same thing at the same time and then see if there is actually ESP going up

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.280
 I don't think it counts as ESP if you're both showing a picture of a table in both bright tables

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.520
 Call me captain skeptic

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:24.480
 Okay, let's move on to fact number two this one's my fact the fact is that

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.760
 2013 was the first years since 1933 that there hasn't been a sighting of the Loch Ness monster

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.560
 So there's huge worries in the Loch Ness monster community because they think Nessie's dead

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.400
 Oh, it just learned to be a bit more surreptitious after hundreds of years of being constantly spotted

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.640
 If I just stay underwater

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.320
 No, I think they're worried. I think because they think Nessie's a friendly animal doesn't mind being spotted

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.440
 People like Nessie very much so it's not an aggressive animal

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.240
 It's never in fact in in 2005 there was a triathlon in Scotland

00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:03.000
 Where all of the athletes took a 1 million pound insurance deal out in case of being attacked by the Loch Ness monster when they were

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.840
 Swimming across the Loch and the the community came out saying that's a ridiculous thing to do if anything she would join in

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.520
 She would she would and she would beat them because she's a great swimmer

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.320
 They're obviously saying that the Loch Ness monster is friendly because she hasn't killed anyone in the last 70 years

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.680
 But there is a slight logic for her isn't it maybe she only needs to eat once a century?

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.600
 No, I'm saying she doesn't exist every year William Hill the bookies. They do an actual competition

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.680
 It's a photo competition where they award money to the winner who's provided the best photographic evidence of Loch Ness monster

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.960
 And this is the first year where they haven't given the head to disqualify all three entries. The first one was obviously a duck

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.880
 The second one was a wave and the third one a closer inspection just wasn't even the Loch

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.880
 It was just another body of water

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.920
 So I have a theory of what's happened to Nessie. Oh, yeah

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:02.120
 Well, it's not my theory. This is the theory by Britain's high priest of White Witches Kevin Carlyon and he says

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.360
 I personally believe Nessie is a ghost of a dinosaur who has been regularly seen in the Loch

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.000
 But the spirit of the creature has been so exploited in recent years

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.520
 I decided to carry out an exorcism hence no sightings of the monster

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.200
 So he's saying that he has personally killed off Nessie

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.200
 Yeah, he just thinks that people have been

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.480
 Yeah, people have been messing around with this spirit of a dinosaur and he wanted to set it free

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.960
 I really like the mythical creatures that we come up with there are so many of them in Britain

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.160
 I don't really know if other countries have them to the same extent

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.480
 But my favourite I came across in I'm reading our mutual friend at the moment

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.240
 And I've decided to read all of the footnotes and if you're ever reading I think Dickens especially but like read all the footnotes

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.400
 They're so interesting one of them made reference to the done cow this

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.040
 Vicious beast that was slain by Guy Earl of Warwick who was one of these like pre-medieval British heroes

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.360
 And yeah, it was just this cow and it produced an everlasting supply of milk and eventually got annoyed that people were like

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.560
 Milking it and milking it and milking it and ran away from its farm in Shropshire

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.520
 And eventually Guy Earl of Warwick who seems like a sort of St. George of the 10th century

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.240
 Went out and had to slay the cow

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.560
 Yeah, you say St. George but slaying a cow is not quite as impressive as slaying a dragon

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.400
 Although he did also slay a dragon which was it must have seemed like a step down

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.080
 It's not that difficult

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.640
 Did that old second monster syndrome in the game?

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.560
 If you go to Warwick Castle so until the 90s I'm not sure if it's still there because I haven't seen it

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.160
 You can see the rib of the done cow

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.240
 And that the king ordered would should be like put in Warwick Castle

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.240
 Is it big? They're getting all cow rib?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.040
 Yes, it is bigger they think that it's actually an elephant tusk

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.680
 I mean skeptics think that it might not be the rib of the giant done cow

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.800
 That's even cooler though if this was found in Gloss the Chirin of Fear

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.320
 Why is no instead of saying oh it's a great crazy magical cow

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.960
 Why is this elephant been there?

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.200
 Maybe that's what they meant by a giant cow

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.320
 Because you know that the initial photo taken in 1933 of the Loch Ness monster

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.200
 The very famous photo they think that that's an elephant

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.360
 No, in the lake

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.200
 Just to justify you that there was a circus in town at the time

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.440
 Elephants as we've seen in David Attenborough documentaries do go swimming

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.240
 And when they do they use their trunks as snorkels

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.960
 And if you look at the photo it looks exactly like an elephant trunk

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.200
 Do you guys remember that story in 2011 where police in Southampton went on the alert

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.080
 Because there was a tiger sighting in one of the fields

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.960
 And then there was a gust of wind that blew it over and it was a cuddly toy

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.200
 There was a lion's skirt in the 70s in Britain which turned out to be a paper bag

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.480
 Well there was a lion's skirt on the last year that turned out to be a large cat

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.520
 So I mean you were saying you're not sure if other countries have similar kind of monster time to do

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.840
 So I have one or two here

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:47.400
 So the lake Okanagan in Canada they have a monster which is very similar to Nessie

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.720
 And every year they give a $50 prize to anyone who can shout loud enough to wake the beast up

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.880
 So everyone stands on the side of the lake, yells, wake up, wake up

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.760
 And if anyone can wake them up they get $50

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.120
 And they go home with the same $50, don't they?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.800
 And yet no winners I think

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:14.440
 Isn't there a fact, you told me years ago I was saying to remember that there was an animal similar to the Loch Ness Monster that had protection policy on it in a different country?

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.000
 Yeah, in Sweden that was, it was the Storcio monster I think you pronounce it

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.480
 And it was classified as an endangered species in the 80s or sometime like that

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.240
 Yeah, because as a result of that, a direct result of that

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.440
 The factory government actually put the Loch Ness Monster on the animal protection

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:32.920
 Oh really?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.640
 Yeah, they were going to do exactly the same, they were going to do what Sweden did but they decided that that was one step too far

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:44.760
 So they would just put in, they were actually there was a document that was put in front of thatcher or thatcher's main people

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.600
 Which they wanted to bring to Blue Nose dolphins over from America to search for the Loch Ness monster

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.000
 Really?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.600
 Yeah, it never got passed but this was the Tory government that said

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.200
 What would happen when the dolphins find, is it like Flipper?

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.400
 They'll come back and go

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.120
 I'd like to, yeah, what's that? What's that? What's that?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.760
 We're speaking of Hollywood people, what about Charlie Sheen? He went looking for the Loch Ness Monster to see him

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.600
 You know what? You know you're saying that there's this guy who exercise the ghost in there

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.240
 Charlie Sheen's getting a lot of stick from the Loch Ness Monster community, so they think

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.640
 The Loch Ness Monster doesn't like two and a half men or maybe they don't have been used together

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.080
 He went into the Loch Ness with a fishing hook and he attached the leg of lamb to a fishing rod

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.560
 And tried to catch it, I an old wooden boat

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.960
 You know what? Call me Captain Skeptical

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.120
 But I don't think that's any less sensible than trying to exercise its ghost

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.760
 Oh, look for it in the first place

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:50.840
 Okay, time for fact number three, this is your fact, Anna

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:59.160
 Yep, so my fact is that the French government forced Madame Tussaud to make models of her friends decapitated hence

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.040
 Yeah, poor old Madame, it's kind of like how her career started

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.640
 Is that during the revolution?

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.560
 Oh exactly, yeah, it was during the terror

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.800
 And the story goes that she actually had her head shaved and everything and they were ready to

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.320
 to capitate her as well because she was friends with the royal family and she had like

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.320
 there is mates in high places and she'd made wax models of a lot of them

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.400
 And just before they dropped the guillotine they were like actually, you come in handy

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.560
 because we want to make these death masks of our victims

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.160
 And so she writes in her memoirs about having to sift through these piles of heads

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.200
 Decapitated heads, pick them up, have them on her lap and making models of them

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.160
 Yeah, I read an account of it and I kind of got the impression that it turned into something she really enjoyed

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.760
 Yeah, I mean she had no choice but you know when you kind of just get used to something

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.320
 You know it's your job, you know, you now waxing heads for a living

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.120
 It was like a treasure hunt effectively, it was going like oh this is the bloke who was in the paper last week

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.800
 Isn't he? Mary Antoinette, it's like nothing coming on in these direct hunt reviews

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.520
 If you just get used to it, you're already into it

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.880
 She was madamsu's father, the only wax workperson at the time

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.960
 I don't think so, I think she just made, so I've been going on for hundreds of years

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.360
 I think she was just very much a self-made woman

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.280
 Well, my understanding of madamsu's father is that she was an apprentice to a doctor

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.680
 And he would make wax bits of internal organs

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.200
 Was that right? Oh yeah, I mean

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.000
 Was his name Cateus? Yes, Cateus

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.360
 But there's a theory that he may have been her father

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.360
 Her biological father, yes

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.720
 I know, her mother's husband was killed two months before she was madamsu's born

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.680
 But there is a theory that he was her natural father

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.640
 Because I heard about this guy that he made most of his money making erotic wax miniatures

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.160
 Is that true? I don't know

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.760
 I didn't see that, really

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.720
 That cast kind of an odd light on him having this 15-year-old girl making wax models for him in his little office

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.520
 Creepy

00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:00.920
 She was obviously talented though, when she was 16 I think she made models of Rousseau and Voltaire

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:09.160
 I love Voltaire because Voltaire had a statistician friend who figured out that this lottery that the French government was proposing

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:17.480
 As a way of it making money, actually if you bought up all the tickets of it you were guaranteed to win more money than you'd spent buying the tickets

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.360
 So Voltaire bought up all the tickets offered in this French lottery and became the equivalent of a millionaire today

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.480
 And never had to work again

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.400
 I don't know if this is completely true but with Madame to source these days when they do a wax work of someone

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.160
 There's no contracts for anything and technically I think people could request for it to be taken away

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.120
 They could say I'm not, I don't want to be done as a wax work

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.640
 But everyone just finds it's such an honour that they're fine for it to be done

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.840
 Yeah I think you worked, wouldn't you?

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.480
 Some people put a few clauses with it so Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson have both said you can do me

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.640
 and it's fine and people can take photos but no press are allowed to take photos of the wax work

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:57.480
 Because then they'll start using that as press shots and so they're good

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.920
 They're good but they're not that good

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.200
 Yeah

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.560
 Tom Cruise bought it again in Madame to source wax work of music and he just loves that thing

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.840
 I found it very interesting who they pick, who the pool of people is

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.840
 Because now it's almost all celebrities

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.640
 Although every monarch since George III has had a wax work made of them

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.880
 So every king of Queen of England

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.920
 Off the top of my head, Ian Duncan Smith is the only leader of the Conservative Party not to have had a wax work

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.080
 Oh no that's because he's the most likely isn't it?

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.920
 Well it takes a while as well to make the wax work and he wasn't leader for very long

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.400
 So I mentioned by the time they'd booked the appointments he was out

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.400
 Do you know Jenny Ryan who works on QI a few years ago

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.880
 Well and she had to ring up Madame to source for another reason to find out

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.720
 Which was the most groped wax work at Madame to source

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.800
 And she found out that it was Brad Pitt

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.920
 And the way they find out is they work it out by

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.440
 Which is the one that's taken in for maintenance of the most knowledge

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.240
 Because presumably he would have had to have been taken in for maintenance constantly

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.080
 They had Hitler in a glass box didn't they because they were worried that he was going to be

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.600
 Repeatedly attacked and in fact he was and he was beheaded in fact

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.960
 Yeah someone ripped his head off, was that before or after or when was that 2008?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.000
 2008, it's not lunatics who have made one during the war I suppose

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.400
 I think he had his maiden in 1930s, that's not really

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.240
 And then gradually they moved it from, you know, honored place with other states

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.200
 Men went to the ground floor to the Chamber of Commons

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.440
 They don't actually in the Lou or something like that

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.480
 There's also there was a rumor going around that

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.520
 Gary Borolo it was melted down into Britney Spears

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.880
 So it was so great that he was curious but it turned out that wasn't true

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.480
 He was taken away, he was taken out after take that had finished

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.160
 But he was brought back when Robbie Williams and take that got back together

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.800
 But it meant that he's kept an aware house in the interim

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.400
 And apparently there's a warehouse with all these fallen wax works

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.360
 Yeah which is kind of it's like the like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.560
 And I don't know who we're in there

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.560
 That is the stuff of Nightmares, I really think

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.000
 Imagine being locked in that warehouse

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.880
 It's just going to be all people from the 80s isn't it?

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.880
 Yeah vanilla rice is in there

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.280
 I read as well that some people is so enthusiastic about being turned into a wax work

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.800
 That they just do as much as they can to help out with the authenticity of

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.280
 Oh yeah

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.240
 And Boris Johnson when he was turned into a wax work

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.240
 He gave on the spot after they measured him the clothes that he was wearing

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.240
 And he left it all to me

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.200
 Oh yeah

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.520
 That was his excuse for why he was found wandering the streets of the naked

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.160
 But if you visit Boris Johnson at Madame Two Swords

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.880
 Have a look at the bottom of his trousers because you'll notice that there's a rip

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.720
 And that's a rip from a bike chain from when he was riding over to be measured

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.760
 Oh, yeah so there's a little bit of PR stunt

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.520
 Even as I love cycling at

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.280
 That is the best cockney rhyming slang I've ever heard PR stunt

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.240
 Boris Johnson is a complete PR stunt

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.320
 Apparently in the past five years 123 pairs of false teeth

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.200
 And one false leg have been left behind in Madame Two Swords

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.880
 One set of ones to claim

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.240
 Who leaves their teeth?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.760
 I don't know, 123 pairs, five years a lot isn't it?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.240
 One last fact about wax works and wax in general

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.760
 It's possible to fire lasers at a fly's brain and make it have sex with a ball of wax

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.120
 Not only possible, it's great fun

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.160
 For the fly or for you

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.120
 I suppose the fly, if the fly doesn't know that it's having sex with a ball of wax

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.640
 So there will feel stupid afterwards

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.440
 Yeah

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.240
 We've all been there

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.520
 *laughs*

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:29.560
 Okay, final fact of the show

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.560
 And we come to you, Andy

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:38.280
 My fact is that during the Normandy landings the Allied forces dropped dogs by parachute onto

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.800
 Why are they able to do that?

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.880
 The UK deployed parachute dogs in the Second World War

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.880
 Which we used to identify minefields and to keep watch and to warn of enemies

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.360
 Yeah, you know when you say identify minefields

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.680
 Does that basically mean wander over a minefield?

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.800
 *laughs*

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.240
 There was a snippet, a snippet dance

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.600
 Yeah, they could smell them

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.960
 And they, so yeah, there were three, initially just three, sent over

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.680
 Brian, Monty and Rene

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.160
 And Rene, I think, was the only female parachuteist in the British army during the war

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.720
 And they were sent in with the 13th Lancashire Paris

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.840
 And then one of the articles I read it said they were called "Paradox"

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.080
 "Breakets short for parachuting dogs"

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.200
 *laughs*

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.400
 Which I love

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:23.240
 But the more office have made radio appeals in 1941 for people to give up their dogs for the war movement

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.680
 And basically lots of people used it as an opportunity to just get rid of their dogs

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.240
 Oh

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.280
 So they, they have thousands sent in and lots of them weren't suitable

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.120
 So were they trained to, like, pull the parachute cord at the right time?

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.360
 I think the parachutes opened automatically

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.080
 And they were, because they were the right shape and size

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:44.760
 They were given the same parachutes that the parachute was used to drop bicycles over the battlefield

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.160
 Which they all, sorry Addy, are you saying a dog is the same shape as a bicycle?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.000
 And size, and you can, if you peddle it right, they're the same effect

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.200
 *laughs*

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.400
 That's a very good point

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.360
 Um, yeah

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.240
 The first training was to jump out of the plane with a bit of meat

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.280
 In your pocket

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:00.920
 *laughs*

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.880
 And then I think...

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.200
 And then I think for someone else to throw the dog out of the plane

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.840
 No, no, no, no, it's actually slightly cooler than that

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.440
 They used to starve the dogs

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.040
 Um, and so what they would do is they would hold the meat outside the plane

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.440
 So the dogs would leave for, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.440
 And how else are you going to get a dog out other than throwing it?

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.120
 Yeah, but they're not cruel

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.560
 I think, I think, I think, eventually they got used to it though, didn't they?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.680
 You didn't get used to it though

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.600
 I watched them watching a really interesting documentary a while back about um

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.680
 I think it was 12 paratroopers from the Second World War

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.160
 Who, they did their first parachute jump and they were obviously terrified

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.640
 As you are when you threw yourself out of a plane for the first time

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.520
 Really, really nervous

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.680
 And then obviously they did it for the subsequent five years

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.600
 Got really used to it, not to get it all

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.120
 Didn't parachute for 50 years

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.400
 And this documentary picked up on them when they were in their 70s and 80s

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.800
 And said, "Jonna do a parachute jump again, let's see how it is"

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.040
 Now to 50 years, not a trace of fear in them

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.760
 And it's like this thing where the way to get over a phobia permanently

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.960
 Is to do it repeatedly

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.160
 And you're cured for life

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.160
 So 50 years they didn't parachute and they all just blazing up in the plane

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.000
 You're, when you're looking for illustrious, decapitated heads

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.760
 You're used to it

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.600
 So I have something else about people dropping stuff by parachute during the war

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.400
 And during Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.800
 And they dropped sheep and bulls by parachute

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.120
 And the reason was, and they needed food

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.080
 They were in the desert

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.200
 And what's the best way of doing it?

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.880
 You can drop meat down, that's very enough

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.720
 Or you can drop live animals

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.520
 And then they can butcher themselves whenever they need the meat

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.480
 And so that's what they did

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.920
 They dropped their bulls on the sheep

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.960
 They attached them to modified harnesses

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.880
 And parachuted them down to the soldiers

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.320
 That is a main style

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.040
 Yeah

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.280
 That must be the biggest thing that's ever been parachuted

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:36.920
 A bull

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.600
 I read that in parachutes, actually, during war times

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.440
 People, as well as, you know, you'd look out for it because of enemy

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.840
 But you would also be looking out for it because parachutes, the material

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.840
 Was such a collectible

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.840
 There was a thing that everyone, yeah, yeah

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.040
 Like apparently if it was a silk one, that would be the common little triangles

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.240
 And you would turn them into underwear

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.280
 That's true

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.280
 Otherwise they had no underwear

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.280
 Like a new meaning to go and commando

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.360
 I love, have you guys seen the footage of friends

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.160
 Oh yeah

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.200
 Rachel, yeah, were you watching that poor guy

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.720
 Who developed a parachute suit, I think, starting in 1910

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.280
 And I just love the fact that he saw he made this parachute suit

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.760
 Which he decided was going to be useful, effective, and work

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.680
 And it just didn't work consistently, didn't

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.280
 And he threw various dummies wearing it off from various heights

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.160
 And they all just plummeted to the ground and died of dummy death

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:35.160
 And then he tried to throw himself off there, like 10 meters high, sort of levels, um, fell, broke his leg

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.480
 And so he thought, well, this has gone well

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.520
 I'm gonna ask if I can throw myself off the Eiffel Tower wearing it

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.720
 And so, yeah, he did and died

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.600
 And you can watch it

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.320
 You can watch it on YouTube, it's an extraordinary bit of footage

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.040
 That's amazing, I didn't realise that it had gone so badly before he decided to jump off the Eiffel Tower

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.120
 Just to get, just to give him the benefit of the doubt

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.920
 Isn't, did he jump off the viewing platform at the Eiffel Tower?

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.200
 Yeah, because he saw no platform

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.480
 And that's quite low, isn't it?

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.280
 Yep, but I wouldn't be surprised if, maybe if he jumped from higher, it might have worked

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.560
 That was what some people said

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.800
 Some people claim that his parachute looked like his parachute suit suddenly blossomed

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.800
 At the last moment, the last split second

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.640
 But I actually can't, I've watched the footage

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.240
 That sounds like a wily coyote and roach run a thing, doesn't it?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.240
 He splatts down and then the parachute opens just to be run

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:28.520
 Yeah, he's the most amazing one stars though, I wondered why the most stars didn't save him with the air resistance, it's so good

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:35.160
 One of my favourite facts about D-Day landings is that 4% of the sand on the beach today in Normandy

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:40.280
 Is made up of tiny metal particles left over from artillery explosions during the attack

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.240
 No, 4%? That's a lot, isn't it?

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:43.720
 Yeah

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.160
 Did you guys read it in the 2000, or someone tried to replicate it in our adventures?

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.320
 Who is one of the first people to design a parachute?

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.080
 Yeah, it was like a triangle or what was it?

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.360
 Yeah, it was, I think it was a bunch of triangles

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.040
 And anyway, it definitely had wood in full

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.600
 So in his design, it was like some sort of cloth

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.000
 And wooden things holding it together, wooden plank, holding it together

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.920
 So someone tried to recreate this in the 2000, but using modern materials and said it worked

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.800
 And it was this, like, it was all over the news saying they didn't know to venture to design

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.040
 Works, this guy survived, but he used cloth and modern materials

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.040
 I feel like if he built a parachute out of wood

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.240
 It would never have worked, would it?

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.120
 I don't think it would work

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.720
 That would never have worked

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.720
 I think the official, I guess, first parachute jump

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.320
 As far as we know, the first public one

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.640
 So it was done by Luis Sebastian Lennemond in Montpellier in France

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.400
 And his very first jump was off a tree holding two umbrellas

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:35.800
 Cool

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.240
 That was the very first parachute jump

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:42.520
 So, do we not counter the Monsbury Monk Ilmer of Monsbury

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.400
 Who was the 11th century monk who flew 200 meters

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.560
 When he jumped off the top of Monsbury Abbey

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.800
 He was airborne for 15 seconds, they've worked out

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.240
 Because they know where he landed

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.240
 And where he took off from and how high it was

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.400
 And he just made a bunch of wings for himself on his feet and his pants

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.720
 And he said if he'd remembered to make himself a tail

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.880
 Then he would have been arm-harmed

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.160
 And that actually seems to be true

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.560
 Because it, like, gives you an equilibrium and means that

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.040
 You're giving me a really good look at him

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.880
 You're giving me a really good look at him

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.120
 I think that sounds very true

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.920
 And people would have thought him a fool when he did that

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.680
 And yet, a few hundred years later

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.000
 We are throwing dogs out of planes

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.360
 To help identify mines

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.360
 Still doing it, 2010

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.520
 German shepherds were being flown in

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.560
 And dropped over Taliban regions

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.160
 It was just fine on the Taliban

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.040
 It's a spy

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.560
 Yeah, they had little cameras on them

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.040
 Wow

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.320
 Yeah, German shepherds

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.360
 I like the fact that in the war it was German shepherds

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.960
 That the British were dropping on Germany

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.640
 I mean, they're not so strong

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.440
 You treading

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.640
 That reminded me that there's always countries that

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.600
 Find an animal and then arrest it for spying

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.200
 But after the whole time, isn't it?

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.840
 Yes

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.440
 Was it Saudi Arabia?

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.400
 I'm making this up

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.280
 Saudi Arabia that arrested a coconut for spying

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.440
 I remember that

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.480
 How was it?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.760
 I don't know

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.280
 I think it's amazing

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.040
 I find you guilty of spying

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.880
 You have to be broken up and put in cocktails

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.760
 There was a bounty on his head

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.560
 [Laughter]

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:19.720
 Okay, that's all that there is for this week

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.680
 There's of our facts

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.200
