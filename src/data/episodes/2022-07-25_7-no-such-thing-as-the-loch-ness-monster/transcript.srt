1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah, um, which was there's no such thing as a fish

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:12,600
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of underwater life. He says it right that first paragraph. No such thing as a fish

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:25,400
 Hello and welcome to no such thing as a fish. This is a QI elf podcast coming to you from our offices in Covenant Garden

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,860
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with three other QILs James Harkin and Ange Zinsky and Andy Murray and once again

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,840
 We're huddled around our microphone and these are the best facts that we found out from the last seven days

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
 So in no particular order. Here we go

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,520
 Okay, fact number one. We're going to start with you James

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,000
 Okay, yeah, my fact this week is a computer game has been invented that takes more than a lifetime to complete

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,160
 Is it digitized normally?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,660
 Oh, yeah, because remember that thing we found there was a computer simulation of monopoly and they found that something like 12% of all games will go on indefinitely

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,120
 Which is not true because it's much more than that

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,420
 What do you mean so with monopoly? How would it go on everyone with illness certain portion of the body?

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,680
 Yeah, just keep going. Terry Pratchett has a computer game in his book, which is called Journey to Alpha Centauri

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,920
 which takes over 3,000 years to play and

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,440
 It's just you know the screen save the very old passion screen save with just the moving dots for a spaceship

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,400
 It's that with a counter counting down for three thousand years and at the end the dot appears in the middle of the screen

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,540
 It says welcome to Alpha Centauri now go home and someone has actually made that it's a very rough game

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,040
 We're going to find out about this. No, we're talking about game. Okay, and this this came from the design museum

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
 I went there this weekend

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,820
 It's the design of the year 2014 is competition for all the best design things and this was that thing that I thought was most interesting

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,580
 But the idea is it's kind of an art installation and they're asking questions like what happens to digital things after you die

22
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,200
 If you die halfway through that game

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,760
 Can you pass it on to another person to finish off the game is that possible or maybe this game is designed for mobile phones

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,880
 What happens when mobile phones and obsolete will the game carry on and so they're asking those kind of questions

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,320
 We're going to be dispiriting to you know to find out that your great uncle have bequeathed you his high score

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,520
 So far in this game that you just had to keep on playing it for the rest of your life

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,480
 To my first son I leave all the property and for my second son I leave this game

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,280
 Hey, you guys know how many hours of games are played per week on earth by humans if you tallyed up over hours

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,720
 I'll say a hundred million a hundred million hours. Yeah, I would say I'm gonna go for

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,140
 Two billion. Okay, I'm gonna go for just 24 hours 24 hours. Yeah, and I think most of humanity's out on a walk

31
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,560
 The answer is three billion hours

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,000
 Oh, yes, I say I'm close, but actually I'm a billion out

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,400
 Feels close. So gamers are supposed to be good at using drones aren't they for war? Yeah, and also

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 Searching a tree. Yeah, if they play computer games it's supposed to help them with keyhole surgery and stuff like this

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,440
 There's a lot of job opportunities coming up for gamers now, which didn't exist before

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,320
 When Robert Ballard discovered the record of Titanic probably in your head you have an image that he was in a submersible

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,440
 But he wasn't a submarine, but they would send down drone submarines as it were and obviously you need someone to operate them

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,000
 This this is a quote from he said I would not let an adult drive my robot. They don't have enough gaming experience

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,680
 So with this game did you actually play it?

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,000
 I I prodded at the screen a few times, but I couldn't really work out how to play it. Oh, okay. Maybe that's why it takes lifetimes the first

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,440
 Just some of the other things of this design of the year they had the first car that's been able to drive

42
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
 100 kilometers on one liter of petrol. It looks really cool

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,720
 It's a bit like James Bond car. It's very sleek and in order to help their

44
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,800
 Aerodynamics, they don't have wing mirrors and instead they have tiny cameras

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,760
 They had talking lamp posts. Is that useful? They were popular stop that stop that bad dog

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,840
 They were in Bristol last year of the year before I think and the idea is that say you had a rubbish bin and it was full

47
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,080
 Then you would be able to talk to your rubbish bin and say you're a bit full and he got oh, sorry

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,640
 I'll make sure I sought that out and then we get emptied

49
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,800
 So it's a way of the community kind of dealing with stuff like that. Yes, it's really interesting thing, isn't it?

50
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,540
 There's this guy and you guys heard of Demetri its cove. No, so he set up this thing called the 2045 initiative

51
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,360
 Basically it's a Russian mogul who thinks that we who wants to remove our minds from our bodies essentially so our mind's gonna forever

52
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
 Well, that's never gone wrong in any films

53
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 I think it seems very promising

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,840
 So by 2045 he really thinks that we'll have our mind to do a couple from our bodies and he's gonna live forever

55
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,360
 And he's a hundred percent certain of this and we'll have holograms and we'll be able to like

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
 Shop in department stores for the body that we want that most suits our purposes and

57
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,720
 Live for eternity and he met the Dalai Lama to discuss it

58
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,160
 He apparently was really supportive according to their website

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,600
 The thing is at the moment the computer capabilities isn't enough to simulate human brain is it? Yeah 2045 scenes

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,680
 Ambitious so if I have something about things that run for longer than you'd expect

61
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,280
 Okay, because off the back of the computer game

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,480
 One of Norway's most popular recent TV shows has been a seven-hour train journey in real-time

63
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,960
 across Norway

64
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,600
 It might be quite beautiful actually. Yeah, it was and so they broadcasted in 2009 and over 20% of the population tuned in at some point at the show

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
 Wow, I'm Britain. That would just be like 45 minutes of set outside Milton Keynes

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,360
 I've watched that I've seen shots of the Norwegian one. It's gorgeous rolling countryside the snow in the first and it's all beautiful

67
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,200
 And yeah, here would not be so and they keep doing this. They've done 18 hours of fishing for salmon

68
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:05,200
 And then they had a 12-hour knitting night and my favorite is national firewood night which was in February last year

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:13,160
 Which was inspired by a Norwegian book solid wood all about chopping drying and stacking wood which sold as many copies as 50 shades of gray in Norway

70
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,840
 Oh, there are different kind of people

71
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,680
 And the first four hours of national firewood night was a discussion of firewood

72
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,800
 And then the next eight hours was shot was a live fireplace being filmed for eight hours and they had 60 complaints

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,520
 Half were complaining that the bark had been put facing up and the other half of being complaining it was put facing down

74
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:42,680
 Just picking up on this idea of things that go on for an extended amount of time

75
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,720
 There's so there's obviously the game where it takes a lifetime or more than a lifetime to play

76
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,920
 There's a lot of musical pieces that do exactly that as well John Cage famously has a piece

77
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,320
 It's called Oregon squared slash ASL SP as a musical piece

78
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,840
 Which was written in 1987 for an Oregon

79
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,160
 The piece itself lasts 20 to 70 minutes

80
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,760
 But it's gonna finish it's gonna go for about 639 years ending in the year

81
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:16,360
 2640 and people you know the next note is gonna be played in a few years time and people will go and watch that note be played in this continuing piece

82
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,040
 That sounds good. Yeah, they use John Cage to teach like beginners piano because a lot of his pieces are very easy

83
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,800
 Technically speaking like piece number one don't play anything. Yeah, especially for minutes

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,240
 That's one of the easiest things to play. There's a lot of people who accidentally play a note during that four-minute

85
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,040
 See what you've gone wrong here

86
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,320
 Classic mistake

87
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,440
 Did you guys know that this game called ESP and I don't know if that's actually exists anymore

88
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,920
 I couldn't get the website to open, but basically two people simultaneously like tag a picture with keywords

89
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,400
 And if you tag it with the same word then you get a point and that's how they tied a whole bunch of Google images

90
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,920
 Wow

91
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,200
 I thought what you're gonna say is that people around the world are all playing this game

92
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,200
 And they're gonna see if two people say the same thing at the same time and then see if there is actually ESP going up

93
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,280
 I don't think it counts as ESP if you're both showing a picture of a table in both bright tables

94
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
 Call me captain skeptic

95
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:24,480
 Okay, let's move on to fact number two this one's my fact the fact is that

96
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,760
 2013 was the first years since 1933 that there hasn't been a sighting of the Loch Ness monster

97
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,560
 So there's huge worries in the Loch Ness monster community because they think Nessie's dead

98
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,400
 Oh, it just learned to be a bit more surreptitious after hundreds of years of being constantly spotted

99
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
 If I just stay underwater

100
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,320
 No, I think they're worried. I think because they think Nessie's a friendly animal doesn't mind being spotted

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,440
 People like Nessie very much so it's not an aggressive animal

102
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,240
 It's never in fact in in 2005 there was a triathlon in Scotland

103
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,000
 Where all of the athletes took a 1 million pound insurance deal out in case of being attacked by the Loch Ness monster when they were

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,840
 Swimming across the Loch and the the community came out saying that's a ridiculous thing to do if anything she would join in

105
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,520
 She would she would and she would beat them because she's a great swimmer

106
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,320
 They're obviously saying that the Loch Ness monster is friendly because she hasn't killed anyone in the last 70 years

107
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,680
 But there is a slight logic for her isn't it maybe she only needs to eat once a century?

108
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,600
 No, I'm saying she doesn't exist every year William Hill the bookies. They do an actual competition

109
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,680
 It's a photo competition where they award money to the winner who's provided the best photographic evidence of Loch Ness monster

110
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,960
 And this is the first year where they haven't given the head to disqualify all three entries. The first one was obviously a duck

111
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,880
 The second one was a wave and the third one a closer inspection just wasn't even the Loch

112
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
 It was just another body of water

113
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,920
 So I have a theory of what's happened to Nessie. Oh, yeah

114
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:02,120
 Well, it's not my theory. This is the theory by Britain's high priest of White Witches Kevin Carlyon and he says

115
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,360
 I personally believe Nessie is a ghost of a dinosaur who has been regularly seen in the Loch

116
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,000
 But the spirit of the creature has been so exploited in recent years

117
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,520
 I decided to carry out an exorcism hence no sightings of the monster

118
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,200
 So he's saying that he has personally killed off Nessie

119
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
 Yeah, he just thinks that people have been

120
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,480
 Yeah, people have been messing around with this spirit of a dinosaur and he wanted to set it free

121
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,960
 I really like the mythical creatures that we come up with there are so many of them in Britain

122
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,160
 I don't really know if other countries have them to the same extent

123
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,480
 But my favourite I came across in I'm reading our mutual friend at the moment

124
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,240
 And I've decided to read all of the footnotes and if you're ever reading I think Dickens especially but like read all the footnotes

125
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,400
 They're so interesting one of them made reference to the done cow this

126
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,040
 Vicious beast that was slain by Guy Earl of Warwick who was one of these like pre-medieval British heroes

127
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,360
 And yeah, it was just this cow and it produced an everlasting supply of milk and eventually got annoyed that people were like

128
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,560
 Milking it and milking it and milking it and ran away from its farm in Shropshire

129
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,520
 And eventually Guy Earl of Warwick who seems like a sort of St. George of the 10th century

130
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,240
 Went out and had to slay the cow

131
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,560
 Yeah, you say St. George but slaying a cow is not quite as impressive as slaying a dragon

132
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,400
 Although he did also slay a dragon which was it must have seemed like a step down

133
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
 It's not that difficult

134
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,640
 Did that old second monster syndrome in the game?

135
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,560
 If you go to Warwick Castle so until the 90s I'm not sure if it's still there because I haven't seen it

136
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,160
 You can see the rib of the done cow

137
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,240
 And that the king ordered would should be like put in Warwick Castle

138
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
 Is it big? They're getting all cow rib?

139
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,040
 Yes, it is bigger they think that it's actually an elephant tusk

140
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,680
 I mean skeptics think that it might not be the rib of the giant done cow

141
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,800
 That's even cooler though if this was found in Gloss the Chirin of Fear

142
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,320
 Why is no instead of saying oh it's a great crazy magical cow

143
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,960
 Why is this elephant been there?

144
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,200
 Maybe that's what they meant by a giant cow

145
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,320
 Because you know that the initial photo taken in 1933 of the Loch Ness monster

146
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,200
 The very famous photo they think that that's an elephant

147
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,360
 No, in the lake

148
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
 Just to justify you that there was a circus in town at the time

149
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,440
 Elephants as we've seen in David Attenborough documentaries do go swimming

150
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,240
 And when they do they use their trunks as snorkels

151
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,960
 And if you look at the photo it looks exactly like an elephant trunk

152
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,200
 Do you guys remember that story in 2011 where police in Southampton went on the alert

153
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,080
 Because there was a tiger sighting in one of the fields

154
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,960
 And then there was a gust of wind that blew it over and it was a cuddly toy

155
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,200
 There was a lion's skirt in the 70s in Britain which turned out to be a paper bag

156
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,480
 Well there was a lion's skirt on the last year that turned out to be a large cat

157
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,520
 So I mean you were saying you're not sure if other countries have similar kind of monster time to do

158
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,840
 So I have one or two here

159
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,400
 So the lake Okanagan in Canada they have a monster which is very similar to Nessie

160
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,720
 And every year they give a $50 prize to anyone who can shout loud enough to wake the beast up

161
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,880
 So everyone stands on the side of the lake, yells, wake up, wake up

162
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,760
 And if anyone can wake them up they get $50

163
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,120
 And they go home with the same $50, don't they?

164
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,800
 And yet no winners I think

165
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:14,440
 Isn't there a fact, you told me years ago I was saying to remember that there was an animal similar to the Loch Ness Monster that had protection policy on it in a different country?

166
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,000
 Yeah, in Sweden that was, it was the Storcio monster I think you pronounce it

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,480
 And it was classified as an endangered species in the 80s or sometime like that

168
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,240
 Yeah, because as a result of that, a direct result of that

169
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,440
 The factory government actually put the Loch Ness Monster on the animal protection

170
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,920
 Oh really?

171
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,640
 Yeah, they were going to do exactly the same, they were going to do what Sweden did but they decided that that was one step too far

172
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:44,760
 So they would just put in, they were actually there was a document that was put in front of thatcher or thatcher's main people

173
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,600
 Which they wanted to bring to Blue Nose dolphins over from America to search for the Loch Ness monster

174
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,000
 Really?

175
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,600
 Yeah, it never got passed but this was the Tory government that said

176
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,200
 What would happen when the dolphins find, is it like Flipper?

177
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
 They'll come back and go

178
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,120
 I'd like to, yeah, what's that? What's that? What's that?

179
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,760
 We're speaking of Hollywood people, what about Charlie Sheen? He went looking for the Loch Ness Monster to see him

180
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,600
 You know what? You know you're saying that there's this guy who exercise the ghost in there

181
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,240
 Charlie Sheen's getting a lot of stick from the Loch Ness Monster community, so they think

182
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,640
 The Loch Ness Monster doesn't like two and a half men or maybe they don't have been used together

183
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,080
 He went into the Loch Ness with a fishing hook and he attached the leg of lamb to a fishing rod

184
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,560
 And tried to catch it, I an old wooden boat

185
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,960
 You know what? Call me Captain Skeptical

186
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,120
 But I don't think that's any less sensible than trying to exercise its ghost

187
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,760
 Oh, look for it in the first place

188
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:50,840
 Okay, time for fact number three, this is your fact, Anna

189
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:59,160
 Yep, so my fact is that the French government forced Madame Tussaud to make models of her friends decapitated hence

190
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,040
 Yeah, poor old Madame, it's kind of like how her career started

191
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,640
 Is that during the revolution?

192
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,560
 Oh exactly, yeah, it was during the terror

193
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,800
 And the story goes that she actually had her head shaved and everything and they were ready to

194
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,320
 to capitate her as well because she was friends with the royal family and she had like

195
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,320
 there is mates in high places and she'd made wax models of a lot of them

196
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,400
 And just before they dropped the guillotine they were like actually, you come in handy

197
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,560
 because we want to make these death masks of our victims

198
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,160
 And so she writes in her memoirs about having to sift through these piles of heads

199
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,200
 Decapitated heads, pick them up, have them on her lap and making models of them

200
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,160
 Yeah, I read an account of it and I kind of got the impression that it turned into something she really enjoyed

201
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,760
 Yeah, I mean she had no choice but you know when you kind of just get used to something

202
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,320
 You know it's your job, you know, you now waxing heads for a living

203
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,120
 It was like a treasure hunt effectively, it was going like oh this is the bloke who was in the paper last week

204
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,800
 Isn't he? Mary Antoinette, it's like nothing coming on in these direct hunt reviews

205
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,520
 If you just get used to it, you're already into it

206
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,880
 She was madamsu's father, the only wax workperson at the time

207
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,960
 I don't think so, I think she just made, so I've been going on for hundreds of years

208
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,360
 I think she was just very much a self-made woman

209
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,280
 Well, my understanding of madamsu's father is that she was an apprentice to a doctor

210
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,680
 And he would make wax bits of internal organs

211
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,200
 Was that right? Oh yeah, I mean

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,000
 Was his name Cateus? Yes, Cateus

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,360
 But there's a theory that he may have been her father

214
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
 Her biological father, yes

215
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,720
 I know, her mother's husband was killed two months before she was madamsu's born

216
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,680
 But there is a theory that he was her natural father

217
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,640
 Because I heard about this guy that he made most of his money making erotic wax miniatures

218
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,160
 Is that true? I don't know

219
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,760
 I didn't see that, really

220
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,720
 That cast kind of an odd light on him having this 15-year-old girl making wax models for him in his little office

221
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,520
 Creepy

222
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,920
 She was obviously talented though, when she was 16 I think she made models of Rousseau and Voltaire

223
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:09,160
 I love Voltaire because Voltaire had a statistician friend who figured out that this lottery that the French government was proposing

224
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:17,480
 As a way of it making money, actually if you bought up all the tickets of it you were guaranteed to win more money than you'd spent buying the tickets

225
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,360
 So Voltaire bought up all the tickets offered in this French lottery and became the equivalent of a millionaire today

226
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,480
 And never had to work again

227
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,400
 I don't know if this is completely true but with Madame to source these days when they do a wax work of someone

228
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,160
 There's no contracts for anything and technically I think people could request for it to be taken away

229
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,120
 They could say I'm not, I don't want to be done as a wax work

230
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,640
 But everyone just finds it's such an honour that they're fine for it to be done

231
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,840
 Yeah I think you worked, wouldn't you?

232
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,480
 Some people put a few clauses with it so Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson have both said you can do me

233
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,640
 and it's fine and people can take photos but no press are allowed to take photos of the wax work

234
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,480
 Because then they'll start using that as press shots and so they're good

235
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,920
 They're good but they're not that good

236
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
 Yeah

237
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,560
 Tom Cruise bought it again in Madame to source wax work of music and he just loves that thing

238
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,840
 I found it very interesting who they pick, who the pool of people is

239
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
 Because now it's almost all celebrities

240
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,640
 Although every monarch since George III has had a wax work made of them

241
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,880
 So every king of Queen of England

242
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,920
 Off the top of my head, Ian Duncan Smith is the only leader of the Conservative Party not to have had a wax work

243
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,080
 Oh no that's because he's the most likely isn't it?

244
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,920
 Well it takes a while as well to make the wax work and he wasn't leader for very long

245
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,400
 So I mentioned by the time they'd booked the appointments he was out

246
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,400
 Do you know Jenny Ryan who works on QI a few years ago

247
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,880
 Well and she had to ring up Madame to source for another reason to find out

248
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,720
 Which was the most groped wax work at Madame to source

249
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,800
 And she found out that it was Brad Pitt

250
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,920
 And the way they find out is they work it out by

251
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,440
 Which is the one that's taken in for maintenance of the most knowledge

252
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,240
 Because presumably he would have had to have been taken in for maintenance constantly

253
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,080
 They had Hitler in a glass box didn't they because they were worried that he was going to be

254
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,600
 Repeatedly attacked and in fact he was and he was beheaded in fact

255
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,960
 Yeah someone ripped his head off, was that before or after or when was that 2008?

256
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,000
 2008, it's not lunatics who have made one during the war I suppose

257
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,400
 I think he had his maiden in 1930s, that's not really

258
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,240
 And then gradually they moved it from, you know, honored place with other states

259
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,200
 Men went to the ground floor to the Chamber of Commons

260
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,440
 They don't actually in the Lou or something like that

261
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,480
 There's also there was a rumor going around that

262
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,520
 Gary Borolo it was melted down into Britney Spears

263
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,880
 So it was so great that he was curious but it turned out that wasn't true

264
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,480
 He was taken away, he was taken out after take that had finished

265
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,160
 But he was brought back when Robbie Williams and take that got back together

266
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,800
 But it meant that he's kept an aware house in the interim

267
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,400
 And apparently there's a warehouse with all these fallen wax works

268
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,360
 Yeah which is kind of it's like the like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark

269
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,560
 And I don't know who we're in there

270
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
 That is the stuff of Nightmares, I really think

271
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,000
 Imagine being locked in that warehouse

272
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,880
 It's just going to be all people from the 80s isn't it?

273
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
 Yeah vanilla rice is in there

274
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,280
 I read as well that some people is so enthusiastic about being turned into a wax work

275
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,800
 That they just do as much as they can to help out with the authenticity of

276
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,280
 Oh yeah

277
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,240
 And Boris Johnson when he was turned into a wax work

278
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,240
 He gave on the spot after they measured him the clothes that he was wearing

279
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
 And he left it all to me

280
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,200
 Oh yeah

281
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,520
 That was his excuse for why he was found wandering the streets of the naked

282
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,160
 But if you visit Boris Johnson at Madame Two Swords

283
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,880
 Have a look at the bottom of his trousers because you'll notice that there's a rip

284
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,720
 And that's a rip from a bike chain from when he was riding over to be measured

285
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,760
 Oh, yeah so there's a little bit of PR stunt

286
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,520
 Even as I love cycling at

287
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,280
 That is the best cockney rhyming slang I've ever heard PR stunt

288
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,240
 Boris Johnson is a complete PR stunt

289
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,320
 Apparently in the past five years 123 pairs of false teeth

290
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,200
 And one false leg have been left behind in Madame Two Swords

291
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
 One set of ones to claim

292
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,240
 Who leaves their teeth?

293
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,760
 I don't know, 123 pairs, five years a lot isn't it?

294
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,240
 One last fact about wax works and wax in general

295
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,760
 It's possible to fire lasers at a fly's brain and make it have sex with a ball of wax

296
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,120
 Not only possible, it's great fun

297
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,160
 For the fly or for you

298
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,120
 I suppose the fly, if the fly doesn't know that it's having sex with a ball of wax

299
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,640
 So there will feel stupid afterwards

300
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,440
 Yeah

301
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,240
 We've all been there

302
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,520
 *laughs*

303
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,560
 Okay, final fact of the show

304
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
 And we come to you, Andy

305
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,280
 My fact is that during the Normandy landings the Allied forces dropped dogs by parachute onto

306
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,800
 Why are they able to do that?

307
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,880
 The UK deployed parachute dogs in the Second World War

308
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,880
 Which we used to identify minefields and to keep watch and to warn of enemies

309
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,360
 Yeah, you know when you say identify minefields

310
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,680
 Does that basically mean wander over a minefield?

311
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,800
 *laughs*

312
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,240
 There was a snippet, a snippet dance

313
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,600
 Yeah, they could smell them

314
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,960
 And they, so yeah, there were three, initially just three, sent over

315
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,680
 Brian, Monty and Rene

316
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,160
 And Rene, I think, was the only female parachuteist in the British army during the war

317
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,720
 And they were sent in with the 13th Lancashire Paris

318
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,840
 And then one of the articles I read it said they were called "Paradox"

319
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,080
 "Breakets short for parachuting dogs"

320
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,200
 *laughs*

321
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,400
 Which I love

322
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,240
 But the more office have made radio appeals in 1941 for people to give up their dogs for the war movement

323
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,680
 And basically lots of people used it as an opportunity to just get rid of their dogs

324
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,240
 Oh

325
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,280
 So they, they have thousands sent in and lots of them weren't suitable

326
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,120
 So were they trained to, like, pull the parachute cord at the right time?

327
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,360
 I think the parachutes opened automatically

328
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,080
 And they were, because they were the right shape and size

329
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,760
 They were given the same parachutes that the parachute was used to drop bicycles over the battlefield

330
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,160
 Which they all, sorry Addy, are you saying a dog is the same shape as a bicycle?

331
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,000
 And size, and you can, if you peddle it right, they're the same effect

332
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
 *laughs*

333
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
 That's a very good point

334
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,360
 Um, yeah

335
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,240
 The first training was to jump out of the plane with a bit of meat

336
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,280
 In your pocket

337
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,920
 *laughs*

338
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,880
 And then I think...

339
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,200
 And then I think for someone else to throw the dog out of the plane

340
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,840
 No, no, no, no, it's actually slightly cooler than that

341
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,440
 They used to starve the dogs

342
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,040
 Um, and so what they would do is they would hold the meat outside the plane

343
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,440
 So the dogs would leave for, yeah, yeah, yeah

344
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
 And how else are you going to get a dog out other than throwing it?

345
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,120
 Yeah, but they're not cruel

346
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,560
 I think, I think, I think, eventually they got used to it though, didn't they?

347
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,680
 You didn't get used to it though

348
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,600
 I watched them watching a really interesting documentary a while back about um

349
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,680
 I think it was 12 paratroopers from the Second World War

350
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,160
 Who, they did their first parachute jump and they were obviously terrified

351
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,640
 As you are when you threw yourself out of a plane for the first time

352
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,520
 Really, really nervous

353
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,680
 And then obviously they did it for the subsequent five years

354
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,600
 Got really used to it, not to get it all

355
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,120
 Didn't parachute for 50 years

356
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,400
 And this documentary picked up on them when they were in their 70s and 80s

357
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,800
 And said, "Jonna do a parachute jump again, let's see how it is"

358
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,040
 Now to 50 years, not a trace of fear in them

359
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,760
 And it's like this thing where the way to get over a phobia permanently

360
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,960
 Is to do it repeatedly

361
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,160
 And you're cured for life

362
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,160
 So 50 years they didn't parachute and they all just blazing up in the plane

363
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,000
 You're, when you're looking for illustrious, decapitated heads

364
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,760
 You're used to it

365
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,600
 So I have something else about people dropping stuff by parachute during the war

366
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,400
 And during Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia

367
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,800
 And they dropped sheep and bulls by parachute

368
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,120
 And the reason was, and they needed food

369
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,080
 They were in the desert

370
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,200
 And what's the best way of doing it?

371
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,880
 You can drop meat down, that's very enough

372
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,720
 Or you can drop live animals

373
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,520
 And then they can butcher themselves whenever they need the meat

374
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,480
 And so that's what they did

375
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
 They dropped their bulls on the sheep

376
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,960
 They attached them to modified harnesses

377
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,880
 And parachuted them down to the soldiers

378
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,320
 That is a main style

379
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,040
 Yeah

380
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,280
 That must be the biggest thing that's ever been parachuted

381
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,920
 A bull

382
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,600
 I read that in parachutes, actually, during war times

383
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,440
 People, as well as, you know, you'd look out for it because of enemy

384
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,840
 But you would also be looking out for it because parachutes, the material

385
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 Was such a collectible

386
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
 There was a thing that everyone, yeah, yeah

387
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,040
 Like apparently if it was a silk one, that would be the common little triangles

388
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,240
 And you would turn them into underwear

389
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,280
 That's true

390
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
 Otherwise they had no underwear

391
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
 Like a new meaning to go and commando

392
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,360
 I love, have you guys seen the footage of friends

393
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,160
 Oh yeah

394
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,200
 Rachel, yeah, were you watching that poor guy

395
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,720
 Who developed a parachute suit, I think, starting in 1910

396
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,280
 And I just love the fact that he saw he made this parachute suit

397
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,760
 Which he decided was going to be useful, effective, and work

398
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,680
 And it just didn't work consistently, didn't

399
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,280
 And he threw various dummies wearing it off from various heights

400
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,160
 And they all just plummeted to the ground and died of dummy death

401
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,160
 And then he tried to throw himself off there, like 10 meters high, sort of levels, um, fell, broke his leg

402
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,480
 And so he thought, well, this has gone well

403
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,520
 I'm gonna ask if I can throw myself off the Eiffel Tower wearing it

404
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,720
 And so, yeah, he did and died

405
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,600
 And you can watch it

406
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,320
 You can watch it on YouTube, it's an extraordinary bit of footage

407
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,040
 That's amazing, I didn't realise that it had gone so badly before he decided to jump off the Eiffel Tower

408
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,120
 Just to get, just to give him the benefit of the doubt

409
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,920
 Isn't, did he jump off the viewing platform at the Eiffel Tower?

410
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,200
 Yeah, because he saw no platform

411
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,480
 And that's quite low, isn't it?

412
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,280
 Yep, but I wouldn't be surprised if, maybe if he jumped from higher, it might have worked

413
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,560
 That was what some people said

414
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,800
 Some people claim that his parachute looked like his parachute suit suddenly blossomed

415
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 At the last moment, the last split second

416
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,640
 But I actually can't, I've watched the footage

417
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,240
 That sounds like a wily coyote and roach run a thing, doesn't it?

418
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,240
 He splatts down and then the parachute opens just to be run

419
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,520
 Yeah, he's the most amazing one stars though, I wondered why the most stars didn't save him with the air resistance, it's so good

420
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,160
 One of my favourite facts about D-Day landings is that 4% of the sand on the beach today in Normandy

421
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,280
 Is made up of tiny metal particles left over from artillery explosions during the attack

422
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,240
 No, 4%? That's a lot, isn't it?

423
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,720
 Yeah

424
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,160
 Did you guys read it in the 2000, or someone tried to replicate it in our adventures?

425
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,320
 Who is one of the first people to design a parachute?

426
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,080
 Yeah, it was like a triangle or what was it?

427
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,360
 Yeah, it was, I think it was a bunch of triangles

428
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,040
 And anyway, it definitely had wood in full

429
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,600
 So in his design, it was like some sort of cloth

430
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,000
 And wooden things holding it together, wooden plank, holding it together

431
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,920
 So someone tried to recreate this in the 2000, but using modern materials and said it worked

432
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,800
 And it was this, like, it was all over the news saying they didn't know to venture to design

433
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,040
 Works, this guy survived, but he used cloth and modern materials

434
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
 I feel like if he built a parachute out of wood

435
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
 It would never have worked, would it?

436
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,120
 I don't think it would work

437
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,720
 That would never have worked

438
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,720
 I think the official, I guess, first parachute jump

439
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,320
 As far as we know, the first public one

440
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,640
 So it was done by Luis Sebastian Lennemond in Montpellier in France

441
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,400
 And his very first jump was off a tree holding two umbrellas

442
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,800
 Cool

443
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,240
 That was the very first parachute jump

444
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,520
 So, do we not counter the Monsbury Monk Ilmer of Monsbury

445
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,400
 Who was the 11th century monk who flew 200 meters

446
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,560
 When he jumped off the top of Monsbury Abbey

447
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,800
 He was airborne for 15 seconds, they've worked out

448
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,240
 Because they know where he landed

449
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
 And where he took off from and how high it was

450
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,400
 And he just made a bunch of wings for himself on his feet and his pants

451
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,720
 And he said if he'd remembered to make himself a tail

452
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,880
 Then he would have been arm-harmed

453
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,160
 And that actually seems to be true

454
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,560
 Because it, like, gives you an equilibrium and means that

455
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,040
 You're giving me a really good look at him

456
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,880
 You're giving me a really good look at him

457
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,120
 I think that sounds very true

458
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,920
 And people would have thought him a fool when he did that

459
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,680
 And yet, a few hundred years later

460
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,000
 We are throwing dogs out of planes

461
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,360
 To help identify mines

462
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
 Still doing it, 2010

463
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,520
 German shepherds were being flown in

464
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,560
 And dropped over Taliban regions

465
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,160
 It was just fine on the Taliban

466
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,040
 It's a spy

467
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,560
 Yeah, they had little cameras on them

468
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,040
 Wow

469
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,320
 Yeah, German shepherds

470
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,360
 I like the fact that in the war it was German shepherds

471
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,960
 That the British were dropping on Germany

472
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,640
 I mean, they're not so strong

473
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,440
 You treading

474
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,640
 That reminded me that there's always countries that

475
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,600
 Find an animal and then arrest it for spying

476
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,200
 But after the whole time, isn't it?

477
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,840
 Yes

478
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,440
 Was it Saudi Arabia?

479
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,400
 I'm making this up

480
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,280
 Saudi Arabia that arrested a coconut for spying

481
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,440
 I remember that

482
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,480
 How was it?

483
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,760
 I don't know

484
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,280
 I think it's amazing

485
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,040
 I find you guilty of spying

486
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,880
 You have to be broken up and put in cocktails

487
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,760
 There was a bounty on his head

488
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
 [Laughter]

489
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:19,720
 Okay, that's all that there is for this week

490
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,680

 They have all the links to the stuff that we're talking about

 Videos that go with what we're talking about

505
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,000
 It's a great page

506
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,800
