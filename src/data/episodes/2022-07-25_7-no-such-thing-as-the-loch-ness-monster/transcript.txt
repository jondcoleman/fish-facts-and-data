 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah, um, which was there's no such thing as a fish
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of underwater life. He says it right that first paragraph. No such thing as a fish
 Hello and welcome to no such thing as a fish. This is a QI elf podcast coming to you from our offices in Covenant Garden
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with three other QILs James Harkin and Ange Zinsky and Andy Murray and once again
 We're huddled around our microphone and these are the best facts that we found out from the last seven days
 So in no particular order. Here we go
 Okay, fact number one. We're going to start with you James
 Okay, yeah, my fact this week is a computer game has been invented that takes more than a lifetime to complete
 Is it digitized normally?
 Oh, yeah, because remember that thing we found there was a computer simulation of monopoly and they found that something like 12% of all games will go on indefinitely
 Which is not true because it's much more than that
 What do you mean so with monopoly? How would it go on everyone with illness certain portion of the body?
 Yeah, just keep going. Terry Pratchett has a computer game in his book, which is called Journey to Alpha Centauri
 which takes over 3,000 years to play and
 It's just you know the screen save the very old passion screen save with just the moving dots for a spaceship
 It's that with a counter counting down for three thousand years and at the end the dot appears in the middle of the screen
 It says welcome to Alpha Centauri now go home and someone has actually made that it's a very rough game
 We're going to find out about this. No, we're talking about game. Okay, and this this came from the design museum
 I went there this weekend
 It's the design of the year 2014 is competition for all the best design things and this was that thing that I thought was most interesting
 But the idea is it's kind of an art installation and they're asking questions like what happens to digital things after you die
 If you die halfway through that game
 Can you pass it on to another person to finish off the game is that possible or maybe this game is designed for mobile phones
 What happens when mobile phones and obsolete will the game carry on and so they're asking those kind of questions
 We're going to be dispiriting to you know to find out that your great uncle have bequeathed you his high score
 So far in this game that you just had to keep on playing it for the rest of your life
 To my first son I leave all the property and for my second son I leave this game
 Hey, you guys know how many hours of games are played per week on earth by humans if you tallyed up over hours
 I'll say a hundred million a hundred million hours. Yeah, I would say I'm gonna go for
 Two billion. Okay, I'm gonna go for just 24 hours 24 hours. Yeah, and I think most of humanity's out on a walk
 The answer is three billion hours
 Oh, yes, I say I'm close, but actually I'm a billion out
 Feels close. So gamers are supposed to be good at using drones aren't they for war? Yeah, and also
 Searching a tree. Yeah, if they play computer games it's supposed to help them with keyhole surgery and stuff like this
 There's a lot of job opportunities coming up for gamers now, which didn't exist before
 When Robert Ballard discovered the record of Titanic probably in your head you have an image that he was in a submersible
 But he wasn't a submarine, but they would send down drone submarines as it were and obviously you need someone to operate them
 This this is a quote from he said I would not let an adult drive my robot. They don't have enough gaming experience
 So with this game did you actually play it?
 I I prodded at the screen a few times, but I couldn't really work out how to play it. Oh, okay. Maybe that's why it takes lifetimes the first
 Just some of the other things of this design of the year they had the first car that's been able to drive
 100 kilometers on one liter of petrol. It looks really cool
 It's a bit like James Bond car. It's very sleek and in order to help their
 Aerodynamics, they don't have wing mirrors and instead they have tiny cameras
 They had talking lamp posts. Is that useful? They were popular stop that stop that bad dog
 They were in Bristol last year of the year before I think and the idea is that say you had a rubbish bin and it was full
 Then you would be able to talk to your rubbish bin and say you're a bit full and he got oh, sorry
 I'll make sure I sought that out and then we get emptied
 So it's a way of the community kind of dealing with stuff like that. Yes, it's really interesting thing, isn't it?
 There's this guy and you guys heard of Demetri its cove. No, so he set up this thing called the 2045 initiative
 Basically it's a Russian mogul who thinks that we who wants to remove our minds from our bodies essentially so our mind's gonna forever
 Well, that's never gone wrong in any films
 I think it seems very promising
 So by 2045 he really thinks that we'll have our mind to do a couple from our bodies and he's gonna live forever
 And he's a hundred percent certain of this and we'll have holograms and we'll be able to like
 Shop in department stores for the body that we want that most suits our purposes and
 Live for eternity and he met the Dalai Lama to discuss it
 He apparently was really supportive according to their website
 The thing is at the moment the computer capabilities isn't enough to simulate human brain is it? Yeah 2045 scenes
 Ambitious so if I have something about things that run for longer than you'd expect
 Okay, because off the back of the computer game
 One of Norway's most popular recent TV shows has been a seven-hour train journey in real-time
 across Norway
 It might be quite beautiful actually. Yeah, it was and so they broadcasted in 2009 and over 20% of the population tuned in at some point at the show
 Wow, I'm Britain. That would just be like 45 minutes of set outside Milton Keynes
 I've watched that I've seen shots of the Norwegian one. It's gorgeous rolling countryside the snow in the first and it's all beautiful
 And yeah, here would not be so and they keep doing this. They've done 18 hours of fishing for salmon
 And then they had a 12-hour knitting night and my favorite is national firewood night which was in February last year
 Which was inspired by a Norwegian book solid wood all about chopping drying and stacking wood which sold as many copies as 50 shades of gray in Norway
 Oh, there are different kind of people
 And the first four hours of national firewood night was a discussion of firewood
 And then the next eight hours was shot was a live fireplace being filmed for eight hours and they had 60 complaints
 Half were complaining that the bark had been put facing up and the other half of being complaining it was put facing down
 Just picking up on this idea of things that go on for an extended amount of time
 There's so there's obviously the game where it takes a lifetime or more than a lifetime to play
 There's a lot of musical pieces that do exactly that as well John Cage famously has a piece
 It's called Oregon squared slash ASL SP as a musical piece
 Which was written in 1987 for an Oregon
 The piece itself lasts 20 to 70 minutes
 But it's gonna finish it's gonna go for about 639 years ending in the year
 2640 and people you know the next note is gonna be played in a few years time and people will go and watch that note be played in this continuing piece
 That sounds good. Yeah, they use John Cage to teach like beginners piano because a lot of his pieces are very easy
 Technically speaking like piece number one don't play anything. Yeah, especially for minutes
 That's one of the easiest things to play. There's a lot of people who accidentally play a note during that four-minute
 See what you've gone wrong here
 Classic mistake
 Did you guys know that this game called ESP and I don't know if that's actually exists anymore
 I couldn't get the website to open, but basically two people simultaneously like tag a picture with keywords
 And if you tag it with the same word then you get a point and that's how they tied a whole bunch of Google images
 Wow
 I thought what you're gonna say is that people around the world are all playing this game
 And they're gonna see if two people say the same thing at the same time and then see if there is actually ESP going up
 I don't think it counts as ESP if you're both showing a picture of a table in both bright tables
 Call me captain skeptic
 Okay, let's move on to fact number two this one's my fact the fact is that
 2013 was the first years since 1933 that there hasn't been a sighting of the Loch Ness monster
 So there's huge worries in the Loch Ness monster community because they think Nessie's dead
 Oh, it just learned to be a bit more surreptitious after hundreds of years of being constantly spotted
 If I just stay underwater
 No, I think they're worried. I think because they think Nessie's a friendly animal doesn't mind being spotted
 People like Nessie very much so it's not an aggressive animal
 It's never in fact in in 2005 there was a triathlon in Scotland
 Where all of the athletes took a 1 million pound insurance deal out in case of being attacked by the Loch Ness monster when they were
 Swimming across the Loch and the the community came out saying that's a ridiculous thing to do if anything she would join in
 She would she would and she would beat them because she's a great swimmer
 They're obviously saying that the Loch Ness monster is friendly because she hasn't killed anyone in the last 70 years
 But there is a slight logic for her isn't it maybe she only needs to eat once a century?
 No, I'm saying she doesn't exist every year William Hill the bookies. They do an actual competition
 It's a photo competition where they award money to the winner who's provided the best photographic evidence of Loch Ness monster
 And this is the first year where they haven't given the head to disqualify all three entries. The first one was obviously a duck
 The second one was a wave and the third one a closer inspection just wasn't even the Loch
 It was just another body of water
 So I have a theory of what's happened to Nessie. Oh, yeah
 Well, it's not my theory. This is the theory by Britain's high priest of White Witches Kevin Carlyon and he says
 I personally believe Nessie is a ghost of a dinosaur who has been regularly seen in the Loch
 But the spirit of the creature has been so exploited in recent years
 I decided to carry out an exorcism hence no sightings of the monster
 So he's saying that he has personally killed off Nessie
 Yeah, he just thinks that people have been
 Yeah, people have been messing around with this spirit of a dinosaur and he wanted to set it free
 I really like the mythical creatures that we come up with there are so many of them in Britain
 I don't really know if other countries have them to the same extent
 But my favourite I came across in I'm reading our mutual friend at the moment
 And I've decided to read all of the footnotes and if you're ever reading I think Dickens especially but like read all the footnotes
 They're so interesting one of them made reference to the done cow this
 Vicious beast that was slain by Guy Earl of Warwick who was one of these like pre-medieval British heroes
 And yeah, it was just this cow and it produced an everlasting supply of milk and eventually got annoyed that people were like
 Milking it and milking it and milking it and ran away from its farm in Shropshire
 And eventually Guy Earl of Warwick who seems like a sort of St. George of the 10th century
 Went out and had to slay the cow
 Yeah, you say St. George but slaying a cow is not quite as impressive as slaying a dragon
 Although he did also slay a dragon which was it must have seemed like a step down
 It's not that difficult
 Did that old second monster syndrome in the game?
 If you go to Warwick Castle so until the 90s I'm not sure if it's still there because I haven't seen it
 You can see the rib of the done cow
 And that the king ordered would should be like put in Warwick Castle
 Is it big? They're getting all cow rib?
 Yes, it is bigger they think that it's actually an elephant tusk
 I mean skeptics think that it might not be the rib of the giant done cow
 That's even cooler though if this was found in Gloss the Chirin of Fear
 Why is no instead of saying oh it's a great crazy magical cow
 Why is this elephant been there?
 Maybe that's what they meant by a giant cow
 Because you know that the initial photo taken in 1933 of the Loch Ness monster
 The very famous photo they think that that's an elephant
 No, in the lake
 Just to justify you that there was a circus in town at the time
 Elephants as we've seen in David Attenborough documentaries do go swimming
 And when they do they use their trunks as snorkels
 And if you look at the photo it looks exactly like an elephant trunk
 Do you guys remember that story in 2011 where police in Southampton went on the alert
 Because there was a tiger sighting in one of the fields
 And then there was a gust of wind that blew it over and it was a cuddly toy
 There was a lion's skirt in the 70s in Britain which turned out to be a paper bag
 Well there was a lion's skirt on the last year that turned out to be a large cat
 So I mean you were saying you're not sure if other countries have similar kind of monster time to do
 So I have one or two here
 So the lake Okanagan in Canada they have a monster which is very similar to Nessie
 And every year they give a $50 prize to anyone who can shout loud enough to wake the beast up
 So everyone stands on the side of the lake, yells, wake up, wake up
 And if anyone can wake them up they get $50
 And they go home with the same $50, don't they?
 And yet no winners I think
 Isn't there a fact, you told me years ago I was saying to remember that there was an animal similar to the Loch Ness Monster that had protection policy on it in a different country?
 Yeah, in Sweden that was, it was the Storcio monster I think you pronounce it
 And it was classified as an endangered species in the 80s or sometime like that
 Yeah, because as a result of that, a direct result of that
 The factory government actually put the Loch Ness Monster on the animal protection
 Oh really?
 Yeah, they were going to do exactly the same, they were going to do what Sweden did but they decided that that was one step too far
 So they would just put in, they were actually there was a document that was put in front of thatcher or thatcher's main people
 Which they wanted to bring to Blue Nose dolphins over from America to search for the Loch Ness monster
 Really?
 Yeah, it never got passed but this was the Tory government that said
 What would happen when the dolphins find, is it like Flipper?
 They'll come back and go
 I'd like to, yeah, what's that? What's that? What's that?
 We're speaking of Hollywood people, what about Charlie Sheen? He went looking for the Loch Ness Monster to see him
 You know what? You know you're saying that there's this guy who exercise the ghost in there
 Charlie Sheen's getting a lot of stick from the Loch Ness Monster community, so they think
 The Loch Ness Monster doesn't like two and a half men or maybe they don't have been used together
 He went into the Loch Ness with a fishing hook and he attached the leg of lamb to a fishing rod
 And tried to catch it, I an old wooden boat
 You know what? Call me Captain Skeptical
 But I don't think that's any less sensible than trying to exercise its ghost
 Oh, look for it in the first place
 Okay, time for fact number three, this is your fact, Anna
 Yep, so my fact is that the French government forced Madame Tussaud to make models of her friends decapitated hence
 Yeah, poor old Madame, it's kind of like how her career started
 Is that during the revolution?
 Oh exactly, yeah, it was during the terror
 And the story goes that she actually had her head shaved and everything and they were ready to
 to capitate her as well because she was friends with the royal family and she had like
 there is mates in high places and she'd made wax models of a lot of them
 And just before they dropped the guillotine they were like actually, you come in handy
 because we want to make these death masks of our victims
 And so she writes in her memoirs about having to sift through these piles of heads
 Decapitated heads, pick them up, have them on her lap and making models of them
 Yeah, I read an account of it and I kind of got the impression that it turned into something she really enjoyed
 Yeah, I mean she had no choice but you know when you kind of just get used to something
 You know it's your job, you know, you now waxing heads for a living
 It was like a treasure hunt effectively, it was going like oh this is the bloke who was in the paper last week
 Isn't he? Mary Antoinette, it's like nothing coming on in these direct hunt reviews
 If you just get used to it, you're already into it
 She was madamsu's father, the only wax workperson at the time
 I don't think so, I think she just made, so I've been going on for hundreds of years
 I think she was just very much a self-made woman
 Well, my understanding of madamsu's father is that she was an apprentice to a doctor
 And he would make wax bits of internal organs
 Was that right? Oh yeah, I mean
 Was his name Cateus? Yes, Cateus
 But there's a theory that he may have been her father
 Her biological father, yes
 I know, her mother's husband was killed two months before she was madamsu's born
 But there is a theory that he was her natural father
 Because I heard about this guy that he made most of his money making erotic wax miniatures
 Is that true? I don't know
 I didn't see that, really
 That cast kind of an odd light on him having this 15-year-old girl making wax models for him in his little office
 Creepy
 She was obviously talented though, when she was 16 I think she made models of Rousseau and Voltaire
 I love Voltaire because Voltaire had a statistician friend who figured out that this lottery that the French government was proposing
 As a way of it making money, actually if you bought up all the tickets of it you were guaranteed to win more money than you'd spent buying the tickets
 So Voltaire bought up all the tickets offered in this French lottery and became the equivalent of a millionaire today
 And never had to work again
 I don't know if this is completely true but with Madame to source these days when they do a wax work of someone
 There's no contracts for anything and technically I think people could request for it to be taken away
 They could say I'm not, I don't want to be done as a wax work
 But everyone just finds it's such an honour that they're fine for it to be done
 Yeah I think you worked, wouldn't you?
 Some people put a few clauses with it so Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson have both said you can do me
 and it's fine and people can take photos but no press are allowed to take photos of the wax work
 Because then they'll start using that as press shots and so they're good
 They're good but they're not that good
 Yeah
 Tom Cruise bought it again in Madame to source wax work of music and he just loves that thing
 I found it very interesting who they pick, who the pool of people is
 Because now it's almost all celebrities
 Although every monarch since George III has had a wax work made of them
 So every king of Queen of England
 Off the top of my head, Ian Duncan Smith is the only leader of the Conservative Party not to have had a wax work
 Oh no that's because he's the most likely isn't it?
 Well it takes a while as well to make the wax work and he wasn't leader for very long
 So I mentioned by the time they'd booked the appointments he was out
 Do you know Jenny Ryan who works on QI a few years ago
 Well and she had to ring up Madame to source for another reason to find out
 Which was the most groped wax work at Madame to source
 And she found out that it was Brad Pitt
 And the way they find out is they work it out by
 Which is the one that's taken in for maintenance of the most knowledge
 Because presumably he would have had to have been taken in for maintenance constantly
 They had Hitler in a glass box didn't they because they were worried that he was going to be
 Repeatedly attacked and in fact he was and he was beheaded in fact
 Yeah someone ripped his head off, was that before or after or when was that 2008?
 2008, it's not lunatics who have made one during the war I suppose
 I think he had his maiden in 1930s, that's not really
 And then gradually they moved it from, you know, honored place with other states
 Men went to the ground floor to the Chamber of Commons
 They don't actually in the Lou or something like that
 There's also there was a rumor going around that
 Gary Borolo it was melted down into Britney Spears
 So it was so great that he was curious but it turned out that wasn't true
 He was taken away, he was taken out after take that had finished
 But he was brought back when Robbie Williams and take that got back together
 But it meant that he's kept an aware house in the interim
 And apparently there's a warehouse with all these fallen wax works
 Yeah which is kind of it's like the like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark
 And I don't know who we're in there
 That is the stuff of Nightmares, I really think
 Imagine being locked in that warehouse
 It's just going to be all people from the 80s isn't it?
 Yeah vanilla rice is in there
 I read as well that some people is so enthusiastic about being turned into a wax work
 That they just do as much as they can to help out with the authenticity of
 Oh yeah
 And Boris Johnson when he was turned into a wax work
 He gave on the spot after they measured him the clothes that he was wearing
 And he left it all to me
 Oh yeah
 That was his excuse for why he was found wandering the streets of the naked
 But if you visit Boris Johnson at Madame Two Swords
 Have a look at the bottom of his trousers because you'll notice that there's a rip
 And that's a rip from a bike chain from when he was riding over to be measured
 Oh, yeah so there's a little bit of PR stunt
 Even as I love cycling at
 That is the best cockney rhyming slang I've ever heard PR stunt
 Boris Johnson is a complete PR stunt
 Apparently in the past five years 123 pairs of false teeth
 And one false leg have been left behind in Madame Two Swords
 One set of ones to claim
 Who leaves their teeth?
 I don't know, 123 pairs, five years a lot isn't it?
 One last fact about wax works and wax in general
 It's possible to fire lasers at a fly's brain and make it have sex with a ball of wax
 Not only possible, it's great fun
 For the fly or for you
 I suppose the fly, if the fly doesn't know that it's having sex with a ball of wax
 So there will feel stupid afterwards
 Yeah
 We've all been there
 *laughs*
 Okay, final fact of the show
 And we come to you, Andy
 My fact is that during the Normandy landings the Allied forces dropped dogs by parachute onto
 Why are they able to do that?
 The UK deployed parachute dogs in the Second World War
 Which we used to identify minefields and to keep watch and to warn of enemies
 Yeah, you know when you say identify minefields
 Does that basically mean wander over a minefield?
 *laughs*
 There was a snippet, a snippet dance
 Yeah, they could smell them
 And they, so yeah, there were three, initially just three, sent over
 Brian, Monty and Rene
 And Rene, I think, was the only female parachuteist in the British army during the war
 And they were sent in with the 13th Lancashire Paris
 And then one of the articles I read it said they were called "Paradox"
 "Breakets short for parachuting dogs"
 *laughs*
 Which I love
 But the more office have made radio appeals in 1941 for people to give up their dogs for the war movement
 And basically lots of people used it as an opportunity to just get rid of their dogs
 Oh
 So they, they have thousands sent in and lots of them weren't suitable
 So were they trained to, like, pull the parachute cord at the right time?
 I think the parachutes opened automatically
 And they were, because they were the right shape and size
 They were given the same parachutes that the parachute was used to drop bicycles over the battlefield
 Which they all, sorry Addy, are you saying a dog is the same shape as a bicycle?
 And size, and you can, if you peddle it right, they're the same effect
 *laughs*
 That's a very good point
 Um, yeah
 The first training was to jump out of the plane with a bit of meat
 In your pocket
 *laughs*
 And then I think...
 And then I think for someone else to throw the dog out of the plane
 No, no, no, no, it's actually slightly cooler than that
 They used to starve the dogs
 Um, and so what they would do is they would hold the meat outside the plane
 So the dogs would leave for, yeah, yeah, yeah
 And how else are you going to get a dog out other than throwing it?
 Yeah, but they're not cruel
 I think, I think, I think, eventually they got used to it though, didn't they?
 You didn't get used to it though
 I watched them watching a really interesting documentary a while back about um
 I think it was 12 paratroopers from the Second World War
 Who, they did their first parachute jump and they were obviously terrified
 As you are when you threw yourself out of a plane for the first time
 Really, really nervous
 And then obviously they did it for the subsequent five years
 Got really used to it, not to get it all
 Didn't parachute for 50 years
 And this documentary picked up on them when they were in their 70s and 80s
 And said, "Jonna do a parachute jump again, let's see how it is"
 Now to 50 years, not a trace of fear in them
 And it's like this thing where the way to get over a phobia permanently
 Is to do it repeatedly
 And you're cured for life
 So 50 years they didn't parachute and they all just blazing up in the plane
 You're, when you're looking for illustrious, decapitated heads
 You're used to it
 So I have something else about people dropping stuff by parachute during the war
 And during Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia
 And they dropped sheep and bulls by parachute
 And the reason was, and they needed food
 They were in the desert
 And what's the best way of doing it?
 You can drop meat down, that's very enough
 Or you can drop live animals
 And then they can butcher themselves whenever they need the meat
 And so that's what they did
 They dropped their bulls on the sheep
 They attached them to modified harnesses
 And parachuted them down to the soldiers
 That is a main style
 Yeah
 That must be the biggest thing that's ever been parachuted
 A bull
 I read that in parachutes, actually, during war times
 People, as well as, you know, you'd look out for it because of enemy
 But you would also be looking out for it because parachutes, the material
 Was such a collectible
 There was a thing that everyone, yeah, yeah
 Like apparently if it was a silk one, that would be the common little triangles
 And you would turn them into underwear
 That's true
 Otherwise they had no underwear
 Like a new meaning to go and commando
 I love, have you guys seen the footage of friends
 Oh yeah
 Rachel, yeah, were you watching that poor guy
 Who developed a parachute suit, I think, starting in 1910
 And I just love the fact that he saw he made this parachute suit
 Which he decided was going to be useful, effective, and work
 And it just didn't work consistently, didn't
 And he threw various dummies wearing it off from various heights
 And they all just plummeted to the ground and died of dummy death
 And then he tried to throw himself off there, like 10 meters high, sort of levels, um, fell, broke his leg
 And so he thought, well, this has gone well
 I'm gonna ask if I can throw myself off the Eiffel Tower wearing it
 And so, yeah, he did and died
 And you can watch it
 You can watch it on YouTube, it's an extraordinary bit of footage
 That's amazing, I didn't realise that it had gone so badly before he decided to jump off the Eiffel Tower
 Just to get, just to give him the benefit of the doubt
 Isn't, did he jump off the viewing platform at the Eiffel Tower?
 Yeah, because he saw no platform
 And that's quite low, isn't it?
 Yep, but I wouldn't be surprised if, maybe if he jumped from higher, it might have worked
 That was what some people said
 Some people claim that his parachute looked like his parachute suit suddenly blossomed
 At the last moment, the last split second
 But I actually can't, I've watched the footage
 That sounds like a wily coyote and roach run a thing, doesn't it?
 He splatts down and then the parachute opens just to be run
 Yeah, he's the most amazing one stars though, I wondered why the most stars didn't save him with the air resistance, it's so good
 One of my favourite facts about D-Day landings is that 4% of the sand on the beach today in Normandy
 Is made up of tiny metal particles left over from artillery explosions during the attack
 No, 4%? That's a lot, isn't it?
 Yeah
 Did you guys read it in the 2000, or someone tried to replicate it in our adventures?
 Who is one of the first people to design a parachute?
 Yeah, it was like a triangle or what was it?
 Yeah, it was, I think it was a bunch of triangles
 And anyway, it definitely had wood in full
 So in his design, it was like some sort of cloth
 And wooden things holding it together, wooden plank, holding it together
 So someone tried to recreate this in the 2000, but using modern materials and said it worked
 And it was this, like, it was all over the news saying they didn't know to venture to design
 Works, this guy survived, but he used cloth and modern materials
 I feel like if he built a parachute out of wood
 It would never have worked, would it?
 I don't think it would work
 That would never have worked
 I think the official, I guess, first parachute jump
 As far as we know, the first public one
 So it was done by Luis Sebastian Lennemond in Montpellier in France
 And his very first jump was off a tree holding two umbrellas
 Cool
 That was the very first parachute jump
 So, do we not counter the Monsbury Monk Ilmer of Monsbury
 Who was the 11th century monk who flew 200 meters
 When he jumped off the top of Monsbury Abbey
 He was airborne for 15 seconds, they've worked out
 Because they know where he landed
 And where he took off from and how high it was
 And he just made a bunch of wings for himself on his feet and his pants
 And he said if he'd remembered to make himself a tail
 Then he would have been arm-harmed
 And that actually seems to be true
 Because it, like, gives you an equilibrium and means that
 You're giving me a really good look at him
 You're giving me a really good look at him
 I think that sounds very true
 And people would have thought him a fool when he did that
 And yet, a few hundred years later
 We are throwing dogs out of planes
 To help identify mines
 Still doing it, 2010
 German shepherds were being flown in
 And dropped over Taliban regions
 It was just fine on the Taliban
 It's a spy
 Yeah, they had little cameras on them
 Wow
 Yeah, German shepherds
 I like the fact that in the war it was German shepherds
 That the British were dropping on Germany
 I mean, they're not so strong
 You treading
 That reminded me that there's always countries that
 Find an animal and then arrest it for spying
 But after the whole time, isn't it?
 Yes
 Was it Saudi Arabia?
 I'm making this up
 Saudi Arabia that arrested a coconut for spying
 I remember that
 How was it?
 I don't know
 I think it's amazing
 I find you guilty of spying
 You have to be broken up and put in cocktails
 There was a bounty on his head
 [Laughter]
 Okay, that's all that there is for this week
 There's of our facts
 Thanks so much for listening everyone
