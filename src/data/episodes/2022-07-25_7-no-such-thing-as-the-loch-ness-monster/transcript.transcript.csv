00:00:00,00:00:04,"We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah, um, which was there's no such thing as a fish"
00:00:04,00:00:12,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of underwater life. He says it right that first paragraph. No such thing as a fish"
00:00:12,00:00:25,Hello and welcome to no such thing as a fish. This is a QI elf podcast coming to you from our offices in Covenant Garden
00:00:25,00:00:32,My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with three other QILs James Harkin and Ange Zinsky and Andy Murray and once again
00:00:32,00:00:37,We're huddled around our microphone and these are the best facts that we found out from the last seven days
00:00:37,00:00:39,So in no particular order. Here we go
00:00:39,00:00:43,"Okay, fact number one. We're going to start with you James"
00:00:43,00:00:51,"Okay, yeah, my fact this week is a computer game has been invented that takes more than a lifetime to complete"
00:00:51,00:00:53,Is it digitized normally?
00:00:54,00:01:02,"Oh, yeah, because remember that thing we found there was a computer simulation of monopoly and they found that something like 12% of all games will go on indefinitely"
00:01:02,00:01:06,Which is not true because it's much more than that
00:01:06,00:01:11,What do you mean so with monopoly? How would it go on everyone with illness certain portion of the body?
00:01:11,00:01:16,"Yeah, just keep going. Terry Pratchett has a computer game in his book, which is called Journey to Alpha Centauri"
00:01:16,00:01:19,"which takes over 3,000 years to play and"
00:01:20,00:01:25,It's just you know the screen save the very old passion screen save with just the moving dots for a spaceship
00:01:25,00:01:30,It's that with a counter counting down for three thousand years and at the end the dot appears in the middle of the screen
00:01:30,00:01:36,It says welcome to Alpha Centauri now go home and someone has actually made that it's a very rough game
00:01:36,00:01:43,"We're going to find out about this. No, we're talking about game. Okay, and this this came from the design museum"
00:01:43,00:01:44,I went there this weekend
00:01:44,00:01:51,It's the design of the year 2014 is competition for all the best design things and this was that thing that I thought was most interesting
00:01:51,00:01:59,But the idea is it's kind of an art installation and they're asking questions like what happens to digital things after you die
00:01:59,00:02:01,If you die halfway through that game
00:02:01,00:02:07,Can you pass it on to another person to finish off the game is that possible or maybe this game is designed for mobile phones
00:02:07,00:02:12,What happens when mobile phones and obsolete will the game carry on and so they're asking those kind of questions
00:02:12,00:02:19,We're going to be dispiriting to you know to find out that your great uncle have bequeathed you his high score
00:02:19,00:02:23,So far in this game that you just had to keep on playing it for the rest of your life
00:02:23,00:02:30,To my first son I leave all the property and for my second son I leave this game
00:02:30,00:02:38,"Hey, you guys know how many hours of games are played per week on earth by humans if you tallyed up over hours"
00:02:38,00:02:42,"I'll say a hundred million a hundred million hours. Yeah, I would say I'm gonna go for"
00:02:42,00:02:50,"Two billion. Okay, I'm gonna go for just 24 hours 24 hours. Yeah, and I think most of humanity's out on a walk"
00:02:50,00:02:53,The answer is three billion hours
00:02:53,00:02:57,"Oh, yes, I say I'm close, but actually I'm a billion out"
00:02:57,00:03:04,"Feels close. So gamers are supposed to be good at using drones aren't they for war? Yeah, and also"
00:03:04,00:03:10,"Searching a tree. Yeah, if they play computer games it's supposed to help them with keyhole surgery and stuff like this"
00:03:10,00:03:14,"There's a lot of job opportunities coming up for gamers now, which didn't exist before"
00:03:14,00:03:20,When Robert Ballard discovered the record of Titanic probably in your head you have an image that he was in a submersible
00:03:20,00:03:27,"But he wasn't a submarine, but they would send down drone submarines as it were and obviously you need someone to operate them"
00:03:27,00:03:33,This this is a quote from he said I would not let an adult drive my robot. They don't have enough gaming experience
00:03:33,00:03:35,So with this game did you actually play it?
00:03:35,00:03:43,"I I prodded at the screen a few times, but I couldn't really work out how to play it. Oh, okay. Maybe that's why it takes lifetimes the first"
00:03:43,00:03:51,Just some of the other things of this design of the year they had the first car that's been able to drive
00:03:51,00:03:55,100 kilometers on one liter of petrol. It looks really cool
00:03:55,00:04:00,It's a bit like James Bond car. It's very sleek and in order to help their
00:04:00,00:04:04,"Aerodynamics, they don't have wing mirrors and instead they have tiny cameras"
00:04:05,00:04:11,They had talking lamp posts. Is that useful? They were popular stop that stop that bad dog
00:04:11,00:04:19,They were in Bristol last year of the year before I think and the idea is that say you had a rubbish bin and it was full
00:04:19,00:04:25,"Then you would be able to talk to your rubbish bin and say you're a bit full and he got oh, sorry"
00:04:25,00:04:27,I'll make sure I sought that out and then we get emptied
00:04:27,00:04:32,"So it's a way of the community kind of dealing with stuff like that. Yes, it's really interesting thing, isn't it?"
00:04:33,00:04:39,"There's this guy and you guys heard of Demetri its cove. No, so he set up this thing called the 2045 initiative"
00:04:39,00:04:46,Basically it's a Russian mogul who thinks that we who wants to remove our minds from our bodies essentially so our mind's gonna forever
00:04:46,00:04:48,"Well, that's never gone wrong in any films"
00:04:48,00:04:51,I think it seems very promising
00:04:51,00:04:55,So by 2045 he really thinks that we'll have our mind to do a couple from our bodies and he's gonna live forever
00:04:55,00:04:59,And he's a hundred percent certain of this and we'll have holograms and we'll be able to like
00:04:59,00:05:03,Shop in department stores for the body that we want that most suits our purposes and
00:05:03,00:05:07,Live for eternity and he met the Dalai Lama to discuss it
00:05:07,00:05:10,He apparently was really supportive according to their website
00:05:10,00:05:16,The thing is at the moment the computer capabilities isn't enough to simulate human brain is it? Yeah 2045 scenes
00:05:16,00:05:21,Ambitious so if I have something about things that run for longer than you'd expect
00:05:21,00:05:24,"Okay, because off the back of the computer game"
00:05:24,00:05:30,One of Norway's most popular recent TV shows has been a seven-hour train journey in real-time
00:05:30,00:05:32,across Norway
00:05:32,00:05:40,"It might be quite beautiful actually. Yeah, it was and so they broadcasted in 2009 and over 20% of the population tuned in at some point at the show"
00:05:40,00:05:44,"Wow, I'm Britain. That would just be like 45 minutes of set outside Milton Keynes"
00:05:44,00:05:52,I've watched that I've seen shots of the Norwegian one. It's gorgeous rolling countryside the snow in the first and it's all beautiful
00:05:52,00:05:58,"And yeah, here would not be so and they keep doing this. They've done 18 hours of fishing for salmon"
00:05:58,00:06:05,And then they had a 12-hour knitting night and my favorite is national firewood night which was in February last year
00:06:05,00:06:13,Which was inspired by a Norwegian book solid wood all about chopping drying and stacking wood which sold as many copies as 50 shades of gray in Norway
00:06:13,00:06:15,"Oh, there are different kind of people"
00:06:15,00:06:21,And the first four hours of national firewood night was a discussion of firewood
00:06:22,00:06:27,And then the next eight hours was shot was a live fireplace being filmed for eight hours and they had 60 complaints
00:06:27,00:06:33,Half were complaining that the bark had been put facing up and the other half of being complaining it was put facing down
00:06:33,00:06:42,Just picking up on this idea of things that go on for an extended amount of time
00:06:42,00:06:46,There's so there's obviously the game where it takes a lifetime or more than a lifetime to play
00:06:47,00:06:51,There's a lot of musical pieces that do exactly that as well John Cage famously has a piece
00:06:51,00:06:56,It's called Oregon squared slash ASL SP as a musical piece
00:06:56,00:06:59,Which was written in 1987 for an Oregon
00:06:59,00:07:03,The piece itself lasts 20 to 70 minutes
00:07:03,00:07:07,But it's gonna finish it's gonna go for about 639 years ending in the year
00:07:07,00:07:16,2640 and people you know the next note is gonna be played in a few years time and people will go and watch that note be played in this continuing piece
00:07:16,00:07:23,"That sounds good. Yeah, they use John Cage to teach like beginners piano because a lot of his pieces are very easy"
00:07:23,00:07:27,"Technically speaking like piece number one don't play anything. Yeah, especially for minutes"
00:07:27,00:07:33,That's one of the easiest things to play. There's a lot of people who accidentally play a note during that four-minute
00:07:33,00:07:37,See what you've gone wrong here
00:07:37,00:07:39,Classic mistake
00:07:39,00:07:43,Did you guys know that this game called ESP and I don't know if that's actually exists anymore
00:07:43,00:07:48,"I couldn't get the website to open, but basically two people simultaneously like tag a picture with keywords"
00:07:48,00:07:54,And if you tag it with the same word then you get a point and that's how they tied a whole bunch of Google images
00:07:54,00:07:57,Wow
00:07:57,00:08:01,I thought what you're gonna say is that people around the world are all playing this game
00:08:01,00:08:07,And they're gonna see if two people say the same thing at the same time and then see if there is actually ESP going up
00:08:07,00:08:11,I don't think it counts as ESP if you're both showing a picture of a table in both bright tables
00:08:11,00:08:13,Call me captain skeptic
00:08:13,00:08:24,"Okay, let's move on to fact number two this one's my fact the fact is that"
00:08:24,00:08:30,2013 was the first years since 1933 that there hasn't been a sighting of the Loch Ness monster
00:08:30,00:08:34,So there's huge worries in the Loch Ness monster community because they think Nessie's dead
00:08:34,00:08:39,"Oh, it just learned to be a bit more surreptitious after hundreds of years of being constantly spotted"
00:08:39,00:08:41,If I just stay underwater
00:08:41,00:08:47,"No, I think they're worried. I think because they think Nessie's a friendly animal doesn't mind being spotted"
00:08:47,00:08:50,People like Nessie very much so it's not an aggressive animal
00:08:50,00:08:54,It's never in fact in in 2005 there was a triathlon in Scotland
00:08:54,00:09:03,Where all of the athletes took a 1 million pound insurance deal out in case of being attacked by the Loch Ness monster when they were
00:09:03,00:09:09,Swimming across the Loch and the the community came out saying that's a ridiculous thing to do if anything she would join in
00:09:09,00:09:12,She would she would and she would beat them because she's a great swimmer
00:09:12,00:09:17,They're obviously saying that the Loch Ness monster is friendly because she hasn't killed anyone in the last 70 years
00:09:17,00:09:22,But there is a slight logic for her isn't it maybe she only needs to eat once a century?
00:09:22,00:09:28,"No, I'm saying she doesn't exist every year William Hill the bookies. They do an actual competition"
00:09:28,00:09:34,It's a photo competition where they award money to the winner who's provided the best photographic evidence of Loch Ness monster
00:09:34,00:09:40,And this is the first year where they haven't given the head to disqualify all three entries. The first one was obviously a duck
00:09:40,00:09:47,The second one was a wave and the third one a closer inspection just wasn't even the Loch
00:09:47,00:09:49,It was just another body of water
00:09:49,00:09:54,"So I have a theory of what's happened to Nessie. Oh, yeah"
00:09:54,00:10:02,"Well, it's not my theory. This is the theory by Britain's high priest of White Witches Kevin Carlyon and he says"
00:10:02,00:10:07,I personally believe Nessie is a ghost of a dinosaur who has been regularly seen in the Loch
00:10:07,00:10:11,But the spirit of the creature has been so exploited in recent years
00:10:11,00:10:15,I decided to carry out an exorcism hence no sightings of the monster
00:10:15,00:10:18,So he's saying that he has personally killed off Nessie
00:10:18,00:10:20,"Yeah, he just thinks that people have been"
00:10:20,00:10:25,"Yeah, people have been messing around with this spirit of a dinosaur and he wanted to set it free"
00:10:25,00:10:29,I really like the mythical creatures that we come up with there are so many of them in Britain
00:10:29,00:10:32,I don't really know if other countries have them to the same extent
00:10:32,00:10:36,But my favourite I came across in I'm reading our mutual friend at the moment
00:10:36,00:10:42,And I've decided to read all of the footnotes and if you're ever reading I think Dickens especially but like read all the footnotes
00:10:42,00:10:45,They're so interesting one of them made reference to the done cow this
00:10:46,00:10:53,Vicious beast that was slain by Guy Earl of Warwick who was one of these like pre-medieval British heroes
00:10:53,00:10:58,"And yeah, it was just this cow and it produced an everlasting supply of milk and eventually got annoyed that people were like"
00:10:58,00:11:01,Milking it and milking it and milking it and ran away from its farm in Shropshire
00:11:01,00:11:05,And eventually Guy Earl of Warwick who seems like a sort of St. George of the 10th century
00:11:05,00:11:07,Went out and had to slay the cow
00:11:07,00:11:11,"Yeah, you say St. George but slaying a cow is not quite as impressive as slaying a dragon"
00:11:11,00:11:16,Although he did also slay a dragon which was it must have seemed like a step down
00:11:16,00:11:18,It's not that difficult
00:11:18,00:11:20,Did that old second monster syndrome in the game?
00:11:20,00:11:25,If you go to Warwick Castle so until the 90s I'm not sure if it's still there because I haven't seen it
00:11:25,00:11:28,You can see the rib of the done cow
00:11:28,00:11:32,And that the king ordered would should be like put in Warwick Castle
00:11:32,00:11:34,Is it big? They're getting all cow rib?
00:11:34,00:11:37,"Yes, it is bigger they think that it's actually an elephant tusk"
00:11:37,00:11:40,I mean skeptics think that it might not be the rib of the giant done cow
00:11:40,00:11:43,That's even cooler though if this was found in Gloss the Chirin of Fear
00:11:43,00:11:47,Why is no instead of saying oh it's a great crazy magical cow
00:11:47,00:11:49,Why is this elephant been there?
00:11:49,00:11:52,Maybe that's what they meant by a giant cow
00:11:52,00:11:57,Because you know that the initial photo taken in 1933 of the Loch Ness monster
00:11:57,00:12:00,The very famous photo they think that that's an elephant
00:12:00,00:12:01,"No, in the lake"
00:12:01,00:12:05,Just to justify you that there was a circus in town at the time
00:12:05,00:12:08,Elephants as we've seen in David Attenborough documentaries do go swimming
00:12:08,00:12:10,And when they do they use their trunks as snorkels
00:12:10,00:12:12,And if you look at the photo it looks exactly like an elephant trunk
00:12:12,00:12:17,Do you guys remember that story in 2011 where police in Southampton went on the alert
00:12:17,00:12:20,Because there was a tiger sighting in one of the fields
00:12:20,00:12:22,And then there was a gust of wind that blew it over and it was a cuddly toy
00:12:22,00:12:27,There was a lion's skirt in the 70s in Britain which turned out to be a paper bag
00:12:27,00:12:33,Well there was a lion's skirt on the last year that turned out to be a large cat
00:12:33,00:12:38,So I mean you were saying you're not sure if other countries have similar kind of monster time to do
00:12:38,00:12:40,So I have one or two here
00:12:40,00:12:47,So the lake Okanagan in Canada they have a monster which is very similar to Nessie
00:12:47,00:12:53,And every year they give a $50 prize to anyone who can shout loud enough to wake the beast up
00:12:53,00:12:57,"So everyone stands on the side of the lake, yells, wake up, wake up"
00:12:57,00:13:00,And if anyone can wake them up they get $50
00:13:00,00:13:04,"And they go home with the same $50, don't they?"
00:13:04,00:13:05,And yet no winners I think
00:13:05,00:13:14,"Isn't there a fact, you told me years ago I was saying to remember that there was an animal similar to the Loch Ness Monster that had protection policy on it in a different country?"
00:13:14,00:13:19,"Yeah, in Sweden that was, it was the Storcio monster I think you pronounce it"
00:13:19,00:13:23,And it was classified as an endangered species in the 80s or sometime like that
00:13:23,00:13:27,"Yeah, because as a result of that, a direct result of that"
00:13:27,00:13:32,The factory government actually put the Loch Ness Monster on the animal protection
00:13:32,00:13:32,Oh really?
00:13:32,00:13:37,"Yeah, they were going to do exactly the same, they were going to do what Sweden did but they decided that that was one step too far"
00:13:37,00:13:44,"So they would just put in, they were actually there was a document that was put in front of thatcher or thatcher's main people"
00:13:44,00:13:50,Which they wanted to bring to Blue Nose dolphins over from America to search for the Loch Ness monster
00:13:50,00:13:51,Really?
00:13:51,00:13:54,"Yeah, it never got passed but this was the Tory government that said"
00:13:54,00:13:58,"What would happen when the dolphins find, is it like Flipper?"
00:13:58,00:13:59,They'll come back and go
00:13:59,00:14:04,"I'd like to, yeah, what's that? What's that? What's that?"
00:14:04,00:14:08,"We're speaking of Hollywood people, what about Charlie Sheen? He went looking for the Loch Ness Monster to see him"
00:14:08,00:14:12,You know what? You know you're saying that there's this guy who exercise the ghost in there
00:14:12,00:14:17,"Charlie Sheen's getting a lot of stick from the Loch Ness Monster community, so they think"
00:14:17,00:14:21,The Loch Ness Monster doesn't like two and a half men or maybe they don't have been used together
00:14:21,00:14:27,He went into the Loch Ness with a fishing hook and he attached the leg of lamb to a fishing rod
00:14:27,00:14:29,"And tried to catch it, I an old wooden boat"
00:14:29,00:14:31,You know what? Call me Captain Skeptical
00:14:31,00:14:36,But I don't think that's any less sensible than trying to exercise its ghost
00:14:36,00:14:38,"Oh, look for it in the first place"
00:14:38,00:14:50,"Okay, time for fact number three, this is your fact, Anna"
00:14:50,00:14:59,"Yep, so my fact is that the French government forced Madame Tussaud to make models of her friends decapitated hence"
00:14:59,00:15:04,"Yeah, poor old Madame, it's kind of like how her career started"
00:15:04,00:15:05,Is that during the revolution?
00:15:05,00:15:07,"Oh exactly, yeah, it was during the terror"
00:15:07,00:15:11,And the story goes that she actually had her head shaved and everything and they were ready to
00:15:11,00:15:15,to capitate her as well because she was friends with the royal family and she had like
00:15:15,00:15:19,there is mates in high places and she'd made wax models of a lot of them
00:15:19,00:15:23,"And just before they dropped the guillotine they were like actually, you come in handy"
00:15:23,00:15:25,because we want to make these death masks of our victims
00:15:25,00:15:29,And so she writes in her memoirs about having to sift through these piles of heads
00:15:29,00:15:34,"Decapitated heads, pick them up, have them on her lap and making models of them"
00:15:34,00:15:39,"Yeah, I read an account of it and I kind of got the impression that it turned into something she really enjoyed"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"Yeah, I mean she had no choice but you know when you kind of just get used to something"
00:15:42,00:15:47,"You know it's your job, you know, you now waxing heads for a living"
00:15:47,00:15:52,"It was like a treasure hunt effectively, it was going like oh this is the bloke who was in the paper last week"
00:15:52,00:15:55,"Isn't he? Mary Antoinette, it's like nothing coming on in these direct hunt reviews"
00:15:55,00:16:00,"If you just get used to it, you're already into it"
00:16:00,00:16:05,"She was madamsu's father, the only wax workperson at the time"
00:16:05,00:16:09,"I don't think so, I think she just made, so I've been going on for hundreds of years"
00:16:09,00:16:12,I think she was just very much a self-made woman
00:16:12,00:16:16,"Well, my understanding of madamsu's father is that she was an apprentice to a doctor"
00:16:16,00:16:20,And he would make wax bits of internal organs
00:16:20,00:16:22,"Was that right? Oh yeah, I mean"
00:16:22,00:16:25,"Was his name Cateus? Yes, Cateus"
00:16:25,00:16:28,But there's a theory that he may have been her father
00:16:28,00:16:30,"Her biological father, yes"
00:16:30,00:16:35,"I know, her mother's husband was killed two months before she was madamsu's born"
00:16:35,00:16:38,But there is a theory that he was her natural father
00:16:38,00:16:43,Because I heard about this guy that he made most of his money making erotic wax miniatures
00:16:43,00:16:45,Is that true? I don't know
00:16:45,00:16:46,"I didn't see that, really"
00:16:46,00:16:53,That cast kind of an odd light on him having this 15-year-old girl making wax models for him in his little office
00:16:53,00:16:54,Creepy
00:16:54,00:17:00,"She was obviously talented though, when she was 16 I think she made models of Rousseau and Voltaire"
00:17:00,00:17:09,I love Voltaire because Voltaire had a statistician friend who figured out that this lottery that the French government was proposing
00:17:09,00:17:17,"As a way of it making money, actually if you bought up all the tickets of it you were guaranteed to win more money than you'd spent buying the tickets"
00:17:17,00:17:22,So Voltaire bought up all the tickets offered in this French lottery and became the equivalent of a millionaire today
00:17:22,00:17:23,And never had to work again
00:17:23,00:17:29,I don't know if this is completely true but with Madame to source these days when they do a wax work of someone
00:17:29,00:17:35,There's no contracts for anything and technically I think people could request for it to be taken away
00:17:35,00:17:38,"They could say I'm not, I don't want to be done as a wax work"
00:17:38,00:17:41,But everyone just finds it's such an honour that they're fine for it to be done
00:17:41,00:17:42,"Yeah I think you worked, wouldn't you?"
00:17:42,00:17:47,Some people put a few clauses with it so Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson have both said you can do me
00:17:47,00:17:51,and it's fine and people can take photos but no press are allowed to take photos of the wax work
00:17:51,00:17:57,Because then they'll start using that as press shots and so they're good
00:17:57,00:17:58,They're good but they're not that good
00:17:58,00:18:00,Yeah
00:18:00,00:18:05,Tom Cruise bought it again in Madame to source wax work of music and he just loves that thing
00:18:05,00:18:08,"I found it very interesting who they pick, who the pool of people is"
00:18:08,00:18:10,Because now it's almost all celebrities
00:18:10,00:18:13,Although every monarch since George III has had a wax work made of them
00:18:13,00:18:15,So every king of Queen of England
00:18:15,00:18:20,"Off the top of my head, Ian Duncan Smith is the only leader of the Conservative Party not to have had a wax work"
00:18:20,00:18:23,Oh no that's because he's the most likely isn't it?
00:18:23,00:18:26,Well it takes a while as well to make the wax work and he wasn't leader for very long
00:18:26,00:18:29,So I mentioned by the time they'd booked the appointments he was out
00:18:29,00:18:33,Do you know Jenny Ryan who works on QI a few years ago
00:18:33,00:18:37,Well and she had to ring up Madame to source for another reason to find out
00:18:37,00:18:41,Which was the most groped wax work at Madame to source
00:18:41,00:18:43,And she found out that it was Brad Pitt
00:18:43,00:18:46,And the way they find out is they work it out by
00:18:46,00:18:50,Which is the one that's taken in for maintenance of the most knowledge
00:18:50,00:18:53,Because presumably he would have had to have been taken in for maintenance constantly
00:18:53,00:18:57,They had Hitler in a glass box didn't they because they were worried that he was going to be
00:18:57,00:19:00,Repeatedly attacked and in fact he was and he was beheaded in fact
00:19:00,00:19:05,"Yeah someone ripped his head off, was that before or after or when was that 2008?"
00:19:05,00:19:09,"2008, it's not lunatics who have made one during the war I suppose"
00:19:09,00:19:11,"I think he had his maiden in 1930s, that's not really"
00:19:11,00:19:15,"And then gradually they moved it from, you know, honored place with other states"
00:19:15,00:19:18,Men went to the ground floor to the Chamber of Commons
00:19:18,00:19:20,They don't actually in the Lou or something like that
00:19:20,00:19:23,There's also there was a rumor going around that
00:19:23,00:19:26,Gary Borolo it was melted down into Britney Spears
00:19:26,00:19:29,So it was so great that he was curious but it turned out that wasn't true
00:19:29,00:19:33,"He was taken away, he was taken out after take that had finished"
00:19:33,00:19:37,But he was brought back when Robbie Williams and take that got back together
00:19:37,00:19:39,But it meant that he's kept an aware house in the interim
00:19:39,00:19:43,And apparently there's a warehouse with all these fallen wax works
00:19:43,00:19:46,Yeah which is kind of it's like the like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark
00:19:46,00:19:47,And I don't know who we're in there
00:19:47,00:19:49,"That is the stuff of Nightmares, I really think"
00:19:49,00:19:51,Imagine being locked in that warehouse
00:19:51,00:19:53,It's just going to be all people from the 80s isn't it?
00:19:53,00:19:55,Yeah vanilla rice is in there
00:19:55,00:20:02,I read as well that some people is so enthusiastic about being turned into a wax work
00:20:02,00:20:05,That they just do as much as they can to help out with the authenticity of
00:20:05,00:20:06,Oh yeah
00:20:06,00:20:09,And Boris Johnson when he was turned into a wax work
00:20:09,00:20:13,He gave on the spot after they measured him the clothes that he was wearing
00:20:13,00:20:15,And he left it all to me
00:20:15,00:20:16,Oh yeah
00:20:16,00:20:20,That was his excuse for why he was found wandering the streets of the naked
00:20:20,00:20:23,But if you visit Boris Johnson at Madame Two Swords
00:20:23,00:20:27,Have a look at the bottom of his trousers because you'll notice that there's a rip
00:20:27,00:20:31,And that's a rip from a bike chain from when he was riding over to be measured
00:20:31,00:20:34,"Oh, yeah so there's a little bit of PR stunt"
00:20:34,00:20:36,Even as I love cycling at
00:20:36,00:20:40,That is the best cockney rhyming slang I've ever heard PR stunt
00:20:40,00:20:45,Boris Johnson is a complete PR stunt
00:20:45,00:20:49,Apparently in the past five years 123 pairs of false teeth
00:20:49,00:20:52,And one false leg have been left behind in Madame Two Swords
00:20:52,00:20:53,One set of ones to claim
00:20:53,00:20:57,Who leaves their teeth?
00:20:57,00:21:00,"I don't know, 123 pairs, five years a lot isn't it?"
00:21:00,00:21:05,One last fact about wax works and wax in general
00:21:05,00:21:10,It's possible to fire lasers at a fly's brain and make it have sex with a ball of wax
00:21:10,00:21:12,"Not only possible, it's great fun"
00:21:12,00:21:15,For the fly or for you
00:21:15,00:21:18,"I suppose the fly, if the fly doesn't know that it's having sex with a ball of wax"
00:21:18,00:21:19,So there will feel stupid afterwards
00:21:19,00:21:20,Yeah
00:21:20,00:21:21,We've all been there
00:21:21,00:21:22,*laughs*
00:21:22,00:21:29,"Okay, final fact of the show"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"And we come to you, Andy"
00:21:31,00:21:38,My fact is that during the Normandy landings the Allied forces dropped dogs by parachute onto
00:21:38,00:21:39,Why are they able to do that?
00:21:39,00:21:43,The UK deployed parachute dogs in the Second World War
00:21:43,00:21:47,Which we used to identify minefields and to keep watch and to warn of enemies
00:21:47,00:21:50,"Yeah, you know when you say identify minefields"
00:21:50,00:21:52,Does that basically mean wander over a minefield?
00:21:52,00:21:53,*laughs*
00:21:53,00:21:55,"There was a snippet, a snippet dance"
00:21:55,00:21:56,"Yeah, they could smell them"
00:21:56,00:21:59,"And they, so yeah, there were three, initially just three, sent over"
00:21:59,00:22:02,"Brian, Monty and Rene"
00:22:02,00:22:07,"And Rene, I think, was the only female parachuteist in the British army during the war"
00:22:07,00:22:09,And they were sent in with the 13th Lancashire Paris
00:22:09,00:22:12,"And then one of the articles I read it said they were called ""Paradox"""
00:22:12,00:22:15,"""Breakets short for parachuting dogs"""
00:22:15,00:22:16,*laughs*
00:22:16,00:22:17,Which I love
00:22:17,00:22:23,But the more office have made radio appeals in 1941 for people to give up their dogs for the war movement
00:22:23,00:22:26,And basically lots of people used it as an opportunity to just get rid of their dogs
00:22:26,00:22:27,Oh
00:22:27,00:22:30,"So they, they have thousands sent in and lots of them weren't suitable"
00:22:30,00:22:34,"So were they trained to, like, pull the parachute cord at the right time?"
00:22:34,00:22:36,I think the parachutes opened automatically
00:22:36,00:22:39,"And they were, because they were the right shape and size"
00:22:39,00:22:44,They were given the same parachutes that the parachute was used to drop bicycles over the battlefield
00:22:44,00:22:49,"Which they all, sorry Addy, are you saying a dog is the same shape as a bicycle?"
00:22:49,00:22:53,"And size, and you can, if you peddle it right, they're the same effect"
00:22:53,00:22:54,*laughs*
00:22:54,00:22:55,That's a very good point
00:22:55,00:22:56,"Um, yeah"
00:22:56,00:22:59,The first training was to jump out of the plane with a bit of meat
00:22:59,00:23:00,In your pocket
00:23:00,00:23:00,*laughs*
00:23:00,00:23:01,And then I think...
00:23:01,00:23:04,And then I think for someone else to throw the dog out of the plane
00:23:04,00:23:06,"No, no, no, no, it's actually slightly cooler than that"
00:23:06,00:23:08,They used to starve the dogs
00:23:08,00:23:12,"Um, and so what they would do is they would hold the meat outside the plane"
00:23:12,00:23:14,"So the dogs would leave for, yeah, yeah, yeah"
00:23:14,00:23:16,And how else are you going to get a dog out other than throwing it?
00:23:16,00:23:18,"Yeah, but they're not cruel"
00:23:18,00:23:21,"I think, I think, I think, eventually they got used to it though, didn't they?"
00:23:21,00:23:22,You didn't get used to it though
00:23:22,00:23:26,I watched them watching a really interesting documentary a while back about um
00:23:26,00:23:28,I think it was 12 paratroopers from the Second World War
00:23:28,00:23:31,"Who, they did their first parachute jump and they were obviously terrified"
00:23:31,00:23:33,As you are when you threw yourself out of a plane for the first time
00:23:33,00:23:34,"Really, really nervous"
00:23:34,00:23:36,And then obviously they did it for the subsequent five years
00:23:36,00:23:38,"Got really used to it, not to get it all"
00:23:38,00:23:40,Didn't parachute for 50 years
00:23:40,00:23:43,And this documentary picked up on them when they were in their 70s and 80s
00:23:43,00:23:45,"And said, ""Jonna do a parachute jump again, let's see how it is"""
00:23:45,00:23:48,"Now to 50 years, not a trace of fear in them"
00:23:48,00:23:50,And it's like this thing where the way to get over a phobia permanently
00:23:50,00:23:51,Is to do it repeatedly
00:23:51,00:23:53,And you're cured for life
00:23:53,00:23:57,So 50 years they didn't parachute and they all just blazing up in the plane
00:23:57,00:24:01,"You're, when you're looking for illustrious, decapitated heads"
00:24:01,00:24:02,You're used to it
00:24:02,00:24:06,So I have something else about people dropping stuff by parachute during the war
00:24:06,00:24:09,And during Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia
00:24:09,00:24:13,And they dropped sheep and bulls by parachute
00:24:13,00:24:16,"And the reason was, and they needed food"
00:24:16,00:24:17,They were in the desert
00:24:17,00:24:18,And what's the best way of doing it?
00:24:18,00:24:19,"You can drop meat down, that's very enough"
00:24:19,00:24:21,Or you can drop live animals
00:24:21,00:24:24,And then they can butcher themselves whenever they need the meat
00:24:24,00:24:25,And so that's what they did
00:24:25,00:24:26,They dropped their bulls on the sheep
00:24:26,00:24:29,They attached them to modified harnesses
00:24:29,00:24:31,And parachuted them down to the soldiers
00:24:31,00:24:33,That is a main style
00:24:33,00:24:34,Yeah
00:24:34,00:24:36,That must be the biggest thing that's ever been parachuted
00:24:36,00:24:36,A bull
00:24:36,00:24:40,"I read that in parachutes, actually, during war times"
00:24:40,00:24:44,"People, as well as, you know, you'd look out for it because of enemy"
00:24:44,00:24:48,"But you would also be looking out for it because parachutes, the material"
00:24:48,00:24:50,Was such a collectible
00:24:50,00:24:52,"There was a thing that everyone, yeah, yeah"
00:24:52,00:24:56,"Like apparently if it was a silk one, that would be the common little triangles"
00:24:56,00:24:57,And you would turn them into underwear
00:24:57,00:24:58,That's true
00:24:58,00:25:00,Otherwise they had no underwear
00:25:00,00:25:02,Like a new meaning to go and commando
00:25:05,00:25:08,"I love, have you guys seen the footage of friends"
00:25:08,00:25:09,Oh yeah
00:25:09,00:25:12,"Rachel, yeah, were you watching that poor guy"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"Who developed a parachute suit, I think, starting in 1910"
00:25:15,00:25:18,And I just love the fact that he saw he made this parachute suit
00:25:18,00:25:20,"Which he decided was going to be useful, effective, and work"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"And it just didn't work consistently, didn't"
00:25:22,00:25:26,And he threw various dummies wearing it off from various heights
00:25:26,00:25:29,And they all just plummeted to the ground and died of dummy death
00:25:29,00:25:35,"And then he tried to throw himself off there, like 10 meters high, sort of levels, um, fell, broke his leg"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"And so he thought, well, this has gone well"
00:25:37,00:25:40,I'm gonna ask if I can throw myself off the Eiffel Tower wearing it
00:25:40,00:25:43,"And so, yeah, he did and died"
00:25:43,00:25:44,And you can watch it
00:25:44,00:25:47,"You can watch it on YouTube, it's an extraordinary bit of footage"
00:25:47,00:25:52,"That's amazing, I didn't realise that it had gone so badly before he decided to jump off the Eiffel Tower"
00:25:52,00:25:54,"Just to get, just to give him the benefit of the doubt"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Isn't, did he jump off the viewing platform at the Eiffel Tower?"
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Yeah, because he saw no platform"
00:25:58,00:25:59,"And that's quite low, isn't it?"
00:25:59,00:26:04,"Yep, but I wouldn't be surprised if, maybe if he jumped from higher, it might have worked"
00:26:04,00:26:05,That was what some people said
00:26:05,00:26:09,Some people claim that his parachute looked like his parachute suit suddenly blossomed
00:26:09,00:26:11,"At the last moment, the last split second"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"But I actually can't, I've watched the footage"
00:26:13,00:26:17,"That sounds like a wily coyote and roach run a thing, doesn't it?"
00:26:17,00:26:21,He splatts down and then the parachute opens just to be run
00:26:21,00:26:28,"Yeah, he's the most amazing one stars though, I wondered why the most stars didn't save him with the air resistance, it's so good"
00:26:28,00:26:35,One of my favourite facts about D-Day landings is that 4% of the sand on the beach today in Normandy
00:26:35,00:26:40,Is made up of tiny metal particles left over from artillery explosions during the attack
00:26:40,00:26:43,"No, 4%? That's a lot, isn't it?"
00:26:43,00:26:43,Yeah
00:26:43,00:26:47,"Did you guys read it in the 2000, or someone tried to replicate it in our adventures?"
00:26:47,00:26:49,Who is one of the first people to design a parachute?
00:26:49,00:26:51,"Yeah, it was like a triangle or what was it?"
00:26:51,00:26:54,"Yeah, it was, I think it was a bunch of triangles"
00:26:54,00:26:56,"And anyway, it definitely had wood in full"
00:26:56,00:26:58,"So in his design, it was like some sort of cloth"
00:26:58,00:27:03,"And wooden things holding it together, wooden plank, holding it together"
00:27:03,00:27:06,"So someone tried to recreate this in the 2000, but using modern materials and said it worked"
00:27:06,00:27:11,"And it was this, like, it was all over the news saying they didn't know to venture to design"
00:27:11,00:27:16,"Works, this guy survived, but he used cloth and modern materials"
00:27:16,00:27:18,I feel like if he built a parachute out of wood
00:27:18,00:27:19,"It would never have worked, would it?"
00:27:19,00:27:20,I don't think it would work
00:27:20,00:27:21,That would never have worked
00:27:21,00:27:25,"I think the official, I guess, first parachute jump"
00:27:25,00:27:27,"As far as we know, the first public one"
00:27:27,00:27:31,So it was done by Luis Sebastian Lennemond in Montpellier in France
00:27:31,00:27:35,And his very first jump was off a tree holding two umbrellas
00:27:35,00:27:35,Cool
00:27:35,00:27:37,That was the very first parachute jump
00:27:37,00:27:42,"So, do we not counter the Monsbury Monk Ilmer of Monsbury"
00:27:42,00:27:45,Who was the 11th century monk who flew 200 meters
00:27:45,00:27:47,When he jumped off the top of Monsbury Abbey
00:27:47,00:27:49,"He was airborne for 15 seconds, they've worked out"
00:27:49,00:27:51,Because they know where he landed
00:27:51,00:27:53,And where he took off from and how high it was
00:27:53,00:27:57,And he just made a bunch of wings for himself on his feet and his pants
00:27:57,00:27:59,And he said if he'd remembered to make himself a tail
00:27:59,00:28:01,Then he would have been arm-harmed
00:28:01,00:28:03,And that actually seems to be true
00:28:03,00:28:05,"Because it, like, gives you an equilibrium and means that"
00:28:05,00:28:08,You're giving me a really good look at him
00:28:08,00:28:09,You're giving me a really good look at him
00:28:09,00:28:12,I think that sounds very true
00:28:12,00:28:14,And people would have thought him a fool when he did that
00:28:14,00:28:16,"And yet, a few hundred years later"
00:28:16,00:28:19,We are throwing dogs out of planes
00:28:19,00:28:20,To help identify mines
00:28:20,00:28:22,"Still doing it, 2010"
00:28:22,00:28:24,German shepherds were being flown in
00:28:24,00:28:27,And dropped over Taliban regions
00:28:27,00:28:29,It was just fine on the Taliban
00:28:29,00:28:30,It's a spy
00:28:30,00:28:31,"Yeah, they had little cameras on them"
00:28:31,00:28:32,Wow
00:28:32,00:28:33,"Yeah, German shepherds"
00:28:33,00:28:36,I like the fact that in the war it was German shepherds
00:28:36,00:28:37,That the British were dropping on Germany
00:28:37,00:28:39,"I mean, they're not so strong"
00:28:39,00:28:40,You treading
00:28:40,00:28:45,That reminded me that there's always countries that
00:28:45,00:28:48,Find an animal and then arrest it for spying
00:28:48,00:28:50,"But after the whole time, isn't it?"
00:28:50,00:28:50,Yes
00:28:50,00:28:52,Was it Saudi Arabia?
00:28:52,00:28:53,I'm making this up
00:28:53,00:28:56,Saudi Arabia that arrested a coconut for spying
00:28:56,00:29:00,I remember that
00:29:00,00:29:01,How was it?
00:29:01,00:29:02,I don't know
00:29:02,00:29:04,I think it's amazing
00:29:04,00:29:06,I find you guilty of spying
00:29:06,00:29:07,You have to be broken up and put in cocktails
00:29:07,00:29:10,There was a bounty on his head
00:29:11,00:29:13,[Laughter]
