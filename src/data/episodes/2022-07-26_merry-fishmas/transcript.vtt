 Chapter of the audiobook. That's what this episode is the entirety of a and what we did is we sat in a studio the four of us

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.280
 We read out the book and we just jumped in and interrupted each other along the way like a classic podcast and the other

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.140
 Present is for everyone in North America because we weren't going to be able to sell the audiobook of the air in the USA and now

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.280
 We've just had the news from the publishing company that we are going to be selling it there

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.100
 Yeah, it means that it's now available

 It's also in massive countries like all of Europe as well. So yeah, all of Europe. So yeah, I hope you enjoy it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.560
 Have a Merry Christmas everyone. Listen out the end for a couple of outtakes that James has managed to track down and we'll see you in the new year

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.400
 Merry fishmas. I knew you liked it. I do like it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.560
 Hey, in which we learn how Brexit was triggered in a space egg whether computers or humans are better at Pac-Man

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.680
 Why Australia is air dropping kangaroo sausages?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.440
 Which King doubles as an airline pilot and who's invented an underwater warehouse?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.140
 Art Varks a zookeeper performed mouth-to-snout on an ad-vark for an hour

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.660
 Only five ad-varks were born in Europe in 2016

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.280
 So when one was born in the Polish city of rock clav this year and struggled to survive

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.980
 The head of the small mammals division at the zoo there Andrej Mioska did all he could to keep him alive

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.100
 We spoke to rock clav zoo and asked how you perform CPR on an ad-vark. This is what they said

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.840
 Mr. Mioska acted on instinct

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.440
 He cut the cord placed the baby on his fleece jacket and started rubbing it vigorously but gently with a towel

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.520
 He then placed the baby snout in his mouth and blew the air in at the same time

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.640
 He was doing chest compressions using his fingers and continue rubbing with a towel

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.680
 After a few rounds the little heart started beating but the cubs still wasn't breathing

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.720
 So Mr. Mioska went on with the mouth-to-snout ventilation altogether. It took about one hour after he came out

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.880
 I am so glad you didn't do the accent there

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.920
 I thought we're gonna start on a big Polish accent. I like the idea that to do master snout on an ad-vark

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.920
 You have to hold the end of the ad-vark snout and then basically you can get both your hands around the rest of the ad-vark snout

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.920
 For people listening and these doing the mine

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.040
 Like playing a trumpet exactly. Yeah

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.440
 This reminds me of a story actually that happened quite a few years ago in China

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.440
 There was a small monkey that had eaten a peanut and it wasn't allowed to eat the peanut because it's stomach couldn't digest it

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.400
 So someone had thrown it into the cage and it laid on its back in the cage dying and it was such a rare little monkey

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.920
 They couldn't actually operate on it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.920
 So no one knew what to do all these zookeepers were going how are we gonna save this monkey and suddenly

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.960
 Zhang Bangshan who was the veteran zookeeper at that zoo step forward and said I know how to save this monkey

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.200
 And he went up to the monkey and he didn't perform mouth-to-snout

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.600
 Oh mouth-to-mouth even on the monkey. He performed mouth-to-bum-bum

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.200
 Could you spare us this technical mum-bug?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.520
 He looked the monkeys butt for over an hour

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.640
 Sort of drawing the peanut through the system kind of like you know if you drop a ball in a pool

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.400
 And you have to do that little wavy thing at the corner to bring the wave to bring the ball back to you

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.120
 He lit for an hour this peanut out of the monkey and the monkey survived

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.200
 There must have been a point about 45 minutes in where the other zookeepers were saying

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.040
 Zhang Bangshan, what are you doing? I think I'd say earlier than that. I think he would have looked at them

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.640
 I'm going to give me 15 more minutes. I also think we've gone off topic really early in this morning

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.440
 So meanwhile in South Africa, scientists finally caught Abbax having a drink

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.560
 250 years after the species was first described

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.280
 It'll long been assumed that they got all the water they needed from the juicy bodies of termites

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.520
 But a zoologist at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Potilisabeth

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.120
 Graham Curley and his team announced the evidence exists for Abbax drinking from puddles

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.960
 So we've never known them to drink before. Now this is huge news

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.440
 Feels like we just haven't been watching them hard enough

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.640
 I mean surely if they're drinking from puddles now they've always been doing it

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.320
 It's not like puddles are new are they?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.880
 Puddles have been around as long as as long as water

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.480
 This wasn't the only puddle news from the year by the way

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.960
 Researchers in Australia found that koalas are now getting their water from puddles

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.840
 They used to think it was just from eucalyptus leaves and they've never seen it before

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.000
 But they think because of climate change they're now drinking from puddles

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.440
 It's a bad year if you're a puddle

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.160
 Suddenly there are two new massive threats to your existence

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.400
 Chances are any advice for people who want to drink like Abbax?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.760
 There is if you can't find a puddle there's a bar in Exeter that's selling an advat cocktail

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.520
 It's served with real ants

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.080
 The drinks made with rum, lemongrass and lime and it's served with an ants chaser

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.400
 The bar owner Patrick Foggerty describes it as crunchy yet satisfying

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.520
 Abdications

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.800
 The Japanese Emperor wanted to abdicate but wasn't allowed to tell anyone

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.920
 Japan's Emperor Akihito is banned from making political statements

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.560
 including any that suggests that he wants to abdicate

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.080
 As a result he had to make a speech very delicately hinting at his concerns about being able to fulfill his duties

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.000
 The government eventually worked out what he meant and allowed him to step down

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.640
 I wonder if they said to him, "So do you want to abdicate?" and he said, "I didn't say that"

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:37.440
 "It's pretty much, yeah, but he had to be so subtle about it so I'm feeling pretty old guys"

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.960
 And then eventually they sort of figured it out

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.800
 But there is still a problem for him which is that he has a distinct lack of airs

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.960
 Once the new Emperor takes over there will only be three airs in total

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.800
 because empress have to be men although there is now some debate about this

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.240
 Some experts are worried that if the youngest prince Hissahito has no sons

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.840
 the 2,600 year old imperial line will be broken

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.080
 Although Hissahito is only 11 so it is a little early to tell how this will

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.600
 And it's a lot of pressure on him isn't it?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.640
 Huge amount of pressure

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.840
 That must be the smallest royal family in the world

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.560
 Is it?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.600
 Well actually I think that the Vatican is technically a one man elected monarchy

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.080
 And that is a royal family of one, but I know you disagree James

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.120
 I do disagree, yeah

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.400
 What about Saudi Arabia? They have a lot, don't they?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.920
 I think that's the largest royal family in the world

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.080
 They've got 4,000 princes

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.480
 Whoa

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.200
 I know

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.800
 So just back to Hissahito

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.760
 As a young man, he had a list of 800 candidates for marriage prepared for him

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.160
 Wow

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.920
 And he rejected every single one of them in favour of someone he met playing tennis

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.360
 And he's quite interesting guy

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.360
 His main interest is marine biology

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.520
 And he's an expert on the goby fish

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.960
 And when the goby equivalent of an emperor, the dominant male, dies

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.880
 He is replaced by the next in line

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.920
 But if there are no males, then a female will change its sex and take the emperor's place

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.920
 Abkhazia

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.680
 A country that most of the world doesn't think exists

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.040
 Had an election that assumed most of its population didn't exist

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.920
 Abkhazia is a self-declared republic that's trying to break from Georgia

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.840
 And is currently recognised only by Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.040
 And bizarrely, the tiny Pacific island of Nauru

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.480
 Still, despite the lack of more general recognition, parliamentary elections were held there this year

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.840
 And technically, elections in Abkhazia are deemed invalid if less than 25% of people vote

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.920
 But, although only 21% of the population voted on this occasion

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.800
 The election was still declared valid as it was decided that any citizen who hold Georgian passports

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.360
 Should not be regarded as Abkhazian nationals

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.840
 The country was also the subject of a critically acclaimed Romanian documentary this year

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.160
 Called Ualeh Louis Tarzan or Tarzan's Testicles

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.560
 So this was the story of the world's oldest primate centre, the Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.960
 In the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.360
 The institute provided the monkeys at the Soviet Union sent into space in the 1980s

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.920
 And it was founded by a man called Ilya Ivanov

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.040
 Whose lifetime obsession was creating an ape human hybrid

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.080
 Advertising

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.120
 The advertising for the newly opened Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.400
 Claims it as six floors taller than it actually is

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.640
 Trump hotels claim that the building is 69 stories high when actually it is only 63

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.960
 They arrived at their total by including below-ground stories which are mostly used for parking in their calculations

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:41.520
 In the course of his career, Trump has claimed that a 67-story tower has 78 floors

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.960
 That a 43-story building has 46 floors

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.000
 That a 44-story building has 52 floors

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.680
 That a 31-story building has 41 floors

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.240
 That a 70-story building has 90 floors

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.320
 And that he lives on the 66th floor of a 58-story building

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.920
 He needs to get his story straight

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:07.520
 Meanwhile, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Toronto paid a reported six million dollars

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.480
 Not to advertise itself as a Trump hotel

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.040
 The hotel decided to part ways with the Trump name

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.120
 Following many years of construction delays, lawsuits, and more recently

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.480
 Because it become a gathering point for protests against the president

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.240
 The agreement they reached allows the management to remove all of Trump's branding from the 65-story building

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.880
 Which, incidentally, has only 57 floors

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.520
 The world champion of the ancient Chinese game of go

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.600
 Was beaten by a three-year-old Brit who then immediately retired

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.600
 Intriguing

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.200
 What could that mean?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.960
 Considering I said it was about AI

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.040
 One way or another, it's been a pretty bad year for humankind

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.360
 We've been defeated by artificial intelligence at No Limit Texas Hold 'Em Poker

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.160
 And the fighting game Super Smash Bros

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.560
 But perhaps the most crushing defeat came when AlphaGo and AI program developed by Google's deep-mind technologies

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.760
 Beat the world champion China's Kirji 3-0

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.800
 AlphaGo was born in 2014 and was classed as British in the Go rankings

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.360
 As the team behind it is based in London

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.240
 After beating the world champion, it immediately retired

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:24.560
 Deep-mind CEO, Demis Hassabis, said that winning these games had been the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:31.040
 Owing to its incredible complexity, Go had been one of the final games at which humans could still beat the machines

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:37.120
 KG later said, "Lash year, it was still quite human-like, but this year it became like a god of Go"

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.680
 James, I've never played Go

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.560
 Yeah, can you quickly give me an idea of what we're talking about here?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.760
 Yeah, sure, so you have a board with lots of squares on it

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.080
 And you put pebbles on it to win territory

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.680
 And it's extremely complicated

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.560
 There are 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 171 possible combinations of move

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.680
 Which is pretty hard to imagine, right

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.240
 Can you put that in some kind of metaphorical context for me?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.440
 Yes, I can, I love it

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.960
 Oh, how convenient

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.360
 If every grain of sand on earth each contained the number of stars in the Milky Way

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.600
 And each of those stars had a hundred planets

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.480
 And each of those planets had 10 billion humans

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.640
 Then the number of cells in all those humans would be fewer than the number of zeros in the number that we're talking about

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.000
 Wow

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.840
 You know that famous story, there's a chess board and each has a grain of rice

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.240
 And it doubles and doubles and some of these go all the rice and country

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.040
 Do you think in this scenario you'd be like, "I've gone way too far"

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.440
 This is, this is a lot of rice

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.640
 Yeah

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.240
 But that interview with KG, actually Chinese fans didn't see the interview

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:43.440
 Because China, presumably for reasons of national pride, wouldn't allow the match to be shown on television or streamed online

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.840
 Air drops

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.440
 Australia is dropping sausages over its outback

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.240
 They come in two flavours, toad and kangaroo

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.240
 I will take kangaroo, please

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.240
 They're not on offer for you, I'm afraid

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.840
 So for years Australia has had this problem with cane toads which aren't indigenous to the continent

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.240
 So many of its native animals eat them

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.440
 And because the toads are toxic, they tend to kill their predators

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.440
 So to combat this, scientists are dropping cane toad flavoured sausages

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.840
 Laced with a chemical that makes predators feel sick

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.040
 Over the outback, in the hope that it'll deter them from biting the real toads in future

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.240
 A bit more brutally, the Aussie government is also dropping poisoned sausages to deal with their feral cats

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.440
 Who are also partial to a bit of kangaroo wiener

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.240
 Still fancy that kangaroo wiener Andy, now you know it's poison

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.240
 That's all actually

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.040
 This year Canada also combated an environmental issue with air drops

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.040
 This time of pregnant bison

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 Bumped National Park has not had any bison for more than a hundred years

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.440
 And the ecosystem suffers from their absence

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.440
 Conservation has collected pregnant bison from the nearby elk island

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.840
 And took them to the pastures of the Rocky Mountains

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.840
 They spent the last 25 kilometres of their journey packed into shipping containers

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.400
 Dangling underneath the helicopter by a rope

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.240
 Their horns were covered in plastic hoses to stop them injuring each other and transit

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.840
 Aliens

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.440
 Eleven promising alien signals were reported this year

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.440
 Unfortunately, they all turned out to be from mobile phones on earth

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.080
 This is the green bank telescope in West Virginia

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.440
 Which listens for radio signals that might indicate signs of intelligence from 692

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.440
 Of the nearest stars to earth

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.520
 It turns out however that the signals that aliens might send are very similar to those given out by mobile phones

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.880
 This wasn't the only alien mystery that may have been sold this year

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.720
 The wow signal was named in 1977 when Anne anomaly was found in a list of data

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.240
 And astronomer Jerry R. Irman was so impressed that he circled numbers on his computer printout

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.560
 And wrote the comment "wow" Antonio Paris, an astronomy professor at St. Petersburg College in Florida

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.240
 Has now suggested that the signal didn't come from an alien life form

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.880
 But from a couple of comets that were passing by at the time

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.360
 Not everyone is convinced though

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.880
 Alan Fitzsimmons, a scientist at Queen's University Belfast, has described the theory as "rubbish"

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.160
 There were a lot of names on that paragraph James

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.600
 Antonio Paris, Alan Fitzsimmons, can I throw another name into the mix?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.280
 Sure, former frontman of Blink 182 Tom DeLong

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:17.920
 Okay

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.800
 He was named UFO researcher of the year this year

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.240
 At the 2017 International UFO Congress

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.400
 And he got this because it turns out he's secretly been emailing high-level security people in America

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.800
 To talk to them about the alien threats

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.840
 Okay, like who?

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.800
 Well, last year when the pedestrian emails were leaked

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.960
 He was the campaign manager of Hillary Clinton

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.440
 That was part of the big wiki leaks that was happening that ruined her campaign largely

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.080
 Amongst those emails were emails from Tom DeLong

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.760
 Blink 182's former lead singer

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.400
 And he was saying I want to talk to you about all the stuff that I believe is going on

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.240
 And that you have knowledge of on the inside about alien life and our contact with them

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.360
 And as a result of all his digging and all of his expertise

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.720
 He is officially the UFO researcher of the year 2017

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.280
 And the rest of us missed the big story about Hillary's email leaks it turns out

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.720
 What are the awards like? Are they a sort of golden probe that you win?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.520
 There you go, awards, okay

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.120
 Can I always always always blink 182 but you said blink 182

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.480
 I've always said blink 182

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.000
 Does anyone say blink 182?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.440
 So they humped for ET moved up a gear this year

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.040
 After the 500 meter aperture spherical telescope

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.480
 Also known as Fast

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.320
 The world's largest join the search

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.360
 Fast is so vast that you could fill its dish with enough conflicts to supply

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.520
 Every person on earth with one bowl's worth every day for a year

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.760
 And still have some left over

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.120
 It's cited in Guizhu Province, southwest China

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.440
 And it hasn't proved universally popular

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.000
 Is construction involved the forcible displacement of 9,000 villages

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.400
 Amazon

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:02.960
 The founder of Amazon.com became the world's richest person for just four hours

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.760
 A surgeon Amazon stock on the 27th of July increased Jeff Bezos' net worth by 1.1 billion dollars

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.240
 Which meant that he overtook Microsoft's Bill Gates

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.880
 His worth a measly 90.7 billion

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.800
 However, by the middle of the next day Bezos' stock had fallen back

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.000
 And a few days later he was down to third place behind

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.760
 A mancio or tega, the owner of the fashion company Zara

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.160
 Amazon stock performance was largely thanks to increased sales

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.840
 In the early days of the company, a bell would ring every time there was a sale

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.680
 And staff would gather around to see if they knew the person who had made the purchase

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.120
 They don't do that anymore

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.320
 If they did that on their biggest sales day in 2017, Amazon Prime Day, 11th of July

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.800
 A bell would need to be rung more than 80 million times

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.800
 Sorry, would you mind putting that in some kind of context again for me?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.440
 Okay, I'll just rustle up something on the spot

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.760
 That is the equivalent of every church bell in England being rung 2,400 times

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.760
 Hang on, how many church bells are there in England?

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.600
 Well, you can work that out if you divide 80 million by 2,400

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.800
 I'm not sure I can, James

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.000
 I believe that as an exercise for the reader

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.680
 Each second is very important to Amazon

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.200
 They've calculated that if their page is loaded just one second slower

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.800
 It would cost them 1.6 billion dollars in annual sales

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.840
 Amazon expanded beyond the online sector this year

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.160
 Opening a physical bookshop in New York

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.360
 The company recognizes that people have a habit of browsing in shops

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.040
 Before buying their books online

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.040
 And so registered a patent to stop customers in Amazon shops

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.840
 From checking out competitors as they look around

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.840
 It's not the only patent application that Amazon has filed in the past few months

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.640
 They've also invented an underwater warehouse

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.240
 In which everything is stored in watertight boxes at the bottom of the lake

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.920
 Each has assigned a unique sound

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.480
 Which, when triggered, inflates a balloon that floats the box to the surface

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.960
 The idea is that this will be more efficient than having people or machines fetch the packages

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.080
 Because they'll be transported by the water buoyancy instead

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.040
 Amazon also holds a patent for a flying warehouse

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.640
 Antarctica

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.720
 The foreign office warned Britain's to look out for terrorists in the Antarctic

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.560
 The population of Britain's 660,000 square miles of Antarctic territory

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.640
 Maybe only 250

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.920
 But as the foreign office points out, you can never be too careful

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.960
 According to official guidelines that issued in May

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.600
 Although there's no recent history of terrorism in the British Antarctic territory

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.440
 Attacks can't be ruled out

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.680
 Visitors should therefore be vigilant

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440
 But they will probably be fine

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.440
 The last crime to be committed anywhere on the continent was back in 2003

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.200
 And involved computer hacking

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.960
 And even that wasn't homegrown, it was done remotely from Romania

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.400
 One Britain who braved the terrorist threat was Patrick Bergel

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.720
 Great grandson of Ernest Chackelton

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.240
 Who made the first ever crossing of Antarctica by car

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.000
 It was a month long, 3600 mile trip

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.520
 Sponsored by Hyundai in a normal family car

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.800
 Although it was adapted to run on jet fuel

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.840
 I'd argue that isn't a normal family car then

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.640
 Almost normal family car, I'd say

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.320
 And to avoid littering, the team had to drag all the excrement behind them

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.760
 In a huge fuel drum

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.960
 Again, not the same as my family car

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.200
 So when he was first asked to make the journey

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.520
 Bergel hadn't even taken his driving test

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.440
 He modestly insisted that

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.680
 Compared to what my great grandfather did, this was 1,000th as hard

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.800
 I would say that's less modest and more just accurate

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.040
 I think his great grandfather would agree

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.640
 His job was harder

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.960
 So as if going on four wheels wasn't hard enough

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.520
 Canadian Hank Van Wielden attempted a 700 mile bike ride

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.400
 On a custom made 10,000 pound bicycle across Antarctica

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.800
 He was meant to complete the journey in 30 days

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.920
 But after six days of pulling a 90 kilo pack

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.560
 In minus 40 degrees Celsius temperatures

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.920
 He dropped out

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.240
 He later said, "I got a taste of it

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.120
 And I got my ass kicked by it"

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.880
 "Apps"

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.040
 If you want to make an emergency confession

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.880
 There's an app for that

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.640
 A new app developed in Spain and called Confessa Go

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.360
 tells you where your nearest priest is for confession

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.680
 And maps the best route to him

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.160
 Handley also tells you the priest's name

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.000
 And the year he was ordained

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.400
 In addition, it includes the 10 commandments

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.120
 To prompt you to recall what you might need to confess

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.280
 So if you've covered in your neighbours' orcs or anything

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.360
 Unlike Uber, the priest doesn't come to you

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.320
 But on the plus side, he doesn't charge extra at busy times

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.040
 What is a busy time for sins?

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.240
 Oh, a good question

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.280
 Christmas, I imagine

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.000
 Do you think so?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.320
 Yeah

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.000
 You're always coveting people's oxen

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.240
 I think you've got time on your hands

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.720
 Right

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.760
 Also, a priest's available 24 hours for confession

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.400
 I don't think so

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.640
 Yeah, I assumed that there was a sort of time

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.720
 That they get in that photo box

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.720
 You know, like the confession booth

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.680
 The confession booth

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.000
 They should combine that with passport photos

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.360
 So you look really happy once you've got everything off your chest

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.640
 You have a nice big smile

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.000
 So there have been other apps built recently

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.440
 For various different things

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.680
 So there have been apps built that will help you

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.280
 If you want to find a celebrity lookalike partner

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.680
 The dating app Bedou has added a feature

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.680
 That allows users to look for celebrity lookalikes

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.920
 Soon after launch, there were 1,405 people on the app

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.480
 Who supposedly look like Ed Sheeran

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.000
 According to them?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.520
 According to the app, I think

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.520
 There are other apps which can help you find

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.400
 Where the nearest iceberg is, providing you're in Canada

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.800
 And there's one app that can stop you from buying things while drunk

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.400
 So once you've consumed alcohol up to a self-imposed limit

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.640
 The app stops your bank card from working

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.640
 Unfortunately for the app to take effect

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.880
 You need to be sober enough to tell it

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.400
 That you've been drinking

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.880
 If you're talking to a machine

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.560
 You're drunk, I think

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.400
 Not if the machine can respond to you

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.160
 I mean sure if I'm talking to my washing machine

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:11.200
 And I'll step way in like if I'm talking to Siri, I think that's okay

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.600
 While we're on smartphones, Donald Trump has only downloaded one app on his phone

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.640
 It's Twitter

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.760
 But he has inspired 250 apps and more for Android alone

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.600
 Including one that measures how many times a man interrupts a woman

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.400
 One where you can draw your own executive order

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.720
 And a third one, DJ Trump

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.760
 Which uses a huge archive of words that Donald has said

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.440
 To enable you to make the US president say anything you want

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.880
 Arrests, human

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.760
 A mafia boss famous for having a permanent erection

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.720
 Was caught in Spain after seven years on the run

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.000
 Francesco Castriota said his prior pism

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.360
 Was thanks to his out of control cocaine habit

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.280
 As he sat in court during a previous hearing

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.440
 With a bag of ice on his aching groin

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.600
 One policeman remarked that he could expect a stiff sentence

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.200
 So his name is Castriota

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.840
 I know, to notice that until I read it just now

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.440
 No, we need it, it's very exciting, isn't it?

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.000
 It's like his name is begging out for his penis to be removed

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.040
 Other notable arrests include

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.960
 A man in India who was arrested for trying to create a fake ID card

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.760
 Using the name Osama bin Laden

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.640
 He even uploaded a blurred photo of the former al-Qaeda leader as the profile picture

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.440
 Police discovered the man's real name was Saddam Hussein

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.880
 A woman in Bangladesh who believed that she was her husband's third wife

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.480
 Had him arrested after discovering she was in fact his 25th

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.160
 Of 28

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.520
 Police arrested him at the home of his 27th wife

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.360
 And lastly, a man was arrested by New York state police for driving under the influence of alcohol

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.240
 This only came to international attention because Joseph Talbot didn't want anyone to know about it

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.520
 After learning that his local paper the Times of Wayne County

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.040
 Had covered the story he tried to buy every copy of the relevant edition to stop people finding out

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.800
 Unfortunately, the fact that he managed to purchase around 900 copies

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.480
 Became a story in its own right and then spread

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.000
 Art

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.200
 A giant snow globe was made using the confetti meant for Hillary Clinton's election night

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.880
 This was designed by an artist called Bunny Berson

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.000
 Whose former works include collages made from chads

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.400
 Which are the punched out pieces of ballot paper that famously decided the year 2000 presidential election in favor of George W Bush

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.000
 It took Berson two weeks to find the confetti that had been loaded into Hillary's victory cannons

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.800
 Ready to celebrate the election result last November

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.960
 And when she did she got the company who produced it to write a letter of verification

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.080
 She then placed the confetti in a glass case with the slogan "And Still I Rise"

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.680
 Which she took from a poem by Maya Angelou who was a close friend of the Clintons

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:59.280
 In a less overtly political act a French artist called Abraham Pouacheval attempted to live like a chicken

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.200
 And successfully hatched nine eggs

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.160
 He sat on the eggs in a glass case in a Paris museum for a month

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.600
 And they were underneath his bottom on a laying table which had a dug out section in it to stop the eggs from being squashed

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.440
 Pouacheval said that his work, egg, raises the question of metamorphosis and gender

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.200
 Despite animal scientists saying that the task was nearly impossible due to human's lower body temperature

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.680
 After 21 days nine of his original ten eggs had indeed hatched

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.440
 The chicks were sent to a farm

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.360
 He is an amazing guy Pouacheval

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:31.920
 Yeah

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.600
 So in February this year he spent a week in another museum inside a 12-ton limestone boulder

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.840
 It had a hollowed out section which was only slightly bigger than he was and he was sealed within it

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.320
 Wow

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.880
 Yeah, and he had little niches where he stored his food and drink and also his excrement

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:55.440
 Do you think that maybe he has been kicked out of his flat and he's just looking for museums to live in?

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.280
 He did live inside a stuffed bear for a while too

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.600
 So actually there is a lot behind that theory I think

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:08.000
 Another artist that hit the news this year was a Russian artist called Feodor Pavlov Andreyovich

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.520
 who in America face potential charges of public lewdness

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.960
 criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct after he was arrested for having himself delivered naked

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.760
 inside a clear plastic box to the exclusive Metgala in New York

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.720
 This is the fifth time he'd had himself sent to an art event

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:31.600
 His aim being to donate himself to institutions that have difficulty understanding or accepting performance art

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.880
 In a statement his friends clarified that the box had also been arrested

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.600
 In their view the charges were ludicrous

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.280
 They said even the policemen were showing signs of having fun

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.960
 Ashes

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.320
 Carrie Fisher's ashes were placed in an urn shaped like a massive prosack pill

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.680
 The giant pill was one of her favourite ornaments

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.080
 At a funeral in January her brother said of it

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.240
 We felt it was where she'd want to be

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.680
 This year people have also chosen to have their ashes sprinkled

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.000
 In the toilet of a baseball stadium

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.200
 The ashes of New York plumber and baseball fan Roy Regal

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:11.360
 have been sprinkled in baseball stadium toilets all over America by his best friend Roy McDonald

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.840
 McDonald said he has sometimes used the toilet at the same time as scattering his friend

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.800
 But that I always flush in between

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.680
 Ashes have also been sprinkled over a ferry

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:27.120
 A ceremony on an Australian ferry went wrong when the ashes were blown back on deck and over the passengers

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.280
 The daughter of the deceased said it was her mother having the last laugh

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.920
 It could be worse. In late 2016 a man tried to scatter his opera loving friends ashes at New York City's Metropolitan Opera

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.480
 Other members of the audience however assumed he was a terrorist who was trying to spread anthrax

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:50.480
 He apologized saying it was a sweet gesture to a dying friend that went completely and utterly wrong in ways that I could never have imagined

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.000
 Anyway, there've also been sprinkled in a hockey penalty box

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.800
 A hockey player Bob Probert had his ashes sprinkled in his team's penalty box

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.480
 or the sin bin because he had been involved in 200 mid-match fights in the course of his career

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.200
 and had therefore spent 3,300 minutes there

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.840
 And finally they've also been sprinkled in separate places

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.880
 A survey of Britain's funeral directors revealed that they're now agreeing ever more frequently

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.480
 to split ashes up to stop angry families arguing over them

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.960
 Article 50

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.840
 The letter that we ended up sending to activate Article 50 was six pages long

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.400
 but it was nearly a hundred pages long

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.320
 That's a big edit

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.280
 Well, they didn't start with a hundred pages and then just whittle it down to six

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.840
 The government sources said there were two options

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.080
 but they eventually picked the six-pager

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.280
 I think they may have thought that sending a hundred would have been excessive

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.760
 Yeah, and so who wrote it? Was it Theresa May?

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.480
 Well, she definitely had some civil service assistance

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.240
 but she did definitely sign it

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.280
 She gave it a wet signature i.e. with pen and ink

00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.720
 but unfortunately, she signed it with a parker pen that was once manufactured in Britain but is now made in France

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.160
 Oh really? That's weird because also Article 50 was ratified in Norman French

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.720
 So as the law passes in the House of Lords, the Lords have to say the words

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.600
 Lorraine LeVault which is Old Norman French for the Queen allows it

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.080
 Another thing about the letter is that it was delivered by Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's permanent

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.760
 representative at the EU

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:27.840
 and he took it from Britain's embassy in Brussels to the EU headquarters which is known as the space egg

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.160
 Space egg? Well, that is just a nickname

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:37.120
 It's a futuristic oval building set inside a cube made from recycled window frames from across Europe

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.960
 But the location's pretty interesting

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.200
 The back of the building was the Nazi headquarters during the occupation of Europe

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:50.240
 Ah, speaking of Nazis, I read that Article 50 was put in place partly because of right-wing politics

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.440
 The guy who wrote it did so at a time when Austria had this far-right politician called York Heider

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.440
 and people really worried that he might be elected

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.240
 So Article 50 was basically written partly to make it easier for a country to storm out of the EU

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.280
 Yeah, that's right

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.360
 And the guy who actually wrote Article 50 is called Lord John Care

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.120
 and what I love about that is that in Spain his name would be Juan Care

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.080
 But they wouldn't understand that in Spain because they all speak Spanish

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.840
 Oh yeah, apart from the British people who live in Spain and they're not going to be there for long

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.800
 because of Brexit

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.600
 So in a few years no one will get that joke anymore

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.160
 So it's not just expats, we also need to work out what to do with the word United Kingdom

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.200
 in the Lisbon Treaty

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.280
 So the Lisbon Treaty is the document that underpins the whole of the EU basically

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.760
 and there are 12 mentions of the UK in it

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.840
 and at the moment they think they're just going to leave them in

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.920
 because it's going to be too much bureaucratic hassle to actually go through removing every mention

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.640
 Is it true that Article 50 was given a lot of fake roots on its way to the space egg

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.560
 so that when Sir Tim was delivering it it would confuse potential saboteurs

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.600
 It's possible

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.200
 It did definitely have an armed guard when it was on the Euro Star on its way over

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.160
 and the Daily Telegraph reported that his path to the space egg was kept secret

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.520
 in case ultra-remainers grabbed the letter from him

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.400
 Wow, I mean I wouldn't call myself an ultra-remainer

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.240
 but I did go on Google Maps

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.240
 and I did the journey from one place to the other

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.480
 and it is extremely short

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.960
 so I don't think there's much space for alternate routes

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.960
 No, it was about 300 metres

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.200
 Yeah, all 328 yards as we're going to have to call it after 2019

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.040
 Aviation

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.600
 The King of the Netherlands revealed he's been secretly moonlighting as an airline pilot

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.320
 Since ascending the throne in 2013

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.560
 King Villem Alexander has been co-piloting commercial flights twice a month without telling passengers

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.800
 He only ever pilots short haul flights though

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.040
 and make sure to always return home on the same day

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.920
 just in case he suddenly needed his king

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.040
 Meanwhile in Afghanistan two MPs went one better

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.000
 and took control of a plane they weren't even on

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.680
 After learning the MPs had missed their flight from Kabul to Bamyan

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.480
 supporters of the pair apparently organised a team to stop the plane from landing at Bamyan airport

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.000
 by blocking the runway

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.560
 It was therefore forced to fly back to Kabul

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.800
 where it picked up the two politicians

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.680
 According to Al Jazeera, one of them Abdul Rahman Shahidani said

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.960
 "Everyone will now know who I am and what my power is"

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.840
 Shahidani added that he hadn't asked his supporters to force the plane to return to Kabul

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.760
 Another MP embroiled in an aviation scandal was Indian politician

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.360
 Ravindra Geikwad who admitted to hitting an air-stored 25 times with his slipper

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.280
 and breaking the steward's glasses

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.600
 His excuse was that he had been given an economy seat rather than business

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.560
 Air India explained that Mr Geikwad had been placed an economy rather than business

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.720
 because there was no business class on this particular all economy flight

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.960
 Avocados

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.200
 The world's first avocado restaurants where every dish contains avocado

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.800
 opened in New York

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.680
 It ran out of avocados on its first day

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.960
 Once all the kinks ran out the restaurant became very popular

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:06.640
 They went through 650 pounds of avocado a week, helped, no doubt, by the fact that diners who particularly like avocados

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.400
 can double the amount of avocado on their dish for an extra two dollars

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.400
 So avocados reached peak hips to this year

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.680
 Millennials were told the only reason they can't afford houses

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.120
 is that they keep spending their money on avocado on toast

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.880
 Avocados are dangerous too

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.320
 They were blamed for a rash of brunch time hand injuries to people

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.320
 Inetly trying to cut them up

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.800
 The British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.160
 demanded that warnings should be placed on all avocados

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.840
 I'm going to go back to the avocado restaurant

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.120
 You know where you can double the amount of avocado on your plate for an extra two dollars

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.960
 Presumably you can only do that once

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.280
 Because like with the rice on the chessboard

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.600
 If you do that eight times

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.800
 That's already more avocados than Mexico produces in the year

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.280
 So M&S are going to be lasering barcodes into their avocados because at the moment

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.920
 They obviously have those little stickers on them with the barcodes

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.760
 And by replacing those with lasers they're going to save 10 tons of paper and 5 tons of glue every year

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.320
 And they did some early trials although they laser them too deep

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.320
 And I think cut through the actual avocado

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.400
 So did they call them avocados?

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.960
 Yeah, they've also said that they're thinking about lasering pumpkins for Halloween

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.120
 But there's no pun involved so

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.280
 So they've given it up

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.680
 So demand for avocados has increased but supply has fallen this year

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.280
 And that's because avocados are an alternate burying crop

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.320
 Which means that every other year the harvest is smaller

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.080
 If you add that to the flooding in Peru and the workers strikes in Mexico

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.960
 You have what America's national public radio has dubbed the guacapocalips

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:48.000
 And with President Trump planning large tariffs on goods coming from Mexico to pay for his wall

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.800
 It may be that avocados will soon be waiting even longer to get on the housing ladder

00:35:52.800 --> 00:36:01.600
 Joe died on the 14th of February in Beijing

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.200
 January

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.720
 Was that wrong the January?

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.400
 No, what did I say?

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.200
 You read February

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.800
 I'm really tired

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.000
 You read it twice

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.800
 Sorry, I'm really tired

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.000
 No, no, that's just amazing

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.240
 Joe died on the 14th of February

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.240
 Oh God

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.320
 Joe died on the 14th of January in Beijing

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.480
 In a hospital called peaking union

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.200
 Terrible, I'm Valentine's Day as well

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:41.760
 While statisticians were advising against putting glitter in envelopes

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.040
 Doctors were nervous

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.240
 I just remembered this bit

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.440
 While statisticians were advising against putting glitter in envelopes

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.480
 Doctors were advising against putting it in vaginas

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.760
 After a product called passion dust appeared online

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.400
 It's a glitter-filled capsule designed to be inserted into the vagina

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.360
 Where it grudges

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.360
 I'm so be going this

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.880
 If you do the crime, you do the time

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.040
 I don't know if there's anything you're going to have to read out

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.720
 Oh my God

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.920
 I'm so sorry

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.960
 Oh, I think about awful things

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.360
 Right

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.280
 We all are

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.640
 Rather than fabulous things

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:29.760
 It's a glitter-filled capsule designed to be inserted into the vagina

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.480
 Where it gradually dissolves and spills its contents

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.440
 According to the website, this generates

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.080
 According to the website, this generates a sweet flavour

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.520
 Sparkly substance

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:54.320
 According to the website, this generates a sweet flavoured sparkly substance

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.760
 Called magicum that will liven up the user's sex life

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.920
 Is that a lattered word?

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.080
 I think it comes up in the earneed

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.560
 Multiple gynecologists strongly advised against using the product

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:14.160
 Saying it could lead to bacterial infections, thrush and inflammation

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.160
 Few

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.320
