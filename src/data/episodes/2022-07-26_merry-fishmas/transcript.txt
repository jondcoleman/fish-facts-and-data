 Merry fishmas. I knew you liked it. I do like it
 Hey, in which we learn how Brexit was triggered in a space egg whether computers or humans are better at Pac-Man
 Why Australia is air dropping kangaroo sausages?
 Which King doubles as an airline pilot and who's invented an underwater warehouse?
 Art Varks a zookeeper performed mouth-to-snout on an ad-vark for an hour
 Only five ad-varks were born in Europe in 2016
 So when one was born in the Polish city of rock clav this year and struggled to survive
 The head of the small mammals division at the zoo there Andrej Mioska did all he could to keep him alive
 We spoke to rock clav zoo and asked how you perform CPR on an ad-vark. This is what they said
 Mr. Mioska acted on instinct
 He cut the cord placed the baby on his fleece jacket and started rubbing it vigorously but gently with a towel
 He then placed the baby snout in his mouth and blew the air in at the same time
 He was doing chest compressions using his fingers and continue rubbing with a towel
 After a few rounds the little heart started beating but the cubs still wasn't breathing
 So Mr. Mioska went on with the mouth-to-snout ventilation altogether. It took about one hour after he came out
 I am so glad you didn't do the accent there
 I thought we're gonna start on a big Polish accent. I like the idea that to do master snout on an ad-vark
 You have to hold the end of the ad-vark snout and then basically you can get both your hands around the rest of the ad-vark snout
 For people listening and these doing the mine
 Like playing a trumpet exactly. Yeah
 This reminds me of a story actually that happened quite a few years ago in China
 There was a small monkey that had eaten a peanut and it wasn't allowed to eat the peanut because it's stomach couldn't digest it
 So someone had thrown it into the cage and it laid on its back in the cage dying and it was such a rare little monkey
 They couldn't actually operate on it
 So no one knew what to do all these zookeepers were going how are we gonna save this monkey and suddenly
 Zhang Bangshan who was the veteran zookeeper at that zoo step forward and said I know how to save this monkey
 And he went up to the monkey and he didn't perform mouth-to-snout
 Oh mouth-to-mouth even on the monkey. He performed mouth-to-bum-bum
 Could you spare us this technical mum-bug?
 He looked the monkeys butt for over an hour
 Sort of drawing the peanut through the system kind of like you know if you drop a ball in a pool
 And you have to do that little wavy thing at the corner to bring the wave to bring the ball back to you
 He lit for an hour this peanut out of the monkey and the monkey survived
 There must have been a point about 45 minutes in where the other zookeepers were saying
 Zhang Bangshan, what are you doing? I think I'd say earlier than that. I think he would have looked at them
 I'm going to give me 15 more minutes. I also think we've gone off topic really early in this morning
 So meanwhile in South Africa, scientists finally caught Abbax having a drink
 250 years after the species was first described
 It'll long been assumed that they got all the water they needed from the juicy bodies of termites
 But a zoologist at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Potilisabeth
 Graham Curley and his team announced the evidence exists for Abbax drinking from puddles
 So we've never known them to drink before. Now this is huge news
 Feels like we just haven't been watching them hard enough
 I mean surely if they're drinking from puddles now they've always been doing it
 It's not like puddles are new are they?
 Puddles have been around as long as as long as water
 This wasn't the only puddle news from the year by the way
 Researchers in Australia found that koalas are now getting their water from puddles
 They used to think it was just from eucalyptus leaves and they've never seen it before
 But they think because of climate change they're now drinking from puddles
 It's a bad year if you're a puddle
 Suddenly there are two new massive threats to your existence
 Chances are any advice for people who want to drink like Abbax?
 There is if you can't find a puddle there's a bar in Exeter that's selling an advat cocktail
 It's served with real ants
 The drinks made with rum, lemongrass and lime and it's served with an ants chaser
 The bar owner Patrick Foggerty describes it as crunchy yet satisfying
 Abdications
 The Japanese Emperor wanted to abdicate but wasn't allowed to tell anyone
 Japan's Emperor Akihito is banned from making political statements
 including any that suggests that he wants to abdicate
 As a result he had to make a speech very delicately hinting at his concerns about being able to fulfill his duties
 The government eventually worked out what he meant and allowed him to step down
 I wonder if they said to him, "So do you want to abdicate?" and he said, "I didn't say that"
 "It's pretty much, yeah, but he had to be so subtle about it so I'm feeling pretty old guys"
 And then eventually they sort of figured it out
 But there is still a problem for him which is that he has a distinct lack of airs
 Once the new Emperor takes over there will only be three airs in total
 because empress have to be men although there is now some debate about this
 Some experts are worried that if the youngest prince Hissahito has no sons
 the 2,600 year old imperial line will be broken
 Although Hissahito is only 11 so it is a little early to tell how this will
 And it's a lot of pressure on him isn't it?
 Huge amount of pressure
 That must be the smallest royal family in the world
 Is it?
 Well actually I think that the Vatican is technically a one man elected monarchy
 And that is a royal family of one, but I know you disagree James
 I do disagree, yeah
 What about Saudi Arabia? They have a lot, don't they?
 I think that's the largest royal family in the world
 They've got 4,000 princes
 Whoa
 I know
 So just back to Hissahito
 As a young man, he had a list of 800 candidates for marriage prepared for him
 Wow
 And he rejected every single one of them in favour of someone he met playing tennis
 And he's quite interesting guy
 His main interest is marine biology
 And he's an expert on the goby fish
 And when the goby equivalent of an emperor, the dominant male, dies
 He is replaced by the next in line
 But if there are no males, then a female will change its sex and take the emperor's place
 Abkhazia
 A country that most of the world doesn't think exists
 Had an election that assumed most of its population didn't exist
 Abkhazia is a self-declared republic that's trying to break from Georgia
 And is currently recognised only by Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela
 And bizarrely, the tiny Pacific island of Nauru
 Still, despite the lack of more general recognition, parliamentary elections were held there this year
 And technically, elections in Abkhazia are deemed invalid if less than 25% of people vote
 But, although only 21% of the population voted on this occasion
 The election was still declared valid as it was decided that any citizen who hold Georgian passports
 Should not be regarded as Abkhazian nationals
 The country was also the subject of a critically acclaimed Romanian documentary this year
 Called Ualeh Louis Tarzan or Tarzan's Testicles
 So this was the story of the world's oldest primate centre, the Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy
 In the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi
 The institute provided the monkeys at the Soviet Union sent into space in the 1980s
 And it was founded by a man called Ilya Ivanov
 Whose lifetime obsession was creating an ape human hybrid
 Advertising
 The advertising for the newly opened Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver
 Claims it as six floors taller than it actually is
 Trump hotels claim that the building is 69 stories high when actually it is only 63
 They arrived at their total by including below-ground stories which are mostly used for parking in their calculations
 In the course of his career, Trump has claimed that a 67-story tower has 78 floors
 That a 43-story building has 46 floors
 That a 44-story building has 52 floors
 That a 31-story building has 41 floors
 That a 70-story building has 90 floors
 And that he lives on the 66th floor of a 58-story building
 He needs to get his story straight
 Meanwhile, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Toronto paid a reported six million dollars
 Not to advertise itself as a Trump hotel
 The hotel decided to part ways with the Trump name
 Following many years of construction delays, lawsuits, and more recently
 Because it become a gathering point for protests against the president
 The agreement they reached allows the management to remove all of Trump's branding from the 65-story building
 Which, incidentally, has only 57 floors
 The world champion of the ancient Chinese game of go
 Was beaten by a three-year-old Brit who then immediately retired
 Intriguing
 What could that mean?
 Considering I said it was about AI
 One way or another, it's been a pretty bad year for humankind
 We've been defeated by artificial intelligence at No Limit Texas Hold 'Em Poker
 And the fighting game Super Smash Bros
 But perhaps the most crushing defeat came when AlphaGo and AI program developed by Google's deep-mind technologies
 Beat the world champion China's Kirji 3-0
 AlphaGo was born in 2014 and was classed as British in the Go rankings
 As the team behind it is based in London
 After beating the world champion, it immediately retired
 Deep-mind CEO, Demis Hassabis, said that winning these games had been the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program
 Owing to its incredible complexity, Go had been one of the final games at which humans could still beat the machines
 KG later said, "Lash year, it was still quite human-like, but this year it became like a god of Go"
 James, I've never played Go
 Yeah, can you quickly give me an idea of what we're talking about here?
 Yeah, sure, so you have a board with lots of squares on it
 And you put pebbles on it to win territory
 And it's extremely complicated
 There are 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 171 possible combinations of move
 Which is pretty hard to imagine, right
 Can you put that in some kind of metaphorical context for me?
 Yes, I can, I love it
 Oh, how convenient
 If every grain of sand on earth each contained the number of stars in the Milky Way
 And each of those stars had a hundred planets
 And each of those planets had 10 billion humans
 Then the number of cells in all those humans would be fewer than the number of zeros in the number that we're talking about
 Wow
 You know that famous story, there's a chess board and each has a grain of rice
 And it doubles and doubles and some of these go all the rice and country
 Do you think in this scenario you'd be like, "I've gone way too far"
 This is, this is a lot of rice
 Yeah
 But that interview with KG, actually Chinese fans didn't see the interview
 Because China, presumably for reasons of national pride, wouldn't allow the match to be shown on television or streamed online
 Air drops
 Australia is dropping sausages over its outback
 They come in two flavours, toad and kangaroo
 I will take kangaroo, please
 They're not on offer for you, I'm afraid
 So for years Australia has had this problem with cane toads which aren't indigenous to the continent
 So many of its native animals eat them
 And because the toads are toxic, they tend to kill their predators
 So to combat this, scientists are dropping cane toad flavoured sausages
 Laced with a chemical that makes predators feel sick
 Over the outback, in the hope that it'll deter them from biting the real toads in future
 A bit more brutally, the Aussie government is also dropping poisoned sausages to deal with their feral cats
 Who are also partial to a bit of kangaroo wiener
 Still fancy that kangaroo wiener Andy, now you know it's poison
 That's all actually
 This year Canada also combated an environmental issue with air drops
 This time of pregnant bison
 Bumped National Park has not had any bison for more than a hundred years
 And the ecosystem suffers from their absence
 Conservation has collected pregnant bison from the nearby elk island
 And took them to the pastures of the Rocky Mountains
 They spent the last 25 kilometres of their journey packed into shipping containers
 Dangling underneath the helicopter by a rope
 Their horns were covered in plastic hoses to stop them injuring each other and transit
 Aliens
 Eleven promising alien signals were reported this year
 Unfortunately, they all turned out to be from mobile phones on earth
 This is the green bank telescope in West Virginia
 Which listens for radio signals that might indicate signs of intelligence from 692
 Of the nearest stars to earth
 It turns out however that the signals that aliens might send are very similar to those given out by mobile phones
 This wasn't the only alien mystery that may have been sold this year
 The wow signal was named in 1977 when Anne anomaly was found in a list of data
 And astronomer Jerry R. Irman was so impressed that he circled numbers on his computer printout
 And wrote the comment "wow" Antonio Paris, an astronomy professor at St. Petersburg College in Florida
 Has now suggested that the signal didn't come from an alien life form
 But from a couple of comets that were passing by at the time
 Not everyone is convinced though
 Alan Fitzsimmons, a scientist at Queen's University Belfast, has described the theory as "rubbish"
 There were a lot of names on that paragraph James
 Antonio Paris, Alan Fitzsimmons, can I throw another name into the mix?
 Sure, former frontman of Blink 182 Tom DeLong
 Okay
 He was named UFO researcher of the year this year
 At the 2017 International UFO Congress
 And he got this because it turns out he's secretly been emailing high-level security people in America
 To talk to them about the alien threats
 Okay, like who?
 Well, last year when the pedestrian emails were leaked
 He was the campaign manager of Hillary Clinton
 That was part of the big wiki leaks that was happening that ruined her campaign largely
 Amongst those emails were emails from Tom DeLong
 Blink 182's former lead singer
 And he was saying I want to talk to you about all the stuff that I believe is going on
 And that you have knowledge of on the inside about alien life and our contact with them
 And as a result of all his digging and all of his expertise
 He is officially the UFO researcher of the year 2017
 And the rest of us missed the big story about Hillary's email leaks it turns out
 What are the awards like? Are they a sort of golden probe that you win?
 There you go, awards, okay
 Can I always always always blink 182 but you said blink 182
 I've always said blink 182
 Does anyone say blink 182?
 So they humped for ET moved up a gear this year
 After the 500 meter aperture spherical telescope
 Also known as Fast
 The world's largest join the search
 Fast is so vast that you could fill its dish with enough conflicts to supply
 Every person on earth with one bowl's worth every day for a year
 And still have some left over
 It's cited in Guizhu Province, southwest China
 And it hasn't proved universally popular
 Is construction involved the forcible displacement of 9,000 villages
 Amazon
 The founder of Amazon.com became the world's richest person for just four hours
 A surgeon Amazon stock on the 27th of July increased Jeff Bezos' net worth by 1.1 billion dollars
 Which meant that he overtook Microsoft's Bill Gates
 His worth a measly 90.7 billion
 However, by the middle of the next day Bezos' stock had fallen back
 And a few days later he was down to third place behind
 A mancio or tega, the owner of the fashion company Zara
 Amazon stock performance was largely thanks to increased sales
 In the early days of the company, a bell would ring every time there was a sale
 And staff would gather around to see if they knew the person who had made the purchase
 They don't do that anymore
 If they did that on their biggest sales day in 2017, Amazon Prime Day, 11th of July
 A bell would need to be rung more than 80 million times
 Sorry, would you mind putting that in some kind of context again for me?
 Okay, I'll just rustle up something on the spot
 That is the equivalent of every church bell in England being rung 2,400 times
 Hang on, how many church bells are there in England?
 Well, you can work that out if you divide 80 million by 2,400
 I'm not sure I can, James
 I believe that as an exercise for the reader
 Each second is very important to Amazon
 They've calculated that if their page is loaded just one second slower
 It would cost them 1.6 billion dollars in annual sales
 Amazon expanded beyond the online sector this year
 Opening a physical bookshop in New York
 The company recognizes that people have a habit of browsing in shops
 Before buying their books online
 And so registered a patent to stop customers in Amazon shops
 From checking out competitors as they look around
 It's not the only patent application that Amazon has filed in the past few months
 They've also invented an underwater warehouse
 In which everything is stored in watertight boxes at the bottom of the lake
 Each has assigned a unique sound
 Which, when triggered, inflates a balloon that floats the box to the surface
 The idea is that this will be more efficient than having people or machines fetch the packages
 Because they'll be transported by the water buoyancy instead
 Amazon also holds a patent for a flying warehouse
 Antarctica
 The foreign office warned Britain's to look out for terrorists in the Antarctic
 The population of Britain's 660,000 square miles of Antarctic territory
 Maybe only 250
 But as the foreign office points out, you can never be too careful
 According to official guidelines that issued in May
 Although there's no recent history of terrorism in the British Antarctic territory
 Attacks can't be ruled out
 Visitors should therefore be vigilant
 But they will probably be fine
 The last crime to be committed anywhere on the continent was back in 2003
 And involved computer hacking
 And even that wasn't homegrown, it was done remotely from Romania
 One Britain who braved the terrorist threat was Patrick Bergel
 Great grandson of Ernest Chackelton
 Who made the first ever crossing of Antarctica by car
 It was a month long, 3600 mile trip
 Sponsored by Hyundai in a normal family car
 Although it was adapted to run on jet fuel
 I'd argue that isn't a normal family car then
 Almost normal family car, I'd say
 And to avoid littering, the team had to drag all the excrement behind them
 In a huge fuel drum
 Again, not the same as my family car
 So when he was first asked to make the journey
 Bergel hadn't even taken his driving test
 He modestly insisted that
 Compared to what my great grandfather did, this was 1,000th as hard
 I would say that's less modest and more just accurate
 I think his great grandfather would agree
 His job was harder
 So as if going on four wheels wasn't hard enough
 Canadian Hank Van Wielden attempted a 700 mile bike ride
 On a custom made 10,000 pound bicycle across Antarctica
 He was meant to complete the journey in 30 days
 But after six days of pulling a 90 kilo pack
 In minus 40 degrees Celsius temperatures
 He dropped out
 He later said, "I got a taste of it
 And I got my ass kicked by it"
 "Apps"
 If you want to make an emergency confession
 There's an app for that
 A new app developed in Spain and called Confessa Go
 tells you where your nearest priest is for confession
 And maps the best route to him
 Handley also tells you the priest's name
 And the year he was ordained
 In addition, it includes the 10 commandments
 To prompt you to recall what you might need to confess
 So if you've covered in your neighbours' orcs or anything
 Unlike Uber, the priest doesn't come to you
 But on the plus side, he doesn't charge extra at busy times
 What is a busy time for sins?
 Oh, a good question
 Christmas, I imagine
 Do you think so?
 Yeah
 You're always coveting people's oxen
 I think you've got time on your hands
 Right
 Also, a priest's available 24 hours for confession
 I don't think so
 Yeah, I assumed that there was a sort of time
 That they get in that photo box
 You know, like the confession booth
 The confession booth
 They should combine that with passport photos
 So you look really happy once you've got everything off your chest
 You have a nice big smile
 So there have been other apps built recently
 For various different things
 So there have been apps built that will help you
 If you want to find a celebrity lookalike partner
 The dating app Bedou has added a feature
 That allows users to look for celebrity lookalikes
 Soon after launch, there were 1,405 people on the app
 Who supposedly look like Ed Sheeran
 According to them?
 According to the app, I think
 There are other apps which can help you find
 Where the nearest iceberg is, providing you're in Canada
 And there's one app that can stop you from buying things while drunk
 So once you've consumed alcohol up to a self-imposed limit
 The app stops your bank card from working
 Unfortunately for the app to take effect
 You need to be sober enough to tell it
 That you've been drinking
 If you're talking to a machine
 You're drunk, I think
 Not if the machine can respond to you
 I mean sure if I'm talking to my washing machine
 And I'll step way in like if I'm talking to Siri, I think that's okay
 While we're on smartphones, Donald Trump has only downloaded one app on his phone
 It's Twitter
 But he has inspired 250 apps and more for Android alone
 Including one that measures how many times a man interrupts a woman
 One where you can draw your own executive order
 And a third one, DJ Trump
 Which uses a huge archive of words that Donald has said
 To enable you to make the US president say anything you want
 Arrests, human
 A mafia boss famous for having a permanent erection
 Was caught in Spain after seven years on the run
 Francesco Castriota said his prior pism
 Was thanks to his out of control cocaine habit
 As he sat in court during a previous hearing
 With a bag of ice on his aching groin
 One policeman remarked that he could expect a stiff sentence
 So his name is Castriota
 I know, to notice that until I read it just now
 No, we need it, it's very exciting, isn't it?
 It's like his name is begging out for his penis to be removed
 Other notable arrests include
 A man in India who was arrested for trying to create a fake ID card
 Using the name Osama bin Laden
 He even uploaded a blurred photo of the former al-Qaeda leader as the profile picture
 Police discovered the man's real name was Saddam Hussein
 A woman in Bangladesh who believed that she was her husband's third wife
 Had him arrested after discovering she was in fact his 25th
 Of 28
 Police arrested him at the home of his 27th wife
 And lastly, a man was arrested by New York state police for driving under the influence of alcohol
 This only came to international attention because Joseph Talbot didn't want anyone to know about it
 After learning that his local paper the Times of Wayne County
 Had covered the story he tried to buy every copy of the relevant edition to stop people finding out
 Unfortunately, the fact that he managed to purchase around 900 copies
 Became a story in its own right and then spread
 Art
 A giant snow globe was made using the confetti meant for Hillary Clinton's election night
 This was designed by an artist called Bunny Berson
 Whose former works include collages made from chads
 Which are the punched out pieces of ballot paper that famously decided the year 2000 presidential election in favor of George W Bush
 It took Berson two weeks to find the confetti that had been loaded into Hillary's victory cannons
 Ready to celebrate the election result last November
 And when she did she got the company who produced it to write a letter of verification
 She then placed the confetti in a glass case with the slogan "And Still I Rise"
 Which she took from a poem by Maya Angelou who was a close friend of the Clintons
 In a less overtly political act a French artist called Abraham Pouacheval attempted to live like a chicken
 And successfully hatched nine eggs
 He sat on the eggs in a glass case in a Paris museum for a month
 And they were underneath his bottom on a laying table which had a dug out section in it to stop the eggs from being squashed
 Pouacheval said that his work, egg, raises the question of metamorphosis and gender
 Despite animal scientists saying that the task was nearly impossible due to human's lower body temperature
 After 21 days nine of his original ten eggs had indeed hatched
 The chicks were sent to a farm
 He is an amazing guy Pouacheval
 Yeah
 So in February this year he spent a week in another museum inside a 12-ton limestone boulder
 It had a hollowed out section which was only slightly bigger than he was and he was sealed within it
 Wow
 Yeah, and he had little niches where he stored his food and drink and also his excrement
 Do you think that maybe he has been kicked out of his flat and he's just looking for museums to live in?
 He did live inside a stuffed bear for a while too
 So actually there is a lot behind that theory I think
 Another artist that hit the news this year was a Russian artist called Feodor Pavlov Andreyovich
 who in America face potential charges of public lewdness
 criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct after he was arrested for having himself delivered naked
 inside a clear plastic box to the exclusive Metgala in New York
 This is the fifth time he'd had himself sent to an art event
 His aim being to donate himself to institutions that have difficulty understanding or accepting performance art
 In a statement his friends clarified that the box had also been arrested
 In their view the charges were ludicrous
 They said even the policemen were showing signs of having fun
 Ashes
 Carrie Fisher's ashes were placed in an urn shaped like a massive prosack pill
 The giant pill was one of her favourite ornaments
 At a funeral in January her brother said of it
 We felt it was where she'd want to be
 This year people have also chosen to have their ashes sprinkled
 In the toilet of a baseball stadium
 The ashes of New York plumber and baseball fan Roy Regal
 have been sprinkled in baseball stadium toilets all over America by his best friend Roy McDonald
 McDonald said he has sometimes used the toilet at the same time as scattering his friend
 But that I always flush in between
 Ashes have also been sprinkled over a ferry
 A ceremony on an Australian ferry went wrong when the ashes were blown back on deck and over the passengers
 The daughter of the deceased said it was her mother having the last laugh
 It could be worse. In late 2016 a man tried to scatter his opera loving friends ashes at New York City's Metropolitan Opera
 Other members of the audience however assumed he was a terrorist who was trying to spread anthrax
 He apologized saying it was a sweet gesture to a dying friend that went completely and utterly wrong in ways that I could never have imagined
 Anyway, there've also been sprinkled in a hockey penalty box
 A hockey player Bob Probert had his ashes sprinkled in his team's penalty box
 or the sin bin because he had been involved in 200 mid-match fights in the course of his career
 and had therefore spent 3,300 minutes there
 And finally they've also been sprinkled in separate places
 A survey of Britain's funeral directors revealed that they're now agreeing ever more frequently
 to split ashes up to stop angry families arguing over them
 Article 50
 The letter that we ended up sending to activate Article 50 was six pages long
 but it was nearly a hundred pages long
 That's a big edit
 Well, they didn't start with a hundred pages and then just whittle it down to six
 The government sources said there were two options
 but they eventually picked the six-pager
 I think they may have thought that sending a hundred would have been excessive
 Yeah, and so who wrote it? Was it Theresa May?
 Well, she definitely had some civil service assistance
 but she did definitely sign it
 She gave it a wet signature i.e. with pen and ink
 but unfortunately, she signed it with a parker pen that was once manufactured in Britain but is now made in France
 Oh really? That's weird because also Article 50 was ratified in Norman French
 So as the law passes in the House of Lords, the Lords have to say the words
 Lorraine LeVault which is Old Norman French for the Queen allows it
 Another thing about the letter is that it was delivered by Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's permanent
 representative at the EU
 and he took it from Britain's embassy in Brussels to the EU headquarters which is known as the space egg
 Space egg? Well, that is just a nickname
 It's a futuristic oval building set inside a cube made from recycled window frames from across Europe
 But the location's pretty interesting
 The back of the building was the Nazi headquarters during the occupation of Europe
 Ah, speaking of Nazis, I read that Article 50 was put in place partly because of right-wing politics
 The guy who wrote it did so at a time when Austria had this far-right politician called York Heider
 and people really worried that he might be elected
 So Article 50 was basically written partly to make it easier for a country to storm out of the EU
 Yeah, that's right
 And the guy who actually wrote Article 50 is called Lord John Care
 and what I love about that is that in Spain his name would be Juan Care
 But they wouldn't understand that in Spain because they all speak Spanish
 Oh yeah, apart from the British people who live in Spain and they're not going to be there for long
 because of Brexit
 So in a few years no one will get that joke anymore
 So it's not just expats, we also need to work out what to do with the word United Kingdom
 in the Lisbon Treaty
 So the Lisbon Treaty is the document that underpins the whole of the EU basically
 and there are 12 mentions of the UK in it
 and at the moment they think they're just going to leave them in
 because it's going to be too much bureaucratic hassle to actually go through removing every mention
 Is it true that Article 50 was given a lot of fake roots on its way to the space egg
 so that when Sir Tim was delivering it it would confuse potential saboteurs
 It's possible
 It did definitely have an armed guard when it was on the Euro Star on its way over
 and the Daily Telegraph reported that his path to the space egg was kept secret
 in case ultra-remainers grabbed the letter from him
 Wow, I mean I wouldn't call myself an ultra-remainer
 but I did go on Google Maps
 and I did the journey from one place to the other
 and it is extremely short
 so I don't think there's much space for alternate routes
 No, it was about 300 metres
 Yeah, all 328 yards as we're going to have to call it after 2019
 Aviation
 The King of the Netherlands revealed he's been secretly moonlighting as an airline pilot
 Since ascending the throne in 2013
 King Villem Alexander has been co-piloting commercial flights twice a month without telling passengers
 He only ever pilots short haul flights though
 and make sure to always return home on the same day
 just in case he suddenly needed his king
 Meanwhile in Afghanistan two MPs went one better
 and took control of a plane they weren't even on
 After learning the MPs had missed their flight from Kabul to Bamyan
 supporters of the pair apparently organised a team to stop the plane from landing at Bamyan airport
 by blocking the runway
 It was therefore forced to fly back to Kabul
 where it picked up the two politicians
 According to Al Jazeera, one of them Abdul Rahman Shahidani said
 "Everyone will now know who I am and what my power is"
 Shahidani added that he hadn't asked his supporters to force the plane to return to Kabul
 Another MP embroiled in an aviation scandal was Indian politician
 Ravindra Geikwad who admitted to hitting an air-stored 25 times with his slipper
 and breaking the steward's glasses
 His excuse was that he had been given an economy seat rather than business
 Air India explained that Mr Geikwad had been placed an economy rather than business
 because there was no business class on this particular all economy flight
 Avocados
 The world's first avocado restaurants where every dish contains avocado
 opened in New York
 It ran out of avocados on its first day
 Once all the kinks ran out the restaurant became very popular
 They went through 650 pounds of avocado a week, helped, no doubt, by the fact that diners who particularly like avocados
 can double the amount of avocado on their dish for an extra two dollars
 So avocados reached peak hips to this year
 Millennials were told the only reason they can't afford houses
 is that they keep spending their money on avocado on toast
 Avocados are dangerous too
 They were blamed for a rash of brunch time hand injuries to people
 Inetly trying to cut them up
 The British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons
 demanded that warnings should be placed on all avocados
 I'm going to go back to the avocado restaurant
 You know where you can double the amount of avocado on your plate for an extra two dollars
 Presumably you can only do that once
 Because like with the rice on the chessboard
 If you do that eight times
 That's already more avocados than Mexico produces in the year
 So M&S are going to be lasering barcodes into their avocados because at the moment
 They obviously have those little stickers on them with the barcodes
 And by replacing those with lasers they're going to save 10 tons of paper and 5 tons of glue every year
 And they did some early trials although they laser them too deep
 And I think cut through the actual avocado
 So did they call them avocados?
 Yeah, they've also said that they're thinking about lasering pumpkins for Halloween
 But there's no pun involved so
 So they've given it up
 So demand for avocados has increased but supply has fallen this year
 And that's because avocados are an alternate burying crop
 Which means that every other year the harvest is smaller
 If you add that to the flooding in Peru and the workers strikes in Mexico
 You have what America's national public radio has dubbed the guacapocalips
 And with President Trump planning large tariffs on goods coming from Mexico to pay for his wall
 It may be that avocados will soon be waiting even longer to get on the housing ladder

 Where it gradually dissolves and spills its contents
