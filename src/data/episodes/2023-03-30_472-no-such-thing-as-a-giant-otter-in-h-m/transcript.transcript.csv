00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. I'm quickly here"
00:00:05,00:00:10,to introduce you to our special guest this week and that is Athena Cablenu. Now you'll
00:00:10,00:00:15,"remember Athena, she's been on the fish a couple of times but one interesting new thing"
00:00:15,00:00:21,to say about her is she has a new podcast. Her podcast is called Why Does My Child Hate
00:00:21,00:00:26,Me? It's absolutely amazing. I think she got the name from reading my mind at 6.30 this
00:00:26,00:00:30,morning but it's a brilliant podcast. It's all about how we as parents are absolutely
00:00:30,00:00:35,amazing and it is the children who are wrong. It's so good and you should definitely check
00:00:35,00:00:39,that out. If you want to hear any more from Athena you can get her on social media on
00:00:39,00:00:45,Twitter and Instagram. Both of those places she can be found at Athena Cablenu and just
00:00:45,00:00:52,so you know how to spell her surname it's K-U-G-B-L-E-N-U. Not much more to say except we do have
00:00:52,00:00:56,a live show coming up. It's at the British Library. That's sold out but you can get
00:00:56,00:01:00,streaming tickets so if you want to know more about that go to No Such Thing As A Fish dot
00:01:00,00:01:04,"com and that's also the place to go if you want to learn about Club Fish, a place where"
00:01:04,00:01:09,"you get ad free episodes, loads of extra bonus stuff and also you get to hear about the live"
00:01:09,00:01:15,shows first. For instance the British Library show almost sold out from just the people
00:01:15,00:01:19,who listen to Club Fish. There was only a few tickets left for those who heard about
00:01:19,00:01:23,it on the Friday so it's definitely a good place to go if you want to hear all of our
00:01:23,00:01:27,news first. Anyway I really hope you enjoy this week's show. I hope all is good with
00:01:27,00:01:48,you. Enjoy our facts with Athena and on with the podcast.
00:01:48,00:01:53,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:53,00:01:58,"to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here"
00:01:58,00:02:04,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Athena Cablanu and once again we have gathered"
00:02:04,00:02:08,around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:02:08,00:02:14,order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Athena.
00:02:14,00:02:23,My fact this week is 15 million clothing items are dumped in Ghana every week. Like someone's
00:02:23,00:02:28,come to your house with a cheap bottle of wine they're re-gifting. Here you go and you've
00:02:28,00:02:31,got to re-gift it and then they re-gift it and there's a bottle of wine floating around
00:02:31,00:02:36,the world being re-gifted over and over again because it's vinegary two pound rubbish and
00:02:36,00:02:39,it's clothing. It's a good analogy and it's a good job
00:02:39,00:02:43,"that Anna isn't here because that's the kind of wine she loves. She'd be like ""I would"
00:02:43,00:02:49,"drink that wine"" but yeah it's absolutely huge, it's a huge amount and they have huge"
00:02:49,00:02:52,sort of piles of it next to it. There's one river in Akra.
00:02:52,00:02:54,So it's like literally mountains of clothing.
00:02:54,00:02:59,"Yeah, yeah, yeah and we've got a massive market where it's traded, most of it's traded, most"
00:02:59,00:03:05,of it's given away but we don't want it. Just to be clear this is unwanted. We want a little
00:03:05,00:03:12,"bit of it. Yeah, second hand stuff is great but it's stuff that we've inevitably bought"
00:03:12,00:03:16,"from fast fashion suppliers for very low amounts of money. We've worn it once, we've thrown"
00:03:16,00:03:21,"it away. We've gone into our wardrobes and we've gone ""I don't want all these clothes."
00:03:21,00:03:24,"It's wasteful in my wardrobe. Let me take you to a charity shop."" Guess what? A charity"
00:03:24,00:03:27,shop doesn't even want all your clothes and then it ends up in a charity shop into the
00:03:27,00:03:31,back of a shipping container and it gets shipped off to a country and one of those countries
00:03:31,00:03:32,is Ghana.
00:03:32,00:03:37,"Wow, up until you mentioning this fact, fast fashion, I'd actually not heard that term"
00:03:37,00:03:44,"before and looking into it, wow, what a mad thing we're all involved in if you buy from"
00:03:44,00:03:48,high street shops. Back in the day you used to maybe buy four shirts and that would last
00:03:48,00:03:53,you for months on end but now it's almost like six shirts a week for some people if
00:03:53,00:03:58,they go out and want for younger kids supposedly from surveys. A lot of kids want to be seen
00:03:58,00:04:01,"in different shirts on their Instagram, they don't want to be seen in the same thing. So"
00:04:01,00:04:06,socially you are doing a turnaround of shirts that you might only wear once and then chuck
00:04:06,00:04:10,away or give back to the shops who then don't resell them.
00:04:10,00:04:14,"The stuff that goes to Ghana, I think like you say, they kind of resell it and reuse"
00:04:14,00:04:19,it and stuff but 40% of it is such low quality that it just goes straight into landfill and
00:04:19,00:04:23,you can't really truck it out of Ghana at that stage so it gets dubbed in Ghana.
00:04:23,00:04:26,"Yeah, and don't forget there's not a huge amount of infrastructure in terms of like"
00:04:26,00:04:32,"wasting recycling. It's not like they can separate it into polyesters, cottons, repurpose it."
00:04:32,00:04:36,"If you want to take rubbish anywhere, I swear to God, Ghana is the last place you want to"
00:04:36,00:04:40,take it and put it to be used in a useful way. Just on your point about how much we
00:04:40,00:04:50,"buy in the UK, we buy two tons of clothing every minute. Every minute, I can't be right."
00:04:50,00:04:51,I got it off the Oxfam website.
00:04:51,00:04:57,"Wow, I found that we throw away 75 pounds of clothes every year per person."
00:04:57,00:05:01,That's way. That's about the weight of a male giant otter.
00:05:01,00:05:03,That does bring it home.
00:05:03,00:05:04,How big are otters that big?
00:05:04,00:05:05,They're huge. They're big.
00:05:05,00:05:06,They're giant otters.
00:05:06,00:05:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:07,00:05:11,There's the logo for the campaign against wasteful clothing.
00:05:11,00:05:15,It may not seem a lot but obviously there's 60 odd million people in the UK. Imagine 60
00:05:15,00:05:17,odd million giant otters.
00:05:17,00:05:21,"Again, James, I do think you've picked one of the worst and least known animals."
00:05:21,00:05:27,"If people's reactions to that factor are they're giant otters, that is a problem with the campaign."
00:05:27,00:05:28,"Yeah, you're right."
00:05:28,00:05:31,"Because then you're immediately talking about the otter, you're not talking about the clothes."
00:05:31,00:05:38,"And also, do we need to be worried about them because they sound kind of aggressive."
00:05:38,00:05:41,"Yeah. Well, you need to worry about yourself if you're in a room with one. They're six"
00:05:41,00:05:45,"feet long and if you're in a room with one, it's not in its natural habitat which is the"
00:05:45,00:05:48,"Amazon base. They're Brazilian, aren't they?"
00:05:48,00:05:49,Giant otter.
00:05:49,00:05:53,"Yeah, it's happened. It's happened. We forgot about clothing. We're in the world of otter."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"It's because the world of fast fashion is so, once you look at the stats, it's so upsetting"
00:05:56,00:06:01,"that if James comes along with his brilliant campaign and posts it, you immediately want"
00:06:01,00:06:02,to think about the otter because...
00:06:02,00:06:05,"I think maybe we can get you a costume, Andy."
00:06:05,00:06:06,An otter costume?
00:06:06,00:06:10,An otter costume and send you into H&M and fuck things up.
00:06:10,00:06:14,I love that. Be like Christ turning over the tables in the temple.
00:06:14,00:06:15,"Yeah, was he an otter costume?"
00:06:15,00:06:19,"He never mentioned... Well, three of the scriptures don't mention it, but John is always a bit"
00:06:19,00:06:21,more out there. He says Christ was at the Law of the Trust.
00:06:21,00:06:24,That could be the new saying instead of a bull in a china shop. It's an otter in a Zara
00:06:24,00:06:26,high street shop.
00:06:26,00:06:32,"No, but you're right. The numbers are kind of heinous. I didn't realize how it had happened"
00:06:32,00:06:38,in the first place as in the way that lots of big high street brands moved from having
00:06:38,00:06:42,a few collections of clothes a year to now having new collections maybe every couple
00:06:42,00:06:47,"of weeks. And there's a firm called Shine who, I think if you know about fashion, you"
00:06:47,00:06:52,"will know about them, but if you don't, you won't. They're an enormous Chinese firm who"
00:06:52,00:06:57,"stock almost all their clothes, 94% of their clothes are stocked for 90 days or less. So"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"they basically turn out thousands and thousands and thousands of designs, but they only make"
00:07:01,00:07:08,"about 50 or 100 of each one. But in the first four months of last year, they added 315,000"
00:07:08,00:07:10,different styles to their website.
00:07:10,00:07:15,"It's a clever idea in a way. I mean, it's terrible for the world, but the idea is that"
00:07:15,00:07:21,"one, you don't have lots of waste. They don't have lots of waste in their company because"
00:07:21,00:07:25,"because you're only making 50 of them, you're probably going to sell all 50, but also you're"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"creating fake scarcity, which means that people, if you see someone wearing it on TV, you're"
00:07:30,00:07:34,"like, well, there might be only 50 of my local shops, so I'm going to have to get there fast"
00:07:34,00:07:35,and get one.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"At which point they'll make another 200,000. Yeah, but 300,000 different pieces of clothing"
00:07:39,00:07:41,in different designs in four months.
00:07:41,00:07:46,"That's crazy. And this is all the fault of one man, one still alive, possibly very litigious"
00:07:46,00:07:47,man.
00:07:47,00:07:48,Is it?
00:07:48,00:07:51,"Well, he might be, I'm about to slag him off."
00:07:51,00:07:52,Let's name some names.
00:07:52,00:07:59,"His name is Emancio Ortega and he is the founder of Zara, the high street shops that are global."
00:07:59,00:08:04,"When he invented Zara, the idea was he wanted fashion to be able to mimic fashion that was"
00:08:04,00:08:08,being seen in the catwalks at a much quicker rate. There used to be such a long period before
00:08:08,00:08:12,"anything even resembling what was seen on the catwalks would appear in shops. And he thought,"
00:08:12,00:08:17,what if we just quickly make them the turnaround? We have no name designers. They're all anonymous.
00:08:17,00:08:21,They work for us in the back rooms and let's get it out within a five week period. That
00:08:21,00:08:22,will make us big.
00:08:22,00:08:27,And then let's just make a few of them. We just constantly create demand for new items
00:08:27,00:08:32,and this caught on around the world. So it's this one guy who at one point became the richest
00:08:32,00:08:37,"man in the world, took over Bill Gates for like a brief second. So he's, he went from"
00:08:37,00:08:41,poverty to richest man in the world of this idea of fast fashion.
00:08:41,00:08:47,"One guy and one woman as well, Rosalia Mira, who's his wife, who did a lot of the work"
00:08:47,00:08:52,"as well. And because they kind of got together, didn't they? She was working in a clove shop."
00:08:52,00:08:57,"He was a messenger boy and they kind of go, ""Can I make it any more obvious?"""
00:08:57,00:09:03,"But yeah, Ortega, he's a really interesting guy, I think, because some of it sounds quite"
00:09:03,00:09:08,"sweet. Like he grew up, he was the son of a railway worker who would move around the"
00:09:08,00:09:13,whole of Spain working wherever there were jobs. He was really poor as a child. He had
00:09:13,00:09:18,only potatoes for some of his meals. And he's very reclusive. He doesn't have a computer.
00:09:18,00:09:24,He does all of his work like in small groups and just kind of tells people what to do and
00:09:24,00:09:27,"really doesn't write much down and stuff. But then on the other hand, he's a billionaire."
00:09:27,00:09:35,"Well, we made a great new enemy on this show. You're welcome, guys. So it was in this tiny"
00:09:35,00:09:40,"town and he wanted to call the company Zorba initially, but there was a restaurant that"
00:09:40,00:09:44,"was selling beers and so on down the road. Greek food, I imagine. It's more of a Greek"
00:09:44,00:09:49,"than a Spanish name, isn't it? Well, Zorba the Greek. Zorba the Greek. But that's what"
00:09:49,00:09:52,they were naming it after. But there happened to be two places that wanted to do it in the
00:09:52,00:09:58,"very same street. And so the restaurant said, ""Can you not do that, please?"" And so he went"
00:09:58,00:10:03,"fine, but they had the molds for Zorba. And so they quickly just rearranged it into Zara."
00:10:03,00:10:08,So I guess they used the A twice out of Zorba. I guess that's how that works. And through
00:10:08,00:10:14,"away the B. Well, they like waste, so it doesn't matter. Start as you mean to go on, guys. Stick"
00:10:14,00:10:19,"it in a bin. He's very reclusive. He's been photographed, I think, once by the company."
00:10:19,00:10:24,"The company released one photo of him once in about the year 2000. He is really very,"
00:10:24,00:10:30,"very, very private, but he appears to wear only the same items of clothing every day."
00:10:30,00:10:36,"He wears a pair of trousers, a shirt and a jacket. None of which is sold by Zara. No,"
00:10:36,00:10:41,"exactly. And it's kind of like that thing, you know how all the tech squillionaires, all"
00:10:41,00:10:44,their children are growing up playing with simple wooden blocks. And they've never seen
00:10:44,00:10:48,"a computer and they all go to schools where they don't do any tech stuff. But that also,"
00:10:48,00:10:52,"it makes me also think of, do you remember Daniel Radcliffe used to do that after it?"
00:10:52,00:10:56,"So when he came out on the West End at the stage door every night, he used to wear the"
00:10:56,00:11:01,exact same clothes so that the paparazzi couldn't sell a new photo because that photo could
00:11:01,00:11:05,have been taken any night of the run. So that was his strategy.
00:11:05,00:11:08,Is that also why he doesn't seem to have aged over the last 30 years?
00:11:08,00:11:14,"He's decided to freeze himself. Yeah, that's why you don't see many photos. Yeah. Okay,"
00:11:14,00:11:17,I'm just floating his theory. Okay. Because obviously a little of fast fashion is driven
00:11:17,00:11:20,by high fashion and by red carpets and things like that. So if you're only allowed to wear
00:11:20,00:11:24,"one item of clothing on the red carpet for the rest of your life, that would presumably"
00:11:24,00:11:29,go a long way to what bit of the waiter. Are we going to make people whatever the last
00:11:29,00:11:33,"thing they were like Sam Smith, they're going to have to wear that kind of rubber thing."
00:11:33,00:11:38,"Yeah, yes. A certain date you just freeze and that's your clothes now. Yeah, like a random"
00:11:38,00:11:42,bell to just go off on your phone or something. Like today's your time and whatever you're
00:11:42,00:11:48,wearing that it's just you know how you they gave us alerts when it was COVID we'd get
00:11:48,00:11:51,"like these text message alerts and it says it should be a clothing alert. Right, this"
00:11:51,00:11:56,is you now. This is your look. And it would incentivize people to always look their best
00:11:56,00:12:00,"because you might get frozen at any time. Yeah, yeah. I'm right now to have worn this"
00:12:00,00:12:06,hoodie with my own podcast. But I do think we need to make it slightly less socially
00:12:06,00:12:11,acceptable to just wait. I just have a friend who wardrobe was just full of clothes with
00:12:11,00:12:18,"tags on. She was just a shoplifter. Actually, there's security tags. Does she have it on"
00:12:18,00:12:26,her ankle as well? She couldn't leave the house office. It's just socially acceptable
00:12:26,00:12:33,to just buy stuff. My ex used to work in a clothes shop and the number of times people
00:12:33,00:12:36,"would come back with an outfit saying yeah, I haven't worn it because it didn't fit and"
00:12:36,00:12:42,"it would be covered in red wine and vomit. Like no, no, we haven't worn it. Honestly,"
00:12:42,00:12:49,"we haven't worn it. Yeah, I know it's shameless watching the lies of a hungover person. A"
00:12:49,00:12:53,lot of this just go back to a lot of this waste is returned items too. So even if you
00:12:53,00:12:58,"return items pristine, they often can't be resold because the minute you open the packaging,"
00:12:58,00:13:02,well it's not something they can really sell again. So we and our brains they go I'll try
00:13:02,00:13:06,it on. I'll send it back and it'll be okay. It's not okay. Most of that does get dumped
00:13:06,00:13:10,"as well. Yes, exactly. And that's the big problem that no one realizes. So it's exactly"
00:13:10,00:13:14,that it is literally online ordering. You tried on and that's the wrong sides. That
00:13:14,00:13:19,"is now going into waste. Yeah, they won't reuse that. It's remarkable as well. I was"
00:13:19,00:13:25,reading about how Zara defines how they can make the fast fashion because it's not just
00:13:25,00:13:30,"looking at the bigger world of fashion, high end fashion like catwalks and so on. Basically"
00:13:30,00:13:35,"the staff and this is from an article that was about 2012. So I'm talking for, you know,"
00:13:35,00:13:39,this could have changed since then but the way they do it is staff have to monitor by
00:13:39,00:13:43,listening carefully to what people are making little comments about. I hate having those
00:13:43,00:13:47,zips on the ankles. I wish they would put them up here and if they would collate this
00:13:47,00:13:50,"stuff and all report back. Did you hear anyone else say that? Yeah, I heard them say that."
00:13:50,00:13:54,They report that back to head office and then they just start designing clothes according
00:13:54,00:13:59,to literally customer feedback within the shop because they come up with so many different
00:13:59,00:14:03,"designs and then what they do at the big Zara warehouse which is like an air hanger, a New"
00:14:03,00:14:07,York Times journalist went to visit it. You would see people talking to the Zara's of
00:14:07,00:14:11,"the world going, ""Red pants? Are they wearing red pants? Okay, we're getting reports of"
00:14:11,00:14:15,"red pants here. Great, we're in red pant business now and they would make pants being trousers,"
00:14:15,00:14:20,"sorry."" Is that for English men over a certain age in the countryside? Going to the Henley"
00:14:20,00:14:25,"Regatta. 14-year-old girls in China, a 60-year-old men at Henley. Zara have really been cracking"
00:14:25,00:14:31,"the regatta market and it's... So if I go into a Zara and be like, ""God, I'd love a panda"
00:14:31,00:14:36,"costume."" Yeah? Yeah. And if we all did it. If we all did it. Sorry, we're getting a giant"
00:14:36,00:14:50,"river otter costume. Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that"
00:14:50,00:14:55,Ford has just got a patent for a car which can repossess itself if the owner falls behind
00:14:55,00:15:05,"with payments. This is quite a dystopian episode, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:15:05,00:15:11,This is just a patent at the moment. Yeah. It may never be billed but it has been granted
00:15:11,00:15:14,as they applied for it a couple of years ago and it's just been granted this year. So here's
00:15:14,00:15:19,"the plan, right? You've got your Ford. Yeah. You think it's safe. You've got it on a payment"
00:15:19,00:15:22,agreement. Payment agreement. You're doing okay but then you miss a couple of payments.
00:15:22,00:15:27,"A couple of payments, something happens and they write to you and you don't acknowledge"
00:15:27,00:15:31,"it. Maybe you missed the message, whatever, right? But anyway, things steadily get worse"
00:15:31,00:15:34,"for you and your car from this point onwards. Firstly, they just make the car a bit less"
00:15:34,00:15:39,"pleasant to drive. In that, you know, they might disable the music or the air conditioning"
00:15:39,00:15:44,"or the GPS. Some of these things sound a little bit dangerous. At this stage, you might just"
00:15:44,00:15:49,"think it's a glitch, right? Yeah. You're doing a regular thing. It's not especially"
00:15:49,00:15:55,hot. So you don't like music. So fine. So you're all right. But then it'll make an unpleasant
00:15:55,00:15:58,"beeping sound whenever you get into the car. Okay, well, that's a bit annoying. It sounds"
00:15:58,00:16:04,"like the music I might have been listening to anyway. Yeah, your EDM collection is fine."
00:16:04,00:16:10,So great. Then it stops you using it at certain days or times as in the car won't even function
00:16:10,00:16:14,"outside, let's say, ordinary working hours. So I think the plan is that you can keep going"
00:16:14,00:16:18,to your job. So you can afford to catch up with your payments eventually. But you can't
00:16:18,00:16:24,"I don't know, socialize. And then as a very last resort, it will either drive to a waiting"
00:16:24,00:16:28,"tow truck to be repossessed, like it'll have an asignation without you knowing about it."
00:16:28,00:16:33,"Or if it's worth very little, it'll just drive itself to a scrap yard and say, take me apart."
00:16:33,00:16:40,Drive yourself to Ghana. That'd be good to be one car. That's great. So this is the plan.
00:16:40,00:16:45,That's amazing. It's incredible. Maybe it'll happen. What's crazy is like this. Why can't
00:16:45,00:16:49,"technology be used for good? If we can control what cars are used and when they're used,"
00:16:49,00:16:53,"what can't we do in the world right now, modal shift, we can't get people out of their cars"
00:16:53,00:16:57,on to train. So why don't we set these new electronic Wi-Fi connected cars in the future
00:16:57,00:17:01,"to like, you can be used for 10 hours a week, run out of your 10 hours, it won't work and"
00:17:01,00:17:06,"you'll have to just go to a field and touch some grass, right? Why don't we use this for"
00:17:06,00:17:13,good? They can only take you to the park and ride. But there's got to be a better way to
00:17:13,00:17:18,"use this technology rather than to just like, make people destitute. Yeah, absolutely. I"
00:17:18,00:17:22,"got one slightly better way of using the technology, the self-driving technologies. So if you've"
00:17:22,00:17:26,"got a really busy road, it's kind of gridlocked almost and everyone's kind of stop, start,"
00:17:26,00:17:31,"stop, start, bad for the environment, bad for everything, right? You can put 5% more"
00:17:31,00:17:36,"cars onto the road, but if they're all driverless and they're all smart and they know exactly"
00:17:36,00:17:41,"how fast to go on which lane to be in, they can stop the gridlock. Okay. Does that make"
00:17:41,00:17:46,sense? You know what I mean? Yeah. So like the cars will join the real cars and they'll
00:17:46,00:17:50,"work out how everyone's behaving and they'll move a little bit faster in this lane, a little"
00:17:50,00:17:54,"bit slower in this lane and suddenly all of the traffic jam will stop. Like a dance,"
00:17:54,00:17:58,"like a synchronised. Yeah, exactly. I used to work in highways and traffic modelling"
00:17:58,00:18:04,"is mostly nonsense. Well, it's not nonsense, but it's super, it's super vulnerable to change."
00:18:04,00:18:09,I worked on this one project here and they spent millions modelling how this new road
00:18:09,00:18:12,would work and everyone was great. And then there was some crisis and petrol went up like
00:18:12,00:18:18,2p and the model that's put in the bin. Like the smallest change in the most random thing
00:18:18,00:18:23,to do with driving. You've got to put it all in the bin and start again. So a lot of policy
00:18:23,00:18:29,"and a lot of stuff is done based on these models, but these models are so quickly made"
00:18:29,00:18:34,and done. But it's true that driver behaviour does cause a huge amount of traffic. So like
00:18:34,00:18:37,Rubberneck is a really good example. You're all familiar with people slow down to look
00:18:37,00:18:42,"at accidents because we're humans. Love it. Or Stonehenge. I'll say it, yeah, but I do"
00:18:42,00:18:47,"that. The A303. Oh, yeah. A303. So you guys are so bad at it, they want to dig a tunnel"
00:18:47,00:18:51,"underneath it. Like you guys are so just, if you won't stop slowing down, we're going"
00:18:51,00:18:56,"to dig underneath it. Every time you're on the A303, you think, God, this wonderful"
00:18:56,00:19:00,crash must have happened up ahead. And it did happen like 3000 years ago. I feel like
00:19:00,00:19:03,"I would drive underneath and go, Oh, we're directly underneath. Let's slow down. Yeah,"
00:19:03,00:19:07,"yeah, yeah. Let's feel it. Sense it. Yeah. Funny enough, I worked for the highway agency"
00:19:07,00:19:10,"whilst I was trying to build it. And I'm like, you're never going to get permission to do"
00:19:10,00:19:14,"this guy. It's like a really old build. Did they get it in the end? No, it got stuck in"
00:19:14,00:19:17,the bin. It's really hard to build tunnels because they're really environmentally unfriendly
00:19:17,00:19:22,and expensive. Put on top of that a bloody English heritage site. You've got recipe for
00:19:22,00:19:31,wasting your money. Yeah. Ford in 2020 applied for a paper to match up passengers with things
00:19:31,00:19:36,"like Uber's, you know, ride sharing. Anyway, matching up passengers on the cars by smell."
00:19:36,00:19:43,Okay. So you fit a car with sensors. And then if that car smells of vomit and then you smell
00:19:43,00:19:49,"of vomit, then you get that one. Is that right? No, it's I think if you've unticked the vomit"
00:19:49,00:19:53,"box, you don't want to be in the car smelling of vomit. Then you won't be paired up. That's"
00:19:53,00:19:58,"clever. So on a Friday night, 11 o'clock, the pubs are kicking out, really hard to get"
00:19:58,00:20:03,an Uber. You uncheck the vomit thing and you're the only one who wants to get a vomit taxi.
00:20:03,00:20:07,"And so there's more taxis available. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's more for people with"
00:20:07,00:20:14,things like airborne nut allergies than people that can't smell vomit. But I think there will
00:20:14,00:20:18,be advantages for everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Let's say someone's had a peanut in the car and it
00:20:18,00:20:22,"will be very dangerous for you if you've got a very, very, very bad nut allergy to get"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"into that car. So you can sense peanuts. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to think what other smells"
00:20:26,00:20:34,can be deadly that are important for this patent. Mustard gas. Yes. That's not good.
00:20:34,00:20:40,"On the smell thing, there was a guy called Henry Cyril Padgett. He was the fifth Marquis"
00:20:40,00:20:47,"of Bath. And he was really famous because he had gotten inheritance in 1904, which was"
00:20:47,00:20:53,"equivalent to 30 million pounds per year. And after about five or 10 years, he'd accumulated"
00:20:53,00:20:58,"debts of about half a million. And that's 60 million in current money, because he just"
00:20:58,00:21:04,spent it on everything. And he modified his car so that his exhaust pipe sprayed perfume.
00:21:04,00:21:09,"So wherever he went, there would be a nice little smell of like someone's vaping past"
00:21:09,00:21:14,"you or something. Lovely. I think it's quite selfless because I mean, it's his car. Yeah,"
00:21:14,00:21:18,"it's actually a benefit that he will never really feel himself. Well, I think what happened"
00:21:18,00:21:22,was he thought that all the cars at the time were a bit smelly. I'm going to do something
00:21:22,00:21:26,"a bit different. I feel like he's a climate change denier. And he's like, what climate"
00:21:26,00:21:37,change? What are you talking about? This is how profligate he was. He was once a theatre
00:21:37,00:21:42,and someone had stolen some of his jewellery. And so he needed to get it back. So he enlisted
00:21:42,00:21:47,the help of Arthur Conan Doyle to try and find the jewels. And he paid Conan Doyle to
00:21:47,00:21:52,"try and solve the case. Brilliant. God, that's great. Isn't that great? I do like people"
00:21:52,00:21:57,who spend money well. It's a really good way to spend your money. Not this fast fashion
00:21:57,00:22:02,nonsense like 5000 shirts or do you want to hire Luther?
00:22:02,00:22:07,Conan Doyle will come up with an incredibly elaborate mechanism by which it would have
00:22:07,00:22:12,been done. He actually that he actually because he was so famous as writing the Sherlock Holmes
00:22:12,00:22:16,"books, people used to come to him with mysteries and ask him to solve them. And obviously they're"
00:22:16,00:22:21,"offering him money and stuff. And he solved a few. And he used two methods, didn't he?"
00:22:21,00:22:26,One was real detective science. And the other was spiritualism. So he would get seances
00:22:26,00:22:31,and he would try and track things down by just the feeling of where it might be. And
00:22:31,00:22:36,did he keep two columns of success and failure? Which method worked better? I think he's
00:22:36,00:22:44,"got wins on both. Yeah, I wonder if that happens today. You know, if like Dan Brown has people"
00:22:44,00:22:50,"getting in contact with him about solving. You'd get in ranking. Yeah, crime. P. D. James."
00:22:50,00:22:58,Richard Osmond. Richard Osmond. Yeah. Your nan goes missing. Richard. Richard in.
00:22:58,00:23:05,"Do you want to hear something, a theory about cup holders? Okay. I was looking into. That's"
00:23:05,00:23:08,correct answer. I was looking into who developed all the different bits of a car and when they
00:23:08,00:23:13,"came in, you know, cup holders came in properly in about the 80s, I think they've been done"
00:23:13,00:23:17,"since the 50s, but they weren't very good. If you were driving, you couldn't really properly"
00:23:17,00:23:22,stash a drink in a drink from a while driving. So like the decent ones came in in the 80s.
00:23:22,00:23:27,"Just a quick aside, the car with the most cup holders is apparently the 2019 Subaru Ascent."
00:23:27,00:23:36,Any guesses? 16. Like five. 12. 19. Oh my God. 19 cup holders. We're at the final three
00:23:36,00:23:44,"that I wasn't thinking of. No. So, okay. Why do we like cup holders? There is a theory"
00:23:44,00:23:49,"by a French scholar. Because you can keep your change in them. Well, yeah, that's kind"
00:23:49,00:23:53,"of I've never put a cup in my cup holder. And the keys and the car keys. Yeah, yeah."
00:23:53,00:23:58,Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here's a theory from this is printed in the Toronto Star French born
00:23:58,00:24:05,"scholar and marketer G Clotaire Rapaye, who argues that warm drinks as we drive a replacement"
00:24:05,00:24:11,"for mother's milk. He says, I see. He says, what was the key element of safety when you"
00:24:11,00:24:15,were a child? It was that your mother fed you and there was warm liquid. Yeah. That's
00:24:15,00:24:21,why cup holders absolutely crucial. I fit in my cup holder with a nipple. Yeah. And
00:24:21,00:24:27,"I, it's very comforting when I try. I'm sure we must have said this, but there was a theory"
00:24:27,00:24:33,"that in McDonald's, the when you're slurping your milkshake, they make it the exact consistency."
00:24:33,00:24:37,So the amount that you slurp is the same amount that you would like to impress. Is that why
00:24:37,00:24:42,"it's so thick? Wow. So you have to suck as hard as you did. I mean, I don't think it's"
00:24:42,00:24:49,"true. There was a theory about that. Beautiful. Beautiful theory. I mean, I don't like milk"
00:24:49,00:24:53,"at all. No, anything to do with milk. I don't like it. I even if like, if you give me a"
00:24:53,00:24:59,"black tea and you use a spoon to stir it, that's been in a milky cup, I swear I can, I can"
00:24:59,00:25:03,"taste, I can't stand milk. And I'm wondering now if that just says something about possibly"
00:25:03,00:25:08,"my relationship with my mother. This is, well, I think it says everything. Yeah. I have the"
00:25:08,00:25:17,exact opposite. So last night you're still on the move. Yeah. I've been wondering for
00:25:17,00:25:26,"nine years who that woman is. Yeah, I woke up two AM last night off the back of having"
00:25:26,00:25:31,"a dream about drinking some milk, got out of bed and I went downstairs and I had a glass"
00:25:31,00:25:39,"of milk. A whole glass of milk. Yeah, two AM off the back of a dream that made me just"
00:25:39,00:25:44,salivate so much for it. I wonder if your body was craving it for something like you
00:25:44,00:25:48,"haven't had enough calcium in your diet. And also vitamin D, right? And it's been very"
00:25:48,00:25:54,"gloomy in the UK recently. Yeah. Yeah. You can get even even other things than milk,"
00:25:54,00:26:01,which is vile in efficacy and smells. I would love to have a quite a fancy glass of milk
00:26:01,00:26:06,lorax. I think I'm on the table. Once you think about it. Yeah. Yeah. What are we talking
00:26:06,00:26:14,about? Carls. Carls. Have you heard of William Suchiti? No. So William Suchiti is a Zimbabwean
00:26:14,00:26:21,born British entrepreneur. And he has invented something called cargo. And this was possibly
00:26:21,00:26:27,going to be the future where they're like little dog sized cars that go round and deliver
00:26:27,00:26:32,"things to people's houses. Okay. And they're autonomous like cars. So you order your milk,"
00:26:32,00:26:37,let's say you've done fancy a glass of milk. Yeah. And then he puts in his order and then
00:26:37,00:26:41,Tesco puts one in a little cargo and it drives it all the way around. Okay. Yeah. He's basically
00:26:41,00:26:45,"going against the Teslas and the Googles as the big, you know, who's going to be the big"
00:26:45,00:26:52,"person who does this in the future. And this guy, the first thing he invented was an intelligent"
00:26:52,00:26:59,robot librarian. Cool. Who doesn't want one of those who was capable of holding a conversation
00:26:59,00:27:02,"or taking commands and would tell you where the books are that you want. So you say, oh,"
00:27:02,00:27:06,"you know what, I really like this Richard Osman book. What else would I like? And they're"
00:27:06,00:27:09,"like, oh, well, there's a Richard Coles book that's just down here. Come and follow me."
00:27:09,00:27:12,And it would kind of drive around and take you to the book. I was sort of picturing an
00:27:12,00:27:19,"anti-Siri where you'd say like, Hey, Siri, and it's just, shh."
00:27:19,00:27:24,This guy also invented an autonomous penguin that they use at Milton Keynes University Hospital.
00:27:24,00:27:28,Cool. And it kind of takes the medicine round to wherever you need it. So if you need certain
00:27:28,00:27:32,"medicine in a state of ward, this little penguin will drive around and drive around and take"
00:27:32,00:27:36,"your medicine. Is it for children's wards? Or just, you know what, it's actually for"
00:27:36,00:27:41,"all wards, but I think, you know, it helps that it is good for children as well. Because"
00:27:41,00:27:49,"you don't want like this evil sort of. Yeah, two 1000 liquid metal. And the other interesting"
00:27:49,00:27:56,thing I found about Sotiti is that in 2023 he rescued a zebra from Ukraine and he currently
00:27:56,00:28:05,"keeps it in his garden in Norfolk. Wow. Using technology for good, rather than evil. I think"
00:28:05,00:28:10,those cargos do sound like a very good idea because it's all about the taking the sort
00:28:10,00:28:13,"of emissions out of the last mile of delivery, isn't it? And that's where a lot of, you"
00:28:13,00:28:17,"know, that's where you can really make efficiencies and, you know, driving vans around all the"
00:28:17,00:28:21,"place, but they are going to need to be quite well defended. As in the number of packages"
00:28:21,00:28:25,"that get mixed from doorsteps, they will need to be. But how would you, what would you say,"
00:28:25,00:28:29,like a flamethrower? I'd fit a flamethrower. I'd fit. So it would be a sliding scale like
00:28:29,00:28:33,"the Ford, like a bit of interference. It just gives you a stern verbal warning. Do you think"
00:28:33,00:28:47,"that we should get William Sotiti to watch ""Robot Wars"" perhaps? Yes. A little spiked."
00:28:47,00:28:51,Okay. And it's time for fact number three. And that is James. Okay. My fact this week
00:28:51,00:28:57,is that the healthiest way to eat broccoli is to stir fry it. After chopping it into
00:28:57,00:29:01,"two millimeter pieces and leaving it to stand for an hour and a half. Yeah, we all know"
00:29:01,00:29:08,"that. Is that how you do yours? Every day. That's what it says in your ""Hello Fresh""."
00:29:08,00:29:15,"Christ, that's a difficult question. So this is because they have a compound called sulforaphane."
00:29:15,00:29:21,"Sulforaphane is really hard to get at. You can get it quite well if you eat it raw, but"
00:29:21,00:29:25,"as soon as you start cooking broccoli, it kind of degenerates and you don't get as much."
00:29:25,00:29:29,"You still get it, but you don't get quite as much. And there was some Chinese researchers"
00:29:29,00:29:34,in the Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry and they tried loads of different ways of
00:29:34,00:29:39,"cooking broccoli, see which ways gets the most sulforaphane, and they found this way,"
00:29:39,00:29:43,"you know, they chopped it into tiny, tiny pieces because actually it's almost a defense"
00:29:43,00:29:48,for the broccoli. It's trying to stop herbivores from eating it. And so it puts this chemical
00:29:48,00:29:52,"out to stop like cows from eating it. Nice try, idiot. You're in my kitchen. There's"
00:29:52,00:29:56,no way you're not going to eat it. Yeah. So like the way to get this out is to kind
00:29:56,00:30:00,of macerate it or chop it up or whatever. So that's why you do the small chopping.
00:30:00,00:30:01,All right.
00:30:01,00:30:05,"And then if you leave it for a long time, it helps the sulforaphane to come out and"
00:30:05,00:30:10,"then you do a quick stir fry. But it's two mil... I gotta say, it feels a bit like you'll"
00:30:10,00:30:14,have a kind of mint of broccoli. And I like the crunch of a floret.
00:30:14,00:30:15,Do you?
00:30:15,00:30:18,"A bit like cauliflower rice, I imagine it would be."
00:30:18,00:30:19,Which I hate.
00:30:19,00:30:25,"I've got a testimony to do with sulforaphane, because I used to have really bad tendinitis"
00:30:25,00:30:29,"in my knees, right? Really bad. And unfortunately, when you're not an athlete, people don't care"
00:30:29,00:30:37,"when your joints hurt. Get over it, Athena. And then at the same time, years ago, became"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"apparent that sulforaphane was good for your joints. And I was like, it can't hurt. So"
00:30:40,00:30:44,"I started having kale and broccoli smoothies, right?"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"Because I was like, they were trying to figure out how to extract the sulforaphane into like"
00:30:47,00:30:52,"a tablet. And I was like, I haven't got time to wait for this, you know? And I honestly,"
00:30:52,00:30:57,"after about a few weeks, if not months, of eating just loads of broccoli and having loads"
00:30:57,00:31:01,"of broccoli and kale smoothies, I'm no word for like, my tendinitis cleared up."
00:31:01,00:31:02,Really?
00:31:02,00:31:07,"Absolutely, yeah. This is anecdotal. It wasn't a scientific study. So I got off the running"
00:31:07,00:31:12,treadmill and off the pavement and started cycling and all this kind of stuff. But after
00:31:12,00:31:15,"a few weeks and months, the tendinitis cleared up and I've not had it since."
00:31:15,00:31:16,Okay.
00:31:16,00:31:17,That's really interesting.
00:31:17,00:31:21,"Would a skeptic say placebo for that, do you think?"
00:31:21,00:31:28,"Well, you know what? Skeptics, right? Skeptics just need to get on board the Athena train."
00:31:28,00:31:29,Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:31,And that's my response to all skeptics on anything they say.
00:31:31,00:31:33,"Like, get on board the Athena train."
00:31:33,00:31:34,The sulforaphane definitely does work.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"Oh, no, I'm just wondering the method of the smoothie, whether or not that."
00:31:37,00:31:42,"Well, it depends. If you're having a fair bit. So there are pills these days, which you'll"
00:31:42,00:31:44,"be glad to know Athena, they completed the process, they made the pills."
00:31:44,00:31:45,"Oh, what a relief."
00:31:45,00:31:51,"Yeah. And the pills, in fact, the pills might be even more effective than broccoli and kale"
00:31:51,00:31:54,"smoothies. I don't know how much you were having. I mean, it sounds like a fair bit."
00:31:54,00:31:58,"I was, honestly, I would buy like three or four florets a week and I'd get through them"
00:31:58,00:32:02,"and either steam it or having my smoothie because my knees, I was in agony. I couldn't"
00:32:02,00:32:05,watch a film. I couldn't go to the theater because every time my knees were bent for more
00:32:05,00:32:11,"than like a minute, they would just be on fire. So I had, yeah, I'd say, and yeah, three"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"or four florets every week. So a lot, a lot."
00:32:13,00:32:17,That is a lot. That absolutely is a lot. These pills are equivalent to eating five kilos
00:32:17,00:32:19,of broccoli every day.
00:32:19,00:32:26,"Wow. That's possibly more. But the other thing is that you can overdo it like with anything,"
00:32:26,00:32:31,"right? And if you have too much sulforaphane, you are supposedly at risk of hyperthyroidism,"
00:32:31,00:32:37,"which will make you tired and, yeah, well, I don't need six kilos of broccoli a day."
00:32:37,00:32:41,"It's just balanced diet. It's like what we always say, but I mean, it's good stuff."
00:32:41,00:32:51,My favorite broccoli is Cubby Broccoli. Hang on though. Hang on though. There's a really
00:32:51,00:32:54,interesting fact about Cubby Broccoli. Cubby Broccoli was the producer of the James Bond
00:32:54,00:32:59,movies. The broccoli family still produced them to this day. Cubby Broccoli in an interview
00:32:59,00:33:09,"that he gave in the 1980s to LA Times made the claim that broccoli, the vegetable is named"
00:33:09,00:33:18,"after him. He's lying. Okay. The broccoli family. So he says that his father, who is"
00:33:18,00:33:23,"called Giovanni and his brother, Giovanni's brother, they immigrated to Long Island from"
00:33:23,00:33:30,"Calabria at the turn of the 20th century. He says, yeah, in Italy, sorry. He says that"
00:33:30,00:33:35,"that broccoli family were descended from the Broccolis of Carrera, who were the first"
00:33:35,00:33:42,"to cross cauliflower and rub to produce the broccoli. Therefore, broccoli is named after"
00:33:42,00:33:46,"him, not vice versa. When people say, are you named after the vegetable? Pretty good."
00:33:46,00:33:50,That sounds very convincing. I have to say. It was an Italian thing. Like the first farmers
00:33:50,00:33:55,"to grow broccoli, the modern broccoli that we consider broccoli today were in the south"
00:33:55,00:33:59,"of Italy. It's definitely a manmade thing. That's from the cabbage family, but they"
00:33:59,00:34:05,"were bred that way, right? Yeah. And it was invented in Italy. I think possibly just named"
00:34:05,00:34:10,"because it's Italian for shoots or something. Yeah. That's the etymology, isn't it? And"
00:34:10,00:34:14,it's the same word. It's the same as brooch. Brooch and broccoli have the same etymological
00:34:14,00:34:20,"root. Yeah. I know the Romans had a version of broccoli, but I don't think they had a"
00:34:20,00:34:24,"lovely classic green broccoli. Well, one thing they definitely didn't have is tender"
00:34:24,00:34:29,stem broccoli. Is that what we've got? So tender stem broccoli is where it's quite a long stem
00:34:29,00:34:33,and then there's little broccoli florets on the top. And you can eat the whole thing.
00:34:33,00:34:38,"It's pot broccoli. Oh, it's delicious, guys. It's brilliant. But this is one of the most"
00:34:38,00:34:43,amazing things I've ever found. Tender stem broccoli was invented about 10 years ago by
00:34:43,00:34:51,a committee in Japan and it's a registered trademark. What? Isn't it amazing? Originally
00:34:51,00:34:56,they called it aspiration when they invented it. Because it looks like an asparagus. Exactly.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"That's where they got it from. And yeah, they would just have this session where a load"
00:34:59,00:35:04,"of people at the Sokata Seed Incorporation in Yokohama sat around the table and went,"
00:35:04,00:35:08,you know what we should do? We should make broccoli where you can eat the whole thing.
00:35:08,00:35:12,"How would we do that? Well, what if we mixed it with Chinese kale? Okay, let's try it."
00:35:12,00:35:16,And they tried it. And now they patent the seeds and they sell the seeds around the world.
00:35:16,00:35:20,Are you saying actually 10 years? About 10 years. In the last 20 years for sure. But
00:35:20,00:35:24,you're saying I couldn't have seen in the millennium with a nice dish of tender stem broccoli.
00:35:24,00:35:30,It would have been close. It was around that time when they started coming in. I never
00:35:30,00:35:33,"saw these because they were inexpensive. I see you're like, oh, I'm doing well in the"
00:35:33,00:35:38,world now that I've been introduced to a new broccoli. It's utterly bizarre. And they
00:35:38,00:35:43,"called them aspiration and they tried to sell them like that. And then Debbie Nucci, who"
00:35:43,00:35:49,"is the wife of the company's chief operating officer, she came up with the name Broccolini"
00:35:49,00:35:53,and that's what they called in America. And then it was Marks and Spencer started to call
00:35:53,00:35:59,in them tender stem in the UK. Wow. So let me get this right. You're saying you think
00:35:59,00:36:02,"that's more amazing than the fact that the James Bond producer? Well, that's not true"
00:36:02,00:36:13,what you said. The bit that I said is verifiably true. That's milk shake nipple. That's not
00:36:13,00:36:17,going to become a thing that my name is now milk shake nipple but Donald's man. It's
00:36:17,00:36:25,"a cat fits. If the nipple fits, they love broccoli in Japan, though, don't they? They"
00:36:25,00:36:30,like to the point. Yeah. Yeah. So to the point where kids particularly love it and there's
00:36:30,00:36:33,"a story which is Pixar, you know, the movie inside out that they did. There's a scene"
00:36:33,00:36:39,in that where it was a movie about emotions. It was a real kind of poignant. They had characters
00:36:39,00:36:44,"like one of them was sad and one of them was angry. It was all in one person's head. Yeah,"
00:36:44,00:36:48,"exactly. And in it, there's a scene where they eat broccoli and they go. It's yucky"
00:36:48,00:36:51,or whatever. And they swap that. They swap that out for the Japanese edition because
00:36:51,00:36:55,broccoli is loved by kids there. So they put it instead. They put in stairs. They don't
00:36:55,00:37:01,"like milk, do they? I think famously in Japan. That wouldn't go down well in my house. Turn"
00:37:01,00:37:10,"it off. We're done. Green peppers. Green peppers. Yeah, that's what they replace it with. But"
00:37:10,00:37:16,isn't there like a substance that makes green vegetables taste horrible to kids? And it's
00:37:16,00:37:21,"in Brussels sprouts and things like that. It's really bitter, right? Yeah. Yeah. So some"
00:37:21,00:37:25,"people, so it happens to lots of children and I think children have extra taste buds."
00:37:25,00:37:31,"But there is a gene, which I have written down, which is called TAS2R38. And that lets"
00:37:31,00:37:35,you taste bitterness. And there's a variant of that gene. And if you get two versions
00:37:35,00:37:39,"of one particular variant, then your whole life, not just when you're a child, you experience"
00:37:39,00:37:44,all the Brassica family as being unbelievably foul and bitter and horrible. It's really
00:37:44,00:37:50,"interesting. My wife, when she was pregnant, she craved broccoli and tender stem. And then"
00:37:50,00:37:55,"after about a month, she couldn't be in the same room as it. But didn't have the hearts"
00:37:55,00:37:58,tell me because I started making a loads of things with broccoli in it because she was
00:37:58,00:38:02,"like, oh yeah, I really want broccoli. I'm like, great, I'll make broccoli soup. I'll"
00:38:02,00:38:06,"make broccoli this, broccoli that. And then she just found it so disgusting she couldn't"
00:38:06,00:38:11,"be near it. Maybe that was the response. Here's your broccoli cake, darling, happy birthday."
00:38:11,00:38:19,You're absolutely right. It's amazing how it can quickly turn. Broccoli everything here.
00:38:19,00:38:22,It could have been more of a comment on my cooking than anything else. It's a two minute
00:38:22,00:38:29,"bit of pieces darling. I made it exactly as I told me to. Oh, this is a cool thing. This"
00:38:29,00:38:35,is slightly tangential. I hope you don't mind. Have you heard of epicuticular wax?
00:38:35,00:38:41,"No. Right. This is a wax that covers lots of vegetables, right? That is water repellent"
00:38:41,00:38:45,"and loads and loads of vegetables, including broccoli, have epicuticular naturally or we"
00:38:45,00:38:50,are doing naturally. So like epidermis is the top layer of skin and cuticular the cuticles.
00:38:50,00:38:57,So it's it's the surface layer. And it's it's to protect the plant from water getting in
00:38:57,00:39:01,"from outside. Yeah. And all the rubbish that might be in external water, matter of bacteria"
00:39:01,00:39:05,"and it might be dangerous. There might be molds, all of that. And this is why, you know,"
00:39:05,00:39:13,"when you wet kale, you know, when you go out wet some kale. Yeah, we all go out on kale"
00:39:13,00:39:18,letting expeditions. But you might rinse some kale before cooking it in the water just seems
00:39:18,00:39:22,"to stick on the surface. Droplets. Yeah, it splashes. It makes a mess. Water goes everywhere."
00:39:22,00:39:28,"It literally is like it's alive and it's rejecting water. Well, it is and it is and it's because"
00:39:28,00:39:34,"of epicuticular wax. And it's why when you boil kale, sometimes it leaves a like a ring"
00:39:34,00:39:40,ring or the bathtub. It's like water off a duck's back. Water off kale's epicuticular
00:39:40,00:39:48,"wax. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And it's, it's super hydrophobic in some plants. It feels like you"
00:39:48,00:39:53,know what really hydrophobic things we tend to use them as lubricants like oil and stuff
00:39:53,00:39:59,"like that, right? Yeah. Feels like you could use this kale as a lubricant. It's gonna struggle"
00:39:59,00:40:05,"to sell it now. Special vegan section of ads on itself. Yeah, I think that's all right."
00:40:05,00:40:09,"You're right. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't thinking sexual. I was thinking, oh, please."
00:40:09,00:40:16,"I said lubricant and sex never. I just, what? Wow. How did you get there? James says lubricant."
00:40:16,00:40:30,He thinks of complicated machine tool processes. Go back to your milkshake.
00:40:30,00:40:35,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week"
00:40:35,00:40:41,"is that last year on December 23rd, a hospital in Doncaster accidentally sent a text message"
00:40:41,00:40:47,to thousands of its patients informing them that they had an aggressive terminal disease.
00:40:47,00:40:52,"What they'd meant to send was a message reading, Merry Christmas and have a happy new year."
00:40:52,00:41:00,"So this is a very unfortunate moment. And I should say that while obviously it's a,"
00:41:00,00:41:07,"it's in theory a hilarious cock up. This caused chaos. Yeah. This caused horrible, horrible"
00:41:07,00:41:11,moments for people in Doncaster and the center of which the texts went out from. There's
00:41:11,00:41:15,"about 8,000 people sign there. So this was their mailing list basically through text"
00:41:15,00:41:18,messaging. Some of them had had tests. Some of them had tests. Some of them were rating
00:41:18,00:41:22,"on results. Some of them were, there was a lady who ran out of her house and she ran"
00:41:22,00:41:26,around the corner because she was so petrified and she saw six people in the street all out
00:41:26,00:41:31,"there as well going, I've just been. So everyone, it was just like a national. You know what"
00:41:31,00:41:37,it reminds me of? Do you remember that Hawaiian? Yeah. If one got a text message saying there's
00:41:37,00:41:41,a nuclear missile coming to Hawaii. Exactly. And everyone believed it for about 15 minutes.
00:41:41,00:41:46,But I think some people were going to shelters and the guy who had sent the message had done
00:41:46,00:41:51,it before as well. I think it was a second offense. Twice before he'd mistook. But he's
00:41:51,00:41:57,"like, it's okay. I'm just going to move to Doncaster. We'll never have this problem again."
00:41:57,00:42:02,Oh yeah. What happened with that was that a call had came in to do a test for a missile
00:42:02,00:42:06,"launch and the guy who pressed the button, there's two buttons that you can press. One"
00:42:06,00:42:11,that says test missile alert and then missile alert. Like a drop down menu. Yeah. Because
00:42:11,00:42:15,they're alphabetically so close to each other. It's not like he picked the wrong thing. He
00:42:15,00:42:19,picked missile alert because he was overhearing the conversation and he said what happened
00:42:19,00:42:23,"was that the guy who had the person on the phone saying, this is a test, this is a test"
00:42:23,00:42:28,"of whatever wording it was, said that to the to the phone that was on the ear of the guy"
00:42:28,00:42:33,receiving it. And then he put it on to speakerphone. So the man who pressed the button didn't
00:42:33,00:42:38,"hear the, this is a test, just heard the next bit and was clearly a paranoid guy. So he"
00:42:38,00:42:42,just pressed the button. So it wasn't only text messages. It was also the TVs. It came
00:42:42,00:42:46,"on the TV. It came over the radio. He's a paranoid guy, but maybe he was just doing"
00:42:46,00:42:51,"his job. Well, he was doing his job, but he'd done it wrong three times in total. So it"
00:42:51,00:42:55,they had to let him go. It was just an amusing that each time it was a music thing that made
00:42:55,00:43:03,him stop hearing this is a test. Yeah. Like siren just drives. There was a school there
00:43:03,00:43:07,"in Hawaii where the students, they ran out after hearing all the, all the text messages"
00:43:07,00:43:12,on on TV and they ran to the fallout shelters built specifically for missiles and so on
00:43:12,00:43:16,"got there, but they were locked. So they had to run back into the school. So they couldn't"
00:43:16,00:43:21,even use the thing built for them to do it. And there were people were reporting people
00:43:21,00:43:25,"driving a hundred miles an hour down the road, desperately trying to get home. It was an"
00:43:25,00:43:29,"amazing thing. I have a book, by the way, which is my favorite novel of recent years"
00:43:29,00:43:35,"I've read by Jim Carrey, my, you know, the comedian. And the cover of it is his face."
00:43:35,00:43:38,"It's done a bit artistically, but it's his face. And Jim Carrey was writing that book"
00:43:38,00:43:44,while that missile was launched in Hawaii. And he was doing FaceTime with his assistant
00:43:44,00:43:48,"who called him up saying, we have minutes to live. And she accidentally took a screen"
00:43:48,00:43:54,grab the second his face. Like this is going to be a billion. She was there as well. So
00:43:54,00:43:59,I think she had minutes to make that money. You want to see what a guy with one of the
00:43:59,00:44:03,"funniest faces in the world does. He was in the mask, right? So as soon as they told"
00:44:03,00:44:13,"him, his eyes would pop out. You've got four minutes to make the funniest face. Get Carrey,"
00:44:13,00:44:17,"Rowan Atkinson, a few others and just workshop it. This isn't really about systems and practical"
00:44:17,00:44:20,"because I've had lots of jobs. I used to do like business development, right? She'd"
00:44:20,00:44:23,"go into companies and they would have a process for doing things. And you'd say, well, this"
00:44:23,00:44:26,process works and doesn't work for these reasons. So this is a really good example of it's
00:44:26,00:44:31,"not actually that guy's fault, professing the nuclear test button. It's the process."
00:44:31,00:44:35,"So you know, in movies in America, there's this mad process they've got to do to like"
00:44:35,00:44:40,actually send the bombs. They've got to read codes. They've got to do dances. They've got
00:44:40,00:44:45,to play charades. They've got to complete the game of mouse trap. Exactly. You know those
00:44:45,00:44:50,games where you've got like a metal wire. And you've got to take something over without
00:44:50,00:44:52,"making something, making noise or whatever. And you've got to take operation. But the"
00:44:52,00:44:57,whole point of that is so you don't just like start firing missiles by accident. It is unequivocal.
00:44:57,00:45:04,"This is what we want you to do. Having a, oh, I just want to put you on speaker. There's"
00:45:04,00:45:08,like a three second delay. Only one person's responsible. There's a drop down list. These
00:45:08,00:45:12,"are all things. If I was going into that office, I'd be like, yeah, you need to change your"
00:45:12,00:45:16,process. That mistake shouldn't have happened with the Doncaster thing. That's a process
00:45:16,00:45:17,thing.
00:45:17,00:45:21,"There used to be, there was an idea, a theory by someone and I forgive me, I can't remember"
00:45:21,00:45:26,"who it was, but they said that they should put the nuclear codes inside a person. And"
00:45:26,00:45:30,that person should be with the president at all times. Yes. So if the president ever needed
00:45:30,00:45:35,"to send a nuke, they would have to kill that person and suddenly it becomes more real for"
00:45:35,00:45:39,the president. He's not just pressing any old button. The president has to literally
00:45:39,00:45:47,stab the guy and I don't think it would be the president. Because the idea is that then
00:45:47,00:45:51,the president who's making that decision has to make a more immediate decision before he
00:45:51,00:45:52,can just press it.
00:45:52,00:45:53,There are lots.
00:45:53,00:45:54,There are lots.
00:45:54,00:45:55,There are lots.
00:45:55,00:45:56,The giant river otter.
00:45:56,00:45:57,With the president at all times.
00:45:57,00:45:59,Because the president's got to make a lot of life and death decisions.
00:45:59,00:46:03,"And who applies for that job as well? Like, who come to go, honey, you got to grow a gig."
00:46:03,00:46:04,I'm working with the president.
00:46:04,00:46:11,"You might, you know, we've never had a nuclear war break out. You will probably just serve"
00:46:11,00:46:12,your time.
00:46:12,00:46:16,"In theory, you could just sit around doing nothing for 30 years and then get to go wherever"
00:46:16,00:46:17,the president goes.
00:46:17,00:46:18,You'll see amazing rooms.
00:46:18,00:46:19,"Oh my God, this is a great thing."
00:46:19,00:46:22,You probably can't put on too much weight because then he would be more difficult for
00:46:22,00:46:23,stab you.
00:46:23,00:46:24,Absolutely.
00:46:24,00:46:25,Rules.
00:46:25,00:46:26,Yeah.
00:46:26,00:46:27,You've got to have a big tattoo of cut here.
00:46:27,00:46:28,Cut here.
00:46:28,00:46:30,A little scissor light inserted on you.
00:46:30,00:46:31,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:31,00:46:32,"That's a bit stressful, but you know."
00:46:32,00:46:37,But then wouldn't the sort of the enemy try and kidnap you and get the codes out of your
00:46:37,00:46:38,chest as well?
00:46:38,00:46:39,"Oh yeah, that is true."
00:46:39,00:46:40,Don't you become a...
00:46:40,00:46:41,As we know who the person is...
00:46:41,00:46:44,"You would probably have to have about 10 people, all of whom were with the president, but only"
00:46:44,00:46:46,the president knows which one it is.
00:46:46,00:46:47,"Oh wow, yes."
00:46:47,00:46:48,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:48,00:46:49,That's a great idea.
00:46:49,00:46:50,Yeah.
00:46:50,00:46:51,Yeah.
00:46:51,00:46:52,So you've all got the tattoo.
00:46:52,00:46:53,Yeah.
00:46:53,00:46:54,But maybe everyone in America has one.
00:46:54,00:46:55,And...
00:46:55,00:46:56,"It's getting complicated, isn't it?"
00:46:56,00:46:58,It's getting harder to...
00:46:58,00:47:03,"Just on text messages, this text message is meant to say, ""Merry Christmas and have a"
00:47:03,00:47:04,"happy new year."""
00:47:04,00:47:05,Yeah.
00:47:05,00:47:06,And that's very apt.
00:47:06,00:47:07,It is.
00:47:07,00:47:10,"Because the first ever text message said, ""You have an aggressive terminal..."""
00:47:10,00:47:11,"No, it said..."
00:47:11,00:47:12,It was a merry Christmas.
00:47:12,00:47:13,It was a merry Christmas message.
00:47:13,00:47:14,"Yeah, that's great."
00:47:14,00:47:16,It was sent by a man called Neil Papworth.
00:47:16,00:47:17,I think it was in the...
00:47:17,00:47:19,"It was in 1992, on the 3rd of December."
00:47:19,00:47:20,There we go.
00:47:20,00:47:21,But imagine getting the first ever text message.
00:47:21,00:47:22,"And it was, like, 3rd of December a bit early."
00:47:22,00:47:23,Yeah.
00:47:23,00:47:24,That's the thing.
00:47:24,00:47:26,Vodafone were having the Christmas party on the 3rd of December.
00:47:26,00:47:27,Vodafone were having a party.
00:47:27,00:47:30,I believe to celebrate the sending of the first ever text message.
00:47:30,00:47:35,"So this guy, Papworth, sent the message to the head of Vodafone, or Richard Jarvis, who"
00:47:35,00:47:36,was a big week at Vodafone.
00:47:36,00:47:41,I believe it was a party partly to celebrate this technology happening.
00:47:41,00:47:45,"And he had to text it from a computer, because phones at the time didn't have the capacity"
00:47:45,00:47:46,to text.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Yeah.
00:47:47,00:47:50,But the phone that Richard Jarvis received it on weighed two kilos.
00:47:50,00:47:57,"And that's about, I think, 12 modern iPhones, as in it just reminds you of what phones have"
00:47:57,00:47:59,"been like in very, very living memory."
00:47:59,00:48:01,There's a guy called Brian Moore.
00:48:01,00:48:05,"He's designed a device that won't let you type the word ""lol"" unless it has actually"
00:48:05,00:48:08,detected you laughing out loud.
00:48:08,00:48:10,"That's a good idea, that, isn't it?"
00:48:10,00:48:11,That's great.
00:48:11,00:48:16,"With the iText hat, when I am laughing, but I would never send lol, even if I'm really"
00:48:16,00:48:17,laughing out loud.
00:48:17,00:48:18,No.
00:48:18,00:48:19,"That would be ""ha ha""."
00:48:19,00:48:24,"I do ""ha ha ha ha"" to be like, you're like, kind of, I'm laughing a lot."
00:48:24,00:48:28,"I do ""wa ha ha ha ha"" but I am a villain."
00:48:28,00:48:32,"But I think you would be able to program it so it wouldn't let you say ""ha ha"" unless"
00:48:32,00:48:36,you were laughing out loud.
00:48:36,00:48:41,"And it also doesn't let you write ""ruffle"" unless you're actually rolling on the floor."
00:48:41,00:48:44,What about pissing myself laughing?
00:48:44,00:48:47,"Then moisture sensors, wow, insert."
00:48:47,00:48:49,Laughing my ass off.
00:48:49,00:48:56,"Okay, the fastest ever text message, this is just a little weird fun record, okay."
00:48:56,00:48:58,Like just KK.
00:48:58,00:49:02,So there's a specific message which you have to send for this record.
00:49:02,00:49:03,Right.
00:49:03,00:49:04,Do we know what it is?
00:49:04,00:49:05,We do.
00:49:05,00:49:07,"I'll tell you the record first, right?"
00:49:07,00:49:11,"So this was broken, it may have been re-broken since, but it was 2010, British woman Melissa"
00:49:11,00:49:13,"Thompson, she sent this message."
00:49:13,00:49:17,It's 26 words and she managed it in 25.94 seconds.
00:49:17,00:49:18,Okay.
00:49:18,00:49:19,That's pretty good.
00:49:19,00:49:20,It's all right.
00:49:20,00:49:22,"It doesn't sound, yeah, second word sounds quite beatable though, doesn't it?"
00:49:22,00:49:24,Here's the message.
00:49:24,00:49:30,"The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serra, Salmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious"
00:49:30,00:49:32,freshwater fish in the world.
00:49:32,00:49:35,"In reality, they seldom attack a human."
00:49:35,00:49:36,Lol.
00:49:36,00:49:40,So that's what she managed in 25 seconds.
00:49:40,00:49:41,"Okay, that is impressive."
00:49:41,00:49:42,It's a predictive text.
00:49:42,00:49:45,I imagine piranhas not necessarily going to come up.
00:49:45,00:49:52,"I would say the name of the species, because I have actually never heard those words before."
00:49:52,00:49:54,"She would learn them beforehand, I guess."
00:49:54,00:49:56,"I think so, yeah, because it's the sentence you'd know."
00:49:56,00:50:01,"And it's a real Fosbury flopper though, Melissa's record, because 2004, the same record with"
00:50:01,00:50:07,"the same sentence was broken by a Sussex man called James Trussler, and he took 67 seconds"
00:50:07,00:50:10,"to do it, and she took under 26 seconds to do it."
00:50:10,00:50:11,Wow.
00:50:11,00:50:12,Did she have a special technique?
00:50:12,00:50:13,"Oh, I don't know."
00:50:13,00:50:15,"I don't know if it's like Fosbury, yeah, yeah."
00:50:15,00:50:17,But it's a huge difference.
00:50:17,00:50:18,Yes.
00:50:18,00:50:22,Maybe she was the first person to ever use her thumb rather than typing with her ridden
00:50:22,00:50:23,next fingers.
00:50:23,00:50:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:50:24,00:50:27,"All right, you know the old lockers, you have to press each button three times."
00:50:27,00:50:28,"A, B, C."
00:50:28,00:50:29,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:50:29,00:50:30,All that.
00:50:30,00:50:31,"So, yeah, that's amazing."
00:50:31,00:50:32,Good for whoever that was.
00:50:32,00:50:34,And good for if you're stuck with a piranha as well.
00:50:34,00:50:35,Yeah.
00:50:35,00:50:37,Because they sell them to attack a human.
00:50:37,00:50:38,Ah.
00:50:38,00:50:42,I think I think about texting.
00:50:42,00:50:43,Yeah.
00:50:43,00:50:44,It was so profitable.
00:50:44,00:50:45,Oh.
00:50:45,00:50:46,"When it cost, I mean--"
00:50:46,00:50:47,"It's like 10p a text, wasn't it?"
00:50:47,00:50:49,We're all of a nature to remember 10p texts.
00:50:49,00:50:50,Yeah.
00:50:50,00:50:52,It didn't cost 10p to send that data.
00:50:52,00:50:53,Doesn't feel like it.
00:50:53,00:50:54,Doesn't feel like it did.
00:50:54,00:50:58,"And so I did a little looking into it, and basically the profits were unbelievably huge"
00:50:58,00:51:00,for mobile phone firms.
00:51:00,00:51:03,"People were sending like a billion, weren't they?"
00:51:03,00:51:04,Like the world was sending--
00:51:04,00:51:09,"And you'd get on your plan, sorry for any younger listeners, but you'd get a certain"
00:51:09,00:51:13,"number of minutes and maybe 200 texts a month, or 500 texts a month, and you'd get right"
00:51:13,00:51:16,up to the wire of how many texts you were allowed to send because then it was charging
00:51:16,00:51:17,you 10p a minute.
00:51:17,00:51:23,"Anyway, in 2001 it cost 10p, like you said, James, which was 128 bytes of data for 160"
00:51:23,00:51:25,"characters, right?"
00:51:25,00:51:30,"The Guardian calculated that if it was charged at that rate, buying a standard music CD would"
00:51:30,00:51:31,"cost £60,000."
00:51:31,00:51:32,Oh my god.
00:51:32,00:51:33,Yeah.
00:51:33,00:51:36,"The text message was just banality, right?"
00:51:36,00:51:40,It wasn't even like-- it wasn't 10p worth of information.
00:51:40,00:51:41,It was mostly flirting.
00:51:41,00:51:47,"Well, mine were all about piranhas and stuff."
00:51:47,00:51:49,I was wondering how old WhatsApp was.
00:51:49,00:51:50,All right.
00:51:50,00:51:51,I'm going to guess this.
00:51:51,00:51:55,"I must say I don't know the answer, but Dan's got his laptop so you can check."
00:51:55,00:51:56,I can check.
00:51:56,00:51:57,Yeah.
00:51:57,00:51:58,"I guess first, I think now."
00:51:58,00:51:59,I think eight years old.
00:51:59,00:52:00,Nice.
00:52:00,00:52:01,"So that's what, 2015?"
00:52:01,00:52:02,Yeah.
00:52:02,00:52:03,"Because James got us earlier with the 10 to stand broccoli, right?"
00:52:03,00:52:04,Yeah.
00:52:04,00:52:05,Like it's invented 20 years ago.
00:52:05,00:52:06,So I'm going to guess 1492.
00:52:06,00:52:07,Ah.
00:52:07,00:52:08,Like it's actually--
00:52:08,00:52:13,"You're not closer, but you're closer to what I'm going to say."
00:52:13,00:52:14,Okay.
00:52:14,00:52:16,"So first of all, Dan, what was the answer?"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"Well, is it older or younger than broccoli?"
00:52:18,00:52:19,Broccoli.
00:52:19,00:52:23,Because I think broccoli and I reckon actually came in around the turn of the millennium
00:52:23,00:52:24,really.
00:52:24,00:52:25,Okay.
00:52:25,00:52:27,So it must be younger than that.
00:52:27,00:52:28,Yeah.
00:52:28,00:52:29,I don't know.
00:52:29,00:52:30,"Yes, it is."
00:52:30,00:52:31,Yeah.
00:52:31,00:52:32,Go on.
00:52:32,00:52:33,2009.
00:52:33,00:52:34,2009.
00:52:34,00:52:35,Okay.
00:52:35,00:52:36,"Well, I found a WhatsApp from 1908."
00:52:36,00:52:38,This is what I just thought.
00:52:38,00:52:43,I'd go in the newspaper archives and search for WhatsApp and see what came up.
00:52:43,00:52:47,"And this was from the Mass on Telegraph of the 26th of September, 1908."
00:52:47,00:52:52,And it was about someone being sued for breaking up an engagement.
00:52:52,00:52:56,"And this was the first time that had ever happened in Albany, in Georgia."
00:52:56,00:52:59,And it was a businessman called Jay E. Sapp.
00:52:59,00:53:02,And he had teamed up with a guy called Mr. Watt.
00:53:02,00:53:05,And they owned a hardware shop in Georgia called WattSapp.
00:53:05,00:53:06,Get out.
00:53:06,00:53:07,Isn't that amazing?
00:53:07,00:53:08,Get out.
00:53:08,00:53:14,"The WattSapp hardware store existed for a small amount of time in 1908 in Albany, Georgia."
00:53:14,00:53:15,Wow.
00:53:15,00:53:19,And the proprietor was going around breaking up engagements.
00:53:19,00:53:22,"Well, that's what WattSapp is used for."
00:53:22,00:53:26,"In many, in many ways, just couples have an argument."
00:53:26,00:53:27,Yeah.
00:53:27,00:53:28,Yeah.
00:53:28,00:53:29,Okay.
00:53:29,00:53:30,That's it.
00:53:30,00:53:33,That is all of our facts.
00:53:33,00:53:34,Thank you so much for listening.

00:54:07,00:54:08,Episode five?
00:54:08,00:54:10,The last one was about a friend of ours who got the snip.
00:54:10,00:54:11,Wow.
00:54:11,00:54:12,"Yeah, right?"
00:54:12,00:54:13,It was way too enthusiastic.
00:54:13,00:54:16,"Your kids must be stressful, man."
00:54:16,00:54:17,Yeah.
00:54:17,00:54:18,That sounds good.
00:54:18,00:54:19,Yeah.
00:54:19,00:54:20,I hadn't thought of that.
00:54:20,00:54:21,"But it's called ""Why Does My Child Hate Me?"""
00:54:21,00:54:23,"It's about kids and how they're the problem, not us."
00:54:23,00:54:24,We're brilliant.
00:54:24,00:54:25,So check that out.
00:54:25,00:54:26,These kids are nuts.
00:54:26,00:54:27,Yeah.
00:54:27,00:54:30,"Otherwise, we'll be back again next week."
00:54:30,00:54:31,We'll see you then.
