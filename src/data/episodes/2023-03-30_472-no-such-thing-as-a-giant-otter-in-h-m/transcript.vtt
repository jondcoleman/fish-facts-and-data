00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. I'm quickly here

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.640
 to introduce you to our special guest this week and that is Athena Cablenu. Now you'll

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.120
 remember Athena, she's been on the fish a couple of times but one interesting new thing

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.040
 to say about her is she has a new podcast. Her podcast is called Why Does My Child Hate

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.200
 Me? It's absolutely amazing. I think she got the name from reading my mind at 6.30 this

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.680
 morning but it's a brilliant podcast. It's all about how we as parents are absolutely

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.320
 amazing and it is the children who are wrong. It's so good and you should definitely check

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.680
 that out. If you want to hear any more from Athena you can get her on social media on

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.920
 Twitter and Instagram. Both of those places she can be found at Athena Cablenu and just

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.560
 so you know how to spell her surname it's K-U-G-B-L-E-N-U. Not much more to say except we do have

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.280
 a live show coming up. It's at the British Library. That's sold out but you can get

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.160
 streaming tickets so if you want to know more about that go to No Such Thing As A Fish dot

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.840
 com and that's also the place to go if you want to learn about Club Fish, a place where

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.800
 you get ad free episodes, loads of extra bonus stuff and also you get to hear about the live

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.200
 shows first. For instance the British Library show almost sold out from just the people

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.160
 who listen to Club Fish. There was only a few tickets left for those who heard about

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.260
 it on the Friday so it's definitely a good place to go if you want to hear all of our

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.600
 news first. Anyway I really hope you enjoy this week's show. I hope all is good with

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:48.400
 you. Enjoy our facts with Athena and on with the podcast.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.760
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.320
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Athena Cablanu and once again we have gathered

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.680
 around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.640
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Athena.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.660
 My fact this week is 15 million clothing items are dumped in Ghana every week. Like someone's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.120
 come to your house with a cheap bottle of wine they're re-gifting. Here you go and you've

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.600
 got to re-gift it and then they re-gift it and there's a bottle of wine floating around

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040
 the world being re-gifted over and over again because it's vinegary two pound rubbish and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.000
 it's clothing. It's a good analogy and it's a good job

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.960
 that Anna isn't here because that's the kind of wine she loves. She'd be like "I would

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.480
 drink that wine" but yeah it's absolutely huge, it's a huge amount and they have huge

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.600
 sort of piles of it next to it. There's one river in Akra.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.840
 So it's like literally mountains of clothing.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah and we've got a massive market where it's traded, most of it's traded, most

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.040
 of it's given away but we don't want it. Just to be clear this is unwanted. We want a little

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.520
 bit of it. Yeah, second hand stuff is great but it's stuff that we've inevitably bought

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.900
 from fast fashion suppliers for very low amounts of money. We've worn it once, we've thrown

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.200
 it away. We've gone into our wardrobes and we've gone "I don't want all these clothes.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.280
 It's wasteful in my wardrobe. Let me take you to a charity shop." Guess what? A charity

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.620
 shop doesn't even want all your clothes and then it ends up in a charity shop into the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.200
 back of a shipping container and it gets shipped off to a country and one of those countries

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 is Ghana.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.360
 Wow, up until you mentioning this fact, fast fashion, I'd actually not heard that term

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.440
 before and looking into it, wow, what a mad thing we're all involved in if you buy from

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.400
 high street shops. Back in the day you used to maybe buy four shirts and that would last

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.280
 you for months on end but now it's almost like six shirts a week for some people if

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.160
 they go out and want for younger kids supposedly from surveys. A lot of kids want to be seen

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.920
 in different shirts on their Instagram, they don't want to be seen in the same thing. So

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.760
 socially you are doing a turnaround of shirts that you might only wear once and then chuck

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.360
 away or give back to the shops who then don't resell them.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.560
 The stuff that goes to Ghana, I think like you say, they kind of resell it and reuse

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.440
 it and stuff but 40% of it is such low quality that it just goes straight into landfill and

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.200
 you can't really truck it out of Ghana at that stage so it gets dubbed in Ghana.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.080
 Yeah, and don't forget there's not a huge amount of infrastructure in terms of like

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.560
 wasting recycling. It's not like they can separate it into polyesters, cottons, repurpose it.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.320
 If you want to take rubbish anywhere, I swear to God, Ghana is the last place you want to

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.640
 take it and put it to be used in a useful way. Just on your point about how much we

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:50.000
 buy in the UK, we buy two tons of clothing every minute. Every minute, I can't be right.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.720
 I got it off the Oxfam website.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.320
 Wow, I found that we throw away 75 pounds of clothes every year per person.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.400
 That's way. That's about the weight of a male giant otter.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.040
 That does bring it home.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.840
 How big are otters that big?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.840
 They're huge. They're big.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840
 They're giant otters.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.160
 There's the logo for the campaign against wasteful clothing.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.320
 It may not seem a lot but obviously there's 60 odd million people in the UK. Imagine 60

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.080
 odd million giant otters.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.600
 Again, James, I do think you've picked one of the worst and least known animals.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.160
 If people's reactions to that factor are they're giant otters, that is a problem with the campaign.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.160
 Yeah, you're right.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.560
 Because then you're immediately talking about the otter, you're not talking about the clothes.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.080
 And also, do we need to be worried about them because they sound kind of aggressive.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.880
 Yeah. Well, you need to worry about yourself if you're in a room with one. They're six

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.320
 feet long and if you're in a room with one, it's not in its natural habitat which is the

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.160
 Amazon base. They're Brazilian, aren't they?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.160
 Giant otter.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
 Yeah, it's happened. It's happened. We forgot about clothing. We're in the world of otter.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.680
 It's because the world of fast fashion is so, once you look at the stats, it's so upsetting

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.160
 that if James comes along with his brilliant campaign and posts it, you immediately want

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.680
 to think about the otter because...

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.520
 I think maybe we can get you a costume, Andy.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520
 An otter costume?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.120
 An otter costume and send you into H&M and fuck things up.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.000
 I love that. Be like Christ turning over the tables in the temple.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.640
 Yeah, was he an otter costume?

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.000
 He never mentioned... Well, three of the scriptures don't mention it, but John is always a bit

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.200
 more out there. He says Christ was at the Law of the Trust.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.640
 That could be the new saying instead of a bull in a china shop. It's an otter in a Zara

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640
 high street shop.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.840
 No, but you're right. The numbers are kind of heinous. I didn't realize how it had happened

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.360
 in the first place as in the way that lots of big high street brands moved from having

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.640
 a few collections of clothes a year to now having new collections maybe every couple

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.600
 of weeks. And there's a firm called Shine who, I think if you know about fashion, you

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.320
 will know about them, but if you don't, you won't. They're an enormous Chinese firm who

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.600
 stock almost all their clothes, 94% of their clothes are stocked for 90 days or less. So

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.560
 they basically turn out thousands and thousands and thousands of designs, but they only make

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.760
 about 50 or 100 of each one. But in the first four months of last year, they added 315,000

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.120
 different styles to their website.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.680
 It's a clever idea in a way. I mean, it's terrible for the world, but the idea is that

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.360
 one, you don't have lots of waste. They don't have lots of waste in their company because

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.720
 because you're only making 50 of them, you're probably going to sell all 50, but also you're

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.760
 creating fake scarcity, which means that people, if you see someone wearing it on TV, you're

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.040
 like, well, there might be only 50 of my local shops, so I'm going to have to get there fast

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040
 and get one.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.160
 At which point they'll make another 200,000. Yeah, but 300,000 different pieces of clothing

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
 in different designs in four months.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.760
 That's crazy. And this is all the fault of one man, one still alive, possibly very litigious

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760
 man.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760
 Is it?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.000
 Well, he might be, I'm about to slag him off.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Let's name some names.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.360
 His name is Emancio Ortega and he is the founder of Zara, the high street shops that are global.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.000
 When he invented Zara, the idea was he wanted fashion to be able to mimic fashion that was

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.760
 being seen in the catwalks at a much quicker rate. There used to be such a long period before

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.680
 anything even resembling what was seen on the catwalks would appear in shops. And he thought,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.360
 what if we just quickly make them the turnaround? We have no name designers. They're all anonymous.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.520
 They work for us in the back rooms and let's get it out within a five week period. That

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.720
 will make us big.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.880
 And then let's just make a few of them. We just constantly create demand for new items

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.280
 and this caught on around the world. So it's this one guy who at one point became the richest

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.960
 man in the world, took over Bill Gates for like a brief second. So he's, he went from

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.880
 poverty to richest man in the world of this idea of fast fashion.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.040
 One guy and one woman as well, Rosalia Mira, who's his wife, who did a lot of the work

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.300
 as well. And because they kind of got together, didn't they? She was working in a clove shop.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.280
 He was a messenger boy and they kind of go, "Can I make it any more obvious?"

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.480
 But yeah, Ortega, he's a really interesting guy, I think, because some of it sounds quite

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.680
 sweet. Like he grew up, he was the son of a railway worker who would move around the

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.440
 whole of Spain working wherever there were jobs. He was really poor as a child. He had

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.780
 only potatoes for some of his meals. And he's very reclusive. He doesn't have a computer.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.160
 He does all of his work like in small groups and just kind of tells people what to do and

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.760
 really doesn't write much down and stuff. But then on the other hand, he's a billionaire.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:35.320
 Well, we made a great new enemy on this show. You're welcome, guys. So it was in this tiny

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.460
 town and he wanted to call the company Zorba initially, but there was a restaurant that

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.360
 was selling beers and so on down the road. Greek food, I imagine. It's more of a Greek

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.160
 than a Spanish name, isn't it? Well, Zorba the Greek. Zorba the Greek. But that's what

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.720
 they were naming it after. But there happened to be two places that wanted to do it in the

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.280
 very same street. And so the restaurant said, "Can you not do that, please?" And so he went

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.880
 fine, but they had the molds for Zorba. And so they quickly just rearranged it into Zara.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.340
 So I guess they used the A twice out of Zorba. I guess that's how that works. And through

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:14.760
 away the B. Well, they like waste, so it doesn't matter. Start as you mean to go on, guys. Stick

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.960
 it in a bin. He's very reclusive. He's been photographed, I think, once by the company.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.960
 The company released one photo of him once in about the year 2000. He is really very,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.240
 very, very private, but he appears to wear only the same items of clothing every day.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.720
 He wears a pair of trousers, a shirt and a jacket. None of which is sold by Zara. No,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.520
 exactly. And it's kind of like that thing, you know how all the tech squillionaires, all

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.440
 their children are growing up playing with simple wooden blocks. And they've never seen

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.520
 a computer and they all go to schools where they don't do any tech stuff. But that also,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.400
 it makes me also think of, do you remember Daniel Radcliffe used to do that after it?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.920
 So when he came out on the West End at the stage door every night, he used to wear the

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.520
 exact same clothes so that the paparazzi couldn't sell a new photo because that photo could

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.040
 have been taken any night of the run. So that was his strategy.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.760
 Is that also why he doesn't seem to have aged over the last 30 years?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.080
 He's decided to freeze himself. Yeah, that's why you don't see many photos. Yeah. Okay,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.280
 I'm just floating his theory. Okay. Because obviously a little of fast fashion is driven

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.960
 by high fashion and by red carpets and things like that. So if you're only allowed to wear

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.720
 one item of clothing on the red carpet for the rest of your life, that would presumably

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.480
 go a long way to what bit of the waiter. Are we going to make people whatever the last

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.960
 thing they were like Sam Smith, they're going to have to wear that kind of rubber thing.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.240
 Yeah, yes. A certain date you just freeze and that's your clothes now. Yeah, like a random

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.760
 bell to just go off on your phone or something. Like today's your time and whatever you're

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.360
 wearing that it's just you know how you they gave us alerts when it was COVID we'd get

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.720
 like these text message alerts and it says it should be a clothing alert. Right, this

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.440
 is you now. This is your look. And it would incentivize people to always look their best

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.960
 because you might get frozen at any time. Yeah, yeah. I'm right now to have worn this

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.280
 hoodie with my own podcast. But I do think we need to make it slightly less socially

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.440
 acceptable to just wait. I just have a friend who wardrobe was just full of clothes with

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.960
 tags on. She was just a shoplifter. Actually, there's security tags. Does she have it on

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:26.840
 her ankle as well? She couldn't leave the house office. It's just socially acceptable

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:33.040
 to just buy stuff. My ex used to work in a clothes shop and the number of times people

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.000
 would come back with an outfit saying yeah, I haven't worn it because it didn't fit and

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 it would be covered in red wine and vomit. Like no, no, we haven't worn it. Honestly,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.800
 we haven't worn it. Yeah, I know it's shameless watching the lies of a hungover person. A

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.880
 lot of this just go back to a lot of this waste is returned items too. So even if you

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.840
 return items pristine, they often can't be resold because the minute you open the packaging,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.960
 well it's not something they can really sell again. So we and our brains they go I'll try

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.680
 it on. I'll send it back and it'll be okay. It's not okay. Most of that does get dumped

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.040
 as well. Yes, exactly. And that's the big problem that no one realizes. So it's exactly

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.480
 that it is literally online ordering. You tried on and that's the wrong sides. That

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.160
 is now going into waste. Yeah, they won't reuse that. It's remarkable as well. I was

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:25.100
 reading about how Zara defines how they can make the fast fashion because it's not just

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.160
 looking at the bigger world of fashion, high end fashion like catwalks and so on. Basically

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.800
 the staff and this is from an article that was about 2012. So I'm talking for, you know,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.920
 this could have changed since then but the way they do it is staff have to monitor by

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.800
 listening carefully to what people are making little comments about. I hate having those

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.080
 zips on the ankles. I wish they would put them up here and if they would collate this

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.800
 stuff and all report back. Did you hear anyone else say that? Yeah, I heard them say that.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.660
 They report that back to head office and then they just start designing clothes according

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.280
 to literally customer feedback within the shop because they come up with so many different

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.680
 designs and then what they do at the big Zara warehouse which is like an air hanger, a New

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.640
 York Times journalist went to visit it. You would see people talking to the Zara's of

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.280
 the world going, "Red pants? Are they wearing red pants? Okay, we're getting reports of

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.080
 red pants here. Great, we're in red pant business now and they would make pants being trousers,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.000
 sorry." Is that for English men over a certain age in the countryside? Going to the Henley

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.840
 Regatta. 14-year-old girls in China, a 60-year-old men at Henley. Zara have really been cracking

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.440
 the regatta market and it's... So if I go into a Zara and be like, "God, I'd love a panda

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.120
 costume." Yeah? Yeah. And if we all did it. If we all did it. Sorry, we're getting a giant

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:50.160
 river otter costume. Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.940
 Ford has just got a patent for a car which can repossess itself if the owner falls behind

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:05.680
 with payments. This is quite a dystopian episode, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.400
 This is just a patent at the moment. Yeah. It may never be billed but it has been granted

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.920
 as they applied for it a couple of years ago and it's just been granted this year. So here's

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.160
 the plan, right? You've got your Ford. Yeah. You think it's safe. You've got it on a payment

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.240
 agreement. Payment agreement. You're doing okay but then you miss a couple of payments.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.080
 A couple of payments, something happens and they write to you and you don't acknowledge

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.360
 it. Maybe you missed the message, whatever, right? But anyway, things steadily get worse

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.160
 for you and your car from this point onwards. Firstly, they just make the car a bit less

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.720
 pleasant to drive. In that, you know, they might disable the music or the air conditioning

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.920
 or the GPS. Some of these things sound a little bit dangerous. At this stage, you might just

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.880
 think it's a glitch, right? Yeah. You're doing a regular thing. It's not especially

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:55.600
 hot. So you don't like music. So fine. So you're all right. But then it'll make an unpleasant

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.740
 beeping sound whenever you get into the car. Okay, well, that's a bit annoying. It sounds

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:04.960
 like the music I might have been listening to anyway. Yeah, your EDM collection is fine.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.400
 So great. Then it stops you using it at certain days or times as in the car won't even function

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.720
 outside, let's say, ordinary working hours. So I think the plan is that you can keep going

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.800
 to your job. So you can afford to catch up with your payments eventually. But you can't

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.480
 I don't know, socialize. And then as a very last resort, it will either drive to a waiting

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.840
 tow truck to be repossessed, like it'll have an asignation without you knowing about it.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.440
 Or if it's worth very little, it'll just drive itself to a scrap yard and say, take me apart.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:40.420
 Drive yourself to Ghana. That'd be good to be one car. That's great. So this is the plan.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.040
 That's amazing. It's incredible. Maybe it'll happen. What's crazy is like this. Why can't

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.880
 technology be used for good? If we can control what cars are used and when they're used,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.880
 what can't we do in the world right now, modal shift, we can't get people out of their cars

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.680
 on to train. So why don't we set these new electronic Wi-Fi connected cars in the future

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.800
 to like, you can be used for 10 hours a week, run out of your 10 hours, it won't work and

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.520
 you'll have to just go to a field and touch some grass, right? Why don't we use this for

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:13.540
 good? They can only take you to the park and ride. But there's got to be a better way to

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.340
 use this technology rather than to just like, make people destitute. Yeah, absolutely. I

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.900
 got one slightly better way of using the technology, the self-driving technologies. So if you've

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.980
 got a really busy road, it's kind of gridlocked almost and everyone's kind of stop, start,

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.220
 stop, start, bad for the environment, bad for everything, right? You can put 5% more

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.460
 cars onto the road, but if they're all driverless and they're all smart and they know exactly

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.520
 how fast to go on which lane to be in, they can stop the gridlock. Okay. Does that make

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.080
 sense? You know what I mean? Yeah. So like the cars will join the real cars and they'll

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.160
 work out how everyone's behaving and they'll move a little bit faster in this lane, a little

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.720
 bit slower in this lane and suddenly all of the traffic jam will stop. Like a dance,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.000
 like a synchronised. Yeah, exactly. I used to work in highways and traffic modelling

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.480
 is mostly nonsense. Well, it's not nonsense, but it's super, it's super vulnerable to change.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.380
 I worked on this one project here and they spent millions modelling how this new road

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.820
 would work and everyone was great. And then there was some crisis and petrol went up like

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:18.980
 2p and the model that's put in the bin. Like the smallest change in the most random thing

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.740
 to do with driving. You've got to put it all in the bin and start again. So a lot of policy

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.820
 and a lot of stuff is done based on these models, but these models are so quickly made

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.640
 and done. But it's true that driver behaviour does cause a huge amount of traffic. So like

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.980
 Rubberneck is a really good example. You're all familiar with people slow down to look

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.780
 at accidents because we're humans. Love it. Or Stonehenge. I'll say it, yeah, but I do

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.900
 that. The A303. Oh, yeah. A303. So you guys are so bad at it, they want to dig a tunnel

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.740
 underneath it. Like you guys are so just, if you won't stop slowing down, we're going

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.300
 to dig underneath it. Every time you're on the A303, you think, God, this wonderful

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.060
 crash must have happened up ahead. And it did happen like 3000 years ago. I feel like

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.660
 I would drive underneath and go, Oh, we're directly underneath. Let's slow down. Yeah,

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.740
 yeah, yeah. Let's feel it. Sense it. Yeah. Funny enough, I worked for the highway agency

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.140
 whilst I was trying to build it. And I'm like, you're never going to get permission to do

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.620
 this guy. It's like a really old build. Did they get it in the end? No, it got stuck in

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.820
 the bin. It's really hard to build tunnels because they're really environmentally unfriendly

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.340
 and expensive. Put on top of that a bloody English heritage site. You've got recipe for

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:31.140
 wasting your money. Yeah. Ford in 2020 applied for a paper to match up passengers with things

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.660
 like Uber's, you know, ride sharing. Anyway, matching up passengers on the cars by smell.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:43.780
 Okay. So you fit a car with sensors. And then if that car smells of vomit and then you smell

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:49.540
 of vomit, then you get that one. Is that right? No, it's I think if you've unticked the vomit

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.420
 box, you don't want to be in the car smelling of vomit. Then you won't be paired up. That's

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.620
 clever. So on a Friday night, 11 o'clock, the pubs are kicking out, really hard to get

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.740
 an Uber. You uncheck the vomit thing and you're the only one who wants to get a vomit taxi.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.940
 And so there's more taxis available. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's more for people with

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:14.300
 things like airborne nut allergies than people that can't smell vomit. But I think there will

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.860
 be advantages for everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Let's say someone's had a peanut in the car and it

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.460
 will be very dangerous for you if you've got a very, very, very bad nut allergy to get

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.700
 into that car. So you can sense peanuts. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to think what other smells

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:34.580
 can be deadly that are important for this patent. Mustard gas. Yes. That's not good.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:40.500
 On the smell thing, there was a guy called Henry Cyril Padgett. He was the fifth Marquis

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:47.580
 of Bath. And he was really famous because he had gotten inheritance in 1904, which was

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:53.220
 equivalent to 30 million pounds per year. And after about five or 10 years, he'd accumulated

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.420
 debts of about half a million. And that's 60 million in current money, because he just

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:04.900
 spent it on everything. And he modified his car so that his exhaust pipe sprayed perfume.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.140
 So wherever he went, there would be a nice little smell of like someone's vaping past

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.300
 you or something. Lovely. I think it's quite selfless because I mean, it's his car. Yeah,

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.500
 it's actually a benefit that he will never really feel himself. Well, I think what happened

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.140
 was he thought that all the cars at the time were a bit smelly. I'm going to do something

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.660
 a bit different. I feel like he's a climate change denier. And he's like, what climate

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:37.300
 change? What are you talking about? This is how profligate he was. He was once a theatre

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.420
 and someone had stolen some of his jewellery. And so he needed to get it back. So he enlisted

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.980
 the help of Arthur Conan Doyle to try and find the jewels. And he paid Conan Doyle to

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.580
 try and solve the case. Brilliant. God, that's great. Isn't that great? I do like people

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.060
 who spend money well. It's a really good way to spend your money. Not this fast fashion

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.420
 nonsense like 5000 shirts or do you want to hire Luther?

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:07.260
 Conan Doyle will come up with an incredibly elaborate mechanism by which it would have

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.380
 been done. He actually that he actually because he was so famous as writing the Sherlock Holmes

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.740
 books, people used to come to him with mysteries and ask him to solve them. And obviously they're

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.420
 offering him money and stuff. And he solved a few. And he used two methods, didn't he?

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.860
 One was real detective science. And the other was spiritualism. So he would get seances

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.700
 and he would try and track things down by just the feeling of where it might be. And

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.840
 did he keep two columns of success and failure? Which method worked better? I think he's

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:44.260
 got wins on both. Yeah, I wonder if that happens today. You know, if like Dan Brown has people

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:50.620
 getting in contact with him about solving. You'd get in ranking. Yeah, crime. P. D. James.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:58.300
 Richard Osmond. Richard Osmond. Yeah. Your nan goes missing. Richard. Richard in.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:05.100
 Do you want to hear something, a theory about cup holders? Okay. I was looking into. That's

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.480
 correct answer. I was looking into who developed all the different bits of a car and when they

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.980
 came in, you know, cup holders came in properly in about the 80s, I think they've been done

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.760
 since the 50s, but they weren't very good. If you were driving, you couldn't really properly

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.840
 stash a drink in a drink from a while driving. So like the decent ones came in in the 80s.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.880
 Just a quick aside, the car with the most cup holders is apparently the 2019 Subaru Ascent.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:36.760
 Any guesses? 16. Like five. 12. 19. Oh my God. 19 cup holders. We're at the final three

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:44.660
 that I wasn't thinking of. No. So, okay. Why do we like cup holders? There is a theory

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.020
 by a French scholar. Because you can keep your change in them. Well, yeah, that's kind

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.940
 of I've never put a cup in my cup holder. And the keys and the car keys. Yeah, yeah.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.480
 Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here's a theory from this is printed in the Toronto Star French born

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:05.000
 scholar and marketer G Clotaire Rapaye, who argues that warm drinks as we drive a replacement

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.560
 for mother's milk. He says, I see. He says, what was the key element of safety when you

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.840
 were a child? It was that your mother fed you and there was warm liquid. Yeah. That's

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.720
 why cup holders absolutely crucial. I fit in my cup holder with a nipple. Yeah. And

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:27.000
 I, it's very comforting when I try. I'm sure we must have said this, but there was a theory

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.740
 that in McDonald's, the when you're slurping your milkshake, they make it the exact consistency.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.900
 So the amount that you slurp is the same amount that you would like to impress. Is that why

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.780
 it's so thick? Wow. So you have to suck as hard as you did. I mean, I don't think it's

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:49.180
 true. There was a theory about that. Beautiful. Beautiful theory. I mean, I don't like milk

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.400
 at all. No, anything to do with milk. I don't like it. I even if like, if you give me a

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.000
 black tea and you use a spoon to stir it, that's been in a milky cup, I swear I can, I can

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.160
 taste, I can't stand milk. And I'm wondering now if that just says something about possibly

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 my relationship with my mother. This is, well, I think it says everything. Yeah. I have the

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:17.820
 exact opposite. So last night you're still on the move. Yeah. I've been wondering for

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:26.660
 nine years who that woman is. Yeah, I woke up two AM last night off the back of having

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.000
 a dream about drinking some milk, got out of bed and I went downstairs and I had a glass

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.880
 of milk. A whole glass of milk. Yeah, two AM off the back of a dream that made me just

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.100
 salivate so much for it. I wonder if your body was craving it for something like you

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.940
 haven't had enough calcium in your diet. And also vitamin D, right? And it's been very

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:54.740
 gloomy in the UK recently. Yeah. Yeah. You can get even even other things than milk,

00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:01.280
 which is vile in efficacy and smells. I would love to have a quite a fancy glass of milk

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:06.960
 lorax. I think I'm on the table. Once you think about it. Yeah. Yeah. What are we talking

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:14.180
 about? Carls. Carls. Have you heard of William Suchiti? No. So William Suchiti is a Zimbabwean

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:21.840
 born British entrepreneur. And he has invented something called cargo. And this was possibly

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:27.180
 going to be the future where they're like little dog sized cars that go round and deliver

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.660
 things to people's houses. Okay. And they're autonomous like cars. So you order your milk,

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.260
 let's say you've done fancy a glass of milk. Yeah. And then he puts in his order and then

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:41.220
 Tesco puts one in a little cargo and it drives it all the way around. Okay. Yeah. He's basically

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.980
 going against the Teslas and the Googles as the big, you know, who's going to be the big

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:52.240
 person who does this in the future. And this guy, the first thing he invented was an intelligent

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:59.120
 robot librarian. Cool. Who doesn't want one of those who was capable of holding a conversation

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.800
 or taking commands and would tell you where the books are that you want. So you say, oh,

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.280
 you know what, I really like this Richard Osman book. What else would I like? And they're

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.880
 like, oh, well, there's a Richard Coles book that's just down here. Come and follow me.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.840
 And it would kind of drive around and take you to the book. I was sort of picturing an

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:19.020
 anti-Siri where you'd say like, Hey, Siri, and it's just, shh.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:24.520
 This guy also invented an autonomous penguin that they use at Milton Keynes University Hospital.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.580
 Cool. And it kind of takes the medicine round to wherever you need it. So if you need certain

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.900
 medicine in a state of ward, this little penguin will drive around and drive around and take

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.300
 your medicine. Is it for children's wards? Or just, you know what, it's actually for

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:41.100
 all wards, but I think, you know, it helps that it is good for children as well. Because

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:49.240
 you don't want like this evil sort of. Yeah, two 1000 liquid metal. And the other interesting

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:56.080
 thing I found about Sotiti is that in 2023 he rescued a zebra from Ukraine and he currently

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:05.560
 keeps it in his garden in Norfolk. Wow. Using technology for good, rather than evil. I think

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.040
 those cargos do sound like a very good idea because it's all about the taking the sort

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.780
 of emissions out of the last mile of delivery, isn't it? And that's where a lot of, you

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.060
 know, that's where you can really make efficiencies and, you know, driving vans around all the

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.020
 place, but they are going to need to be quite well defended. As in the number of packages

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.220
 that get mixed from doorsteps, they will need to be. But how would you, what would you say,

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.380
 like a flamethrower? I'd fit a flamethrower. I'd fit. So it would be a sliding scale like

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.860
 the Ford, like a bit of interference. It just gives you a stern verbal warning. Do you think

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:47.060
 that we should get William Sotiti to watch "Robot Wars" perhaps? Yes. A little spiked.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:51.720
 Okay. And it's time for fact number three. And that is James. Okay. My fact this week

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.080
 is that the healthiest way to eat broccoli is to stir fry it. After chopping it into

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.920
 two millimeter pieces and leaving it to stand for an hour and a half. Yeah, we all know

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:08.060
 that. Is that how you do yours? Every day. That's what it says in your "Hello Fresh".

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:15.460
 Christ, that's a difficult question. So this is because they have a compound called sulforaphane.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:21.020
 Sulforaphane is really hard to get at. You can get it quite well if you eat it raw, but

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.060
 as soon as you start cooking broccoli, it kind of degenerates and you don't get as much.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.540
 You still get it, but you don't get quite as much. And there was some Chinese researchers

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.160
 in the Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry and they tried loads of different ways of

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.680
 cooking broccoli, see which ways gets the most sulforaphane, and they found this way,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.880
 you know, they chopped it into tiny, tiny pieces because actually it's almost a defense

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.600
 for the broccoli. It's trying to stop herbivores from eating it. And so it puts this chemical

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.600
 out to stop like cows from eating it. Nice try, idiot. You're in my kitchen. There's

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.600
 no way you're not going to eat it. Yeah. So like the way to get this out is to kind

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.340
 of macerate it or chop it up or whatever. So that's why you do the small chopping.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.340
 All right.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.420
 And then if you leave it for a long time, it helps the sulforaphane to come out and

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.420
 then you do a quick stir fry. But it's two mil... I gotta say, it feels a bit like you'll

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.660
 have a kind of mint of broccoli. And I like the crunch of a floret.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.660
 Do you?

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.700
 A bit like cauliflower rice, I imagine it would be.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.700
 Which I hate.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:25.740
 I've got a testimony to do with sulforaphane, because I used to have really bad tendinitis

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.760
 in my knees, right? Really bad. And unfortunately, when you're not an athlete, people don't care

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:37.000
 when your joints hurt. Get over it, Athena. And then at the same time, years ago, became

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.920
 apparent that sulforaphane was good for your joints. And I was like, it can't hurt. So

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.400
 I started having kale and broccoli smoothies, right?

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.940
 Because I was like, they were trying to figure out how to extract the sulforaphane into like

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.860
 a tablet. And I was like, I haven't got time to wait for this, you know? And I honestly,

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.320
 after about a few weeks, if not months, of eating just loads of broccoli and having loads

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.860
 of broccoli and kale smoothies, I'm no word for like, my tendinitis cleared up.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.860
 Really?

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.700
 Absolutely, yeah. This is anecdotal. It wasn't a scientific study. So I got off the running

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.100
 treadmill and off the pavement and started cycling and all this kind of stuff. But after

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.860
 a few weeks and months, the tendinitis cleared up and I've not had it since.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.860
 Okay.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.860
 That's really interesting.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.700
 Would a skeptic say placebo for that, do you think?

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:28.540
 Well, you know what? Skeptics, right? Skeptics just need to get on board the Athena train.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.540
 Yeah.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.700
 And that's my response to all skeptics on anything they say.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.540
 Like, get on board the Athena train.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.540
 The sulforaphane definitely does work.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.620
 Oh, no, I'm just wondering the method of the smoothie, whether or not that.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:42.740
 Well, it depends. If you're having a fair bit. So there are pills these days, which you'll

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.940
 be glad to know Athena, they completed the process, they made the pills.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.940
 Oh, what a relief.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.380
 Yeah. And the pills, in fact, the pills might be even more effective than broccoli and kale

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.020
 smoothies. I don't know how much you were having. I mean, it sounds like a fair bit.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.660
 I was, honestly, I would buy like three or four florets a week and I'd get through them

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.100
 and either steam it or having my smoothie because my knees, I was in agony. I couldn't

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.580
 watch a film. I couldn't go to the theater because every time my knees were bent for more

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:11.320
 than like a minute, they would just be on fire. So I had, yeah, I'd say, and yeah, three

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.900
 or four florets every week. So a lot, a lot.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.700
 That is a lot. That absolutely is a lot. These pills are equivalent to eating five kilos

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.940
 of broccoli every day.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:26.380
 Wow. That's possibly more. But the other thing is that you can overdo it like with anything,

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.700
 right? And if you have too much sulforaphane, you are supposedly at risk of hyperthyroidism,

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:37.300
 which will make you tired and, yeah, well, I don't need six kilos of broccoli a day.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.660
 It's just balanced diet. It's like what we always say, but I mean, it's good stuff.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:51.020
 My favorite broccoli is Cubby Broccoli. Hang on though. Hang on though. There's a really

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.780
 interesting fact about Cubby Broccoli. Cubby Broccoli was the producer of the James Bond

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:59.900
 movies. The broccoli family still produced them to this day. Cubby Broccoli in an interview

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:09.300
 that he gave in the 1980s to LA Times made the claim that broccoli, the vegetable is named

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:18.620
 after him. He's lying. Okay. The broccoli family. So he says that his father, who is

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.660
 called Giovanni and his brother, Giovanni's brother, they immigrated to Long Island from

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:30.380
 Calabria at the turn of the 20th century. He says, yeah, in Italy, sorry. He says that

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:35.700
 that broccoli family were descended from the Broccolis of Carrera, who were the first

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:42.340
 to cross cauliflower and rub to produce the broccoli. Therefore, broccoli is named after

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.060
 him, not vice versa. When people say, are you named after the vegetable? Pretty good.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.980
 That sounds very convincing. I have to say. It was an Italian thing. Like the first farmers

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.220
 to grow broccoli, the modern broccoli that we consider broccoli today were in the south

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.780
 of Italy. It's definitely a manmade thing. That's from the cabbage family, but they

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:05.420
 were bred that way, right? Yeah. And it was invented in Italy. I think possibly just named

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.540
 because it's Italian for shoots or something. Yeah. That's the etymology, isn't it? And

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.780
 it's the same word. It's the same as brooch. Brooch and broccoli have the same etymological

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:20.340
 root. Yeah. I know the Romans had a version of broccoli, but I don't think they had a

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.180
 lovely classic green broccoli. Well, one thing they definitely didn't have is tender

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:29.980
 stem broccoli. Is that what we've got? So tender stem broccoli is where it's quite a long stem

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.780
 and then there's little broccoli florets on the top. And you can eat the whole thing.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.340
 It's pot broccoli. Oh, it's delicious, guys. It's brilliant. But this is one of the most

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:43.540
 amazing things I've ever found. Tender stem broccoli was invented about 10 years ago by

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:51.380
 a committee in Japan and it's a registered trademark. What? Isn't it amazing? Originally

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.020
 they called it aspiration when they invented it. Because it looks like an asparagus. Exactly.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.420
 That's where they got it from. And yeah, they would just have this session where a load

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.500
 of people at the Sokata Seed Incorporation in Yokohama sat around the table and went,

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.100
 you know what we should do? We should make broccoli where you can eat the whole thing.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:12.540
 How would we do that? Well, what if we mixed it with Chinese kale? Okay, let's try it.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.700
 And they tried it. And now they patent the seeds and they sell the seeds around the world.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.940
 Are you saying actually 10 years? About 10 years. In the last 20 years for sure. But

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.380
 you're saying I couldn't have seen in the millennium with a nice dish of tender stem broccoli.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:30.220
 It would have been close. It was around that time when they started coming in. I never

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.440
 saw these because they were inexpensive. I see you're like, oh, I'm doing well in the

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.740
 world now that I've been introduced to a new broccoli. It's utterly bizarre. And they

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:43.780
 called them aspiration and they tried to sell them like that. And then Debbie Nucci, who

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:49.380
 is the wife of the company's chief operating officer, she came up with the name Broccolini

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.860
 and that's what they called in America. And then it was Marks and Spencer started to call

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:59.700
 in them tender stem in the UK. Wow. So let me get this right. You're saying you think

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.900
 that's more amazing than the fact that the James Bond producer? Well, that's not true

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:13.580
 what you said. The bit that I said is verifiably true. That's milk shake nipple. That's not

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.460
 going to become a thing that my name is now milk shake nipple but Donald's man. It's

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:25.580
 a cat fits. If the nipple fits, they love broccoli in Japan, though, don't they? They

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:30.100
 like to the point. Yeah. Yeah. So to the point where kids particularly love it and there's

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.700
 a story which is Pixar, you know, the movie inside out that they did. There's a scene

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:39.660
 in that where it was a movie about emotions. It was a real kind of poignant. They had characters

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.660
 like one of them was sad and one of them was angry. It was all in one person's head. Yeah,

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.780
 exactly. And in it, there's a scene where they eat broccoli and they go. It's yucky

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.920
 or whatever. And they swap that. They swap that out for the Japanese edition because

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.900
 broccoli is loved by kids there. So they put it instead. They put in stairs. They don't

00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:01.340
 like milk, do they? I think famously in Japan. That wouldn't go down well in my house. Turn

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:10.100
 it off. We're done. Green peppers. Green peppers. Yeah, that's what they replace it with. But

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:16.420
 isn't there like a substance that makes green vegetables taste horrible to kids? And it's

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:21.220
 in Brussels sprouts and things like that. It's really bitter, right? Yeah. Yeah. So some

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:25.620
 people, so it happens to lots of children and I think children have extra taste buds.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:31.100
 But there is a gene, which I have written down, which is called TAS2R38. And that lets

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.260
 you taste bitterness. And there's a variant of that gene. And if you get two versions

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.780
 of one particular variant, then your whole life, not just when you're a child, you experience

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.980
 all the Brassica family as being unbelievably foul and bitter and horrible. It's really

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:50.220
 interesting. My wife, when she was pregnant, she craved broccoli and tender stem. And then

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.380
 after about a month, she couldn't be in the same room as it. But didn't have the hearts

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.820
 tell me because I started making a loads of things with broccoli in it because she was

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.020
 like, oh yeah, I really want broccoli. I'm like, great, I'll make broccoli soup. I'll

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.220
 make broccoli this, broccoli that. And then she just found it so disgusting she couldn't

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:11.300
 be near it. Maybe that was the response. Here's your broccoli cake, darling, happy birthday.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:19.100
 You're absolutely right. It's amazing how it can quickly turn. Broccoli everything here.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.780
 It could have been more of a comment on my cooking than anything else. It's a two minute

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:29.820
 bit of pieces darling. I made it exactly as I told me to. Oh, this is a cool thing. This

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:35.940
 is slightly tangential. I hope you don't mind. Have you heard of epicuticular wax?

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:41.820
 No. Right. This is a wax that covers lots of vegetables, right? That is water repellent

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.500
 and loads and loads of vegetables, including broccoli, have epicuticular naturally or we

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.780
 are doing naturally. So like epidermis is the top layer of skin and cuticular the cuticles.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:57.860
 So it's it's the surface layer. And it's it's to protect the plant from water getting in

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:01.780
 from outside. Yeah. And all the rubbish that might be in external water, matter of bacteria

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.800
 and it might be dangerous. There might be molds, all of that. And this is why, you know,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:13.260
 when you wet kale, you know, when you go out wet some kale. Yeah, we all go out on kale

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:18.100
 letting expeditions. But you might rinse some kale before cooking it in the water just seems

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:22.860
 to stick on the surface. Droplets. Yeah, it splashes. It makes a mess. Water goes everywhere.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:28.980
 It literally is like it's alive and it's rejecting water. Well, it is and it is and it's because

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:34.260
 of epicuticular wax. And it's why when you boil kale, sometimes it leaves a like a ring

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:40.740
 ring or the bathtub. It's like water off a duck's back. Water off kale's epicuticular

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:48.740
 wax. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And it's, it's super hydrophobic in some plants. It feels like you

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.020
 know what really hydrophobic things we tend to use them as lubricants like oil and stuff

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:59.260
 like that, right? Yeah. Feels like you could use this kale as a lubricant. It's gonna struggle

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:05.460
 to sell it now. Special vegan section of ads on itself. Yeah, I think that's all right.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.740
 You're right. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't thinking sexual. I was thinking, oh, please.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:16.540
 I said lubricant and sex never. I just, what? Wow. How did you get there? James says lubricant.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:30.620
 He thinks of complicated machine tool processes. Go back to your milkshake.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:35.280
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.380
 is that last year on December 23rd, a hospital in Doncaster accidentally sent a text message

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:47.260
 to thousands of its patients informing them that they had an aggressive terminal disease.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:52.180
 What they'd meant to send was a message reading, Merry Christmas and have a happy new year.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:41:00.740
 So this is a very unfortunate moment. And I should say that while obviously it's a,

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:07.380
 it's in theory a hilarious cock up. This caused chaos. Yeah. This caused horrible, horrible

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.440
 moments for people in Doncaster and the center of which the texts went out from. There's

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.420
 about 8,000 people sign there. So this was their mailing list basically through text

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.700
 messaging. Some of them had had tests. Some of them had tests. Some of them were rating

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.580
 on results. Some of them were, there was a lady who ran out of her house and she ran

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.500
 around the corner because she was so petrified and she saw six people in the street all out

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.220
 there as well going, I've just been. So everyone, it was just like a national. You know what

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:37.020
 it reminds me of? Do you remember that Hawaiian? Yeah. If one got a text message saying there's

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:41.260
 a nuclear missile coming to Hawaii. Exactly. And everyone believed it for about 15 minutes.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:46.220
 But I think some people were going to shelters and the guy who had sent the message had done

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:51.540
 it before as well. I think it was a second offense. Twice before he'd mistook. But he's

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:57.580
 like, it's okay. I'm just going to move to Doncaster. We'll never have this problem again.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.580
 Oh yeah. What happened with that was that a call had came in to do a test for a missile

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.220
 launch and the guy who pressed the button, there's two buttons that you can press. One

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:11.420
 that says test missile alert and then missile alert. Like a drop down menu. Yeah. Because

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.860
 they're alphabetically so close to each other. It's not like he picked the wrong thing. He

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.700
 picked missile alert because he was overhearing the conversation and he said what happened

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.940
 was that the guy who had the person on the phone saying, this is a test, this is a test

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:28.140
 of whatever wording it was, said that to the to the phone that was on the ear of the guy

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:33.140
 receiving it. And then he put it on to speakerphone. So the man who pressed the button didn't

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:38.740
 hear the, this is a test, just heard the next bit and was clearly a paranoid guy. So he

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.980
 just pressed the button. So it wasn't only text messages. It was also the TVs. It came

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.340
 on the TV. It came over the radio. He's a paranoid guy, but maybe he was just doing

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:51.580
 his job. Well, he was doing his job, but he'd done it wrong three times in total. So it

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.420
 they had to let him go. It was just an amusing that each time it was a music thing that made

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:03.060
 him stop hearing this is a test. Yeah. Like siren just drives. There was a school there

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:07.900
 in Hawaii where the students, they ran out after hearing all the, all the text messages

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:12.860
 on on TV and they ran to the fallout shelters built specifically for missiles and so on

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.500
 got there, but they were locked. So they had to run back into the school. So they couldn't

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.060
 even use the thing built for them to do it. And there were people were reporting people

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.180
 driving a hundred miles an hour down the road, desperately trying to get home. It was an

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:29.700
 amazing thing. I have a book, by the way, which is my favorite novel of recent years

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:35.300
 I've read by Jim Carrey, my, you know, the comedian. And the cover of it is his face.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.980
 It's done a bit artistically, but it's his face. And Jim Carrey was writing that book

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:44.500
 while that missile was launched in Hawaii. And he was doing FaceTime with his assistant

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.340
 who called him up saying, we have minutes to live. And she accidentally took a screen

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:54.820
 grab the second his face. Like this is going to be a billion. She was there as well. So

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.020
 I think she had minutes to make that money. You want to see what a guy with one of the

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:03.060
 funniest faces in the world does. He was in the mask, right? So as soon as they told

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:13.140
 him, his eyes would pop out. You've got four minutes to make the funniest face. Get Carrey,

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.460
 Rowan Atkinson, a few others and just workshop it. This isn't really about systems and practical

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.540
 because I've had lots of jobs. I used to do like business development, right? She'd

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.860
 go into companies and they would have a process for doing things. And you'd say, well, this

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.980
 process works and doesn't work for these reasons. So this is a really good example of it's

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:31.580
 not actually that guy's fault, professing the nuclear test button. It's the process.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:35.220
 So you know, in movies in America, there's this mad process they've got to do to like

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:40.660
 actually send the bombs. They've got to read codes. They've got to do dances. They've got

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:45.340
 to play charades. They've got to complete the game of mouse trap. Exactly. You know those

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:50.220
 games where you've got like a metal wire. And you've got to take something over without

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.740
 making something, making noise or whatever. And you've got to take operation. But the

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.860
 whole point of that is so you don't just like start firing missiles by accident. It is unequivocal.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:04.060
 This is what we want you to do. Having a, oh, I just want to put you on speaker. There's

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:08.140
 like a three second delay. Only one person's responsible. There's a drop down list. These

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:12.540
 are all things. If I was going into that office, I'd be like, yeah, you need to change your

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.540
 process. That mistake shouldn't have happened with the Doncaster thing. That's a process

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.540
 thing.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.620
 There used to be, there was an idea, a theory by someone and I forgive me, I can't remember

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.100
 who it was, but they said that they should put the nuclear codes inside a person. And

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.820
 that person should be with the president at all times. Yes. So if the president ever needed

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.780
 to send a nuke, they would have to kill that person and suddenly it becomes more real for

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.260
 the president. He's not just pressing any old button. The president has to literally

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:47.060
 stab the guy and I don't think it would be the president. Because the idea is that then

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:51.300
 the president who's making that decision has to make a more immediate decision before he

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.300
 can just press it.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.300
 There are lots.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.300
 There are lots.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.300
 There are lots.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.300
 The giant river otter.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.300
 With the president at all times.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.620
 Because the president's got to make a lot of life and death decisions.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.580
 And who applies for that job as well? Like, who come to go, honey, you got to grow a gig.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.580
 I'm working with the president.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:11.140
 You might, you know, we've never had a nuclear war break out. You will probably just serve

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.140
 your time.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.020
 In theory, you could just sit around doing nothing for 30 years and then get to go wherever

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.020
 the president goes.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.020
 You'll see amazing rooms.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.020
 Oh my God, this is a great thing.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.820
 You probably can't put on too much weight because then he would be more difficult for

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.820
 stab you.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.820
 Absolutely.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:25.820
 Rules.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.820
 Yeah.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.820
 You've got to have a big tattoo of cut here.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:28.820
 Cut here.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.820
 A little scissor light inserted on you.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.820
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.820
 That's a bit stressful, but you know.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:37.220
 But then wouldn't the sort of the enemy try and kidnap you and get the codes out of your

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.220
 chest as well?

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.220
 Oh yeah, that is true.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.220
 Don't you become a...

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.220
 As we know who the person is...

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.660
 You would probably have to have about 10 people, all of whom were with the president, but only

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.060
 the president knows which one it is.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.060
 Oh wow, yes.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.060
 That's a great idea.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.060
 Yeah.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.060
 Yeah.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.060
 So you've all got the tattoo.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.060
 Yeah.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.060
 But maybe everyone in America has one.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.060
 And...

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.060
 It's getting complicated, isn't it?

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.400
 It's getting harder to...

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.020
 Just on text messages, this text message is meant to say, "Merry Christmas and have a

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.020
 happy new year."

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.020
 Yeah.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.020
 And that's very apt.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.020
 It is.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.020
 Because the first ever text message said, "You have an aggressive terminal..."

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.020
 No, it said...

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020
 It was a merry Christmas.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.020
 It was a merry Christmas message.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.020
 Yeah, that's great.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.260
 It was sent by a man called Neil Papworth.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.500
 I think it was in the...

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.860
 It was in 1992, on the 3rd of December.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.860
 There we go.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.860
 But imagine getting the first ever text message.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.860
 And it was, like, 3rd of December a bit early.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.860
 Yeah.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.860
 That's the thing.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.860
 Vodafone were having the Christmas party on the 3rd of December.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.860
 Vodafone were having a party.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.620
 I believe to celebrate the sending of the first ever text message.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:35.420
 So this guy, Papworth, sent the message to the head of Vodafone, or Richard Jarvis, who

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.820
 was a big week at Vodafone.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.020
 I believe it was a party partly to celebrate this technology happening.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:45.660
 And he had to text it from a computer, because phones at the time didn't have the capacity

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.660
 to text.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.660
 Yeah.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.900
 But the phone that Richard Jarvis received it on weighed two kilos.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:57.220
 And that's about, I think, 12 modern iPhones, as in it just reminds you of what phones have

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.180
 been like in very, very living memory.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.540
 There's a guy called Brian Moore.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.780
 He's designed a device that won't let you type the word "lol" unless it has actually

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.020
 detected you laughing out loud.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.900
 That's a good idea, that, isn't it?

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.900
 That's great.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:16.500
 With the iText hat, when I am laughing, but I would never send lol, even if I'm really

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.500
 laughing out loud.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.500
 No.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.500
 That would be "ha ha".

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:24.620
 I do "ha ha ha ha" to be like, you're like, kind of, I'm laughing a lot.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:28.700
 I do "wa ha ha ha ha" but I am a villain.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.780
 But I think you would be able to program it so it wouldn't let you say "ha ha" unless

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.140
 you were laughing out loud.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:41.420
 And it also doesn't let you write "ruffle" unless you're actually rolling on the floor.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.820
 What about pissing myself laughing?

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:47.220
 Then moisture sensors, wow, insert.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.620
 Laughing my ass off.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:56.380
 Okay, the fastest ever text message, this is just a little weird fun record, okay.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.580
 Like just KK.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.620
 So there's a specific message which you have to send for this record.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.620
 Right.

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.620
 Do we know what it is?

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.620
 We do.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.540
 I'll tell you the record first, right?

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.660
 So this was broken, it may have been re-broken since, but it was 2010, British woman Melissa

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.380
 Thompson, she sent this message.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:17.140
 It's 26 words and she managed it in 25.94 seconds.

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.140
 Okay.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.140
 That's pretty good.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.140
 It's all right.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.660
 It doesn't sound, yeah, second word sounds quite beatable though, doesn't it?

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.380
 Here's the message.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:30.540
 The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serra, Salmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.260
 freshwater fish in the world.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.620
 In reality, they seldom attack a human.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.620
 Lol.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.020
 So that's what she managed in 25 seconds.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.540
 Okay, that is impressive.

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.660
 It's a predictive text.

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.300
 I imagine piranhas not necessarily going to come up.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:52.380
 I would say the name of the species, because I have actually never heard those words before.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.740
 She would learn them beforehand, I guess.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.660
 I think so, yeah, because it's the sentence you'd know.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:01.740
 And it's a real Fosbury flopper though, Melissa's record, because 2004, the same record with

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:07.740
 the same sentence was broken by a Sussex man called James Trussler, and he took 67 seconds

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.900
 to do it, and she took under 26 seconds to do it.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.900
 Wow.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.900
 Did she have a special technique?

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:13.900
 Oh, I don't know.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.900
 I don't know if it's like Fosbury, yeah, yeah.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.780
 But it's a huge difference.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.780
 Yes.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:22.620
 Maybe she was the first person to ever use her thumb rather than typing with her ridden

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.620
 next fingers.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.220
 All right, you know the old lockers, you have to press each button three times.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:28.220
 A, B, C.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.220
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.220
 All that.

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.220
 So, yeah, that's amazing.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.500
 Good for whoever that was.

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.820
 And good for if you're stuck with a piranha as well.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.820
 Yeah.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.820
 Because they sell them to attack a human.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.820
 Ah.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.820
 I think I think about texting.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.820
 Yeah.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.820
 It was so profitable.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:45.820
 Oh.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.820
 When it cost, I mean--

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.820
 It's like 10p a text, wasn't it?

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.700
 We're all of a nature to remember 10p texts.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:50.700
 Yeah.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.500
 It didn't cost 10p to send that data.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.500
 Doesn't feel like it.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.500
 Doesn't feel like it did.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.820
 And so I did a little looking into it, and basically the profits were unbelievably huge

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.020
 for mobile phone firms.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.100
 People were sending like a billion, weren't they?

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.740
 Like the world was sending--

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:09.100
 And you'd get on your plan, sorry for any younger listeners, but you'd get a certain

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:13.940
 number of minutes and maybe 200 texts a month, or 500 texts a month, and you'd get right

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.540
 up to the wire of how many texts you were allowed to send because then it was charging

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.780
 you 10p a minute.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:23.820
 Anyway, in 2001 it cost 10p, like you said, James, which was 128 bytes of data for 160

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.220
 characters, right?

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:30.380
 The Guardian calculated that if it was charged at that rate, buying a standard music CD would

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.380
 cost £60,000.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.500
 Oh my god.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.500
 Yeah.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.580
 The text message was just banality, right?

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.020
 It wasn't even like-- it wasn't 10p worth of information.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.020
 It was mostly flirting.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:47.540
 Well, mine were all about piranhas and stuff.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.900
 I was wondering how old WhatsApp was.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.900
 All right.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.900
 I'm going to guess this.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.780
 I must say I don't know the answer, but Dan's got his laptop so you can check.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.780
 I can check.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.780
 Yeah.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.780
 I guess first, I think now.

00:51:58.780 --> 00:51:59.780
 I think eight years old.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:00.780
 Nice.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.780
 So that's what, 2015?

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.780
 Yeah.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.780
 Because James got us earlier with the 10 to stand broccoli, right?

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.780
 Yeah.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.780
 Like it's invented 20 years ago.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.780
 So I'm going to guess 1492.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.780
 Ah.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.780
 Like it's actually--

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.900
 You're not closer, but you're closer to what I'm going to say.

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:14.900
 Okay.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.300
 So first of all, Dan, what was the answer?

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.900
 Well, is it older or younger than broccoli?

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:19.900
 Broccoli.

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:23.820
 Because I think broccoli and I reckon actually came in around the turn of the millennium

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:24.820
 really.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:25.820
 Okay.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.180
 So it must be younger than that.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.180
 Yeah.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.180
 I don't know.

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.180
 Yes, it is.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.180
 Yeah.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.180
 Go on.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.180
 2009.

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.180
 2009.

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.180
 Okay.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.180
 Well, I found a WhatsApp from 1908.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.180
 This is what I just thought.

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:43.140
 I'd go in the newspaper archives and search for WhatsApp and see what came up.

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:47.700
 And this was from the Mass on Telegraph of the 26th of September, 1908.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:52.300
 And it was about someone being sued for breaking up an engagement.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:56.300
 And this was the first time that had ever happened in Albany, in Georgia.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.540
 And it was a businessman called Jay E. Sapp.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.700
 And he had teamed up with a guy called Mr. Watt.

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:05.580
 And they owned a hardware shop in Georgia called WattSapp.

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.580
 Get out.

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.580
 Isn't that amazing?

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.580
 Get out.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:14.500
 The WattSapp hardware store existed for a small amount of time in 1908 in Albany, Georgia.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.500
 Wow.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.820
 And the proprietor was going around breaking up engagements.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.140
 Well, that's what WattSapp is used for.

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:26.420
 In many, in many ways, just couples have an argument.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.420
 Yeah.

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.420
 Yeah.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.420
 Okay.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.420
 That's it.

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.420
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.900

 But don't come to me.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:48.660
 I don't know.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.660
 I think.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:50.660

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.300
 How long's it been going now?

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.300
 Oh, we're on episode five.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.300
 Episode five?

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.860
 The last one was about a friend of ours who got the snip.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:11.860
 Wow.

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:12.860
 Yeah, right?

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:13.860
 It was way too enthusiastic.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.060
 Your kids must be stressful, man.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.060
 Yeah.

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.060
 That sounds good.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.060
 Yeah.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.060
 I hadn't thought of that.

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.060
 But it's called "Why Does My Child Hate Me?"

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.860
 It's about kids and how they're the problem, not us.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.860
 We're brilliant.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:25.860
 So check that out.

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.860
 These kids are nuts.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:27.860
 Yeah.

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.260
 Otherwise, we'll be back again next week.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.260
 We'll see you then.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:31.760
 Goodbye.
