00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. I'm quickly here

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,640
 to introduce you to our special guest this week and that is Athena Cablenu. Now you'll

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,120
 remember Athena, she's been on the fish a couple of times but one interesting new thing

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,040
 to say about her is she has a new podcast. Her podcast is called Why Does My Child Hate

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,200
 Me? It's absolutely amazing. I think she got the name from reading my mind at 6.30 this

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,680
 morning but it's a brilliant podcast. It's all about how we as parents are absolutely

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,320
 amazing and it is the children who are wrong. It's so good and you should definitely check

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,680
 that out. If you want to hear any more from Athena you can get her on social media on

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,920
 Twitter and Instagram. Both of those places she can be found at Athena Cablenu and just

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,560
 so you know how to spell her surname it's K-U-G-B-L-E-N-U. Not much more to say except we do have

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,280
 a live show coming up. It's at the British Library. That's sold out but you can get

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,160
 streaming tickets so if you want to know more about that go to No Such Thing As A Fish dot

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,840
 com and that's also the place to go if you want to learn about Club Fish, a place where

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
 you get ad free episodes, loads of extra bonus stuff and also you get to hear about the live

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,200
 shows first. For instance the British Library show almost sold out from just the people

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,160
 who listen to Club Fish. There was only a few tickets left for those who heard about

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,260
 it on the Friday so it's definitely a good place to go if you want to hear all of our

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,600
 news first. Anyway I really hope you enjoy this week's show. I hope all is good with

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:48,400
 you. Enjoy our facts with Athena and on with the podcast.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,760
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,320
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Athena Cablanu and once again we have gathered

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,680
 around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,640
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Athena.

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:23,660
 My fact this week is 15 million clothing items are dumped in Ghana every week. Like someone's

26
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,120
 come to your house with a cheap bottle of wine they're re-gifting. Here you go and you've

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,600
 got to re-gift it and then they re-gift it and there's a bottle of wine floating around

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,040
 the world being re-gifted over and over again because it's vinegary two pound rubbish and

29
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,000
 it's clothing. It's a good analogy and it's a good job

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,960
 that Anna isn't here because that's the kind of wine she loves. She'd be like "I would

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,480
 drink that wine" but yeah it's absolutely huge, it's a huge amount and they have huge

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,600
 sort of piles of it next to it. There's one river in Akra.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,840
 So it's like literally mountains of clothing.

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah and we've got a massive market where it's traded, most of it's traded, most

35
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,040
 of it's given away but we don't want it. Just to be clear this is unwanted. We want a little

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,520
 bit of it. Yeah, second hand stuff is great but it's stuff that we've inevitably bought

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,900
 from fast fashion suppliers for very low amounts of money. We've worn it once, we've thrown

38
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,200
 it away. We've gone into our wardrobes and we've gone "I don't want all these clothes.

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,280
 It's wasteful in my wardrobe. Let me take you to a charity shop." Guess what? A charity

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,620
 shop doesn't even want all your clothes and then it ends up in a charity shop into the

41
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,200
 back of a shipping container and it gets shipped off to a country and one of those countries

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
 is Ghana.

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,360
 Wow, up until you mentioning this fact, fast fashion, I'd actually not heard that term

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,440
 before and looking into it, wow, what a mad thing we're all involved in if you buy from

45
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,400
 high street shops. Back in the day you used to maybe buy four shirts and that would last

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
 you for months on end but now it's almost like six shirts a week for some people if

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,160
 they go out and want for younger kids supposedly from surveys. A lot of kids want to be seen

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,920
 in different shirts on their Instagram, they don't want to be seen in the same thing. So

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,760
 socially you are doing a turnaround of shirts that you might only wear once and then chuck

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,360
 away or give back to the shops who then don't resell them.

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,560
 The stuff that goes to Ghana, I think like you say, they kind of resell it and reuse

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,440
 it and stuff but 40% of it is such low quality that it just goes straight into landfill and

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,200
 you can't really truck it out of Ghana at that stage so it gets dubbed in Ghana.

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,080
 Yeah, and don't forget there's not a huge amount of infrastructure in terms of like

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,560
 wasting recycling. It's not like they can separate it into polyesters, cottons, repurpose it.

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
 If you want to take rubbish anywhere, I swear to God, Ghana is the last place you want to

57
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,640
 take it and put it to be used in a useful way. Just on your point about how much we

58
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:50,000
 buy in the UK, we buy two tons of clothing every minute. Every minute, I can't be right.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
 I got it off the Oxfam website.

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,320
 Wow, I found that we throw away 75 pounds of clothes every year per person.

61
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,400
 That's way. That's about the weight of a male giant otter.

62
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,040
 That does bring it home.

63
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,840
 How big are otters that big?

64
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
 They're huge. They're big.

65
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
 They're giant otters.

66
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,160
 There's the logo for the campaign against wasteful clothing.

68
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,320
 It may not seem a lot but obviously there's 60 odd million people in the UK. Imagine 60

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,080
 odd million giant otters.

70
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,600
 Again, James, I do think you've picked one of the worst and least known animals.

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,160
 If people's reactions to that factor are they're giant otters, that is a problem with the campaign.

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
 Yeah, you're right.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,560
 Because then you're immediately talking about the otter, you're not talking about the clothes.

74
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,080
 And also, do we need to be worried about them because they sound kind of aggressive.

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,880
 Yeah. Well, you need to worry about yourself if you're in a room with one. They're six

76
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,320
 feet long and if you're in a room with one, it's not in its natural habitat which is the

77
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,160
 Amazon base. They're Brazilian, aren't they?

78
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
 Giant otter.

79
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,160
 Yeah, it's happened. It's happened. We forgot about clothing. We're in the world of otter.

80
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,680
 It's because the world of fast fashion is so, once you look at the stats, it's so upsetting

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,160
 that if James comes along with his brilliant campaign and posts it, you immediately want

82
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
 to think about the otter because...

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,520
 I think maybe we can get you a costume, Andy.

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
 An otter costume?

85
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,120
 An otter costume and send you into H&M and fuck things up.

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,000
 I love that. Be like Christ turning over the tables in the temple.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,640
 Yeah, was he an otter costume?

88
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,000
 He never mentioned... Well, three of the scriptures don't mention it, but John is always a bit

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,200
 more out there. He says Christ was at the Law of the Trust.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,640
 That could be the new saying instead of a bull in a china shop. It's an otter in a Zara

91
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
 high street shop.

92
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,840
 No, but you're right. The numbers are kind of heinous. I didn't realize how it had happened

93
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,360
 in the first place as in the way that lots of big high street brands moved from having

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,640
 a few collections of clothes a year to now having new collections maybe every couple

95
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,600
 of weeks. And there's a firm called Shine who, I think if you know about fashion, you

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,320
 will know about them, but if you don't, you won't. They're an enormous Chinese firm who

97
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,600
 stock almost all their clothes, 94% of their clothes are stocked for 90 days or less. So

98
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,560
 they basically turn out thousands and thousands and thousands of designs, but they only make

99
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,760
 about 50 or 100 of each one. But in the first four months of last year, they added 315,000

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,120
 different styles to their website.

101
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,680
 It's a clever idea in a way. I mean, it's terrible for the world, but the idea is that

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,360
 one, you don't have lots of waste. They don't have lots of waste in their company because

103
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,720
 because you're only making 50 of them, you're probably going to sell all 50, but also you're

104
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,760
 creating fake scarcity, which means that people, if you see someone wearing it on TV, you're

105
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,040
 like, well, there might be only 50 of my local shops, so I'm going to have to get there fast

106
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
 and get one.

107
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,160
 At which point they'll make another 200,000. Yeah, but 300,000 different pieces of clothing

108
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
 in different designs in four months.

109
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,760
 That's crazy. And this is all the fault of one man, one still alive, possibly very litigious

110
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
 man.

111
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
 Is it?

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,000
 Well, he might be, I'm about to slag him off.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Let's name some names.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,360
 His name is Emancio Ortega and he is the founder of Zara, the high street shops that are global.

115
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
 When he invented Zara, the idea was he wanted fashion to be able to mimic fashion that was

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,760
 being seen in the catwalks at a much quicker rate. There used to be such a long period before

117
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,680
 anything even resembling what was seen on the catwalks would appear in shops. And he thought,

118
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,360
 what if we just quickly make them the turnaround? We have no name designers. They're all anonymous.

119
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,520
 They work for us in the back rooms and let's get it out within a five week period. That

120
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
 will make us big.

121
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,880
 And then let's just make a few of them. We just constantly create demand for new items

122
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,280
 and this caught on around the world. So it's this one guy who at one point became the richest

123
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,960
 man in the world, took over Bill Gates for like a brief second. So he's, he went from

124
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,880
 poverty to richest man in the world of this idea of fast fashion.

125
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,040
 One guy and one woman as well, Rosalia Mira, who's his wife, who did a lot of the work

126
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,300
 as well. And because they kind of got together, didn't they? She was working in a clove shop.

127
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,280
 He was a messenger boy and they kind of go, "Can I make it any more obvious?"

128
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,480
 But yeah, Ortega, he's a really interesting guy, I think, because some of it sounds quite

129
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,680
 sweet. Like he grew up, he was the son of a railway worker who would move around the

130
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,440
 whole of Spain working wherever there were jobs. He was really poor as a child. He had

131
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,780
 only potatoes for some of his meals. And he's very reclusive. He doesn't have a computer.

132
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,160
 He does all of his work like in small groups and just kind of tells people what to do and

133
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,760
 really doesn't write much down and stuff. But then on the other hand, he's a billionaire.

134
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,320
 Well, we made a great new enemy on this show. You're welcome, guys. So it was in this tiny

135
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,460
 town and he wanted to call the company Zorba initially, but there was a restaurant that

136
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,360
 was selling beers and so on down the road. Greek food, I imagine. It's more of a Greek

137
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,160
 than a Spanish name, isn't it? Well, Zorba the Greek. Zorba the Greek. But that's what

138
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,720
 they were naming it after. But there happened to be two places that wanted to do it in the

139
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,280
 very same street. And so the restaurant said, "Can you not do that, please?" And so he went

140
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,880
 fine, but they had the molds for Zorba. And so they quickly just rearranged it into Zara.

141
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,340
 So I guess they used the A twice out of Zorba. I guess that's how that works. And through

142
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:14,760
 away the B. Well, they like waste, so it doesn't matter. Start as you mean to go on, guys. Stick

143
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,960
 it in a bin. He's very reclusive. He's been photographed, I think, once by the company.

144
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,960
 The company released one photo of him once in about the year 2000. He is really very,

145
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,240
 very, very private, but he appears to wear only the same items of clothing every day.

146
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,720
 He wears a pair of trousers, a shirt and a jacket. None of which is sold by Zara. No,

147
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,520
 exactly. And it's kind of like that thing, you know how all the tech squillionaires, all

148
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,440
 their children are growing up playing with simple wooden blocks. And they've never seen

149
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,520
 a computer and they all go to schools where they don't do any tech stuff. But that also,

150
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,400
 it makes me also think of, do you remember Daniel Radcliffe used to do that after it?

151
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,920
 So when he came out on the West End at the stage door every night, he used to wear the

152
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,520
 exact same clothes so that the paparazzi couldn't sell a new photo because that photo could

153
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,040
 have been taken any night of the run. So that was his strategy.

154
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,760
 Is that also why he doesn't seem to have aged over the last 30 years?

155
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,080
 He's decided to freeze himself. Yeah, that's why you don't see many photos. Yeah. Okay,

156
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,280
 I'm just floating his theory. Okay. Because obviously a little of fast fashion is driven

157
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,960
 by high fashion and by red carpets and things like that. So if you're only allowed to wear

158
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,720
 one item of clothing on the red carpet for the rest of your life, that would presumably

159
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,480
 go a long way to what bit of the waiter. Are we going to make people whatever the last

160
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,960
 thing they were like Sam Smith, they're going to have to wear that kind of rubber thing.

161
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,240
 Yeah, yes. A certain date you just freeze and that's your clothes now. Yeah, like a random

162
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,760
 bell to just go off on your phone or something. Like today's your time and whatever you're

163
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,360
 wearing that it's just you know how you they gave us alerts when it was COVID we'd get

164
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,720
 like these text message alerts and it says it should be a clothing alert. Right, this

165
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,440
 is you now. This is your look. And it would incentivize people to always look their best

166
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,960
 because you might get frozen at any time. Yeah, yeah. I'm right now to have worn this

167
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,280
 hoodie with my own podcast. But I do think we need to make it slightly less socially

168
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,440
 acceptable to just wait. I just have a friend who wardrobe was just full of clothes with

169
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,960
 tags on. She was just a shoplifter. Actually, there's security tags. Does she have it on

170
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,840
 her ankle as well? She couldn't leave the house office. It's just socially acceptable

171
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:33,040
 to just buy stuff. My ex used to work in a clothes shop and the number of times people

172
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,000
 would come back with an outfit saying yeah, I haven't worn it because it didn't fit and

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 it would be covered in red wine and vomit. Like no, no, we haven't worn it. Honestly,

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,800
 we haven't worn it. Yeah, I know it's shameless watching the lies of a hungover person. A

175
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,880
 lot of this just go back to a lot of this waste is returned items too. So even if you

176
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,840
 return items pristine, they often can't be resold because the minute you open the packaging,

177
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,960
 well it's not something they can really sell again. So we and our brains they go I'll try

178
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,680
 it on. I'll send it back and it'll be okay. It's not okay. Most of that does get dumped

179
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,040
 as well. Yes, exactly. And that's the big problem that no one realizes. So it's exactly

180
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,480
 that it is literally online ordering. You tried on and that's the wrong sides. That

181
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,160
 is now going into waste. Yeah, they won't reuse that. It's remarkable as well. I was

182
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,100
 reading about how Zara defines how they can make the fast fashion because it's not just

183
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,160
 looking at the bigger world of fashion, high end fashion like catwalks and so on. Basically

184
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,800
 the staff and this is from an article that was about 2012. So I'm talking for, you know,

185
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,920
 this could have changed since then but the way they do it is staff have to monitor by

186
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,800
 listening carefully to what people are making little comments about. I hate having those

187
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,080
 zips on the ankles. I wish they would put them up here and if they would collate this

188
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,800
 stuff and all report back. Did you hear anyone else say that? Yeah, I heard them say that.

189
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,660
 They report that back to head office and then they just start designing clothes according

190
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,280
 to literally customer feedback within the shop because they come up with so many different

191
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,680
 designs and then what they do at the big Zara warehouse which is like an air hanger, a New

192
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,640
 York Times journalist went to visit it. You would see people talking to the Zara's of

193
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,280
 the world going, "Red pants? Are they wearing red pants? Okay, we're getting reports of

194
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,080
 red pants here. Great, we're in red pant business now and they would make pants being trousers,

195
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,000
 sorry." Is that for English men over a certain age in the countryside? Going to the Henley

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,840
 Regatta. 14-year-old girls in China, a 60-year-old men at Henley. Zara have really been cracking

197
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,440
 the regatta market and it's... So if I go into a Zara and be like, "God, I'd love a panda

198
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,120
 costume." Yeah? Yeah. And if we all did it. If we all did it. Sorry, we're getting a giant

199
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:50,160
 river otter costume. Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that

200
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,940
 Ford has just got a patent for a car which can repossess itself if the owner falls behind

201
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:05,680
 with payments. This is quite a dystopian episode, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

202
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,400
 This is just a patent at the moment. Yeah. It may never be billed but it has been granted

203
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,920
 as they applied for it a couple of years ago and it's just been granted this year. So here's

204
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,160
 the plan, right? You've got your Ford. Yeah. You think it's safe. You've got it on a payment

205
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,240
 agreement. Payment agreement. You're doing okay but then you miss a couple of payments.

206
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,080
 A couple of payments, something happens and they write to you and you don't acknowledge

207
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,360
 it. Maybe you missed the message, whatever, right? But anyway, things steadily get worse

208
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
 for you and your car from this point onwards. Firstly, they just make the car a bit less

209
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,720
 pleasant to drive. In that, you know, they might disable the music or the air conditioning

210
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,920
 or the GPS. Some of these things sound a little bit dangerous. At this stage, you might just

211
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,880
 think it's a glitch, right? Yeah. You're doing a regular thing. It's not especially

212
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,600
 hot. So you don't like music. So fine. So you're all right. But then it'll make an unpleasant

213
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,740
 beeping sound whenever you get into the car. Okay, well, that's a bit annoying. It sounds

214
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,960
 like the music I might have been listening to anyway. Yeah, your EDM collection is fine.

215
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,400
 So great. Then it stops you using it at certain days or times as in the car won't even function

216
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,720
 outside, let's say, ordinary working hours. So I think the plan is that you can keep going

217
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
 to your job. So you can afford to catch up with your payments eventually. But you can't

218
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,480
 I don't know, socialize. And then as a very last resort, it will either drive to a waiting

219
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,840
 tow truck to be repossessed, like it'll have an asignation without you knowing about it.

220
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,440
 Or if it's worth very little, it'll just drive itself to a scrap yard and say, take me apart.

221
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,420
 Drive yourself to Ghana. That'd be good to be one car. That's great. So this is the plan.

222
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,040
 That's amazing. It's incredible. Maybe it'll happen. What's crazy is like this. Why can't

223
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,880
 technology be used for good? If we can control what cars are used and when they're used,

224
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 what can't we do in the world right now, modal shift, we can't get people out of their cars

225
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,680
 on to train. So why don't we set these new electronic Wi-Fi connected cars in the future

226
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,800
 to like, you can be used for 10 hours a week, run out of your 10 hours, it won't work and

227
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,520
 you'll have to just go to a field and touch some grass, right? Why don't we use this for

228
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,540
 good? They can only take you to the park and ride. But there's got to be a better way to

229
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,340
 use this technology rather than to just like, make people destitute. Yeah, absolutely. I

230
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,900
 got one slightly better way of using the technology, the self-driving technologies. So if you've

231
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,980
 got a really busy road, it's kind of gridlocked almost and everyone's kind of stop, start,

232
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,220
 stop, start, bad for the environment, bad for everything, right? You can put 5% more

233
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,460
 cars onto the road, but if they're all driverless and they're all smart and they know exactly

234
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,520
 how fast to go on which lane to be in, they can stop the gridlock. Okay. Does that make

235
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,080
 sense? You know what I mean? Yeah. So like the cars will join the real cars and they'll

236
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,160
 work out how everyone's behaving and they'll move a little bit faster in this lane, a little

237
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,720
 bit slower in this lane and suddenly all of the traffic jam will stop. Like a dance,

238
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
 like a synchronised. Yeah, exactly. I used to work in highways and traffic modelling

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,480
 is mostly nonsense. Well, it's not nonsense, but it's super, it's super vulnerable to change.

240
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,380
 I worked on this one project here and they spent millions modelling how this new road

241
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,820
 would work and everyone was great. And then there was some crisis and petrol went up like

242
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,980
 2p and the model that's put in the bin. Like the smallest change in the most random thing

243
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,740
 to do with driving. You've got to put it all in the bin and start again. So a lot of policy

244
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,820
 and a lot of stuff is done based on these models, but these models are so quickly made

245
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,640
 and done. But it's true that driver behaviour does cause a huge amount of traffic. So like

246
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,980
 Rubberneck is a really good example. You're all familiar with people slow down to look

247
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,780
 at accidents because we're humans. Love it. Or Stonehenge. I'll say it, yeah, but I do

248
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,900
 that. The A303. Oh, yeah. A303. So you guys are so bad at it, they want to dig a tunnel

249
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,740
 underneath it. Like you guys are so just, if you won't stop slowing down, we're going

250
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,300
 to dig underneath it. Every time you're on the A303, you think, God, this wonderful

251
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,060
 crash must have happened up ahead. And it did happen like 3000 years ago. I feel like

252
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,660
 I would drive underneath and go, Oh, we're directly underneath. Let's slow down. Yeah,

253
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,740
 yeah, yeah. Let's feel it. Sense it. Yeah. Funny enough, I worked for the highway agency

254
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,140
 whilst I was trying to build it. And I'm like, you're never going to get permission to do

255
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,620
 this guy. It's like a really old build. Did they get it in the end? No, it got stuck in

256
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,820
 the bin. It's really hard to build tunnels because they're really environmentally unfriendly

257
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,340
 and expensive. Put on top of that a bloody English heritage site. You've got recipe for

258
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:31,140
 wasting your money. Yeah. Ford in 2020 applied for a paper to match up passengers with things

259
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,660
 like Uber's, you know, ride sharing. Anyway, matching up passengers on the cars by smell.

260
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,780
 Okay. So you fit a car with sensors. And then if that car smells of vomit and then you smell

261
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,540
 of vomit, then you get that one. Is that right? No, it's I think if you've unticked the vomit

262
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,420
 box, you don't want to be in the car smelling of vomit. Then you won't be paired up. That's

263
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,620
 clever. So on a Friday night, 11 o'clock, the pubs are kicking out, really hard to get

264
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,740
 an Uber. You uncheck the vomit thing and you're the only one who wants to get a vomit taxi.

265
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,940
 And so there's more taxis available. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's more for people with

266
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:14,300
 things like airborne nut allergies than people that can't smell vomit. But I think there will

267
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,860
 be advantages for everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Let's say someone's had a peanut in the car and it

268
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,460
 will be very dangerous for you if you've got a very, very, very bad nut allergy to get

269
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,700
 into that car. So you can sense peanuts. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to think what other smells

270
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:34,580
 can be deadly that are important for this patent. Mustard gas. Yes. That's not good.

271
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,500
 On the smell thing, there was a guy called Henry Cyril Padgett. He was the fifth Marquis

272
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,580
 of Bath. And he was really famous because he had gotten inheritance in 1904, which was

273
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,220
 equivalent to 30 million pounds per year. And after about five or 10 years, he'd accumulated

274
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,420
 debts of about half a million. And that's 60 million in current money, because he just

275
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,900
 spent it on everything. And he modified his car so that his exhaust pipe sprayed perfume.

276
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,140
 So wherever he went, there would be a nice little smell of like someone's vaping past

277
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,300
 you or something. Lovely. I think it's quite selfless because I mean, it's his car. Yeah,

278
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,500
 it's actually a benefit that he will never really feel himself. Well, I think what happened

279
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,140
 was he thought that all the cars at the time were a bit smelly. I'm going to do something

280
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,660
 a bit different. I feel like he's a climate change denier. And he's like, what climate

281
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:37,300
 change? What are you talking about? This is how profligate he was. He was once a theatre

282
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,420
 and someone had stolen some of his jewellery. And so he needed to get it back. So he enlisted

283
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,980
 the help of Arthur Conan Doyle to try and find the jewels. And he paid Conan Doyle to

284
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,580
 try and solve the case. Brilliant. God, that's great. Isn't that great? I do like people

285
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,060
 who spend money well. It's a really good way to spend your money. Not this fast fashion

286
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,420
 nonsense like 5000 shirts or do you want to hire Luther?

287
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,260
 Conan Doyle will come up with an incredibly elaborate mechanism by which it would have

288
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,380
 been done. He actually that he actually because he was so famous as writing the Sherlock Holmes

289
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,740
 books, people used to come to him with mysteries and ask him to solve them. And obviously they're

290
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,420
 offering him money and stuff. And he solved a few. And he used two methods, didn't he?

291
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,860
 One was real detective science. And the other was spiritualism. So he would get seances

292
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,700
 and he would try and track things down by just the feeling of where it might be. And

293
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,840
 did he keep two columns of success and failure? Which method worked better? I think he's

294
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:44,260
 got wins on both. Yeah, I wonder if that happens today. You know, if like Dan Brown has people

295
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:50,620
 getting in contact with him about solving. You'd get in ranking. Yeah, crime. P. D. James.

296
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:58,300
 Richard Osmond. Richard Osmond. Yeah. Your nan goes missing. Richard. Richard in.

297
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:05,100
 Do you want to hear something, a theory about cup holders? Okay. I was looking into. That's

298
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,480
 correct answer. I was looking into who developed all the different bits of a car and when they

299
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,980
 came in, you know, cup holders came in properly in about the 80s, I think they've been done

300
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,760
 since the 50s, but they weren't very good. If you were driving, you couldn't really properly

301
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,840
 stash a drink in a drink from a while driving. So like the decent ones came in in the 80s.

302
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,880
 Just a quick aside, the car with the most cup holders is apparently the 2019 Subaru Ascent.

303
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:36,760
 Any guesses? 16. Like five. 12. 19. Oh my God. 19 cup holders. We're at the final three

304
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:44,660
 that I wasn't thinking of. No. So, okay. Why do we like cup holders? There is a theory

305
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,020
 by a French scholar. Because you can keep your change in them. Well, yeah, that's kind

306
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,940
 of I've never put a cup in my cup holder. And the keys and the car keys. Yeah, yeah.

307
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,480
 Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here's a theory from this is printed in the Toronto Star French born

308
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,000
 scholar and marketer G Clotaire Rapaye, who argues that warm drinks as we drive a replacement

309
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,560
 for mother's milk. He says, I see. He says, what was the key element of safety when you

310
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,840
 were a child? It was that your mother fed you and there was warm liquid. Yeah. That's

311
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,720
 why cup holders absolutely crucial. I fit in my cup holder with a nipple. Yeah. And

312
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,000
 I, it's very comforting when I try. I'm sure we must have said this, but there was a theory

313
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,740
 that in McDonald's, the when you're slurping your milkshake, they make it the exact consistency.

314
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,900
 So the amount that you slurp is the same amount that you would like to impress. Is that why

315
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,780
 it's so thick? Wow. So you have to suck as hard as you did. I mean, I don't think it's

316
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:49,180
 true. There was a theory about that. Beautiful. Beautiful theory. I mean, I don't like milk

317
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,400
 at all. No, anything to do with milk. I don't like it. I even if like, if you give me a

318
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,000
 black tea and you use a spoon to stir it, that's been in a milky cup, I swear I can, I can

319
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,160
 taste, I can't stand milk. And I'm wondering now if that just says something about possibly

320
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,160
 my relationship with my mother. This is, well, I think it says everything. Yeah. I have the

321
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:17,820
 exact opposite. So last night you're still on the move. Yeah. I've been wondering for

322
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:26,660
 nine years who that woman is. Yeah, I woke up two AM last night off the back of having

323
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,000
 a dream about drinking some milk, got out of bed and I went downstairs and I had a glass

324
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,880
 of milk. A whole glass of milk. Yeah, two AM off the back of a dream that made me just

325
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,100
 salivate so much for it. I wonder if your body was craving it for something like you

326
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,940
 haven't had enough calcium in your diet. And also vitamin D, right? And it's been very

327
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,740
 gloomy in the UK recently. Yeah. Yeah. You can get even even other things than milk,

328
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:01,280
 which is vile in efficacy and smells. I would love to have a quite a fancy glass of milk

329
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,960
 lorax. I think I'm on the table. Once you think about it. Yeah. Yeah. What are we talking

330
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,180
 about? Carls. Carls. Have you heard of William Suchiti? No. So William Suchiti is a Zimbabwean

331
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:21,840
 born British entrepreneur. And he has invented something called cargo. And this was possibly

332
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,180
 going to be the future where they're like little dog sized cars that go round and deliver

333
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,660
 things to people's houses. Okay. And they're autonomous like cars. So you order your milk,

334
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,260
 let's say you've done fancy a glass of milk. Yeah. And then he puts in his order and then

335
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,220
 Tesco puts one in a little cargo and it drives it all the way around. Okay. Yeah. He's basically

336
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,980
 going against the Teslas and the Googles as the big, you know, who's going to be the big

337
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:52,240
 person who does this in the future. And this guy, the first thing he invented was an intelligent

338
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,120
 robot librarian. Cool. Who doesn't want one of those who was capable of holding a conversation

339
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,800
 or taking commands and would tell you where the books are that you want. So you say, oh,

340
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,280
 you know what, I really like this Richard Osman book. What else would I like? And they're

341
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,880
 like, oh, well, there's a Richard Coles book that's just down here. Come and follow me.

342
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,840
 And it would kind of drive around and take you to the book. I was sort of picturing an

343
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,020
 anti-Siri where you'd say like, Hey, Siri, and it's just, shh.

344
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,520
 This guy also invented an autonomous penguin that they use at Milton Keynes University Hospital.

345
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,580
 Cool. And it kind of takes the medicine round to wherever you need it. So if you need certain

346
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,900
 medicine in a state of ward, this little penguin will drive around and drive around and take

347
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,300
 your medicine. Is it for children's wards? Or just, you know what, it's actually for

348
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,100
 all wards, but I think, you know, it helps that it is good for children as well. Because

349
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:49,240
 you don't want like this evil sort of. Yeah, two 1000 liquid metal. And the other interesting

350
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:56,080
 thing I found about Sotiti is that in 2023 he rescued a zebra from Ukraine and he currently

351
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:05,560
 keeps it in his garden in Norfolk. Wow. Using technology for good, rather than evil. I think

352
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,040
 those cargos do sound like a very good idea because it's all about the taking the sort

353
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,780
 of emissions out of the last mile of delivery, isn't it? And that's where a lot of, you

354
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,060
 know, that's where you can really make efficiencies and, you know, driving vans around all the

355
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,020
 place, but they are going to need to be quite well defended. As in the number of packages

356
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,220
 that get mixed from doorsteps, they will need to be. But how would you, what would you say,

357
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,380
 like a flamethrower? I'd fit a flamethrower. I'd fit. So it would be a sliding scale like

358
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,860
 the Ford, like a bit of interference. It just gives you a stern verbal warning. Do you think

359
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:47,060
 that we should get William Sotiti to watch "Robot Wars" perhaps? Yes. A little spiked.

360
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,720
 Okay. And it's time for fact number three. And that is James. Okay. My fact this week

361
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,080
 is that the healthiest way to eat broccoli is to stir fry it. After chopping it into

362
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,920
 two millimeter pieces and leaving it to stand for an hour and a half. Yeah, we all know

363
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,060
 that. Is that how you do yours? Every day. That's what it says in your "Hello Fresh".

364
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:15,460
 Christ, that's a difficult question. So this is because they have a compound called sulforaphane.

365
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,020
 Sulforaphane is really hard to get at. You can get it quite well if you eat it raw, but

366
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,060
 as soon as you start cooking broccoli, it kind of degenerates and you don't get as much.

367
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,540
 You still get it, but you don't get quite as much. And there was some Chinese researchers

368
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,160
 in the Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry and they tried loads of different ways of

369
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,680
 cooking broccoli, see which ways gets the most sulforaphane, and they found this way,

370
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,880
 you know, they chopped it into tiny, tiny pieces because actually it's almost a defense

371
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,600
 for the broccoli. It's trying to stop herbivores from eating it. And so it puts this chemical

372
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,600
 out to stop like cows from eating it. Nice try, idiot. You're in my kitchen. There's

373
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,600
 no way you're not going to eat it. Yeah. So like the way to get this out is to kind

374
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,340
 of macerate it or chop it up or whatever. So that's why you do the small chopping.

375
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
 All right.

376
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,420
 And then if you leave it for a long time, it helps the sulforaphane to come out and

377
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:10,420
 then you do a quick stir fry. But it's two mil... I gotta say, it feels a bit like you'll

378
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,660
 have a kind of mint of broccoli. And I like the crunch of a floret.

379
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
 Do you?

380
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,700
 A bit like cauliflower rice, I imagine it would be.

381
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
 Which I hate.

382
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:25,740
 I've got a testimony to do with sulforaphane, because I used to have really bad tendinitis

383
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,760
 in my knees, right? Really bad. And unfortunately, when you're not an athlete, people don't care

384
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,000
 when your joints hurt. Get over it, Athena. And then at the same time, years ago, became

385
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,920
 apparent that sulforaphane was good for your joints. And I was like, it can't hurt. So

386
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,400
 I started having kale and broccoli smoothies, right?

387
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,940
 Because I was like, they were trying to figure out how to extract the sulforaphane into like

388
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,860
 a tablet. And I was like, I haven't got time to wait for this, you know? And I honestly,

389
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,320
 after about a few weeks, if not months, of eating just loads of broccoli and having loads

390
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,860
 of broccoli and kale smoothies, I'm no word for like, my tendinitis cleared up.

391
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
 Really?

392
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,700
 Absolutely, yeah. This is anecdotal. It wasn't a scientific study. So I got off the running

393
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,100
 treadmill and off the pavement and started cycling and all this kind of stuff. But after

394
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,860
 a few weeks and months, the tendinitis cleared up and I've not had it since.

395
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
 Okay.

396
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
 That's really interesting.

397
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,700
 Would a skeptic say placebo for that, do you think?

398
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:28,540
 Well, you know what? Skeptics, right? Skeptics just need to get on board the Athena train.

399
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
 Yeah.

400
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,700
 And that's my response to all skeptics on anything they say.

401
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,540
 Like, get on board the Athena train.

402
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
 The sulforaphane definitely does work.

403
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,620
 Oh, no, I'm just wondering the method of the smoothie, whether or not that.

404
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,740
 Well, it depends. If you're having a fair bit. So there are pills these days, which you'll

405
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,940
 be glad to know Athena, they completed the process, they made the pills.

406
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
 Oh, what a relief.

407
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,380
 Yeah. And the pills, in fact, the pills might be even more effective than broccoli and kale

408
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,020
 smoothies. I don't know how much you were having. I mean, it sounds like a fair bit.

409
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,660
 I was, honestly, I would buy like three or four florets a week and I'd get through them

410
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,100
 and either steam it or having my smoothie because my knees, I was in agony. I couldn't

411
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,580
 watch a film. I couldn't go to the theater because every time my knees were bent for more

412
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:11,320
 than like a minute, they would just be on fire. So I had, yeah, I'd say, and yeah, three

413
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,900
 or four florets every week. So a lot, a lot.

414
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,700
 That is a lot. That absolutely is a lot. These pills are equivalent to eating five kilos

415
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,940
 of broccoli every day.

416
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:26,380
 Wow. That's possibly more. But the other thing is that you can overdo it like with anything,

417
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,700
 right? And if you have too much sulforaphane, you are supposedly at risk of hyperthyroidism,

418
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,300
 which will make you tired and, yeah, well, I don't need six kilos of broccoli a day.

419
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,660
 It's just balanced diet. It's like what we always say, but I mean, it's good stuff.

420
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:51,020
 My favorite broccoli is Cubby Broccoli. Hang on though. Hang on though. There's a really

421
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,780
 interesting fact about Cubby Broccoli. Cubby Broccoli was the producer of the James Bond

422
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,900
 movies. The broccoli family still produced them to this day. Cubby Broccoli in an interview

423
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:09,300
 that he gave in the 1980s to LA Times made the claim that broccoli, the vegetable is named

424
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:18,620
 after him. He's lying. Okay. The broccoli family. So he says that his father, who is

425
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,660
 called Giovanni and his brother, Giovanni's brother, they immigrated to Long Island from

426
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:30,380
 Calabria at the turn of the 20th century. He says, yeah, in Italy, sorry. He says that

427
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,700
 that broccoli family were descended from the Broccolis of Carrera, who were the first

428
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,340
 to cross cauliflower and rub to produce the broccoli. Therefore, broccoli is named after

429
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,060
 him, not vice versa. When people say, are you named after the vegetable? Pretty good.

430
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,980
 That sounds very convincing. I have to say. It was an Italian thing. Like the first farmers

431
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,220
 to grow broccoli, the modern broccoli that we consider broccoli today were in the south

432
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,780
 of Italy. It's definitely a manmade thing. That's from the cabbage family, but they

433
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,420
 were bred that way, right? Yeah. And it was invented in Italy. I think possibly just named

434
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,540
 because it's Italian for shoots or something. Yeah. That's the etymology, isn't it? And

435
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,780
 it's the same word. It's the same as brooch. Brooch and broccoli have the same etymological

436
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,340
 root. Yeah. I know the Romans had a version of broccoli, but I don't think they had a

437
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,180
 lovely classic green broccoli. Well, one thing they definitely didn't have is tender

438
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:29,980
 stem broccoli. Is that what we've got? So tender stem broccoli is where it's quite a long stem

439
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,780
 and then there's little broccoli florets on the top. And you can eat the whole thing.

440
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,340
 It's pot broccoli. Oh, it's delicious, guys. It's brilliant. But this is one of the most

441
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:43,540
 amazing things I've ever found. Tender stem broccoli was invented about 10 years ago by

442
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:51,380
 a committee in Japan and it's a registered trademark. What? Isn't it amazing? Originally

443
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,020
 they called it aspiration when they invented it. Because it looks like an asparagus. Exactly.

444
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,420
 That's where they got it from. And yeah, they would just have this session where a load

445
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,500
 of people at the Sokata Seed Incorporation in Yokohama sat around the table and went,

446
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,100
 you know what we should do? We should make broccoli where you can eat the whole thing.

447
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,540
 How would we do that? Well, what if we mixed it with Chinese kale? Okay, let's try it.

448
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,700
 And they tried it. And now they patent the seeds and they sell the seeds around the world.

449
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,940
 Are you saying actually 10 years? About 10 years. In the last 20 years for sure. But

450
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,380
 you're saying I couldn't have seen in the millennium with a nice dish of tender stem broccoli.

451
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,220
 It would have been close. It was around that time when they started coming in. I never

452
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,440
 saw these because they were inexpensive. I see you're like, oh, I'm doing well in the

453
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,740
 world now that I've been introduced to a new broccoli. It's utterly bizarre. And they

454
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:43,780
 called them aspiration and they tried to sell them like that. And then Debbie Nucci, who

455
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:49,380
 is the wife of the company's chief operating officer, she came up with the name Broccolini

456
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,860
 and that's what they called in America. And then it was Marks and Spencer started to call

457
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:59,700
 in them tender stem in the UK. Wow. So let me get this right. You're saying you think

458
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,900
 that's more amazing than the fact that the James Bond producer? Well, that's not true

459
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:13,580
 what you said. The bit that I said is verifiably true. That's milk shake nipple. That's not

460
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,460
 going to become a thing that my name is now milk shake nipple but Donald's man. It's

461
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:25,580
 a cat fits. If the nipple fits, they love broccoli in Japan, though, don't they? They

462
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,100
 like to the point. Yeah. Yeah. So to the point where kids particularly love it and there's

463
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,700
 a story which is Pixar, you know, the movie inside out that they did. There's a scene

464
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,660
 in that where it was a movie about emotions. It was a real kind of poignant. They had characters

465
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,660
 like one of them was sad and one of them was angry. It was all in one person's head. Yeah,

466
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,780
 exactly. And in it, there's a scene where they eat broccoli and they go. It's yucky

467
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,920
 or whatever. And they swap that. They swap that out for the Japanese edition because

468
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,900
 broccoli is loved by kids there. So they put it instead. They put in stairs. They don't

469
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,340
 like milk, do they? I think famously in Japan. That wouldn't go down well in my house. Turn

470
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:10,100
 it off. We're done. Green peppers. Green peppers. Yeah, that's what they replace it with. But

471
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:16,420
 isn't there like a substance that makes green vegetables taste horrible to kids? And it's

472
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,220
 in Brussels sprouts and things like that. It's really bitter, right? Yeah. Yeah. So some

473
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,620
 people, so it happens to lots of children and I think children have extra taste buds.

474
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:31,100
 But there is a gene, which I have written down, which is called TAS2R38. And that lets

475
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,260
 you taste bitterness. And there's a variant of that gene. And if you get two versions

476
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,780
 of one particular variant, then your whole life, not just when you're a child, you experience

477
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,980
 all the Brassica family as being unbelievably foul and bitter and horrible. It's really

478
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:50,220
 interesting. My wife, when she was pregnant, she craved broccoli and tender stem. And then

479
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,380
 after about a month, she couldn't be in the same room as it. But didn't have the hearts

480
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,820
 tell me because I started making a loads of things with broccoli in it because she was

481
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,020
 like, oh yeah, I really want broccoli. I'm like, great, I'll make broccoli soup. I'll

482
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,220
 make broccoli this, broccoli that. And then she just found it so disgusting she couldn't

483
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,300
 be near it. Maybe that was the response. Here's your broccoli cake, darling, happy birthday.

484
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:19,100
 You're absolutely right. It's amazing how it can quickly turn. Broccoli everything here.

485
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,780
 It could have been more of a comment on my cooking than anything else. It's a two minute

486
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:29,820
 bit of pieces darling. I made it exactly as I told me to. Oh, this is a cool thing. This

487
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,940
 is slightly tangential. I hope you don't mind. Have you heard of epicuticular wax?

488
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,820
 No. Right. This is a wax that covers lots of vegetables, right? That is water repellent

489
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,500
 and loads and loads of vegetables, including broccoli, have epicuticular naturally or we

490
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,780
 are doing naturally. So like epidermis is the top layer of skin and cuticular the cuticles.

491
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:57,860
 So it's it's the surface layer. And it's it's to protect the plant from water getting in

492
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,780
 from outside. Yeah. And all the rubbish that might be in external water, matter of bacteria

493
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,800
 and it might be dangerous. There might be molds, all of that. And this is why, you know,

494
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:13,260
 when you wet kale, you know, when you go out wet some kale. Yeah, we all go out on kale

495
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,100
 letting expeditions. But you might rinse some kale before cooking it in the water just seems

496
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,860
 to stick on the surface. Droplets. Yeah, it splashes. It makes a mess. Water goes everywhere.

497
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,980
 It literally is like it's alive and it's rejecting water. Well, it is and it is and it's because

498
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,260
 of epicuticular wax. And it's why when you boil kale, sometimes it leaves a like a ring

499
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:40,740
 ring or the bathtub. It's like water off a duck's back. Water off kale's epicuticular

500
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:48,740
 wax. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And it's, it's super hydrophobic in some plants. It feels like you

501
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,020
 know what really hydrophobic things we tend to use them as lubricants like oil and stuff

502
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:59,260
 like that, right? Yeah. Feels like you could use this kale as a lubricant. It's gonna struggle

503
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:05,460
 to sell it now. Special vegan section of ads on itself. Yeah, I think that's all right.

504
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,740
 You're right. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't thinking sexual. I was thinking, oh, please.

505
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:16,540
 I said lubricant and sex never. I just, what? Wow. How did you get there? James says lubricant.

506
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:30,620
 He thinks of complicated machine tool processes. Go back to your milkshake.

507
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,280
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week

508
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,380
 is that last year on December 23rd, a hospital in Doncaster accidentally sent a text message

509
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:47,260
 to thousands of its patients informing them that they had an aggressive terminal disease.

510
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,180
 What they'd meant to send was a message reading, Merry Christmas and have a happy new year.

511
00:40:52,180 --> 00:41:00,740
 So this is a very unfortunate moment. And I should say that while obviously it's a,

512
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:07,380
 it's in theory a hilarious cock up. This caused chaos. Yeah. This caused horrible, horrible

513
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,440
 moments for people in Doncaster and the center of which the texts went out from. There's

514
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,420
 about 8,000 people sign there. So this was their mailing list basically through text

515
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,700
 messaging. Some of them had had tests. Some of them had tests. Some of them were rating

516
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,580
 on results. Some of them were, there was a lady who ran out of her house and she ran

517
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,500
 around the corner because she was so petrified and she saw six people in the street all out

518
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,220
 there as well going, I've just been. So everyone, it was just like a national. You know what

519
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:37,020
 it reminds me of? Do you remember that Hawaiian? Yeah. If one got a text message saying there's

520
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,260
 a nuclear missile coming to Hawaii. Exactly. And everyone believed it for about 15 minutes.

521
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,220
 But I think some people were going to shelters and the guy who had sent the message had done

522
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,540
 it before as well. I think it was a second offense. Twice before he'd mistook. But he's

523
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,580
 like, it's okay. I'm just going to move to Doncaster. We'll never have this problem again.

524
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,580
 Oh yeah. What happened with that was that a call had came in to do a test for a missile

525
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,220
 launch and the guy who pressed the button, there's two buttons that you can press. One

526
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,420
 that says test missile alert and then missile alert. Like a drop down menu. Yeah. Because

527
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,860
 they're alphabetically so close to each other. It's not like he picked the wrong thing. He

528
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,700
 picked missile alert because he was overhearing the conversation and he said what happened

529
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,940
 was that the guy who had the person on the phone saying, this is a test, this is a test

530
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,140
 of whatever wording it was, said that to the to the phone that was on the ear of the guy

531
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:33,140
 receiving it. And then he put it on to speakerphone. So the man who pressed the button didn't

532
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,740
 hear the, this is a test, just heard the next bit and was clearly a paranoid guy. So he

533
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,980
 just pressed the button. So it wasn't only text messages. It was also the TVs. It came

534
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,340
 on the TV. It came over the radio. He's a paranoid guy, but maybe he was just doing

535
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,580
 his job. Well, he was doing his job, but he'd done it wrong three times in total. So it

536
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,420
 they had to let him go. It was just an amusing that each time it was a music thing that made

537
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:03,060
 him stop hearing this is a test. Yeah. Like siren just drives. There was a school there

538
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,900
 in Hawaii where the students, they ran out after hearing all the, all the text messages

539
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,860
 on on TV and they ran to the fallout shelters built specifically for missiles and so on

540
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,500
 got there, but they were locked. So they had to run back into the school. So they couldn't

541
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,060
 even use the thing built for them to do it. And there were people were reporting people

542
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:25,180
 driving a hundred miles an hour down the road, desperately trying to get home. It was an

543
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,700
 amazing thing. I have a book, by the way, which is my favorite novel of recent years

544
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,300
 I've read by Jim Carrey, my, you know, the comedian. And the cover of it is his face.

545
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,980
 It's done a bit artistically, but it's his face. And Jim Carrey was writing that book

546
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,500
 while that missile was launched in Hawaii. And he was doing FaceTime with his assistant

547
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,340
 who called him up saying, we have minutes to live. And she accidentally took a screen

548
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:54,820
 grab the second his face. Like this is going to be a billion. She was there as well. So

549
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,020
 I think she had minutes to make that money. You want to see what a guy with one of the

550
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,060
 funniest faces in the world does. He was in the mask, right? So as soon as they told

551
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:13,140
 him, his eyes would pop out. You've got four minutes to make the funniest face. Get Carrey,

552
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,460
 Rowan Atkinson, a few others and just workshop it. This isn't really about systems and practical

553
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,540
 because I've had lots of jobs. I used to do like business development, right? She'd

554
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,860
 go into companies and they would have a process for doing things. And you'd say, well, this

555
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,980
 process works and doesn't work for these reasons. So this is a really good example of it's

556
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,580
 not actually that guy's fault, professing the nuclear test button. It's the process.

557
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,220
 So you know, in movies in America, there's this mad process they've got to do to like

558
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:40,660
 actually send the bombs. They've got to read codes. They've got to do dances. They've got

559
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:45,340
 to play charades. They've got to complete the game of mouse trap. Exactly. You know those

560
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:50,220
 games where you've got like a metal wire. And you've got to take something over without

561
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,740
 making something, making noise or whatever. And you've got to take operation. But the

562
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,860
 whole point of that is so you don't just like start firing missiles by accident. It is unequivocal.

563
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:04,060
 This is what we want you to do. Having a, oh, I just want to put you on speaker. There's

564
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,140
 like a three second delay. Only one person's responsible. There's a drop down list. These

565
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:12,540
 are all things. If I was going into that office, I'd be like, yeah, you need to change your

566
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,540
 process. That mistake shouldn't have happened with the Doncaster thing. That's a process

567
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,540
 thing.

568
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,620
 There used to be, there was an idea, a theory by someone and I forgive me, I can't remember

569
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,100
 who it was, but they said that they should put the nuclear codes inside a person. And

570
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,820
 that person should be with the president at all times. Yes. So if the president ever needed

571
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,780
 to send a nuke, they would have to kill that person and suddenly it becomes more real for

572
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,260
 the president. He's not just pressing any old button. The president has to literally

573
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:47,060
 stab the guy and I don't think it would be the president. Because the idea is that then

574
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,300
 the president who's making that decision has to make a more immediate decision before he

575
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,300
 can just press it.

576
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,300
 There are lots.

577
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,300
 There are lots.

578
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,300
 There are lots.

579
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,300
 The giant river otter.

580
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,300
 With the president at all times.

581
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,620
 Because the president's got to make a lot of life and death decisions.

582
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,580
 And who applies for that job as well? Like, who come to go, honey, you got to grow a gig.

583
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,580
 I'm working with the president.

584
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:11,140
 You might, you know, we've never had a nuclear war break out. You will probably just serve

585
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
 your time.

586
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,020
 In theory, you could just sit around doing nothing for 30 years and then get to go wherever

587
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,020
 the president goes.

588
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,020
 You'll see amazing rooms.

589
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,020
 Oh my God, this is a great thing.

590
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,820
 You probably can't put on too much weight because then he would be more difficult for

591
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,820
 stab you.

592
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,820
 Absolutely.

593
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,820
 Rules.

594
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,820
 Yeah.

595
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
 You've got to have a big tattoo of cut here.

596
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,820
 Cut here.

597
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,820
 A little scissor light inserted on you.

598
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,820
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

599
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,820
 That's a bit stressful, but you know.

600
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,220
 But then wouldn't the sort of the enemy try and kidnap you and get the codes out of your

601
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,220
 chest as well?

602
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,220
 Oh yeah, that is true.

603
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,220
 Don't you become a...

604
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,220
 As we know who the person is...

605
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,660
 You would probably have to have about 10 people, all of whom were with the president, but only

606
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,060
 the president knows which one it is.

607
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,060
 Oh wow, yes.

608
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

609
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,060
 That's a great idea.

610
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,060
 Yeah.

611
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,060
 Yeah.

612
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,060
 So you've all got the tattoo.

613
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,060
 Yeah.

614
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,060
 But maybe everyone in America has one.

615
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,060
 And...

616
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,060
 It's getting complicated, isn't it?

617
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,400
 It's getting harder to...

618
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,020
 Just on text messages, this text message is meant to say, "Merry Christmas and have a

619
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,020
 happy new year."

620
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,020
 Yeah.

621
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,020
 And that's very apt.

622
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,020
 It is.

623
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,020
 Because the first ever text message said, "You have an aggressive terminal..."

624
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,020
 No, it said...

625
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,020
 It was a merry Christmas.

626
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,020
 It was a merry Christmas message.

627
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,020
 Yeah, that's great.

628
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,260
 It was sent by a man called Neil Papworth.

629
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,500
 I think it was in the...

630
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,860
 It was in 1992, on the 3rd of December.

631
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,860
 There we go.

632
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,860
 But imagine getting the first ever text message.

633
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,860
 And it was, like, 3rd of December a bit early.

634
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:23,860
 Yeah.

635
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,860
 That's the thing.

636
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,860
 Vodafone were having the Christmas party on the 3rd of December.

637
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,860
 Vodafone were having a party.

638
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,620
 I believe to celebrate the sending of the first ever text message.

639
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:35,420
 So this guy, Papworth, sent the message to the head of Vodafone, or Richard Jarvis, who

640
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,820
 was a big week at Vodafone.

641
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,020
 I believe it was a party partly to celebrate this technology happening.

642
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,660
 And he had to text it from a computer, because phones at the time didn't have the capacity

643
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,660
 to text.

644
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,660
 Yeah.

645
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,900
 But the phone that Richard Jarvis received it on weighed two kilos.

646
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:57,220
 And that's about, I think, 12 modern iPhones, as in it just reminds you of what phones have

647
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,180
 been like in very, very living memory.

648
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,540
 There's a guy called Brian Moore.

649
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,780
 He's designed a device that won't let you type the word "lol" unless it has actually

650
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,020
 detected you laughing out loud.

651
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,900
 That's a good idea, that, isn't it?

652
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
 That's great.

653
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,500
 With the iText hat, when I am laughing, but I would never send lol, even if I'm really

654
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,500
 laughing out loud.

655
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,500
 No.

656
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
 That would be "ha ha".

657
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,620
 I do "ha ha ha ha" to be like, you're like, kind of, I'm laughing a lot.

658
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,700
 I do "wa ha ha ha ha" but I am a villain.

659
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,780
 But I think you would be able to program it so it wouldn't let you say "ha ha" unless

660
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,140
 you were laughing out loud.

661
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,420
 And it also doesn't let you write "ruffle" unless you're actually rolling on the floor.

662
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,820
 What about pissing myself laughing?

663
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,220
 Then moisture sensors, wow, insert.

664
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,620
 Laughing my ass off.

665
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:56,380
 Okay, the fastest ever text message, this is just a little weird fun record, okay.

666
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,580
 Like just KK.

667
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,620
 So there's a specific message which you have to send for this record.

668
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,620
 Right.

669
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,620
 Do we know what it is?

670
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,620
 We do.

671
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,540
 I'll tell you the record first, right?

672
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,660
 So this was broken, it may have been re-broken since, but it was 2010, British woman Melissa

673
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,380
 Thompson, she sent this message.

674
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,140
 It's 26 words and she managed it in 25.94 seconds.

675
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,140
 Okay.

676
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,140
 That's pretty good.

677
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,140
 It's all right.

678
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,660
 It doesn't sound, yeah, second word sounds quite beatable though, doesn't it?

679
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,380
 Here's the message.

680
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:30,540
 The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serra, Salmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious

681
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,260
 freshwater fish in the world.

682
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,620
 In reality, they seldom attack a human.

683
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,620
 Lol.

684
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,020
 So that's what she managed in 25 seconds.

685
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,540
 Okay, that is impressive.

686
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,660
 It's a predictive text.

687
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,300
 I imagine piranhas not necessarily going to come up.

688
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:52,380
 I would say the name of the species, because I have actually never heard those words before.

689
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,740
 She would learn them beforehand, I guess.

690
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,660
 I think so, yeah, because it's the sentence you'd know.

691
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,740
 And it's a real Fosbury flopper though, Melissa's record, because 2004, the same record with

692
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:07,740
 the same sentence was broken by a Sussex man called James Trussler, and he took 67 seconds

693
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,900
 to do it, and she took under 26 seconds to do it.

694
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,900
 Wow.

695
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,900
 Did she have a special technique?

696
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,900
 Oh, I don't know.

697
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,900
 I don't know if it's like Fosbury, yeah, yeah.

698
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,780
 But it's a huge difference.

699
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,780
 Yes.

700
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,620
 Maybe she was the first person to ever use her thumb rather than typing with her ridden

701
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,620
 next fingers.

702
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

703
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,220
 All right, you know the old lockers, you have to press each button three times.

704
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,220
 A, B, C.

705
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,220
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,220
 All that.

707
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,220
 So, yeah, that's amazing.

708
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,500
 Good for whoever that was.

709
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,820
 And good for if you're stuck with a piranha as well.

710
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,820
 Yeah.

711
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,820
 Because they sell them to attack a human.

712
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,820
 Ah.

713
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,820
 I think I think about texting.

714
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,820
 Yeah.

715
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,820
 It was so profitable.

716
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,820
 Oh.

717
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,820
 When it cost, I mean--

718
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
 It's like 10p a text, wasn't it?

719
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,700
 We're all of a nature to remember 10p texts.

720
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,700
 Yeah.

721
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,500
 It didn't cost 10p to send that data.

722
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
 Doesn't feel like it.

723
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
 Doesn't feel like it did.

724
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,820
 And so I did a little looking into it, and basically the profits were unbelievably huge

725
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,020
 for mobile phone firms.

726
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,100
 People were sending like a billion, weren't they?

727
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,740
 Like the world was sending--

728
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:09,100
 And you'd get on your plan, sorry for any younger listeners, but you'd get a certain

729
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,940
 number of minutes and maybe 200 texts a month, or 500 texts a month, and you'd get right

730
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,540
 up to the wire of how many texts you were allowed to send because then it was charging

731
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,780
 you 10p a minute.

732
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:23,820
 Anyway, in 2001 it cost 10p, like you said, James, which was 128 bytes of data for 160

733
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,220
 characters, right?

734
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,380
 The Guardian calculated that if it was charged at that rate, buying a standard music CD would

735
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,380
 cost £60,000.

736
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,500
 Oh my god.

737
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
 Yeah.

738
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,580
 The text message was just banality, right?

739
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,020
 It wasn't even like-- it wasn't 10p worth of information.

740
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,020
 It was mostly flirting.

741
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:47,540
 Well, mine were all about piranhas and stuff.

742
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,900
 I was wondering how old WhatsApp was.

743
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
 All right.

744
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
 I'm going to guess this.

745
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,780
 I must say I don't know the answer, but Dan's got his laptop so you can check.

746
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,780
 I can check.

747
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,780
 Yeah.

748
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,780
 I guess first, I think now.

749
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,780
 I think eight years old.

750
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,780
 Nice.

751
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,780
 So that's what, 2015?

752
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,780
 Yeah.

753
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
 Because James got us earlier with the 10 to stand broccoli, right?

754
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,780
 Yeah.

755
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,780
 Like it's invented 20 years ago.

756
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,780
 So I'm going to guess 1492.

757
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,780
 Ah.

758
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,780
 Like it's actually--

759
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,900
 You're not closer, but you're closer to what I'm going to say.

760
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,900
 Okay.

761
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,300
 So first of all, Dan, what was the answer?

762
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,900
 Well, is it older or younger than broccoli?

763
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,900
 Broccoli.

764
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,820
 Because I think broccoli and I reckon actually came in around the turn of the millennium

765
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,820
 really.

766
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,820
 Okay.

767
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,180
 So it must be younger than that.

768
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,180
 Yeah.

769
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,180
 I don't know.

770
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,180
 Yes, it is.

771
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,180
 Yeah.

772
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,180
 Go on.

773
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,180
 2009.

774
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,180
 2009.

775
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,180
 Okay.

776
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,180
 Well, I found a WhatsApp from 1908.

777
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,180
 This is what I just thought.

778
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:43,140
 I'd go in the newspaper archives and search for WhatsApp and see what came up.

779
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,700
 And this was from the Mass on Telegraph of the 26th of September, 1908.

780
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,300
 And it was about someone being sued for breaking up an engagement.

781
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,300
 And this was the first time that had ever happened in Albany, in Georgia.

782
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,540
 And it was a businessman called Jay E. Sapp.

783
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,700
 And he had teamed up with a guy called Mr. Watt.

784
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,580
 And they owned a hardware shop in Georgia called WattSapp.

785
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,580
 Get out.

786
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,580
 Isn't that amazing?

787
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,580
 Get out.

788
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:14,500
 The WattSapp hardware store existed for a small amount of time in 1908 in Albany, Georgia.

789
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,500
 Wow.

790
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,820
 And the proprietor was going around breaking up engagements.

791
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,140
 Well, that's what WattSapp is used for.

792
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,420
 In many, in many ways, just couples have an argument.

793
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,420
 Yeah.

794
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,420
 Yeah.

795
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,420
 Okay.

796
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,420
 That's it.

797
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,420
 That is all of our facts.

798
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,900

 And Athena.

 Athena could blend you.

807
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,660
 But don't come to me.

808
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,660
 I don't know.

809
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,660
 I think.

810
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,660

816
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,300
 How long's it been going now?

817
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,300
 Oh, we're on episode five.

818
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,300
 Episode five?

819
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,860
 The last one was about a friend of ours who got the snip.

820
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,860
 Wow.

821
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,860
 Yeah, right?

822
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,860
 It was way too enthusiastic.

823
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,060
 Your kids must be stressful, man.

824
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,060
 Yeah.

825
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,060
 That sounds good.

826
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,060
 Yeah.

827
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,060
 I hadn't thought of that.

828
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,060
 But it's called "Why Does My Child Hate Me?"

829
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,860
 It's about kids and how they're the problem, not us.

830
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,860
 We're brilliant.

831
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,860
 So check that out.

832
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,860
 These kids are nuts.

833
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,860
 Yeah.

834
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,260
 Otherwise, we'll be back again next week.

835
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,260
 We'll see you then.

836
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,760
 Goodbye.
