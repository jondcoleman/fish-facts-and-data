00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.420
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.980
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.620
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.740
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.300
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.740
 and Anna Tyshinski.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.940
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.820
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.980
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.420
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the first submarine

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.140
 to go around the world was only seen by one civilian,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.980
 a Filipino kayaker who saw the periscope

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.900
 and thought it was a sea monster.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.820
 - It's pretty amazing because we have a photo of that man.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.380
 Like this is, it looks--

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.500
 - Did they take the photo?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.060
 - So we'll get into the big story,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.660
 but there was a photographer on board.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.340
 And so anytime the periscope went up,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.540
 they took a photo of what the periscope was seeing.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.660
 And in this shot, you had a man sitting there

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.860
 called Rufino.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.220
 - Yeah, and we also know more about him

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.780
 'cause National Geographic went out looking for him.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.620
 - Yeah.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.460
 - And they found him and interviewed him.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.660
 And that's when they found out

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.300
 that he thought it was a sea monster.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.980
 He immediately went home and painted the names

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.700
 of Saints Peter and Paul on his boat

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.900
 for protection against the sea monster.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.740
 - Sensible.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.460
 - And by amazing coincidence,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.180
 this submarine that we're about to talk about

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.900
 started and ended at Saint Peter and Paul

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.100
 Archipelago in the Atlantic.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.940
 - It's incredible to see this.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.900
 - What a coincidence.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 - Yeah.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.580
 They've blown it wide open.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.780
 - Fervent evidence that we are living in a simulation.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.860
 - In a very unimaginative matrix.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.900
 So yeah, this is a 1960, we're talking.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.940
 Middle of the Cold War.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.540
 The Americans and the Soviets are not getting on very well,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.620
 but maybe there's gonna be a peace summit in Paris.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.740
 But before they do that,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.020
 the US decided to show off a bit and say,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.340
 we've got a new submarine that can go all the way

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.900
 around the world with no one noticing it.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.380
 And so that's why they did it.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.220
 It was called Operation Sandblast.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.020
 - They could just say they'd done it, couldn't they?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.620
 But literally we sailed all the way around the world

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.780
 underwater without anyone noticing.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.700
 - Yeah, but you're still here.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.060
 That's 'cause we went all the way around the world.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.580
 - Yeah, we just finished.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.860
 They just should have sent it underwater

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.860
 and they just had it coming through a big tape at the end.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.700
 - Yeah.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.620
 - They were really hardcore bright.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.500
 So there were a couple of moments where it looked dodgy

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.220
 where really they should have come up.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 And they didn't.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.420
 There's one instance where there was a member of the crew

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.820
 who had kidney stones,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.500
 and they did have to get him off the submarine,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.460
 sort of halfway through the mission.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.300
 And they-

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.100
 - They fired him out of the torpedo.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.900
 - Basically, that might have been an option

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.340
 because what they ended up doing

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.900
 was putting up a bit of the submarine out of the water

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.500
 for him to be collected from it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 while keeping the main hull underneath.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.340
 - And they didn't know, like,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.660
 none of the crew knew what they were doing, did they?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.900
 Until they were out at sea, under sea.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.980
 There was just their captain captain beach.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.540
 It was quite nice giving it with sandblast.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.380
 - Amazing.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.200
 - Yeah.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.540
 - And giving it, they were at sea.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.380
 What's the sea surrounded by?

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.220
 The beach.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.660
 - Yeah, and it's got a beach under it, arguably, as well.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.620
 - Well, let's discuss that, shall we?

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.700
 - Where is the beach?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.220
 I don't want to go on your package beach holiday.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.060
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.180
 I don't want to go on the picnic on the beach.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.500
 Everyone, get your scuba gear on.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.780
 But yeah, he didn't tell the crew

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.220
 until they were out seeing underwater.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.500
 And I think the crew had just been told

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.060
 to prepare to be away a little bit longer than usual.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.660
 And then they're going around the world.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.140
 - Yeah, they were told to get all the tax details in order

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.260
 'cause it was going to go over the tax year

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.100
 while they were away.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.940
 - Really?

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.760
 - So they're like, whatever you do,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.020
 make sure you pay your tax

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.940
 because you're not going to be back in time for it.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.180
 - It's a good excuse, though.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.500
 It's a very good excuse.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.660
 I love really like this.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.060
 So the submarines these days,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.140
 nuclear ones have their own way of making air on board.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.900
 But this one didn't have that capacity

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.020
 'cause it was an early nuclear sub.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.780
 It had to have its own,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.060
 it had to have a snorkel, basically.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.940
 It would stick up the periscope and go,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.140
 (gasps)

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.740
 and then go back down again every night.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.180
 - I actually, honestly,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.380
 this might just be a lying spot for me,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.300
 but I didn't realize what a nuclear submarine was.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.020
 I thought a nuclear submarine was a submarine

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.540
 that had nuclear bombs on it.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.460
 I think because the British tried to once are,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.500
 that's why I thought they all were.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.660
 - I just want to say the missiles are tried

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.780
 at the submarines of Vanguard.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.100
 Sorry.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.940
 - Sure.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.940
 - But yeah, no,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.580
 will it can be a sub with nuclear missiles on board?

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.060
 - It can be, but by definition,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.460
 a nuclear submarine is something

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.620
 which is powered by a nuclear reactor.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.900
 And what that means is you can just stay under water

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.740
 for way longer,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.620
 and these days you can make your own oxygen

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.820
 using the nuclear reactor

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.420
 by taking in the sea water,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.260
 separating the hydrogen and oxygen,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.660
 and that means you could stay under water

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.380
 for months and years.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.740
 - Right. - It's so cool.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.820
 - There are various problems

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.900
 with the fact that we can now have submarines

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.620
 under water forever, essentially.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.260
 There are various reasons why you can't do that.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.020
 So one of which is like all your clothes

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.660
 get so dirty in the end, you run out

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.620
 and people get claustrophobic and upset.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.820
 And another is rubbish.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.300
 I didn't know what they did with rubbish.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.220
 - Oh, on this? - On submarines.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.420
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - On sort of all submarines now,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.860
 they bring on board lots of metal sheets,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.740
 and then they have a special machine on board

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.540
 that turns the sheets into a cylinder to be a bin,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.060
 'cause obviously if they just brought on loads of bins,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.900
 they take up too much space.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.740
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.180
 - So then they throw-- - Space is in a premium, yeah.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.260
 - Space is a premium.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.300
 And then the bins all get secured

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.460
 once they're filled with rubbish,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.500
 and then they just jettison them out of the submarine

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.460
 with weights on them to take them to the bottom of the sea.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.380
 - To the bottom of the sea. - To the beach.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.180
 - To the beach! (laughing)

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.220
 - The people sunbathing down there are pissed off about it.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.660
 - That's crazy, 'cause the whole point of a submarine

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.660
 is that, I mean, the whole game of being in a submarine

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.620
 is that you're being quiet and undetectable,

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.300
 and enormous efforts are gone to

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.700
 to make submarines quiet and undetectable,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.420
 but if they're just pooing out metal bins wherever they go.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.740
 - But you're not gonna see it.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.380
 - The ocean is big, Andy.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.100
 - No, I know, but the whole thing is,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.380
 I mean, the amazing lengths they go to not to be spotted.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.540
 - Well then, can I just say about the bins?

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.820
 Given that you've raised the issue.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.780
 - Oh my God, you sound like my neighbors.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.620
 - What day do they go out again, is it?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.820
 - It's Tuesday this week, it's a bank holiday.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.380
 (laughing)

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.100
 Some people on submarines say that they're so careful

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.500
 about not drawing attention to themselves

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.380
 that eggs, old eggs they haven't eaten,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.340
 are pre-broken before they're put

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.900
 in the trash disposal unit,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.700
 because if they broke after being released,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.260
 they would generate enough sound

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.460
 that they would be detectable.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.300
 - What?

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.660
 That's how sensitive some other submarines are to noise.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.500
 - Really? - Really?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.780
 - Other submarines are constantly, yeah,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.420
 they don't hear an egg break.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.220
 They absolutely get so quiet down there.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.700
 - I've just, it's not that quiet under the water.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.420
 There's tons of animals down there.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.780
 - It's pretty noisy, it's a lot.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.660
 How about the engine running the submarine?

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.500
 What are they doing about that?

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.020
 - That's very heavily buffered.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.660
 - They put, you know, the egg boxes,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.900
 they put them around them.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.660
 (laughing)

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.980
 - No, it is not how quiet they are.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.980
 And so for example, bubbles.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.820
 - Oh yeah?

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.300
 - They put the bubbles through a diffuser

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.380
 to spread them out before they release them.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.220
 - Oh wow.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.060
 - 'Cause otherwise there's a big plume of bubbles

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.900
 at the surface, very obvious.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.740
 Oh, there's a submarine down there.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.900
 - Is that like, if you feel a big fart coming

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.740
 and you somehow managed to let it go out

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.260
 in a very slow little--

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.580
 - It's exactly like that.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.580
 And spies, MI5 spies are trained to do that.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.820
 (laughing)

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.060
 Just in case.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.940
 - They're the only ships that fly Jolly Rogers,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.100
 which I should have actually phrased as,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.740
 what flies a Jolly Roger?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.900
 - Submarines.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.220
 - I've screwed it up now, yeah,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.180
 but if you hadn't done the research

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540
 and I hadn't just said that, what would you have said?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.660
 - I've known that for years.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.620
 - Okay, but if you weren't a QI researcher.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.260
 - I just can't imagine the world where I would think.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.100
 (laughing)

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.940
 I don't know that right now.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.780
 - I have a question.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.860
 - Yeah.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.020
 - Would be quite soggy.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.380
 (laughing)

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.700
 - Kind of fly a flag under water.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.820
 - That's a good point.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.340
 They display it flattened.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.660
 I guess they fly it when they come up in triumph.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.900
 So I think traditionally if they've had a triumphant

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.500
 a sojourn, what do you call it, expedition?

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.340
 - Sojourn.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.700
 - I don't think they call it sojourn, yeah.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.540
 (laughing)

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.260
 I think they're pretty sure it most was.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.740
 They go, "Subs, you're going on a sojourn

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.660
 "into the Baltic Sea now."

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.500
 - It's amazing.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.340
 There's no space on the submarine

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.180
 'cause most people are wearing crevats.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.180
 The number of cigarette holders you have to have on board.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.380
 It just takes up loads of space.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.860
 - And then the actual battle itself

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.100
 is called a box social.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.060
 (laughing)

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.780
 - Whatever they're called, mission.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.860
 - Yeah, good, mission.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.980
 - They, when you come back and you've had a good one,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.460
 you have the, you fly it.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.300
 Fly the Jolly Roger.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.900
 - If you've sunk somebody else.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.820
 - I think if you've sunk someone else,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.020
 but now I think they quite often do it

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.260
 'cause sinkings happen very rarely these days.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
 And it's because it's a like middle finger

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.620
 to firstly Lord Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.900
 who complained in 1901.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.100
 As I'm sure you'll remember that submarines

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.420
 were underhanded, unfair and damned un-English.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:30.420
 And then in 1914 someone sunk someone else in the war,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.380
 the great one.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.060
 And they came back flying the Jolly Roger to say,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.880
 "Screw you.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.420
 "You think we're underhand and piratee."

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.260
 That's what we've done.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.940
 - Interesting.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.540
 There's so many correspondence in the fish inbox,

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.020
 fin box about nuclear submarines.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.900
 Almost all our listeners seem to be on nuclear submarines.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.740
 It's stunning.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.460
 - I didn't know the wifi was that good down there.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.300
 Amazing.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.140
 - Yeah.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.980
 - They must pre-download.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.820
 (laughing)

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.660
 - Good point, yeah.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.500
 - Take a plunge.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.340
 - Yeah.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.160
 - What are they telling us?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.000
 - Okay, well.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.840
 - State secrets.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.660
 - We've got some secret correspondence actually.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.740
 Tim, I'll say Tim W writes.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.900
 It's okay 'cause his friend's brother

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.420
 is learning to operate a nuclear submarine,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.100
 but you should not flush the loo at sea.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.940
 Why?

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.500
 - Well, there was once a U-boat that was sunk

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.980
 because they flushed, it was kernel-slit.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.820
 - That's it.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.660
 - Yes.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.940
 - And yeah, the whole thing went down.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.180
 - So that's a good reason not to do it.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.980
 But basically you shouldn't dump fresh water at sea.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.820
 - Okay.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.820
 - Because it has a different sonar signature to seawater.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.140
 It refracts sound waves differently.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.020
 And so it shows up as a massive blob.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.860
 - Oh, come on.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.700
 - Wow.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.540
 - It gives you away.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.380
 - It gives you away.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.820
 - And it just keeps samples of different ocean water

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.020
 that they are traveling in.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.860
 - 'Cause space.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.380
 - That gets put into the system whenever there's.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.220
 - Space is limited.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.060
 No, that's a good idea.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.900
 That's a really good idea.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.420
 - Well, it's actually, it's quite interesting.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.620
 I didn't realize this about oceans.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.540
 This story of the submarine going around the world

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.420
 has taught me this, that four days after

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.540
 they were thought to be a sea monster in the Philippines,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.180
 they were going in the Lombok Strait

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.740
 and then they were making their way into the Indian Ocean.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.900
 And then out of nowhere, they plunged

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.900
 from periscope depth height to 125 feet in 40 seconds,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.300
 because the density of the saltwater is different

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.540
 in the Indian Ocean than it is to the Lombok Strait

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.660
 that they were coming through.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.100
 - Hang on, so it wasn't, it's not like there's a wall there

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.380
 and they hit it and suddenly drop like a rice grain.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.100
 - I feel like it is, I think it is.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.180
 'Cause it came out of nowhere that they just plunged.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.780
 - I have a feeling that when you go from one ocean

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.060
 to another, you do get those like quite solid blocks.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.900
 - Really?

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.260
 - Yeah, because there's such different densities.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.540
 - They can't mix.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.380
 - Isn't that wild?

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.540
 - It's crazy.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.300
 - I have a riddle for you.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.860
 - Yeah.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.380
 - The first people to successfully escape

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.740
 from a submarine did it in 1851.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.660
 It was called La Plonge Marine Diver

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.340
 and it was operated like a pedalo.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.820
 So there were three crew, two crew on the pedalo bit,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.260
 cycling along and then one bloke was captain.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.540
 Anyway, they sank in a test dive in Kiel Harbor

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.740
 and they waited five hours for someone to rescue them.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.900
 No one came, there's an escape hatch,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.420
 but they can't push it open because they're underwater.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.820
 So the water pressure is too much.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.580
 And then the captain who was the inventor

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.420
 and he was a guy called Wilhelm Bauer,

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.620
 he grabbed a small valve, unscrewed it and whipped it open.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.380
 So water started coming in and his crewmates were like,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.220
 "What have you done?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.660
 "You've got mad, Wilhelm, you're going to kill us all."

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.220
 Why did he do it?

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.140
 - Is it the same reason as if you hold a straw,

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.940
 the top of a straw and then put it in water,

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.940
 the water stays in there because it releases pressure,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.740
 which means then there isn't pressure holding the door closed.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.980
 - Yes, 'cause what does the valve do?

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.100
 It lets water in from the outside.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.940
 So as the water came in from the outside,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.060
 then it equalized the pressure.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.820
 So suddenly you've got water inside as well as out.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.780
 So there's a really horrible moment

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.820
 where you all have to hold your breath

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.380
 as the whole thing fills up with water

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.540
 and you're suffocating to death

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.580
 'cause the CO2 levels are so extreme.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.620
 And then suddenly it hit the pressure equality

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.260
 and it went pop open and it fired them up onto the surface

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.780
 in the middle of their funerals.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.700
 - What?

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.500
 - Yeah, they were doing an impromptu service

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.620
 'cause it had been over seven hours.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.380
 - Pretty quick, I'm sorry.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.860
 I would like more efforts to be made for me.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.100
 - He's been in that toilet 20 minutes,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.540
 should we have a beer or not?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.740
 - That doesn't make any sense, Adam.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.100
 - The ones with the new partners.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.380
 - They were having a service.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.140
 They assumed they were dead.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.340
 A little, not that the coffins weren't out yet.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.180
 - Have you seen the other way

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.820
 that you can escape a submarine if it is sunk?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.220
 - You disguise yourself as an egg, I know this.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.780
 - No, what are the lifeboats of a submarine if it sinks?

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.460
 - Like smaller submarines?

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.300
 - Like torpedoes?

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.620
 - No, it's a suit that you wear.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.260
 It's a life raft, but you're in the life raft.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.100
 - You are in the raft.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.660
 - And you have a picture homer working

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.180
 in the nuclear power plant with that big helmet on,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.020
 but it's all fabric and he can see

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.940
 through a window in his face.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.540
 It's, you could've just said picture a house chem suit

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.540
 and there's no need to bring the Simpsons in.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.780
 That's another way, a more bland way

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.820
 of giving the picture to the audience.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.980
 So you go out of the submarine and you slowly rise

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.780
 and then you're just bobbing up there,

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.620
 waiting to be rescued.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.620
 - But I think a lot of the time

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.220
 if you're stuck, you're stuck, right?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.060
 - Yes, it's not soul proof this.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.580
 - Yeah, I think it's almost never that you can get out.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.660
 - We have one other person, right,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.660
 who actually was a sonar operator on a nuclear submarine.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.340
 This is so cool because with sonar, right,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.020
 what you can do is it lets you count the number

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.740
 of blades on a propeller.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.580
 So you can guess what kind of ship something is

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.380
 by your knowledge of the propeller.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.260
 - Because you fire your sonar at the propeller

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.180
 and sometimes it hits and sometimes it misses.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.020
 - Pretty much.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.420
 And then you can make an educated guess as to the kind

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.380
 of propeller and therefore what kind

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.780
 of submarine you're observing.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.820
 So the whole game is to cover up the propeller

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.940
 when you're in a public port for secrecy.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.660
 So no one knows how many blades you've got

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.060
 on your propeller in case someone spots you.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.660
 And this, I should say it's a diesel electric submarine

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.140
 as well, so it's slightly different.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.860
 But it's for sneaking around the Norwegian fjords

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.300
 and for that kind of stuff.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.900
 And I love this, I'm just going to read this.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.380
 The snorkel has a valve at the top that automatically closes

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.860
 if a wave goes over it, right?

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.780
 The snorkel bit.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.500
 But then when that happens, the diesel engine suck loads

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.780
 of the air from the rest of the submarine

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.980
 and that means the air pressure drops.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.300
 So it really hurts everyone's ears on board.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.460
 But what that then means, if the air is moist,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.700
 the air spontaneously condenses

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.220
 and it starts raining inside the submarine

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.140
 because of the pressure changes that have happened.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.900
 So he says that's an amazing experience.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.740
 - Oh, wow.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.860
 On propellers, this is going from memory

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.860
 so it might be wrong, but I think it's right.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.820
 There was an episode of, I think, Doctor Who

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.540
 where they needed a submarine.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.540
 They got this model of submarine

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.220
 and they looked at the propeller

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.300
 and it was exactly the same as one of the most

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.340
 secret submarines that the UK had.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.740
 And the UK defence were like, holy shit,

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.140
 where did they get the designs from?

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.980
 That's absolutely ridiculous.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.100
 And they brought these people into a questioning

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.340
 and said, well, where did you get it from?

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.980
 And it turned out they'd been to Woolworth's

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.980
 and just bought a toy submarine and used it

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.340
 and just by coincidence, it had the exact same

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.660
 specifications as this British nuclear submarine.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.020
 - Oh my God.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.340
 - That's amazing.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.920
 (upbeat music)

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.220
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.780
 and that is my fact.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.660
 My fact this week is that the original

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.780
 little mermaid production was almost delayed

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.620
 because all of their underwater bubbles

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.980
 got caught up in the Tiananmen Square incident.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.860
 - And tell me Dan, what exactly was the Tiananmen Square incident?

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.380
 - It was a-

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.860
 - For all of our global listeners.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.140
 - It was a sojourn by the Red Army.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:39.940
 - This was quite a surprising fact that the little mermaid,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.140
 which was the last entirely hand drawn

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.660
 and hand coloured movie that Disney was producing,

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.300
 decided that rather than photocopying

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.100
 drawings of underwater bubbles,

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.100
 they would have each individual bubble,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.940
 millions of them drawn by hand

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.500
 and they couldn't do that on their own.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.460
 So they farmed that out to a company

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.980
 that was called Pacific Rim in China.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.980
 - Great film, great film.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.020
 - And the offices of Pacific Rim happened to be

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.100
 right next to Tiananmen Square

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.980
 and when suddenly all the chaos broke out

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.660
 in Tiananmen Square, all the protests

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.380
 and all the military coming in,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.820
 the bubbles were still being drawn

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.700
 and they were locked up in a safe there

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.300
 and the producers didn't know

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.860
 whether or not they were going to be able to get them out.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.740
 They didn't know how long this was going to last.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.220
 - And they're so fragile bubbles.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.220
 I mean, that will pop at the slightest tweak, won't it?

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.820
 - Exactly, and it'll give away their location

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.980
 if one goes off as well.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.260
 - If you look carefully, a lot of the bubbles

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.740
 in the little mermaid are actually eggs

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.220
 that have been just up to the user then, yeah, yeah.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.540
 But they did manage to get them out of the building.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.900
 They got them onto a ship.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.660
 So it's quite interesting there to ship

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.100
 their bubbles back over to the States

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.820
 and then they made it into the film, but it's, yeah.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.780
 - So if you look at the film,

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.420
 so I was watching lots of clips, and once you know this,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.820
 there are shed loads of bubbles.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.900
 Every time they move, there's bubbles all over the shop.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.820
 - To be honest, like that's one of the best things

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.140
 about the movie is the way they animated the water.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.060
 - Yeah, it's very good.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.420
 And it would have been worse, I think,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.980
 if they had done the photocopying.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.940
 - Agreed, agreed.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.220
 - 'Cause it was quite interesting.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.420
 So it's the Xerox process they called it,

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.820
 which is a bit like photocopying,

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.660
 but for animation and for film.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.460
 And they should have used that

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.620
 'cause that's what people had been using.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.860
 I think the last film to use the hand-drawn method

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.740
 was Sleeping Beauty, which was ages before that.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.740
 But when you photocopy stuff, it gives it a black outline.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.340
 And this was so interesting

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.220
 because if you watch any Disney film

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.500
 that was Sleeping Beauty in before,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.180
 so like Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.860
 there's no black lines around the cartoons.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.260
 So they're all like realistic.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.700
 Like I'm wearing a yellow jumper.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.740
 There's no black line around it.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.380
 There's just yellow jumper, then air.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.500
 And that's if you watch Sleeping Beauty, you'll see that.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.540
 Every film after that has black lines around the cartoon.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.620
 So they look more cartoon-y and less realistic.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.100
 And if you do want to sound like a big old snob,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.580
 you can just say is a very inferior period

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.860
 of animation for Disney before they fixed it.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.100
 And sweetly, that was for Beauty and the Beast.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.660
 They brought the beauty back.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.620
 - The co-director of The Little Mermaid, John Musker, said,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.700
 'cause he was interviewed about the bubble thing.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.780
 And he said, "Yeah, no, we cared about the guy

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.380
 "in front of the tank and that democracy might take root there.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.140
 "But we were wondering, what's going on with our bubbles?"

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.980
 (laughing)

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.020
 - In the next paragraph, he reveals he was joking.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.140
 'Cause this was an incident where,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.740
 well, there was loads of protests in China,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.300
 pro-democracy protests,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.900
 and the Chinese government went in and killed a lot of people.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.340
 James and I, you and I met Kate Adie,

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.580
 who was there at the time. - I am.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.620
 - And the footage, The Little Mermaid premiere.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.660
 (laughing)

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.780
 - Wow.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.940
 - She's always been heart-hitting, but I had no idea.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.020
 Right in the thick of it.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.300
 - Yeah, she's bubble-obsessed.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.420
 She was there, and the footage that was taken,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.180
 I think James, am I right in saying it's particularly

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.820
 the footage of the man standing in front of the tank,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.380
 she had to get that back to a British embassy,

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.380
 and she had some Chinese guards trying to take the camera,

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.260
 at reals offer, so that she couldn't get through.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.100
 So she ended up kicking one of them in the nuts

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.860
 and climbing over a wall in order to get into safety.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.060
 And yeah, so that's how we have the footage.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.260
 It was Kate Adie. - Oh, wow.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.100
 I didn't know that.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.940
 - I believe that's right.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.260
 It's certainly what she told us, yeah.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.100
 - Just a fact for Dan, about that,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.100
 the Simpsons, they have an episode where they go to China,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.900
 and in the middle of it, there is a picture on Tiananmen Square,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.700
 it says Tiananmen Square, on this site in 1989,

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.620
 nothing happened, which is obviously about the fact

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.300
 that references to it are banned in China,

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.060
 but then Disney decided to omit that episode of The Simpsons,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.900
 so you can't watch that in China anyway.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.740
 - Really?

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.580
 - Yeah.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.700
 - What's the Disney film that they made about Mermaid?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.180
 - Little Mermaid, Andy.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.020
 - Uh-uh.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.860
 (laughing)

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.500
 - The first Disney film about a mermaid was Splash.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.460
 - You didn't say, you didn't set a specify first.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.340
 - Yeah, you didn't.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.580
 - You just said, what's the film they made?

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.580
 - Oh, what was the first one?

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.420
 It was Splash.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.260
 - Daryl Hanna.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.940
 - Daryl Hanna, and falling in love with Tom Hanks.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.780
 Who wouldn't?

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.340
 - Walking out of the water with her bum out.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.180
 - Yeah.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.500
 - How it was a teenager when that came out.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.180
 - That must have been formative.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.380
 - I think they've re-edited it,

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.940
 so she's got longer hair now.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.140
 So I'm afraid, James, the next time you--

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:11.980
 - Really?

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.140
 - You want to see Daryl Hanna's bum,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.140
 you'll have to do it some other way, basically.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.460
 Because, yeah, there's a waste to do that

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.860
 on the internet these days.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.700
 I don't believe so.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.460
 No, yeah, so they made Splash way before

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.380
 they made The Little Mermaid, like five years before.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.260
 They were trying to make films for grown-ups,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.060
 and this was their first one.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.860
 You know, she's a mermaid, Tom Hanks is a man,

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.620
 and they fall for each other.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.460
 - But we've all seen Splash.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.540
 - It's the story of The Little Mermaid.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.580
 - I can't believe you're leading with that,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.220
 rather than the fact you just dropped in

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.420
 that they've extended Daryl Hanna's hair

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.740
 in the modern version to cover her bum.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.980
 - Oh, they didn't give her a hairy bum, they extended.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.580
 (laughing)

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.420
 I misunderstood.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.700
 - You didn't say which hair they extended in best.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.260
 - Yeah, they've extended her back hair.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.580
 (laughing)

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.100
 - Yeah, they've extended her bum hair,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.820
 and then they plait it into her head.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.660
 - Oh, God.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.380
 - The British Board of Film Classification

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.260
 have some things to say about The Little Mermaid.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.380
 In the Additional Issues section of the website,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.460
 it says, "In one scene, a female character

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.380
 "comically shakes her bottom,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.900
 "while singing about the importance of body language

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.700
 "in attracting a man."

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.020
 - Hmm.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.060
 And what's the issue there?

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.060
 - Violet.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:20.900
 - Not woke.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.580
 (laughing)

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.580
 I had a look at a lot of other Disney movies on the BBFC

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.380
 to see what their additional issues are.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.700
 In Frozen, there is some very mild humor,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.900
 including reference to picking your nose and eating it.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.660
 (laughing)

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.260
 - Which is offensive to children.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.260
 - It's on there.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.100
 - Wow.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.700
 - In Brave, there are moments of mild rude behavior,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.740
 such as a Scotsman burying his behind

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.180
 by lifting his kilt.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.260
 (laughing)

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.700
 - Well, they've extended his hair, so that's okay.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.540
 (laughing)

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.020
 - And in Honey, I Struck the Kids,

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.580
 which was also a Disney movie,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.740
 there are upsetting scenes when a friendly aunt is killed.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.020
 (laughing)

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.860
 - So just beware.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.700
 - But this is someone's job.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.540
 - Wow.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.780
 'Cause there are those terrific Christian websites

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.980
 which do this kind of forensic detail.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.220
 - Well, this is on the BBFC.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.180
 - Wow.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.820
 - I quite like how they did Ariel's whole look,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.460
 'cause Daryl Hannah played a part

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.020
 in how Ariel looked as well.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.460
 - So she is the little mermaid, right?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.580
 - Yeah, so Ariel is the little mermaid.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.700
 Splash had come out,

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.620
 and so they changed her hair color,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.100
 Ariel's hair color to red,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.460
 because the original hair color was too similar

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.300
 to Daryl Hannah's.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.420
 So that had a very immediate influence on their movie.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.660
 The actress, Alyssa Milano, was the face model for Ariel.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.140
 There was a different body model who they had come in,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.260
 who was a comedian improviser,

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.620
 who came in and would do all the scenes.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.380
 So you can see the footage of them doing the scenes,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.700
 so all the body movements were equaled.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.540
 - Is that Sherry Stoner?

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.380
 - Sherry Stoner.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.340
 - Well, there are hardly any people alive

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.740
 with the body of the little mermaid, aren't there?

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:49.580
 (laughing)

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.900
 There was actually very little competition for that.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.580
 - You're right, there is half of the body.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.340
 - A lot of her material as a stand-up

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.020
 is about the fact that she has a massive tail.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.860
 (laughing)

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.900
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.700
 But the most interesting one is the hair

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.340
 and how it moves in the water.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.540
 And that was inspired by the Space Shuttle astronaut,

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.740
 Sally Ride.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.260
 They looked at her hair in zero gravity

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.340
 to create the water look that they needed.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.260
 So yeah.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.980
 - Someone who gets a lot of shit is Sebastian

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.940
 and the little mermaid.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:15.780
 - The crab.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.620
 - Yeah.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.580
 - The friendly Jamaican crab.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.420
 - Oh.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.260
 - Under the sea.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.700
 - What's Sebastian's accent?

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.540
 - Jamaica.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.380
 - Jamaica.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.580
 - Incorrect.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.420
 - Caribbean.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.420
 - Well, I mean, you just broadened it.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.260
 So it's not fair.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.540
 (laughing)

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.700
 So Sebastian, he was originally gonna be called Clarence

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.980
 and he was gonna be like a posh English guy.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.980
 And they made a good move.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.900
 'Cause you can imagine he was really strict,

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.660
 that Zazu type character.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.260
 You can imagine why they wanted to do that.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.860
 - Rowan Atkinson style voice.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.700
 - Exactly.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.060
 And then they thought, let's make him more fun.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.380
 So they decided to make him Jamaican.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.540
 But then they found the person to play him, Samuel E. Wright,

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.780
 who'd just been in a film playing Dizzy Gillespie.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.460
 And Samuel E. Wright couldn't do a Jamaican accent,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.420
 but he could do a Trinidadian accent.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.900
 So actually, tell everyone you know,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.380
 he doesn't speak with a Jamaican accent.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.220
 - That's really interesting.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.060
 - He speaks with a Trinidadian accent.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.060
 - Because a few years later, when they made Cool Runnings,

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.100
 they brought in these four Jamaican actors.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.900
 And they said, okay, can you do these lines?

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.340
 And they said, well, you don't sound Jamaican.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.100
 And they're like, well, we actually are Jamaican.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.940
 This is how we talk.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.740
 And they're like, no, no, we need you to sound

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.380
 like the crab from The Little Mermaid.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.700
 - No way!

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.140
 James, we've pieced it together.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.980
 - It's amazing.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.340
 The producer basically said,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.060
 if you don't sound like Sebastian, I'm gonna get fired.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:33.020
 And so they all put on these kind of like fake Jamaican accents.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.420
 - That's amazing.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.260
 - That's bizarre.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.500
 - Wow.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.380
 - Okay, so the reason that the crab was made Jamaican,

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.700
 let's say Jamaican, despite the accent,

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.940
 was the songwriters were working literally

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.700
 in the room next door to the animators.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.260
 And each other were influencing

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.700
 how the movie was going along.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.780
 And one of the songwriters came in

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.780
 and said to the filmmakers,

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.180
 tell me about Sebastian the crab.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.420
 They said he's this British posh guy.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.500
 They said, can you make him something more Caribbean?

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.700
 Can you make him Jamaican?

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.700
 Because I think this song under the sea

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.140
 will be great as like a Calypso-style song.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.820
 And the accent will go great with that.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.540
 And they changed it for that reason

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.540
 'cause they were working in tandem together.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.020
 - So if you find a VHS of The Little Mermaid

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.220
 and it has a drawing of the penis on the cover,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.420
 could be worth up to 30,000 pounds.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.260
 - Really?

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.900
 - And it doesn't work if you just get one

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.220
 and get it right on yourself.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.140
 - Is that true? - This is true.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.020
 - I thought this was sort of urban myth.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.580
 - There are mythy parts about it.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.540
 So there's a guy called Bill Morrison

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.220
 who was drawing all the artwork,

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.740
 a little mermaid who's doing all the different things.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.980
 And they said, can you do the VHS?

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.580
 And they said it really last minute

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.580
 and it was the middle of the night

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.300
 and his deadline was just coming up there.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.580
 And he just sort of scribbled something together.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.020
 And it had to look like this sort of castle

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.060
 in the background.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.900
 And castles have turrets.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.940
 And turrets can look phallic sometimes

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.980
 if you're not concentrating.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.940
 - Your penises all have cretolations.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.780
 - Yeah.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.620
 - Yes, they do.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.460
 - Okay.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.220
 - How do you think we fire arrows out of them?

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.540
 (laughing)

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.140
 - When do you think the boiling oil comes from?

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.380
 (laughing)

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.100
 So he rushed to do it and then he made this thing

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.500
 and no one noticed it for ages.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.340
 - So was it deliberate?

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.220
 - No, no, that's the thing.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.500
 - It was just, yeah.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.300
 - The myth goes that it's some pissed off employee of Disney

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.500
 who put a penis in there to piss everyone off.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.900
 In actual fact, it was this guy who was doing his best

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.540
 and just happened to accidentally draw a penis

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.380
 in the thing.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.140
 And then it basically came about that someone noticed it

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.860
 once it had already been imprinted

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.980
 and Disney were furious.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.300
 (laughing)

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.740
 They're not really so relaxed about this kind of thing.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.300
 They said, if we find out who did that,

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.460
 they're never gonna work for us again.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.860
 And this guy's company was,

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.220
 this was most of their work doing stuff for Disney.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.180
 So in the end, you either kind of pretend

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.740
 that you don't know anything about it

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.700
 or you say, look, it was us, but it was an accident.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.540
 And that's what they did.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.260
 And eventually Disney sort of realized that they were,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.180
 it was an accident and they carried into it.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.380
 - Imagine the Dick Mountain ride at Disneyland.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.940
 (laughing)

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.620
 - Very, very, very steep up.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.300
 Very, very, very steep down the other side.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.740
 - Good.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.020
 - And Bill Morrison won for Dan.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.300
 He left this company and went to work for the Simpsons

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.940
 where he did some drawing for them.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.780
 So there you go.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.980
 - Is that why Homer Simpson's head

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.300
 also looks like a penis?

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.340
 (laughing)

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.380
 - This was about bubbles in "The Little Mermaid"

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.020
 in "Frozen", which is another princess movie.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.580
 Obviously not bubbles, but snow.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.140
 Snowflake, stuff like that.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.620
 And there is a thing down which I'm sure you know about

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.100
 called the "Diatlov Pass" incident.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.500
 It's a conspiracy theory thing

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.340
 about a load of kids who went walking

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.820
 just outside of Katrinberg.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.860
 - And disappeared, doesn't mean anything.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.860
 - They disappeared and we never know what happened to them.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.340
 And last year, thanks to "Frozen",

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.980
 we might have found out what happened to them.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.460
 And that's because the technology they used

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.980
 to make the snow in "Frozen" was so amazing,

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.740
 like the computer programs,

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.860
 that you could use that to work out

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.260
 what happens with avalanches.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.940
 There was a scientist called Johann Gaum,

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.060
 who was from the Snow Avalanche Simulation Laboratory

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.220
 in Switzerland.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.540
 And he saw "Frozen" and he thought,

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.020
 "What they're doing is amazing."

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.860
 And he went over and he said,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.780
 "Can I borrow your technology

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.780
 "to show what happens with avalanches?"

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.940
 And he tried it and using the lie of the land

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.220
 in "Diatlov" and stuff like that,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.540
 he showed that it was possible

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.820
 that these kids might have been taken away by an avalanche

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.020
 as opposed to a Yeti or aliens

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.380
 or whatever everyone else thought.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.980
 - Wow. - And that was "Frozen".

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.140
 - That was "Frozen" that did it.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.620
 - 'Cause I thought you were gonna say

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.180
 the other sort of wild theory about "Frozen"

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.380
 is the reason that that title was picked for the movie

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.100
 was to stop everyone from spreading the idea

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.380
 that Disney was "Frozen" cryogenically.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.940
 So if you went on Google

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.580
 and you put Disney, "Frozen",

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.580
 you get the movie now as opposed to this-

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.620
 - Walt Disney's head.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.780
 - Walt Disney's head has been-

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.740
 - That's so cryogenically. - "Frozen" cryogenically, yeah.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.740
 That is a theory out there.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.320
 (upbeat music)

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.660
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.980
 and that is Andy.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.060
 - My fact is that the longest road tunnel in the world

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.060
 is so long that the builders recruited a team of psychologists

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.060
 to stop people crashing halfway through.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.900
 So this is a tunnel called the Ladal Tunnel in Norway,

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.540
 and it is 24 kilometers long.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.940
 So what's that, 17, 18 miles?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:18.940
 It's quite, it's long.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.580
 - Yeah, it's the longest.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.100
 - It's been over 25 years now,

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.140
 and it helps people drive between Oslo and Bergen.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.580
 And it's partly because Norway is so crinkly,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.420
 and it's hard to get around,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.500
 and the perilous crossing the mountain path is in winter.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.420
 So you either fly little distances in small planes,

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.940
 which is a big way of getting around there,

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.500
 or you drive, but this allows you to drive much straight up

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.340
 'cause you're in a tunnel.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.180
 That's how tunnels work.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.260
 - Yeah, it helps goods get through as well.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.540
 - Completely, yeah, yeah, all of that.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.780
 So it was a very impressive engineering project, but--

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.420
 - Do we know the effect of the psychologist,

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.180
 like what they said, and what happened?

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.140
 - Yeah, that's the important part there.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.060
 - Yeah, that's what they did.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.140
 They were consulted on how people can drive through

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.780
 this tunnel and not go crackers,

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.740
 because it's 20 minutes of the same lighting,

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.940
 the same panels passing you, it's hypnotic, you're driving.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.060
 - I'm already going crackers just from you saying that.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.220
 - You've crashed into the wall, James, there we go,

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.060
 you've hit the wall.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:13.900
 - And no radio signal.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.620
 Can't get radio forward in the middle of a tunnel, can you?

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.460
 - Exactly. - Always the annoying thing

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.460
 about tunnels. - That's true.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.740
 - It's like being in a nuclear submarine, basically.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.500
 - You should pre-download before you go through the tunnel.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.340
 - Pre-download before you go through.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.980
 - You've got to talk about this pre-download thing.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.820
 - So the shrinks, basically,

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.260
 they were a crack team of shrinks were called in and said,

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.220
 "Oh, yes."

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.780
 And they said, they said--

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.060
 - They were the people who were originally cast

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.900
 in the place of Astrid.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.700
 - Yeah, they were, and they said,

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.100
 "Well, you've got to break it up for people.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.420
 You've got to make it feel more varied."

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.220
 - I'll be honest, Andy, I think,

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.420
 without any psychological training,

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.940
 I reckon breaking things up

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.940
 so people don't get bored is pretty root one, isn't it?

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.140
 - Like this bit of me speaking.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.620
 And you've just helped to do that

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.500
 by breaking it up so that people at home

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.780
 haven't crashed themselves.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.660
 - That's what this podcast is, is us breaking up

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.460
 Andy's monotonous words for the listener.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.700
 - Okay, that's enough, Anna.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.540
 Okay, let's do another five colloases, Andy.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.540
 - Thank you.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.340
 - So basically, there are these mountain caves,

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.260
 as they get called, strategically placed along.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.660
 And every five minutes, you get to another mountain cave.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.780
 The lighting all changes completely.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.020
 The road opens out and it looks like you're driving into

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.340
 a sort of beautiful mountain pass.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.820
 It looks like there's daylight above you.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.660
 It's really gorgeous.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.580
 - I think it looks quite tri--

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.580
 I would feel like the drugs had kicked in

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.660
 as soon as I got to certain bits of it.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.740
 It's like avatar in there, all of a sudden.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.580
 - It is a bit.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.460
 - It's like you're in an aquarium,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.460
 like you're in the actual water with it surrounding you.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.420
 It's like mountainous-y dark blue, trippy as hell.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.660
 - I would want like, 'cause you're expecting a tunnel.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.940
 I'd go into that tunnel

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.660
 and suddenly you're not really in a tunnel anymore.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.340
 I agree with that and I would freak the fuck out of me.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.740
 - You've had a lot of tunnel already.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.340
 You're filled to the back teeth with tunnel.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.540
 What you want is a bit of variety.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.620
 I mean, I don't think people frequently go do

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.460
 lally halfway along a tunnel, so it clearly works.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.300
 - It is a good idea.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.820
 And I think one of the reasons it's a good idea,

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.660
 them doing this,

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.420
 is 'cause for the longest road tunnel in the world,

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.740
 not many vehicles drive through it.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.140
 So a thousand vehicles a day.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.140
 So basically the chances are you're gonna be driving through

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.460
 completely on your own,

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.220
 which is what would freak you out, right?

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.220
 Like if you're going behind a bunch of cars, it's fine.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.580
 - Have you ever been driving in like a place

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.500
 which is so the same that you think maybe I have died?

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.340
 - Yes, I have.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.180
 - I have done that.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.020
 - Oh my God.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.980
 - I was driving down the coast of Croatia

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.020
 and there's all these inlets.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.940
 And you kind of go on an inlet

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.620
 and you come background again and you drive for a bit

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.340
 and you have another inlet and another inlet

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.820
 and another inlet and they're almost all identical.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.020
 And like after about two hours of that,

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.940
 you're just like, maybe I have died.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.620
 Maybe one of these times I missed the corner.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.140
 I was doing this forever.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.540
 - It's fractal.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.380
 - Yeah.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.140
 - Do you have that thing when you're driving

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.020
 where you sort of come to and you realize,

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.580
 "Oh, I just drove half an hour there."

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.060
 You know, and then your conscious mind

00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.900
 reasserts yourself and you're like,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.980
 "Oh, and you've got a bloodied knife next to you

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.940
 "on the outside of the seat."

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.820
 And there's bags full of money in the boot.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.940
 - But not that bag.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.780
 Oh no.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:14.380
 I once, in fact, more than once

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.180
 when I worked in an office as an accountant

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.300
 would sort of come to at the desk

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.100
 and not remember how I got there.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.540
 Like as in I just sort of, I got up,

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.540
 got out of the house, got dressed,

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.660
 drive the car all the way to the office,

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.220
 sat down, started work without even realizing,

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.860
 "Yeah, yeah, promise, yeah."

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.180
 - Yeah, I see that.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.580
 Have you ever woken up midway through a fact on fish?

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.780
 (laughing)

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.460
 - I'm hopeful it might happen eventually on this.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.820
 It's called highway hypnosis.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.900
 And people noticed it all the way back to 1921

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.300
 when it was called road hypnotism.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.060
 And basically what it is, is even when you're looking

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.780
 at something, your eyes are making very slight movements

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.620
 all the time.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.380
 Like your eyes are always like darting this way

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.740
 and that and whatever.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.740
 And normally they're a response to something

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.660
 that's happening outside as a bird go past or whatever.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.620
 But what happens when you're driving for ages

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.700
 is your eyes start to go in this sort of predetermined pattern.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.220
 They start, they're still moving,

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.380
 but they move left and right, then up, then down,

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.780
 then left, then right, then up, then down and whatever.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.460
 And the thing is they don't really alert the brain properly.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.260
 The brain starts thinking that not really

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.620
 anything is happening.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.500
 And then you start losing concentration.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.060
 - So you should roll your eyes

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.100
 round and around and around.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.380
 - Well, you should take a break.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.660
 - Or have something, or watch something on your phone.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.500
 That's another.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.540
 (all laughing)

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.060
 - As long as you pre-downloaded it though,

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.700
 that's the impact of that.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.300
 - This tunnel, in 2000, I love this,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.060
 someone got married in the middle of the Laerdal tunnel.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.900
 Did you read this?

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.740
 - No.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.060
 - It was a young couple, young Norwegian couple.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.340
 And the groom was called Ronny Rinder.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.700
 And he said that his mother-in-law had attended the wedding,

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.900
 but she had been slightly skeptical about it.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.940
 And I just love this.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.180
 He said, "She's scared of two things, dogs and tunnels.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.220
 "We've recently bought two Alsatians,

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.020
 "and now we've got married in the tunnel."

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.020
 (all laughing)

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.140
 And I would say maybe the psychologist shouldn't.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.980
 (all laughing)

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.460
 - Another thing they have in this tunnel

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.740
 is a rumble strip in the middle of the road.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.580
 - Okay.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.220
 - And the idea is if you're driving along,

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.660
 you slightly fear off to the middle.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.940
 You hear it rumble, it wakes you up.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.980
 These things were invented in 1955

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.980
 by a guy called Harold Griffin.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.180
 And they were originally called Singing Shoulders.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.020
 (all laughing)

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.380
 - That's better.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.820
 - But they caused a 44% reduction

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.820
 on head-on fatal crashes if you have them on a road.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.140
 These are US figures.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.140
 - Wow.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.020
 - They should be the same in most countries.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.620
 - So head-on collisions are hugely caused

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.220
 by falling asleep or losing concentration.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.300
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.140
 - Right.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.860
 - And there are large areas of Michigan

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.340
 with no rumble strips.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.140
 So most places in America,

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.980
 they have to have them now on highways,

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.300
 but there are large areas of Michigan

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.700
 with no rumble strips.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.380
 Po-kwa, why?

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.380
 - Ooh.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.860
 - There's no double lane roads.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.980
 - That's good, in Michigan.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.300
 - No.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.100
 - They have to transport something

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.660
 which is delicate, like eggs, to the market.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.660
 And if they hit the rumble strips,

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.500
 they break all the eggs.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.340
 - All of that eggs for you.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.180
 - Exactly.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.900
 - And they're happy to have a full head-on collision

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.740
 as long as they don't break a few eggs.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.340
 - That actually weirdly, more eggs get lost

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.140
 by the rumble strips than in the full-on collision.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.980
 - Yeah.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.140
 - No, it's a certain group of people

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.380
 who didn't want them to.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.220
 - The Amish.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.420
 - The Amish.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.420
 - Who are the Amish?

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.540
 (laughing)

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.380
 - The Amish.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.220
 - The Amish.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.060
 - Or Amish.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.620
 - I've never, in my knowledge, called the Amish.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.060
 - Really?

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.460
 Do they not like rumble strips?

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.500
 - It's the horses.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.620
 The horses don't like them

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.100
 and they refuse to cross rumble strips

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.660
 'cause it makes them hard to set their feet down

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.380
 'cause of the way that they're...

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.220
 - Really?

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.060
 - You can't step over them.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:51.900
 - Not that broad.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.660
 - Yeah, but the horses just don't like it.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.980
 So, there are certain areas.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.940
 - They didn't even leave 'cause they didn't have a...

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.780
 (laughing)

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.700
 I was trying to do a rumble horse neck.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.540
 - That was really good.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.540
 - Didn't come out right, sorry.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.940
 - It weren't to be, you saw it, though.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.100
 What you're doing with your lips there.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.700
 - So, in any location in Michigan

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.220
 where horse-drawn buggies utilise the roadway,

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.780
 you're not supposed to use shoulder corrugations,

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.860
 which is what they call them,

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.060
 unless a crash history exists.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:14.900
 - Right.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.940
 London has a new tunnel.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.300
 In the week we record this.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.140
 - No.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:18.980
 - Yeah.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.340
 Have you guys been reading about the Silver Town Tunnel?

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.160
 - No.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.000
 - Oh, it's so good.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.840
 It's great.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.460
 It's just next to the Blackwall Tunnel,

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.940
 which is very, very traffic-y tunnel in London, basically.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.220
 It has to shut down, I think, 700 times a year.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.580
 It gets shut down 'cause the traffic just gets too crazy.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.220
 So, they've just opened another tunnel next to it,

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.420
 but bikes can't go along it because it's for cars.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.940
 So, they're running a sort of bike bus for it.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.300
 But, it's amazing how they built it.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.460
 So, you know, TBMs, tunnel boring machines?

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.780
 - Okay.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.500
 - The one that built this tunnel was called Jill,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.340
 after Jill Weiner,

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.140
 who was London's first female bus driver.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:51.980
 - Okay.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.380
 - And they wanted two tunnels, right?

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.220
 'Cause it's really big.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.200
 Stop me awning, James.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.460
 (laughing)

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.300
 They wanted two big tunnels, right?

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.020
 Normally, it's really hard to build two tunnels

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.100
 with the same machine,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.820
 'cause turning it round down there is a bastard.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.100
 You know, it's really difficult.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.900
 - So, reverse, just get some wing mirrors on there.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.460
 - Or don't they famously come out the other side?

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.500
 - Didn't they, sorry to interrupt,

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.740
 but for the channel tunnel,

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:21.140
 I think the boring machines, they just kept boring down.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:21.980
 - They sometimes do.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.980
 - And they buried them under the ground.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.020
 - Sometimes they do, yeah.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.140
 So, this one, they wanted to use it again.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.100
 They wanted to get good use out of this machine,

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.940
 'cause it's a massive factory.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.540
 Like, it's huge underground thing.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.980
 So, they put it, I just love this, on nitrogen skates.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.100
 They put it on compressed nitrogen.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.540
 Like, some skates would rest on compressed nitrogen,

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.260
 like a hovercraft.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.260
 And that allowed them to turn it round

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.340
 in a special underground chamber.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.780
 And then go back the other way.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.700
 - They must have had to build a massive underground chamber.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.300
 I mean, 'cause these things are up to 170 meters long.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.140
 - So, I don't know what that chamber was like,

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.140
 but it's crazy.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.580
 - Yeah, they are awesome.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.180
 And I think they do like to reuse them now.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.020
 They break up them up into little parts.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.220
 'Cause every one is like the width of the tunnel

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.660
 that's specifically made for that one tunnel.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.300
 So, you can't really reuse the whole thing,

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.980
 but you can take it apart and use it.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.220
 But yeah, in the olden days, they did random shit with it.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.540
 Like, as you say, in the channel tunnel,

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.300
 one of them was just like buried.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.220
 Another one in 2004 was--

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.060
 - So great.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:18.900
 I can't wait for archaeologists to find that.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.900
 That's going to be a great day for them.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.780
 - So, they literally just changed its directions

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.180
 and it bore its way down to the bottom of the--

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.540
 - I think it's going to come out in Australia sometime soon.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.780
 (all laughing)

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.460
 - It's going to split the world in half.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.860
 - I think it actually went into more of a lay-by.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.300
 - Oh, it is buried on the--

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.220
 - Yeah, and then they bricked it.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.060
 They bricked it up.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.940
 But it reminds me of that really sad Thomas Atank engine episode

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.020
 where they bricked one of the engines in.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:40.860
 - Henry.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.700
 - Henry, he's very sad.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.660
 - Why'd they do that?

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.500
 - He's been naughty.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.580
 - Oh, wow.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.580
 - He won't come out in the rain.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.140
 Anyway, we'll save that.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.740
 But there was another one in 2004.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.980
 One of the TBMs using the channel tunnel was sold on eBay.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.740
 There were obviously loads of prank bids,

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.860
 but then it was actually sold for 39,999 pounds.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.060
 - What was posted in package then?

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.580
 - That's such a good question, Dan.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.820
 You've hit the nail on the head.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.820
 I never thought I'd say this,

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.500
 but if only the buyer had been as smart as you are,

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.060
 'cause he bought it and he signed the contract

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.100
 and everything and then he got an email from him

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.220
 who was called Steddenum.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.060
 - Oh, no.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.020
 - Guess how much it was gonna cost him to collect it?

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.780
 - I mean, an insane amount of money.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.940
 So he paid how much for the thing?

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.500
 - He paid 40 grand.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.100
 - Which is a bargain.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.980
 Is it for a big tunnel machine?

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.260
 Yeah, second hand.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.580
 Like that's a--

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.540
 - Vintage.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.980
 - That's a really nice car, second hand, you know what I mean?

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.820
 - Yeah.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.540
 - Or you get a machine that could dig a channel.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.100
 - I don't think they're that road worthy, but yeah.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.540
 - Okay, what was--

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.340
 - Cost a quarter of a million pounds to move it.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.180
 - Wow.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.140
 (laughing)

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.420
 - And can you back out on that sale?

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.620
 Sometimes they're really strict on eBay about--

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.020
 - You can't back out on the tunnel even.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.860
 You can't do anything.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.440
 (upbeat music)

00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.460
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.180
 and that is Anna.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.540
 - My fact this week is that walking backwards

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.500
 is healthier than walking forwards.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.340
 - Wow.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.740
 - With some caveats, like, you know,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.260
 don't do it at Russia on a main road.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.620
 It's for a railway tunnel.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.580
 (laughing)

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.620
 - Railway tunnel.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.980
 This is just sort of a raft of stuff that's come out

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.900
 in the last 20 years, I guess,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.900
 about the various advantages.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.020
 Most crucially, burns more calories.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.780
 So like the metabolic cost of walking backwards

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.380
 seems to be significantly higher.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.780
 I think the first study was in 1995 that found this

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.660
 and it found that oxygen intake and heart rate

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.900
 of the various, I think it was 27 subjects,

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:42.500
 increased between 38 and 119% walking backwards

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.820
 compared to walking forwards.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.900
 - Okay, I have to say, I'm not massively surprised by that

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.140
 given that for two million years

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.500
 we've been evolving to walk forwards.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.060
 Like, doing something hard is harder

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.180
 than doing something easy.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.020
 - I agree.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.860
 - It's like doing press-ups constantly

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.180
 is harder than just lying there.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.180
 But that's because I'm involved with just lying there.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.380
 - You might as well say that walking like a kangaroo

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.420
 is healthier than walking like a human.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.260
 (laughing)

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.780
 - Basically, doing anything really difficult

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.460
 that feels unnatural is better for you.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.300
 - Yeah.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.140
 - Okay.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.580
 - I think so a lot of this stuff makes kind of perfect sense

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.340
 because it's doing stuff that you're not used to doing, right?

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.140
 So this is why it's often used in rehabilitation

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.980
 for things like osteoarthritis

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.980
 because let's say you've got knee problems

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.500
 'cause you put too much pressure on your knees,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.460
 you go for runs, you're walking on tarmac a lot,

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.860
 you start walking backwards,

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.980
 suddenly you're putting pressure on different parts

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.100
 that your quads are taking a lot more pressure

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.460
 or if you've got plantar fasciitis in your heels,

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.220
 oh my God, it's a pain, isn't it?

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.500
 I feel for you.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.260
 But if you start walking backwards,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.900
 then you don't have such an impact on your heels.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.260
 - Did anyone do some walking backwards for this?

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.820
 I did 15 minutes in my garden.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.660
 - Did you?

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.940
 - 15 minutes, that's a lot.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.620
 - Yeah, well, I couldn't be bothered doing any research.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.260
 - I meant to say you look fantastic today.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.400
 - Thank you, well, you should see my heels.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.700
 (laughing)

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.540
 - So how was it?

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.420
 - Well, to be honest, I didn't really see much difference

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.660
 in the 15 minutes I did.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.820
 Apart from, I would say it works slightly different muscles

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.340
 in my legs, like my Achilles probably,

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.340
 and my calf that normally wouldn't feel it

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.460
 after 15 minutes walk.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.300
 I could feel it after.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.260
 - Also, your neighbors all think you're a witch now?

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.100
 - Yeah.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:16.940
 - I'm no doubt.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.220
 (laughing)

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.700
 - I did, because quite a lot of my neighbors' houses

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.340
 overlook my garden.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.340
 And I didn't think, they probably think I'm a bit weird.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.260
 Yeah, they already know.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.420
 - Yeah, I'm sure you've done worse things in that garden.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.660
 (laughing)

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.540
 - Where did those bags of money come from?

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.800
 (laughing)

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.060
 But it's quite good.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:40.140
 I read a few articles where it said that backwards running,

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.180
 this post-book to backwards walking is quite good

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.900
 in warming up if you're an athlete,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.540
 because it uses slightly different joints and tendons

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.980
 as you would normally do.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.780
 Also, there was another person, an orthopedic specialist

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.020
 called Nicole Hass, who in one of the papers she said,

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.140
 that actually one of the main things is,

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.500
 it's using your brain in a slightly different way.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.340
 - Yeah.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.460
 - 'Cause like one of the things you're doing quite a lot

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.280
 when you're walking backwards, as I know,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.400
 is working out where everything is

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.880
 and what you're not falling over.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.520
 'Cause my garden is not very big

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.440
 and I had to do lots of laps of it to 15 minutes.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.960
 And all the time you're thinking,

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.720
 where did I leave that barbecue?

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.520
 - Yes, yes.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.440
 Well, next time you do it,

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.080
 you should do what a man called Patrick Harmon did

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.400
 when he took on a challenge to walk from San Francisco

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.560
 to New York, which is he walked backwards,

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.400
 but he had installed near the front of his chest

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.920
 a car mirror so that he could see everything

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.000
 that was behind him.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.180
 - I mean, it makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.420
 - He said it was good for him.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.180
 So he did this in 1915?

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.020
 - Yep.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.140
 - It took him about a year.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.420
 - Yeah, 290 days in total.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.580
 - About a year.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.460
 (laughing)

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.140
 - A big chunk missing for the whole year.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.460
 - The bulk of a year.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.420
 (laughing)

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.140
 - I'm really looking forward to going to your 60th birthday.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.140
 - Yeah, it's gonna be about 52.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.580
 (laughing)

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.460
 - And he claimed that it had made his ankle so strong,

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.720
 it would take a sledgehammer blow to sprain them.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.640
 So he clearly felt some kind of benefits.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.480
 - Yeah.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.020
 - It's interesting that he,

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.640
 'cause he did that 1915, did you say?

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.480
 - Yeah.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.880
 - 'Cause there was a guy called Pleny Wingo,

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.680
 who he's the one in the Guinness World Record Book

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.840
 because he walked 8,000 miles

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.480
 from Santa Monica to Istanbul, so a bit further.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.320
 But I think he believed he was the first person

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.520
 to come up with it.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.160
 - Twice as long, just when you say a bit further,

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.000
 and almost a year.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:31.840
 - A bit further.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.680
 (laughing)

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.880
 - Well, fact checker's striper today.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, more than actually, yeah.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.840
 - You don't want us doing down the backwards walkers,

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.680
 do you?

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.520
 They need to get there just as a--

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.600
 - Some respect, please.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.960
 Pleny Wingo, yeah.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.280
 - He lost his business and--

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.120
 - In the Great Depression.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:45.960
 - In the Great Depression.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.000
 So I'm so excited about it.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.960
 - We're gonna be seeing lots more

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.520
 of this kind of great stuff soon.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.760
 (laughing)

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.760
 So you're right, we're topical.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.600
 - Limber up.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.760
 He had the idea, 'cause he was listening to his daughter,

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.160
 his 15 year old daughter,

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.200
 her birthday party chatting to her friends saying,

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.160
 everything that could ever be done has been done now,

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.620
 'cause it was this age of stunts.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.400
 We've talked about flagpole sitting before,

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.120
 everyone was sitting on flagpoles,

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.520
 and we're crawling up mountains,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.600
 pushing peanuts up mountains with their noses.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.480
 And he said, "Not everything's been done.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.980
 "No one's ever walked backwards around the world."

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.600
 And then he thought, "Bugger, now I've said that,

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.880
 "I'll have to do it."

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.920
 And he tried to do it, and he got as far as Turkey,

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.320
 and then they kicked him out and told him to go home.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.360
 I don't think he did make his fortune.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.480
 It's very hard to tell.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.320
 - No, he didn't.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.160
 - It's pretty sure he didn't.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.000
 - He didn't.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.360
 - They said when he got to Turkey,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.920
 they said he had to leave the country for his own safety.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.760
 (laughing)

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.460
 'Cause I think the idea was that people

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.560
 were throwing things at him quite a lot.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.080
 - I'm surprised you got as far as that.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.240
 - Apparently, according to one article I read about him,

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.720
 he was in New York City walking backwards,

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.640
 and he agreed to walk backwards along the top ledge

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.400
 of a 12 story building in return for money.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.400
 And then loads of people paid him to see him do this,

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.520
 and he did it.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.640
 But the guy who was working with him

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.120
 and collecting all the money off there,

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.480
 onlookers just did a runner and took all his money off him.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.560
 - For the backwards runner.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.600
 - Well, if you're walking backwards,

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.040
 it's hard to catch anyone, isn't it?

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.720
 - That's crazy.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.320
 - His wife left him, Mrs. Wingo.

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.760
 - Oh no, I mean, I understand why she did it, but even so.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.800
 - But he was still walking backwards for decades.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.400
 So in 1976, he appeared on the Johnny Carson show,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.200
 one of these American talk shows saying,

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.880
 "I'm doing it again!"

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.520
 And he claimed he was gonna do another

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.360
 sort of round the world thing.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.320
 That suggests that he didn't make his fortune

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.160
 the first time.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.480
 - I don't think so.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.440
 - I think it does, sadly.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.080
 There is a profession who walked backwards

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.640
 maybe more than any other.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.160
 And maybe, I'm not certain about this,

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.120
 but it's a good, I think it's a good.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.840
 - Photographers?

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.680
 - I don't know.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.520
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.360
 - That's good content.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.680
 - I was reading a paper about sports people

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.080
 and they said rugby league players,

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.040
 handball athletes and soccer referees do a lot of baseball.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.680
 - Football referees is the one I saw.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.080
 - I think there's, is there not a famous one,

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.880
 I think we might have even mentioned it before,

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.840
 about at the White House,

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.200
 it's people who are doing the tour guides,

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.400
 they walk backwards forever.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.440
 - Pentagon, I think it was.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.360
 Yeah, where they have to memorize where the corner is

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.560
 so that they can go around it.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.400
 Yeah. - Why?

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.840
 - Is it so they keep an eye on people?

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.680
 - Yeah.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.520
 - Oh.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.360
 - Just get the mirrors.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.720
 - Get the mirrors, exactly.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.600
 - But I've trained as a football referee

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.440
 and for sure as part of the training,

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.440
 they teach you how to run backwards well.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.280
 - Don't they?

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.320
 - Yeah, or they don't teach you,

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.000
 but they just say make sure you know how to run backwards.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.280
 (laughing)

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.360
 - I used to do quite a lot, I'd say,

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.360
 when I was like when I was a nipper.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.200
 - Yeah.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.720
 - I was running backwards or a referee.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.040
 - Running for the referee.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.520
 - Did a lot of, oh.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.400
 - Was that avoiding the wedgie as they chased you?

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.240
 (laughing)

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.880
 - Okay, okay, okay, you can't be wedgie.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.800
 (laughing)

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.120
 - They could do a front wedgie.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.040
 - The front wedgie is horrible.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.920
 - It makes it look like a Disney tower.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.180
 (laughing)

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.220
 - There's another group of people

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.260
 who are becoming expert backward walkers in recent times,

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.180
 and that is celebrities.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:11.180
 So Taylor Swift spends a lot of her time walking backwards

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:14.580
 so that she can avoid the paparazzi taking photos of her.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.460
 - Is it so that they can't sell the photos

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.820
 because they're trying to sell those photos

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:18.660
 of her walking forward?

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:21.500
 - Now, as in the paparazzi stood in one particular place

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.220
 and you need to have your back to the paparazzo

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.940
 so that they can't see your face.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.220
 I saw quite a recent news article

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.700
 about her walking through the woods, right?

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.620
 - Yeah, she went and did a whole mountain trail,

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.180
 basically walking backwards

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.260
 so that the paparazzi couldn't get shots of her.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.860
 - Back up ahead, she should do.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.620
 Back up ahead and hold for the eye.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:39.660
 - That's a good idea.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.980
 (laughing)

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.620
 - But if someone's walking backwards,

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.460
 so she's walking backwards

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.140
 towards the paparazzi who were facing her.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.580
 - Let's say she's come out of the building,

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.980
 there's paparazzi waiting outside.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.820
 She faces the other way to get in the car.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.020
 - But I would film that, and that's like...

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.060
 - But it could be anyone.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.620
 It could be anyone with blonde hair.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:56.460
 - Oh, please.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.300
 I didn't know Taylor Swift asked anyone.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.820
 (laughing)

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.980
 I wouldn't even recognize her face,

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:05.460
 but there's an amazing woman called Justine Galloway.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.780
 I think we might have mentioned in our sports book

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.980
 that we happened to write semi-recently.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.100
 She's a runner.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.900
 She's 44, and she used to run loads of marathons.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.660
 And then in 2011,

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.140
 she was running her third Boston marathon,

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.700
 and she got really good times.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.940
 And she suddenly her left leg

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.700
 started staying up in the air too long,

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.180
 sort of swung out to the left a bit,

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.940
 and it just wasn't working properly.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.580
 And she basically got what is called runner's dystonia,

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.420
 which is a bit like the yips in golf,

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.380
 where you just suddenly kind of can't do it.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.640
 And within a few weeks, she couldn't run at all.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.260
 It's like this weird neurological issue

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.340
 where your brain and your body will not connect at all.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:47.260
 And she was obviously devastating,

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.060
 like running with her life.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.980
 And then she realized if she ran backwards, she was fine.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.820
 - Crazy.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.780
 - And now she's got the world record

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.860
 for running a half marathon backwards.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:57.900
 - Does she do mirrors?

00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:58.740
 Or does she do?

00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.580
 - She does mirrors, yes.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.380
 - Does she, when you do a half marathon with her,

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:04.180
 does she start at the end and go to the start?

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.180
 She passes everyone halfway.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.380
 - Yeah, she always gets moaned down in the middle, so.

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.220
 - So it is a competitive sport.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.500
 - Yeah, I mean, there are all sorts of records.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.580
 There aren't many full races of people running backwards,

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.020
 but there's a guy called Aaron Yoda, who's the world's best.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.940
 - God hold her, he is.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.660
 - Runs backwards, speaks backwards.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.220
 (all laughing)

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.660
 He's done a mile and five minutes, 54 seconds backwards,

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.100
 which I'm quite sure is faster

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.820
 than I could do a mile for four, for me, yeah, yeah.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.980
 - So walking backwards, right?

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.340
 Imagine you're walking backwards

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.780
 and stuff is happening in your peripheral vision.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.300
 Some people are better at noticing those things than others.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.740
 - Only if you're walking backwards?

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.660
 - Only if you're walking backwards, yeah.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:50.500
 - Can we guess this?

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.060
 - Is it like football, right?

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:52.900
 - Scottish people.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:53.740
 - It's a class of people.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.500
 - I'd be a stud-ist if you went to that place.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.620
 - Is it a profession or a nationality?

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.300
 - It's a hobby group.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:05.420
 - Oh, is that like birdwatchers or train spotters?

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.380
 - Not them.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.420
 - Think of a hobby that slightly more normal people might do,

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.020
 and the tunnel boring machine enthusiasts.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.820
 (all laughing)

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.420
 Oh, what's a normal hobby?

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.540
 It's something that cool people might do,

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.020
 slightly more cool people than you.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.260
 It's people who play video games.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.340
 - Oh yeah, those jocks, those bloody jocks.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.660
 - So there was a study that was done.

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:28.500
 - Are they cool?

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.700
 Sorry, coming questions.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.620
 - I was just thinking cooler than boring enthusiasts.

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:33.460
 - Oh, yeah.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.460
 - On a par for me.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.300
 - I actually was thinking,

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.460
 I'd love to write a film script set on a tunnel boring machine.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.900
 I just think that'd be really cool.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.300
 - Like a really slow version of speed.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.460
 (all laughing)

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.940
 - We gotta keep going at 0.25 miles an hour.

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.580
 - It's gonna blow.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.900
 - So the thing is right,

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.260
 they wanted to find out,

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.180
 do people who play video games have better perception,

00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.580
 and especially people who play,

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.460
 you know, like first person shooter games, okay?

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.300
 So they tried that,

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.020
 and they realized that actually,

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.220
 people have equal perception.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.860
 If you, Andy, and someone who plays video games

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.580
 are walking straight down a road,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.660
 then you equally can see things in your peripheral vision.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.820
 But for the people who play video games,

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.100
 when you're going backwards,

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.260
 they have much better perception.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:19.980
 And that's because in video games,

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.780
 often these shooters, they are moving backwards.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.740
 Like when you move backwards on your joystick,

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.460
 your character is so easy to do.

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:31.060
 So they're seeing that quite often in their day-to-day hobby,

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.460
 whereas we hardly ever see it,

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.420
 'cause we hardly ever walk backwards.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.500
 That's cool, that's cool.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.340
 - I thought you were gonna say it

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.940
 so that you had a peripheral view

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.580
 on seeing whether or not your mom came in

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:41.380
 to tell you to stop playing video games,

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.460
 so you just built a better...

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.860
 So video games are probably quite good.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.460
 (all laughing)

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:52.500
 - Nature's joystick.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.580
 (all laughing)

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.160
 (upbeat music)

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.460
 - Okay, that's it.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.500
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.900
