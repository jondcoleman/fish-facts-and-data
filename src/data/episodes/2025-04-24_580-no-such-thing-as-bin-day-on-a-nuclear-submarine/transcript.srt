1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,420
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,980
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,620
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,740
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,820
 My name is Dan Shriver.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,300
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,740
 and Anna Tyshinski.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,940
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,820
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,980
 And in a particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,260
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,420
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the first submarine

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,140
 to go around the world was only seen by one civilian,

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,980
 a Filipino kayaker who saw the periscope

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,900
 and thought it was a sea monster.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,820
 - It's pretty amazing because we have a photo of that man.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,380
 Like this is, it looks--

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,500
 - Did they take the photo?

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,060
 - So we'll get into the big story,

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,660
 but there was a photographer on board.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,340
 And so anytime the periscope went up,

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,540
 they took a photo of what the periscope was seeing.

24
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,660
 And in this shot, you had a man sitting there

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,860
 called Rufino.

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,220
 - Yeah, and we also know more about him

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,780
 'cause National Geographic went out looking for him.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,620
 - Yeah.

29
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,460
 - And they found him and interviewed him.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,660
 And that's when they found out

31
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,300
 that he thought it was a sea monster.

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,980
 He immediately went home and painted the names

33
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,700
 of Saints Peter and Paul on his boat

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,900
 for protection against the sea monster.

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,740
 - Sensible.

36
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,460
 - And by amazing coincidence,

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,180
 this submarine that we're about to talk about

38
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,900
 started and ended at Saint Peter and Paul

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,100
 Archipelago in the Atlantic.

40
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,940
 - It's incredible to see this.

41
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,900
 - What a coincidence.

42
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,740
 - Yeah.

43
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,580
 They've blown it wide open.

44
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,780
 - Fervent evidence that we are living in a simulation.

45
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,860
 - In a very unimaginative matrix.

46
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,900
 So yeah, this is a 1960, we're talking.

47
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,940
 Middle of the Cold War.

48
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,540
 The Americans and the Soviets are not getting on very well,

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,620
 but maybe there's gonna be a peace summit in Paris.

50
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,740
 But before they do that,

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,020
 the US decided to show off a bit and say,

52
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,340
 we've got a new submarine that can go all the way

53
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,900
 around the world with no one noticing it.

54
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,380
 And so that's why they did it.

55
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,220
 It was called Operation Sandblast.

56
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,020
 - They could just say they'd done it, couldn't they?

57
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,620
 But literally we sailed all the way around the world

58
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,780
 underwater without anyone noticing.

59
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,700
 - Yeah, but you're still here.

60
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,060
 That's 'cause we went all the way around the world.

61
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,580
 - Yeah, we just finished.

62
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,860
 They just should have sent it underwater

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,860
 and they just had it coming through a big tape at the end.

64
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,700
 - Yeah.

65
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,620
 - They were really hardcore bright.

66
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,500
 So there were a couple of moments where it looked dodgy

67
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,220
 where really they should have come up.

68
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,060
 And they didn't.

69
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,420
 There's one instance where there was a member of the crew

70
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,820
 who had kidney stones,

71
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,500
 and they did have to get him off the submarine,

72
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,460
 sort of halfway through the mission.

73
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,300
 And they-

74
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,100
 - They fired him out of the torpedo.

75
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
 - Basically, that might have been an option

76
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,340
 because what they ended up doing

77
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,900
 was putting up a bit of the submarine out of the water

78
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,500
 for him to be collected from it

79
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 while keeping the main hull underneath.

80
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,340
 - And they didn't know, like,

81
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,660
 none of the crew knew what they were doing, did they?

82
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,900
 Until they were out at sea, under sea.

83
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,980
 There was just their captain captain beach.

84
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,540
 It was quite nice giving it with sandblast.

85
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,380
 - Amazing.

86
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,200
 - Yeah.

87
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,540
 - And giving it, they were at sea.

88
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,380
 What's the sea surrounded by?

89
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,220
 The beach.

90
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,660
 - Yeah, and it's got a beach under it, arguably, as well.

91
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,620
 - Well, let's discuss that, shall we?

92
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,700
 - Where is the beach?

93
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,220
 I don't want to go on your package beach holiday.

94
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,060
 - Yeah, exactly.

95
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,180
 I don't want to go on the picnic on the beach.

96
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,500
 Everyone, get your scuba gear on.

97
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,780
 But yeah, he didn't tell the crew

98
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,220
 until they were out seeing underwater.

99
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,500
 And I think the crew had just been told

100
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,060
 to prepare to be away a little bit longer than usual.

101
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,660
 And then they're going around the world.

102
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,140
 - Yeah, they were told to get all the tax details in order

103
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,260
 'cause it was going to go over the tax year

104
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,100
 while they were away.

105
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,940
 - Really?

106
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,760
 - So they're like, whatever you do,

107
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,020
 make sure you pay your tax

108
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,940
 because you're not going to be back in time for it.

109
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,180
 - It's a good excuse, though.

110
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,500
 It's a very good excuse.

111
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,660
 I love really like this.

112
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,060
 So the submarines these days,

113
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,140
 nuclear ones have their own way of making air on board.

114
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,900
 But this one didn't have that capacity

115
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,020
 'cause it was an early nuclear sub.

116
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,780
 It had to have its own,

117
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,060
 it had to have a snorkel, basically.

118
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,940
 It would stick up the periscope and go,

119
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,140
 (gasps)

120
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,740
 and then go back down again every night.

121
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,180
 - I actually, honestly,

122
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,380
 this might just be a lying spot for me,

123
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,300
 but I didn't realize what a nuclear submarine was.

124
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,020
 I thought a nuclear submarine was a submarine

125
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,540
 that had nuclear bombs on it.

126
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,460
 I think because the British tried to once are,

127
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,500
 that's why I thought they all were.

128
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,660
 - I just want to say the missiles are tried

129
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,780
 at the submarines of Vanguard.

130
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,100
 Sorry.

131
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,940
 - Sure.

132
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
 - But yeah, no,

133
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,580
 will it can be a sub with nuclear missiles on board?

134
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,060
 - It can be, but by definition,

135
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,460
 a nuclear submarine is something

136
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,620
 which is powered by a nuclear reactor.

137
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,900
 And what that means is you can just stay under water

138
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,740
 for way longer,

139
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,620
 and these days you can make your own oxygen

140
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,820
 using the nuclear reactor

141
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,420
 by taking in the sea water,

142
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,260
 separating the hydrogen and oxygen,

143
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,660
 and that means you could stay under water

144
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,380
 for months and years.

145
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,740
 - Right. - It's so cool.

146
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,820
 - There are various problems

147
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,900
 with the fact that we can now have submarines

148
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,620
 under water forever, essentially.

149
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,260
 There are various reasons why you can't do that.

150
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,020
 So one of which is like all your clothes

151
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,660
 get so dirty in the end, you run out

152
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,620
 and people get claustrophobic and upset.

153
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,820
 And another is rubbish.

154
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,300
 I didn't know what they did with rubbish.

155
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,220
 - Oh, on this? - On submarines.

156
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,420
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - On sort of all submarines now,

157
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,860
 they bring on board lots of metal sheets,

158
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,740
 and then they have a special machine on board

159
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,540
 that turns the sheets into a cylinder to be a bin,

160
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,060
 'cause obviously if they just brought on loads of bins,

161
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,900
 they take up too much space.

162
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,740
 - Yeah, yeah.

163
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,180
 - So then they throw-- - Space is in a premium, yeah.

164
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,260
 - Space is a premium.

165
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,300
 And then the bins all get secured

166
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,460
 once they're filled with rubbish,

167
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,500
 and then they just jettison them out of the submarine

168
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,460
 with weights on them to take them to the bottom of the sea.

169
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,380
 - To the bottom of the sea. - To the beach.

170
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,180
 - To the beach! (laughing)

171
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,220
 - The people sunbathing down there are pissed off about it.

172
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,660
 - That's crazy, 'cause the whole point of a submarine

173
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
 is that, I mean, the whole game of being in a submarine

174
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,620
 is that you're being quiet and undetectable,

175
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,300
 and enormous efforts are gone to

176
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,700
 to make submarines quiet and undetectable,

177
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,420
 but if they're just pooing out metal bins wherever they go.

178
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,740
 - But you're not gonna see it.

179
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,380
 - The ocean is big, Andy.

180
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,100
 - No, I know, but the whole thing is,

181
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,380
 I mean, the amazing lengths they go to not to be spotted.

182
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,540
 - Well then, can I just say about the bins?

183
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,820
 Given that you've raised the issue.

184
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,780
 - Oh my God, you sound like my neighbors.

185
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,620
 - What day do they go out again, is it?

186
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,820
 - It's Tuesday this week, it's a bank holiday.

187
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,380
 (laughing)

188
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,100
 Some people on submarines say that they're so careful

189
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,500
 about not drawing attention to themselves

190
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,380
 that eggs, old eggs they haven't eaten,

191
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,340
 are pre-broken before they're put

192
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,900
 in the trash disposal unit,

193
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,700
 because if they broke after being released,

194
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,260
 they would generate enough sound

195
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,460
 that they would be detectable.

196
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,300
 - What?

197
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,660
 That's how sensitive some other submarines are to noise.

198
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,500
 - Really? - Really?

199
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,780
 - Other submarines are constantly, yeah,

200
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,420
 they don't hear an egg break.

201
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,220
 They absolutely get so quiet down there.

202
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,700
 - I've just, it's not that quiet under the water.

203
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,420
 There's tons of animals down there.

204
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,780
 - It's pretty noisy, it's a lot.

205
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,660
 How about the engine running the submarine?

206
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,500
 What are they doing about that?

207
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,020
 - That's very heavily buffered.

208
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,660
 - They put, you know, the egg boxes,

209
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,900
 they put them around them.

210
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,660
 (laughing)

211
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,980
 - No, it is not how quiet they are.

212
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
 And so for example, bubbles.

213
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,820
 - Oh yeah?

214
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,300
 - They put the bubbles through a diffuser

215
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,380
 to spread them out before they release them.

216
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,220
 - Oh wow.

217
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,060
 - 'Cause otherwise there's a big plume of bubbles

218
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,900
 at the surface, very obvious.

219
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,740
 Oh, there's a submarine down there.

220
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,900
 - Is that like, if you feel a big fart coming

221
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,740
 and you somehow managed to let it go out

222
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,260
 in a very slow little--

223
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,580
 - It's exactly like that.

224
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,580
 And spies, MI5 spies are trained to do that.

225
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,820
 (laughing)

226
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,060
 Just in case.

227
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,940
 - They're the only ships that fly Jolly Rogers,

228
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,100
 which I should have actually phrased as,

229
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,740
 what flies a Jolly Roger?

230
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,900
 - Submarines.

231
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,220
 - I've screwed it up now, yeah,

232
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,180
 but if you hadn't done the research

233
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,540
 and I hadn't just said that, what would you have said?

234
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,660
 - I've known that for years.

235
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,620
 - Okay, but if you weren't a QI researcher.

236
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,260
 - I just can't imagine the world where I would think.

237
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,100
 (laughing)

238
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,940
 I don't know that right now.

239
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,780
 - I have a question.

240
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,860
 - Yeah.

241
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,020
 - Would be quite soggy.

242
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,380
 (laughing)

243
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,700
 - Kind of fly a flag under water.

244
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,820
 - That's a good point.

245
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,340
 They display it flattened.

246
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,660
 I guess they fly it when they come up in triumph.

247
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,900
 So I think traditionally if they've had a triumphant

248
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,500
 a sojourn, what do you call it, expedition?

249
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,340
 - Sojourn.

250
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,700
 - I don't think they call it sojourn, yeah.

251
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,540
 (laughing)

252
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,260
 I think they're pretty sure it most was.

253
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,740
 They go, "Subs, you're going on a sojourn

254
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,660
 "into the Baltic Sea now."

255
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,500
 - It's amazing.

256
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,340
 There's no space on the submarine

257
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,180
 'cause most people are wearing crevats.

258
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,180
 The number of cigarette holders you have to have on board.

259
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,380
 It just takes up loads of space.

260
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,860
 - And then the actual battle itself

261
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,100
 is called a box social.

262
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,060
 (laughing)

263
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,780
 - Whatever they're called, mission.

264
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,860
 - Yeah, good, mission.

265
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,980
 - They, when you come back and you've had a good one,

266
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,460
 you have the, you fly it.

267
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,300
 Fly the Jolly Roger.

268
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
 - If you've sunk somebody else.

269
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,820
 - I think if you've sunk someone else,

270
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,020
 but now I think they quite often do it

271
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,260
 'cause sinkings happen very rarely these days.

272
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,260
 And it's because it's a like middle finger

273
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,620
 to firstly Lord Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson

274
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,900
 who complained in 1901.

275
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,100
 As I'm sure you'll remember that submarines

276
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,420
 were underhanded, unfair and damned un-English.

277
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,420
 And then in 1914 someone sunk someone else in the war,

278
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,380
 the great one.

279
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,060
 And they came back flying the Jolly Roger to say,

280
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,880
 "Screw you.

281
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,420
 "You think we're underhand and piratee."

282
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,260
 That's what we've done.

283
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

284
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,940
 - Interesting.

285
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,540
 There's so many correspondence in the fish inbox,

286
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,020
 fin box about nuclear submarines.

287
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,900
 Almost all our listeners seem to be on nuclear submarines.

288
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,740
 It's stunning.

289
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,460
 - I didn't know the wifi was that good down there.

290
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,300
 Amazing.

291
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,140
 - Yeah.

292
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,980
 - They must pre-download.

293
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,820
 (laughing)

294
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,660
 - Good point, yeah.

295
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,500
 - Take a plunge.

296
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,340
 - Yeah.

297
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,160
 - What are they telling us?

298
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,000
 - Okay, well.

299
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
 - State secrets.

300
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,660
 - We've got some secret correspondence actually.

301
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,740
 Tim, I'll say Tim W writes.

302
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,900
 It's okay 'cause his friend's brother

303
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,420
 is learning to operate a nuclear submarine,

304
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,100
 but you should not flush the loo at sea.

305
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,940
 Why?

306
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,500
 - Well, there was once a U-boat that was sunk

307
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,980
 because they flushed, it was kernel-slit.

308
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,820
 - That's it.

309
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,660
 - Yes.

310
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,940
 - And yeah, the whole thing went down.

311
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,180
 - So that's a good reason not to do it.

312
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,980
 But basically you shouldn't dump fresh water at sea.

313
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,820
 - Okay.

314
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,820
 - Because it has a different sonar signature to seawater.

315
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,140
 It refracts sound waves differently.

316
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,020
 And so it shows up as a massive blob.

317
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,860
 - Oh, come on.

318
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,700
 - Wow.

319
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,540
 - It gives you away.

320
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,380
 - It gives you away.

321
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,820
 - And it just keeps samples of different ocean water

322
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,020
 that they are traveling in.

323
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,860
 - 'Cause space.

324
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,380
 - That gets put into the system whenever there's.

325
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,220
 - Space is limited.

326
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
 No, that's a good idea.

327
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,900
 That's a really good idea.

328
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,420
 - Well, it's actually, it's quite interesting.

329
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,620
 I didn't realize this about oceans.

330
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,540
 This story of the submarine going around the world

331
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,420
 has taught me this, that four days after

332
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,540
 they were thought to be a sea monster in the Philippines,

333
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,180
 they were going in the Lombok Strait

334
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,740
 and then they were making their way into the Indian Ocean.

335
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,900
 And then out of nowhere, they plunged

336
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,900
 from periscope depth height to 125 feet in 40 seconds,

337
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,300
 because the density of the saltwater is different

338
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,540
 in the Indian Ocean than it is to the Lombok Strait

339
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,660
 that they were coming through.

340
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,100
 - Hang on, so it wasn't, it's not like there's a wall there

341
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,380
 and they hit it and suddenly drop like a rice grain.

342
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,100
 - I feel like it is, I think it is.

343
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,180
 'Cause it came out of nowhere that they just plunged.

344
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,780
 - I have a feeling that when you go from one ocean

345
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,060
 to another, you do get those like quite solid blocks.

346
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,900
 - Really?

347
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,260
 - Yeah, because there's such different densities.

348
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,540
 - They can't mix.

349
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,380
 - Isn't that wild?

350
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,540
 - It's crazy.

351
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,300
 - I have a riddle for you.

352
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,860
 - Yeah.

353
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,380
 - The first people to successfully escape

354
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,740
 from a submarine did it in 1851.

355
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,660
 It was called La Plonge Marine Diver

356
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,340
 and it was operated like a pedalo.

357
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,820
 So there were three crew, two crew on the pedalo bit,

358
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,260
 cycling along and then one bloke was captain.

359
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,540
 Anyway, they sank in a test dive in Kiel Harbor

360
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,740
 and they waited five hours for someone to rescue them.

361
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,900
 No one came, there's an escape hatch,

362
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,420
 but they can't push it open because they're underwater.

363
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,820
 So the water pressure is too much.

364
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,580
 And then the captain who was the inventor

365
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,420
 and he was a guy called Wilhelm Bauer,

366
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,620
 he grabbed a small valve, unscrewed it and whipped it open.

367
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,380
 So water started coming in and his crewmates were like,

368
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,220
 "What have you done?

369
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,660
 "You've got mad, Wilhelm, you're going to kill us all."

370
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,220
 Why did he do it?

371
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,140
 - Is it the same reason as if you hold a straw,

372
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,940
 the top of a straw and then put it in water,

373
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,940
 the water stays in there because it releases pressure,

374
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,740
 which means then there isn't pressure holding the door closed.

375
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,980
 - Yes, 'cause what does the valve do?

376
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,100
 It lets water in from the outside.

377
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,940
 So as the water came in from the outside,

378
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,060
 then it equalized the pressure.

379
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,820
 So suddenly you've got water inside as well as out.

380
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,780
 So there's a really horrible moment

381
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,820
 where you all have to hold your breath

382
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,380
 as the whole thing fills up with water

383
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,540
 and you're suffocating to death

384
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,580
 'cause the CO2 levels are so extreme.

385
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,620
 And then suddenly it hit the pressure equality

386
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,260
 and it went pop open and it fired them up onto the surface

387
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,780
 in the middle of their funerals.

388
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,700
 - What?

389
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,500
 - Yeah, they were doing an impromptu service

390
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,620
 'cause it had been over seven hours.

391
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,380
 - Pretty quick, I'm sorry.

392
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,860
 I would like more efforts to be made for me.

393
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,100
 - He's been in that toilet 20 minutes,

394
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,540
 should we have a beer or not?

395
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,740
 - That doesn't make any sense, Adam.

396
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,100
 - The ones with the new partners.

397
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,380
 - They were having a service.

398
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,140
 They assumed they were dead.

399
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,340
 A little, not that the coffins weren't out yet.

400
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,180
 - Have you seen the other way

401
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,820
 that you can escape a submarine if it is sunk?

402
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,220
 - You disguise yourself as an egg, I know this.

403
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,780
 - No, what are the lifeboats of a submarine if it sinks?

404
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,460
 - Like smaller submarines?

405
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,300
 - Like torpedoes?

406
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,620
 - No, it's a suit that you wear.

407
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,260
 It's a life raft, but you're in the life raft.

408
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,100
 - You are in the raft.

409
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,660
 - And you have a picture homer working

410
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,180
 in the nuclear power plant with that big helmet on,

411
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,020
 but it's all fabric and he can see

412
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,940
 through a window in his face.

413
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,540
 It's, you could've just said picture a house chem suit

414
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,540
 and there's no need to bring the Simpsons in.

415
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,780
 That's another way, a more bland way

416
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,820
 of giving the picture to the audience.

417
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,980
 So you go out of the submarine and you slowly rise

418
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,780
 and then you're just bobbing up there,

419
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,620
 waiting to be rescued.

420
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,620
 - But I think a lot of the time

421
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,220
 if you're stuck, you're stuck, right?

422
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,060
 - Yes, it's not soul proof this.

423
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,580
 - Yeah, I think it's almost never that you can get out.

424
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,660
 - We have one other person, right,

425
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,660
 who actually was a sonar operator on a nuclear submarine.

426
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,340
 This is so cool because with sonar, right,

427
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,020
 what you can do is it lets you count the number

428
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,740
 of blades on a propeller.

429
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,580
 So you can guess what kind of ship something is

430
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,380
 by your knowledge of the propeller.

431
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,260
 - Because you fire your sonar at the propeller

432
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,180
 and sometimes it hits and sometimes it misses.

433
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,020
 - Pretty much.

434
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,420
 And then you can make an educated guess as to the kind

435
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,380
 of propeller and therefore what kind

436
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,780
 of submarine you're observing.

437
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,820
 So the whole game is to cover up the propeller

438
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,940
 when you're in a public port for secrecy.

439
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,660
 So no one knows how many blades you've got

440
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,060
 on your propeller in case someone spots you.

441
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,660
 And this, I should say it's a diesel electric submarine

442
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,140
 as well, so it's slightly different.

443
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,860
 But it's for sneaking around the Norwegian fjords

444
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,300
 and for that kind of stuff.

445
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,900
 And I love this, I'm just going to read this.

446
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,380
 The snorkel has a valve at the top that automatically closes

447
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,860
 if a wave goes over it, right?

448
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,780
 The snorkel bit.

449
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,500
 But then when that happens, the diesel engine suck loads

450
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,780
 of the air from the rest of the submarine

451
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,980
 and that means the air pressure drops.

452
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,300
 So it really hurts everyone's ears on board.

453
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,460
 But what that then means, if the air is moist,

454
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,700
 the air spontaneously condenses

455
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,220
 and it starts raining inside the submarine

456
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,140
 because of the pressure changes that have happened.

457
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,900
 So he says that's an amazing experience.

458
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,740
 - Oh, wow.

459
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,860
 On propellers, this is going from memory

460
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,860
 so it might be wrong, but I think it's right.

461
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,820
 There was an episode of, I think, Doctor Who

462
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,540
 where they needed a submarine.

463
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
 They got this model of submarine

464
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,220
 and they looked at the propeller

465
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,300
 and it was exactly the same as one of the most

466
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,340
 secret submarines that the UK had.

467
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,740
 And the UK defence were like, holy shit,

468
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,140
 where did they get the designs from?

469
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,980
 That's absolutely ridiculous.

470
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,100
 And they brought these people into a questioning

471
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,340
 and said, well, where did you get it from?

472
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,980
 And it turned out they'd been to Woolworth's

473
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,980
 and just bought a toy submarine and used it

474
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,340
 and just by coincidence, it had the exact same

475
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,660
 specifications as this British nuclear submarine.

476
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,020
 - Oh my God.

477
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,340
 - That's amazing.

478
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,920
 (upbeat music)

479
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,220
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

480
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,780
 and that is my fact.

481
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,660
 My fact this week is that the original

482
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,780
 little mermaid production was almost delayed

483
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,620
 because all of their underwater bubbles

484
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,980
 got caught up in the Tiananmen Square incident.

485
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,860
 - And tell me Dan, what exactly was the Tiananmen Square incident?

486
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,380
 - It was a-

487
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,860
 - For all of our global listeners.

488
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,140
 - It was a sojourn by the Red Army.

489
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,940
 - This was quite a surprising fact that the little mermaid,

490
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,140
 which was the last entirely hand drawn

491
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,660
 and hand coloured movie that Disney was producing,

492
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,300
 decided that rather than photocopying

493
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,100
 drawings of underwater bubbles,

494
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
 they would have each individual bubble,

495
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,940
 millions of them drawn by hand

496
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,500
 and they couldn't do that on their own.

497
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,460
 So they farmed that out to a company

498
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,980
 that was called Pacific Rim in China.

499
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,980
 - Great film, great film.

500
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,020
 - And the offices of Pacific Rim happened to be

501
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,100
 right next to Tiananmen Square

502
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,980
 and when suddenly all the chaos broke out

503
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,660
 in Tiananmen Square, all the protests

504
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,380
 and all the military coming in,

505
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,820
 the bubbles were still being drawn

506
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,700
 and they were locked up in a safe there

507
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,300
 and the producers didn't know

508
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,860
 whether or not they were going to be able to get them out.

509
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,740
 They didn't know how long this was going to last.

510
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,220
 - And they're so fragile bubbles.

511
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,220
 I mean, that will pop at the slightest tweak, won't it?

512
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,820
 - Exactly, and it'll give away their location

513
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,980
 if one goes off as well.

514
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,260
 - If you look carefully, a lot of the bubbles

515
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,740
 in the little mermaid are actually eggs

516
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,220
 that have been just up to the user then, yeah, yeah.

517
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,540
 But they did manage to get them out of the building.

518
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,900
 They got them onto a ship.

519
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,660
 So it's quite interesting there to ship

520
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,100
 their bubbles back over to the States

521
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,820
 and then they made it into the film, but it's, yeah.

522
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,780
 - So if you look at the film,

523
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,420
 so I was watching lots of clips, and once you know this,

524
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,820
 there are shed loads of bubbles.

525
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,900
 Every time they move, there's bubbles all over the shop.

526
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,820
 - To be honest, like that's one of the best things

527
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,140
 about the movie is the way they animated the water.

528
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,060
 - Yeah, it's very good.

529
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,420
 And it would have been worse, I think,

530
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,980
 if they had done the photocopying.

531
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,940
 - Agreed, agreed.

532
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,220
 - 'Cause it was quite interesting.

533
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,420
 So it's the Xerox process they called it,

534
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,820
 which is a bit like photocopying,

535
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,660
 but for animation and for film.

536
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,460
 And they should have used that

537
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,620
 'cause that's what people had been using.

538
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,860
 I think the last film to use the hand-drawn method

539
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,740
 was Sleeping Beauty, which was ages before that.

540
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,740
 But when you photocopy stuff, it gives it a black outline.

541
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,340
 And this was so interesting

542
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,220
 because if you watch any Disney film

543
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,500
 that was Sleeping Beauty in before,

544
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,180
 so like Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi,

545
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,860
 there's no black lines around the cartoons.

546
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,260
 So they're all like realistic.

547
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,700
 Like I'm wearing a yellow jumper.

548
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,740
 There's no black line around it.

549
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,380
 There's just yellow jumper, then air.

550
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,500
 And that's if you watch Sleeping Beauty, you'll see that.

551
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,540
 Every film after that has black lines around the cartoon.

552
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,620
 So they look more cartoon-y and less realistic.

553
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,100
 And if you do want to sound like a big old snob,

554
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,580
 you can just say is a very inferior period

555
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,860
 of animation for Disney before they fixed it.

556
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,100
 And sweetly, that was for Beauty and the Beast.

557
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,660
 They brought the beauty back.

558
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,620
 - The co-director of The Little Mermaid, John Musker, said,

559
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,700
 'cause he was interviewed about the bubble thing.

560
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,780
 And he said, "Yeah, no, we cared about the guy

561
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,380
 "in front of the tank and that democracy might take root there.

562
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,140
 "But we were wondering, what's going on with our bubbles?"

563
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,980
 (laughing)

564
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,020
 - In the next paragraph, he reveals he was joking.

565
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,140
 'Cause this was an incident where,

567
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,740
 well, there was loads of protests in China,

568
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,300
 pro-democracy protests,

569
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,900
 and the Chinese government went in and killed a lot of people.

570
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,340
 James and I, you and I met Kate Adie,

572
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,580
 who was there at the time. - I am.

573
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,620
 - And the footage, The Little Mermaid premiere.

574
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,660
 (laughing)

575
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,780
 - Wow.

576
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,940
 - She's always been heart-hitting, but I had no idea.

577
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,020
 Right in the thick of it.

578
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,300
 - Yeah, she's bubble-obsessed.

579
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,420
 She was there, and the footage that was taken,

580
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,180
 I think James, am I right in saying it's particularly

581
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,820
 the footage of the man standing in front of the tank,

582
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,380
 she had to get that back to a British embassy,

583
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,380
 and she had some Chinese guards trying to take the camera,

584
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,260
 at reals offer, so that she couldn't get through.

585
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,100
 So she ended up kicking one of them in the nuts

586
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,860
 and climbing over a wall in order to get into safety.

587
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,060
 And yeah, so that's how we have the footage.

588
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,260
 It was Kate Adie. - Oh, wow.

589
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,100
 I didn't know that.

590
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,940
 - I believe that's right.

591
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,260
 It's certainly what she told us, yeah.

592
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,100
 - Just a fact for Dan, about that,

593
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,100
 the Simpsons, they have an episode where they go to China,

594
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,900
 and in the middle of it, there is a picture on Tiananmen Square,

595
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,700
 it says Tiananmen Square, on this site in 1989,

596
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,620
 nothing happened, which is obviously about the fact

597
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,300
 that references to it are banned in China,

598
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,060
 but then Disney decided to omit that episode of The Simpsons,

599
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,900
 so you can't watch that in China anyway.

600
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,740
 - Really?

601
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,580
 - Yeah.

602
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,700
 - What's the Disney film that they made about Mermaid?

603
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,180
 - Little Mermaid, Andy.

604
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,020
 - Uh-uh.

605
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,860
 (laughing)

606
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,500
 - The first Disney film about a mermaid was Splash.

607
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,460
 - You didn't say, you didn't set a specify first.

608
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,340
 - Yeah, you didn't.

609
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,580
 - You just said, what's the film they made?

610
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
 - Oh, what was the first one?

611
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,420
 It was Splash.

612
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,260
 - Daryl Hanna.

613
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,940
 - Daryl Hanna, and falling in love with Tom Hanks.

614
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,780
 Who wouldn't?

615
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,340
 - Walking out of the water with her bum out.

616
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,180
 - Yeah.

617
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,500
 - How it was a teenager when that came out.

618
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,180
 - That must have been formative.

619
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,380
 - I think they've re-edited it,

620
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,940
 so she's got longer hair now.

621
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,140
 So I'm afraid, James, the next time you--

622
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,980
 - Really?

623
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,140
 - You want to see Daryl Hanna's bum,

624
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
 you'll have to do it some other way, basically.

625
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,460
 Because, yeah, there's a waste to do that

626
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,860
 on the internet these days.

627
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,700
 I don't believe so.

628
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,460
 No, yeah, so they made Splash way before

629
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,380
 they made The Little Mermaid, like five years before.

630
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,260
 They were trying to make films for grown-ups,

631
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,060
 and this was their first one.

632
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,860
 You know, she's a mermaid, Tom Hanks is a man,

633
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,620
 and they fall for each other.

634
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,460
 - But we've all seen Splash.

635
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,540
 - It's the story of The Little Mermaid.

636
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,580
 - I can't believe you're leading with that,

637
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,220
 rather than the fact you just dropped in

638
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,420
 that they've extended Daryl Hanna's hair

639
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,740
 in the modern version to cover her bum.

640
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,980
 - Oh, they didn't give her a hairy bum, they extended.

641
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,580
 (laughing)

642
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,420
 I misunderstood.

643
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,700
 - You didn't say which hair they extended in best.

644
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,260
 - Yeah, they've extended her back hair.

645
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,580
 (laughing)

646
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,100
 - Yeah, they've extended her bum hair,

647
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,820
 and then they plait it into her head.

648
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,660
 - Oh, God.

649
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,380
 - The British Board of Film Classification

650
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,260
 have some things to say about The Little Mermaid.

651
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,380
 In the Additional Issues section of the website,

652
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,460
 it says, "In one scene, a female character

653
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,380
 "comically shakes her bottom,

654
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,900
 "while singing about the importance of body language

655
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,700
 "in attracting a man."

656
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,020
 - Hmm.

657
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,060
 And what's the issue there?

658
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
 - Violet.

659
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,900
 - Not woke.

660
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,580
 (laughing)

661
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,580
 I had a look at a lot of other Disney movies on the BBFC

662
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,380
 to see what their additional issues are.

663
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,700
 In Frozen, there is some very mild humor,

664
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,900
 including reference to picking your nose and eating it.

665
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,660
 (laughing)

666
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,260
 - Which is offensive to children.

667
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
 - It's on there.

668
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,100
 - Wow.

669
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,700
 - In Brave, there are moments of mild rude behavior,

670
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,740
 such as a Scotsman burying his behind

671
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,180
 by lifting his kilt.

672
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,260
 (laughing)

673
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,700
 - Well, they've extended his hair, so that's okay.

674
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,540
 (laughing)

675
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,020
 - And in Honey, I Struck the Kids,

676
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,580
 which was also a Disney movie,

677
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,740
 there are upsetting scenes when a friendly aunt is killed.

678
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,020
 (laughing)

679
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,860
 - So just beware.

680
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,700
 - But this is someone's job.

681
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,540
 - Wow.

682
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,780
 'Cause there are those terrific Christian websites

683
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,980
 which do this kind of forensic detail.

684
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,220
 - Well, this is on the BBFC.

685
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,180
 - Wow.

686
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,820
 - I quite like how they did Ariel's whole look,

687
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,460
 'cause Daryl Hannah played a part

688
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,020
 in how Ariel looked as well.

689
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,460
 - So she is the little mermaid, right?

690
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,580
 - Yeah, so Ariel is the little mermaid.

691
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,700
 Splash had come out,

692
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,620
 and so they changed her hair color,

693
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,100
 Ariel's hair color to red,

694
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,460
 because the original hair color was too similar

695
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,300
 to Daryl Hannah's.

696
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,420
 So that had a very immediate influence on their movie.

697
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,660
 The actress, Alyssa Milano, was the face model for Ariel.

698
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,140
 There was a different body model who they had come in,

699
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,260
 who was a comedian improviser,

700
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,620
 who came in and would do all the scenes.

701
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,380
 So you can see the footage of them doing the scenes,

702
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,700
 so all the body movements were equaled.

703
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,540
 - Is that Sherry Stoner?

704
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,380
 - Sherry Stoner.

705
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,340
 - Well, there are hardly any people alive

706
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,740
 with the body of the little mermaid, aren't there?

707
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,580
 (laughing)

708
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,900
 There was actually very little competition for that.

709
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,580
 - You're right, there is half of the body.

710
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,340
 - A lot of her material as a stand-up

711
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,020
 is about the fact that she has a massive tail.

712
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,860
 (laughing)

713
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,900
 - Yeah, exactly.

714
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,700
 But the most interesting one is the hair

715
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,340
 and how it moves in the water.

716
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,540
 And that was inspired by the Space Shuttle astronaut,

717
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,740
 Sally Ride.

718
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,260
 They looked at her hair in zero gravity

719
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,340
 to create the water look that they needed.

720
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,260
 So yeah.

721
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,980
 - Someone who gets a lot of shit is Sebastian

722
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,940
 and the little mermaid.

723
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,780
 - The crab.

724
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,620
 - Yeah.

725
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,580
 - The friendly Jamaican crab.

726
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,420
 - Oh.

727
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,260
 - Under the sea.

728
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,700
 - What's Sebastian's accent?

729
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,540
 - Jamaica.

730
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,380
 - Jamaica.

731
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,580
 - Incorrect.

732
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,420
 - Caribbean.

733
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,420
 - Well, I mean, you just broadened it.

734
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,260
 So it's not fair.

735
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,540
 (laughing)

736
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,700
 So Sebastian, he was originally gonna be called Clarence

737
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,980
 and he was gonna be like a posh English guy.

738
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
 And they made a good move.

739
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,900
 'Cause you can imagine he was really strict,

740
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,660
 that Zazu type character.

741
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,260
 You can imagine why they wanted to do that.

742
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,860
 - Rowan Atkinson style voice.

743
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,700
 - Exactly.

744
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,060
 And then they thought, let's make him more fun.

745
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,380
 So they decided to make him Jamaican.

746
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,540
 But then they found the person to play him, Samuel E. Wright,

747
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,780
 who'd just been in a film playing Dizzy Gillespie.

748
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,460
 And Samuel E. Wright couldn't do a Jamaican accent,

749
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,420
 but he could do a Trinidadian accent.

750
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,900
 So actually, tell everyone you know,

751
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,380
 he doesn't speak with a Jamaican accent.

752
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,220
 - That's really interesting.

753
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,060
 - He speaks with a Trinidadian accent.

754
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,060
 - Because a few years later, when they made Cool Runnings,

755
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,100
 they brought in these four Jamaican actors.

756
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,900
 And they said, okay, can you do these lines?

757
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,340
 And they said, well, you don't sound Jamaican.

758
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,100
 And they're like, well, we actually are Jamaican.

759
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,940
 This is how we talk.

760
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,740
 And they're like, no, no, we need you to sound

761
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,380
 like the crab from The Little Mermaid.

762
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,700
 - No way!

763
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,140
 James, we've pieced it together.

764
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,980
 - It's amazing.

765
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,340
 The producer basically said,

766
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,060
 if you don't sound like Sebastian, I'm gonna get fired.

767
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,020
 And so they all put on these kind of like fake Jamaican accents.

768
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,420
 - That's amazing.

769
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,260
 - That's bizarre.

770
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,500
 - Wow.

771
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,380
 - Okay, so the reason that the crab was made Jamaican,

772
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,700
 let's say Jamaican, despite the accent,

773
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,940
 was the songwriters were working literally

774
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,700
 in the room next door to the animators.

775
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,260
 And each other were influencing

776
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,700
 how the movie was going along.

777
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,780
 And one of the songwriters came in

778
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,780
 and said to the filmmakers,

779
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,180
 tell me about Sebastian the crab.

780
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,420
 They said he's this British posh guy.

781
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,500
 They said, can you make him something more Caribbean?

782
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,700
 Can you make him Jamaican?

783
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
 Because I think this song under the sea

784
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,140
 will be great as like a Calypso-style song.

785
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,820
 And the accent will go great with that.

786
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,540
 And they changed it for that reason

787
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
 'cause they were working in tandem together.

788
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,020
 - So if you find a VHS of The Little Mermaid

789
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,220
 and it has a drawing of the penis on the cover,

790
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,420
 could be worth up to 30,000 pounds.

791
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,260
 - Really?

792
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,900
 - And it doesn't work if you just get one

793
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,220
 and get it right on yourself.

794
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,140
 - Is that true? - This is true.

795
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,020
 - I thought this was sort of urban myth.

796
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,580
 - There are mythy parts about it.

797
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,540
 So there's a guy called Bill Morrison

798
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,220
 who was drawing all the artwork,

799
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,740
 a little mermaid who's doing all the different things.

800
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,980
 And they said, can you do the VHS?

801
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,580
 And they said it really last minute

802
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
 and it was the middle of the night

803
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,300
 and his deadline was just coming up there.

804
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,580
 And he just sort of scribbled something together.

805
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,020
 And it had to look like this sort of castle

806
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,060
 in the background.

807
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,900
 And castles have turrets.

808
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,940
 And turrets can look phallic sometimes

809
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,980
 if you're not concentrating.

810
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,940
 - Your penises all have cretolations.

811
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,780
 - Yeah.

812
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,620
 - Yes, they do.

813
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,460
 - Okay.

814
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,220
 - How do you think we fire arrows out of them?

815
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,540
 (laughing)

816
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,140
 - When do you think the boiling oil comes from?

817
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,380
 (laughing)

818
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,100
 So he rushed to do it and then he made this thing

819
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,500
 and no one noticed it for ages.

820
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,340
 - So was it deliberate?

821
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,220
 - No, no, that's the thing.

822
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,500
 - It was just, yeah.

823
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,300
 - The myth goes that it's some pissed off employee of Disney

824
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,500
 who put a penis in there to piss everyone off.

825
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,900
 In actual fact, it was this guy who was doing his best

826
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,540
 and just happened to accidentally draw a penis

827
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,380
 in the thing.

828
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,140
 And then it basically came about that someone noticed it

829
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,860
 once it had already been imprinted

830
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,980
 and Disney were furious.

831
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,300
 (laughing)

832
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,740
 They're not really so relaxed about this kind of thing.

833
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,300
 They said, if we find out who did that,

834
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,460
 they're never gonna work for us again.

835
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,860
 And this guy's company was,

836
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,220
 this was most of their work doing stuff for Disney.

837
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,180
 So in the end, you either kind of pretend

838
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,740
 that you don't know anything about it

839
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,700
 or you say, look, it was us, but it was an accident.

840
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,540
 And that's what they did.

841
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,260
 And eventually Disney sort of realized that they were,

842
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,180
 it was an accident and they carried into it.

843
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,380
 - Imagine the Dick Mountain ride at Disneyland.

844
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,940
 (laughing)

845
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,620
 - Very, very, very steep up.

846
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,300
 Very, very, very steep down the other side.

847
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,740
 - Good.

848
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,020
 - And Bill Morrison won for Dan.

849
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,300
 He left this company and went to work for the Simpsons

850
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,940
 where he did some drawing for them.

851
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,780
 So there you go.

852
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,980
 - Is that why Homer Simpson's head

853
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,300
 also looks like a penis?

854
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,340
 (laughing)

855
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,380
 - This was about bubbles in "The Little Mermaid"

856
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,020
 in "Frozen", which is another princess movie.

857
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,580
 Obviously not bubbles, but snow.

858
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,140
 Snowflake, stuff like that.

859
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,620
 And there is a thing down which I'm sure you know about

860
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,100
 called the "Diatlov Pass" incident.

861
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,500
 It's a conspiracy theory thing

862
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,340
 about a load of kids who went walking

863
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,820
 just outside of Katrinberg.

864
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,860
 - And disappeared, doesn't mean anything.

865
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,860
 - They disappeared and we never know what happened to them.

866
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,340
 And last year, thanks to "Frozen",

867
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,980
 we might have found out what happened to them.

868
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,460
 And that's because the technology they used

869
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,980
 to make the snow in "Frozen" was so amazing,

870
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,740
 like the computer programs,

871
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,860
 that you could use that to work out

872
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,260
 what happens with avalanches.

873
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,940
 There was a scientist called Johann Gaum,

874
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,060
 who was from the Snow Avalanche Simulation Laboratory

875
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,220
 in Switzerland.

876
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,540
 And he saw "Frozen" and he thought,

877
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,020
 "What they're doing is amazing."

878
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,860
 And he went over and he said,

879
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,780
 "Can I borrow your technology

880
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,780
 "to show what happens with avalanches?"

881
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,940
 And he tried it and using the lie of the land

882
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,220
 in "Diatlov" and stuff like that,

883
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,540
 he showed that it was possible

884
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,820
 that these kids might have been taken away by an avalanche

885
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,020
 as opposed to a Yeti or aliens

886
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,380
 or whatever everyone else thought.

887
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,980
 - Wow. - And that was "Frozen".

888
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,140
 - That was "Frozen" that did it.

889
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,620
 - 'Cause I thought you were gonna say

890
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,180
 the other sort of wild theory about "Frozen"

891
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,380
 is the reason that that title was picked for the movie

892
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,100
 was to stop everyone from spreading the idea

893
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,380
 that Disney was "Frozen" cryogenically.

894
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,940
 So if you went on Google

895
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,580
 and you put Disney, "Frozen",

896
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,580
 you get the movie now as opposed to this-

897
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,620
 - Walt Disney's head.

898
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,780
 - Walt Disney's head has been-

899
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,740
 - That's so cryogenically. - "Frozen" cryogenically, yeah.

900
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
 That is a theory out there.

901
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,320
 (upbeat music)

902
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,660
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

903
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,980
 and that is Andy.

904
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,060
 - My fact is that the longest road tunnel in the world

905
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,060
 is so long that the builders recruited a team of psychologists

906
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,060
 to stop people crashing halfway through.

907
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,900
 So this is a tunnel called the Ladal Tunnel in Norway,

908
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,540
 and it is 24 kilometers long.

909
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,940
 So what's that, 17, 18 miles?

910
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
 It's quite, it's long.

911
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,580
 - Yeah, it's the longest.

912
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,100
 - It's been over 25 years now,

913
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,140
 and it helps people drive between Oslo and Bergen.

914
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,580
 And it's partly because Norway is so crinkly,

915
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,420
 and it's hard to get around,

916
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,500
 and the perilous crossing the mountain path is in winter.

917
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,420
 So you either fly little distances in small planes,

918
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,940
 which is a big way of getting around there,

919
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,500
 or you drive, but this allows you to drive much straight up

920
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,340
 'cause you're in a tunnel.

921
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,180
 That's how tunnels work.

922
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,260
 - Yeah, it helps goods get through as well.

923
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,540
 - Completely, yeah, yeah, all of that.

924
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,780
 So it was a very impressive engineering project, but--

925
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,420
 - Do we know the effect of the psychologist,

926
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,180
 like what they said, and what happened?

927
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,140
 - Yeah, that's the important part there.

928
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,060
 - Yeah, that's what they did.

929
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,140
 They were consulted on how people can drive through

930
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,780
 this tunnel and not go crackers,

931
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,740
 because it's 20 minutes of the same lighting,

932
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,940
 the same panels passing you, it's hypnotic, you're driving.

933
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,060
 - I'm already going crackers just from you saying that.

934
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,220
 - You've crashed into the wall, James, there we go,

935
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,060
 you've hit the wall.

936
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,900
 - And no radio signal.

937
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,620
 Can't get radio forward in the middle of a tunnel, can you?

938
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,460
 - Exactly. - Always the annoying thing

939
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
 about tunnels. - That's true.

940
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,740
 - It's like being in a nuclear submarine, basically.

941
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,500
 - You should pre-download before you go through the tunnel.

942
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,340
 - Pre-download before you go through.

943
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,980
 - You've got to talk about this pre-download thing.

944
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,820
 - So the shrinks, basically,

945
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,260
 they were a crack team of shrinks were called in and said,

946
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,220
 "Oh, yes."

947
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,780
 And they said, they said--

948
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,060
 - They were the people who were originally cast

949
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,900
 in the place of Astrid.

950
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,700
 - Yeah, they were, and they said,

951
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,100
 "Well, you've got to break it up for people.

952
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,420
 You've got to make it feel more varied."

953
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,220
 - I'll be honest, Andy, I think,

954
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,420
 without any psychological training,

955
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,940
 I reckon breaking things up

956
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,940
 so people don't get bored is pretty root one, isn't it?

957
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,140
 - Like this bit of me speaking.

958
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,620
 And you've just helped to do that

959
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,500
 by breaking it up so that people at home

960
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,780
 haven't crashed themselves.

961
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,660
 - That's what this podcast is, is us breaking up

962
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,460
 Andy's monotonous words for the listener.

963
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,700
 - Okay, that's enough, Anna.

964
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,540
 Okay, let's do another five colloases, Andy.

965
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
 - Thank you.

966
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,340
 - So basically, there are these mountain caves,

967
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,260
 as they get called, strategically placed along.

968
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,660
 And every five minutes, you get to another mountain cave.

969
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,780
 The lighting all changes completely.

970
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,020
 The road opens out and it looks like you're driving into

971
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,340
 a sort of beautiful mountain pass.

972
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,820
 It looks like there's daylight above you.

973
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,660
 It's really gorgeous.

974
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,580
 - I think it looks quite tri--

975
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
 I would feel like the drugs had kicked in

976
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,660
 as soon as I got to certain bits of it.

977
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,740
 It's like avatar in there, all of a sudden.

978
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,580
 - It is a bit.

979
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,460
 - It's like you're in an aquarium,

980
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,460
 like you're in the actual water with it surrounding you.

981
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,420
 It's like mountainous-y dark blue, trippy as hell.

982
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,660
 - I would want like, 'cause you're expecting a tunnel.

983
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,940
 I'd go into that tunnel

984
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,660
 and suddenly you're not really in a tunnel anymore.

985
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,340
 I agree with that and I would freak the fuck out of me.

986
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,740
 - You've had a lot of tunnel already.

987
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,340
 You're filled to the back teeth with tunnel.

988
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,540
 What you want is a bit of variety.

989
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,620
 I mean, I don't think people frequently go do

990
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,460
 lally halfway along a tunnel, so it clearly works.

991
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,300
 - It is a good idea.

992
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,820
 And I think one of the reasons it's a good idea,

993
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,660
 them doing this,

994
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,420
 is 'cause for the longest road tunnel in the world,

995
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,740
 not many vehicles drive through it.

996
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,140
 So a thousand vehicles a day.

997
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
 So basically the chances are you're gonna be driving through

998
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,460
 completely on your own,

999
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,220
 which is what would freak you out, right?

1000
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
 Like if you're going behind a bunch of cars, it's fine.

1001
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,580
 - Have you ever been driving in like a place

1002
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,500
 which is so the same that you think maybe I have died?

1003
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,340
 - Yes, I have.

1004
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,180
 - I have done that.

1005
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,020
 - Oh my God.

1006
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,980
 - I was driving down the coast of Croatia

1007
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,020
 and there's all these inlets.

1008
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,940
 And you kind of go on an inlet

1009
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,620
 and you come background again and you drive for a bit

1010
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,340
 and you have another inlet and another inlet

1011
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,820
 and another inlet and they're almost all identical.

1012
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,020
 And like after about two hours of that,

1013
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,940
 you're just like, maybe I have died.

1014
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,620
 Maybe one of these times I missed the corner.

1015
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,140
 I was doing this forever.

1016
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,540
 - It's fractal.

1017
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,380
 - Yeah.

1018
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,140
 - Do you have that thing when you're driving

1019
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,020
 where you sort of come to and you realize,

1020
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,580
 "Oh, I just drove half an hour there."

1021
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,060
 You know, and then your conscious mind

1022
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,900
 reasserts yourself and you're like,

1023
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,980
 "Oh, and you've got a bloodied knife next to you

1024
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,940
 "on the outside of the seat."

1025
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,820
 And there's bags full of money in the boot.

1026
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,940
 - But not that bag.

1027
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,780
 Oh no.

1028
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,380
 I once, in fact, more than once

1029
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,180
 when I worked in an office as an accountant

1030
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,300
 would sort of come to at the desk

1031
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,100
 and not remember how I got there.

1032
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,540
 Like as in I just sort of, I got up,

1033
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
 got out of the house, got dressed,

1034
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,660
 drive the car all the way to the office,

1035
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,220
 sat down, started work without even realizing,

1036
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,860
 "Yeah, yeah, promise, yeah."

1037
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,180
 - Yeah, I see that.

1038
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,580
 Have you ever woken up midway through a fact on fish?

1039
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,780
 (laughing)

1040
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,460
 - I'm hopeful it might happen eventually on this.

1041
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,820
 It's called highway hypnosis.

1042
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,900
 And people noticed it all the way back to 1921

1043
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,300
 when it was called road hypnotism.

1044
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,060
 And basically what it is, is even when you're looking

1045
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,780
 at something, your eyes are making very slight movements

1046
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,620
 all the time.

1047
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,380
 Like your eyes are always like darting this way

1048
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,740
 and that and whatever.

1049
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
 And normally they're a response to something

1050
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,660
 that's happening outside as a bird go past or whatever.

1051
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,620
 But what happens when you're driving for ages

1052
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,700
 is your eyes start to go in this sort of predetermined pattern.

1053
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,220
 They start, they're still moving,

1054
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,380
 but they move left and right, then up, then down,

1055
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,780
 then left, then right, then up, then down and whatever.

1056
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,460
 And the thing is they don't really alert the brain properly.

1057
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,260
 The brain starts thinking that not really

1058
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,620
 anything is happening.

1059
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,500
 And then you start losing concentration.

1060
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,060
 - So you should roll your eyes

1061
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,100
 round and around and around.

1062
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,380
 - Well, you should take a break.

1063
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,660
 - Or have something, or watch something on your phone.

1064
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,500
 That's another.

1065
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,540
 (all laughing)

1066
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,060
 - As long as you pre-downloaded it though,

1067
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,700
 that's the impact of that.

1068
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,300
 - This tunnel, in 2000, I love this,

1069
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,060
 someone got married in the middle of the Laerdal tunnel.

1070
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,900
 Did you read this?

1071
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,740
 - No.

1072
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,060
 - It was a young couple, young Norwegian couple.

1073
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,340
 And the groom was called Ronny Rinder.

1074
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,700
 And he said that his mother-in-law had attended the wedding,

1075
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,900
 but she had been slightly skeptical about it.

1076
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,940
 And I just love this.

1077
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,180
 He said, "She's scared of two things, dogs and tunnels.

1078
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,220
 "We've recently bought two Alsatians,

1079
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,020
 "and now we've got married in the tunnel."

1080
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
 (all laughing)

1081
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,140
 And I would say maybe the psychologist shouldn't.

1082
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,980
 (all laughing)

1083
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,460
 - Another thing they have in this tunnel

1084
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,740
 is a rumble strip in the middle of the road.

1085
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,580
 - Okay.

1086
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,220
 - And the idea is if you're driving along,

1087
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,660
 you slightly fear off to the middle.

1088
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,940
 You hear it rumble, it wakes you up.

1089
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,980
 These things were invented in 1955

1090
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,980
 by a guy called Harold Griffin.

1091
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,180
 And they were originally called Singing Shoulders.

1092
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,020
 (all laughing)

1093
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,380
 - That's better.

1094
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,820
 - But they caused a 44% reduction

1095
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,820
 on head-on fatal crashes if you have them on a road.

1096
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,140
 These are US figures.

1097
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
 - Wow.

1098
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,020
 - They should be the same in most countries.

1099
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,620
 - So head-on collisions are hugely caused

1100
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,220
 by falling asleep or losing concentration.

1101
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,300
 - Absolutely, yeah.

1102
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,140
 - Right.

1103
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,860
 - And there are large areas of Michigan

1104
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,340
 with no rumble strips.

1105
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,140
 So most places in America,

1106
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,980
 they have to have them now on highways,

1107
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,300
 but there are large areas of Michigan

1108
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,700
 with no rumble strips.

1109
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,380
 Po-kwa, why?

1110
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
 - Ooh.

1111
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,860
 - There's no double lane roads.

1112
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,980
 - That's good, in Michigan.

1113
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,300
 - No.

1114
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,100
 - They have to transport something

1115
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,660
 which is delicate, like eggs, to the market.

1116
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,660
 And if they hit the rumble strips,

1117
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,500
 they break all the eggs.

1118
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,340
 - All of that eggs for you.

1119
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,180
 - Exactly.

1120
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,900
 - And they're happy to have a full head-on collision

1121
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,740
 as long as they don't break a few eggs.

1122
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,340
 - That actually weirdly, more eggs get lost

1123
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,140
 by the rumble strips than in the full-on collision.

1124
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,980
 - Yeah.

1125
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,140
 - No, it's a certain group of people

1126
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,380
 who didn't want them to.

1127
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,220
 - The Amish.

1128
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,420
 - The Amish.

1129
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
 - Who are the Amish?

1130
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,540
 (laughing)

1131
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,380
 - The Amish.

1132
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,220
 - The Amish.

1133
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,060
 - Or Amish.

1134
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,620
 - I've never, in my knowledge, called the Amish.

1135
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,060
 - Really?

1136
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,460
 Do they not like rumble strips?

1137
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,500
 - It's the horses.

1138
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,620
 The horses don't like them

1139
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,100
 and they refuse to cross rumble strips

1140
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,660
 'cause it makes them hard to set their feet down

1141
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,380
 'cause of the way that they're...

1142
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,220
 - Really?

1143
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,060
 - You can't step over them.

1144
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,900
 - Not that broad.

1145
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,660
 - Yeah, but the horses just don't like it.

1146
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,980
 So, there are certain areas.

1147
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,940
 - They didn't even leave 'cause they didn't have a...

1148
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
 (laughing)

1149
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,700
 I was trying to do a rumble horse neck.

1150
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,540
 - That was really good.

1151
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,540
 - Didn't come out right, sorry.

1152
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,940
 - It weren't to be, you saw it, though.

1153
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,100
 What you're doing with your lips there.

1154
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,700
 - So, in any location in Michigan

1155
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,220
 where horse-drawn buggies utilise the roadway,

1156
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,780
 you're not supposed to use shoulder corrugations,

1157
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,860
 which is what they call them,

1158
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,060
 unless a crash history exists.

1159
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,900
 - Right.

1160
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,940
 London has a new tunnel.

1161
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,300
 In the week we record this.

1162
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,140
 - No.

1163
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,980
 - Yeah.

1164
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,340
 Have you guys been reading about the Silver Town Tunnel?

1165
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,160
 - No.

1166
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,000
 - Oh, it's so good.

1167
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,840
 It's great.

1168
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,460
 It's just next to the Blackwall Tunnel,

1169
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,940
 which is very, very traffic-y tunnel in London, basically.

1170
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,220
 It has to shut down, I think, 700 times a year.

1171
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,580
 It gets shut down 'cause the traffic just gets too crazy.

1172
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,220
 So, they've just opened another tunnel next to it,

1173
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,420
 but bikes can't go along it because it's for cars.

1174
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,940
 So, they're running a sort of bike bus for it.

1175
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,300
 But, it's amazing how they built it.

1176
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,460
 So, you know, TBMs, tunnel boring machines?

1177
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,780
 - Okay.

1178
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,500
 - The one that built this tunnel was called Jill,

1179
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,340
 after Jill Weiner,

1180
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,140
 who was London's first female bus driver.

1181
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,980
 - Okay.

1182
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,380
 - And they wanted two tunnels, right?

1183
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,220
 'Cause it's really big.

1184
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,200
 Stop me awning, James.

1185
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,460
 (laughing)

1186
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,300
 They wanted two big tunnels, right?

1187
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,020
 Normally, it's really hard to build two tunnels

1188
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,100
 with the same machine,

1189
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,820
 'cause turning it round down there is a bastard.

1190
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,100
 You know, it's really difficult.

1191
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,900
 - So, reverse, just get some wing mirrors on there.

1192
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,460
 - Or don't they famously come out the other side?

1193
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,500
 - Didn't they, sorry to interrupt,

1194
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,740
 but for the channel tunnel,

1195
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,140
 I think the boring machines, they just kept boring down.

1196
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,980
 - They sometimes do.

1197
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
 - And they buried them under the ground.

1198
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,020
 - Sometimes they do, yeah.

1199
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,140
 So, this one, they wanted to use it again.

1200
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,100
 They wanted to get good use out of this machine,

1201
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,940
 'cause it's a massive factory.

1202
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,540
 Like, it's huge underground thing.

1203
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,980
 So, they put it, I just love this, on nitrogen skates.

1204
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,100
 They put it on compressed nitrogen.

1205
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,540
 Like, some skates would rest on compressed nitrogen,

1206
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,260
 like a hovercraft.

1207
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
 And that allowed them to turn it round

1208
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,340
 in a special underground chamber.

1209
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,780
 And then go back the other way.

1210
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,700
 - They must have had to build a massive underground chamber.

1211
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,300
 I mean, 'cause these things are up to 170 meters long.

1212
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,140
 - So, I don't know what that chamber was like,

1213
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
 but it's crazy.

1214
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,580
 - Yeah, they are awesome.

1215
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,180
 And I think they do like to reuse them now.

1216
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,020
 They break up them up into little parts.

1217
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,220
 'Cause every one is like the width of the tunnel

1218
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,660
 that's specifically made for that one tunnel.

1219
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,300
 So, you can't really reuse the whole thing,

1220
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,980
 but you can take it apart and use it.

1221
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,220
 But yeah, in the olden days, they did random shit with it.

1222
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,540
 Like, as you say, in the channel tunnel,

1223
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,300
 one of them was just like buried.

1224
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,220
 Another one in 2004 was--

1225
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,060
 - So great.

1226
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,900
 I can't wait for archaeologists to find that.

1227
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
 That's going to be a great day for them.

1228
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,780
 - So, they literally just changed its directions

1229
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,180
 and it bore its way down to the bottom of the--

1230
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,540
 - I think it's going to come out in Australia sometime soon.

1231
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,780
 (all laughing)

1232
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,460
 - It's going to split the world in half.

1233
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,860
 - I think it actually went into more of a lay-by.

1234
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,300
 - Oh, it is buried on the--

1235
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,220
 - Yeah, and then they bricked it.

1236
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,060
 They bricked it up.

1237
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,940
 But it reminds me of that really sad Thomas Atank engine episode

1238
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,020
 where they bricked one of the engines in.

1239
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,860
 - Henry.

1240
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,700
 - Henry, he's very sad.

1241
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,660
 - Why'd they do that?

1242
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
 - He's been naughty.

1243
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,580
 - Oh, wow.

1244
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,580
 - He won't come out in the rain.

1245
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,140
 Anyway, we'll save that.

1246
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,740
 But there was another one in 2004.

1247
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,980
 One of the TBMs using the channel tunnel was sold on eBay.

1248
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,740
 There were obviously loads of prank bids,

1249
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,860
 but then it was actually sold for 39,999 pounds.

1250
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,060
 - What was posted in package then?

1251
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,580
 - That's such a good question, Dan.

1252
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,820
 You've hit the nail on the head.

1253
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
 I never thought I'd say this,

1254
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,500
 but if only the buyer had been as smart as you are,

1255
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,060
 'cause he bought it and he signed the contract

1256
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,100
 and everything and then he got an email from him

1257
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,220
 who was called Steddenum.

1258
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,060
 - Oh, no.

1259
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,020
 - Guess how much it was gonna cost him to collect it?

1260
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,780
 - I mean, an insane amount of money.

1261
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,940
 So he paid how much for the thing?

1262
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,500
 - He paid 40 grand.

1263
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,100
 - Which is a bargain.

1264
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,980
 Is it for a big tunnel machine?

1265
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,260
 Yeah, second hand.

1266
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,580
 Like that's a--

1267
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,540
 - Vintage.

1268
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,980
 - That's a really nice car, second hand, you know what I mean?

1269
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,820
 - Yeah.

1270
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,540
 - Or you get a machine that could dig a channel.

1271
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,100
 - I don't think they're that road worthy, but yeah.

1272
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,540
 - Okay, what was--

1273
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,340
 - Cost a quarter of a million pounds to move it.

1274
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,180
 - Wow.

1275
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,140
 (laughing)

1276
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,420
 - And can you back out on that sale?

1277
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,620
 Sometimes they're really strict on eBay about--

1278
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,020
 - You can't back out on the tunnel even.

1279
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,860
 You can't do anything.

1280
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,440
 (upbeat music)

1281
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,460
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1282
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,180
 and that is Anna.

1283
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,540
 - My fact this week is that walking backwards

1284
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,500
 is healthier than walking forwards.

1285
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,340
 - Wow.

1286
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,740
 - With some caveats, like, you know,

1287
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,260
 don't do it at Russia on a main road.

1288
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,620
 It's for a railway tunnel.

1289
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,580
 (laughing)

1290
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,620
 - Railway tunnel.

1291
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,980
 This is just sort of a raft of stuff that's come out

1292
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,900
 in the last 20 years, I guess,

1293
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,900
 about the various advantages.

1294
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,020
 Most crucially, burns more calories.

1295
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,780
 So like the metabolic cost of walking backwards

1296
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,380
 seems to be significantly higher.

1297
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,780
 I think the first study was in 1995 that found this

1298
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,660
 and it found that oxygen intake and heart rate

1299
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,900
 of the various, I think it was 27 subjects,

1300
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,500
 increased between 38 and 119% walking backwards

1301
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,820
 compared to walking forwards.

1302
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,900
 - Okay, I have to say, I'm not massively surprised by that

1303
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,140
 given that for two million years

1304
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,500
 we've been evolving to walk forwards.

1305
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,060
 Like, doing something hard is harder

1306
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,180
 than doing something easy.

1307
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,020
 - I agree.

1308
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,860
 - It's like doing press-ups constantly

1309
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,180
 is harder than just lying there.

1310
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,180
 But that's because I'm involved with just lying there.

1311
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,380
 - You might as well say that walking like a kangaroo

1312
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,420
 is healthier than walking like a human.

1313
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,260
 (laughing)

1314
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,780
 - Basically, doing anything really difficult

1315
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,460
 that feels unnatural is better for you.

1316
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,300
 - Yeah.

1317
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,140
 - Okay.

1318
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,580
 - I think so a lot of this stuff makes kind of perfect sense

1319
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,340
 because it's doing stuff that you're not used to doing, right?

1320
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,140
 So this is why it's often used in rehabilitation

1321
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,980
 for things like osteoarthritis

1322
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
 because let's say you've got knee problems

1323
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,500
 'cause you put too much pressure on your knees,

1324
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,460
 you go for runs, you're walking on tarmac a lot,

1325
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,860
 you start walking backwards,

1326
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,980
 suddenly you're putting pressure on different parts

1327
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,100
 that your quads are taking a lot more pressure

1328
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,460
 or if you've got plantar fasciitis in your heels,

1329
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,220
 oh my God, it's a pain, isn't it?

1330
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,500
 I feel for you.

1331
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,260
 But if you start walking backwards,

1332
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,900
 then you don't have such an impact on your heels.

1333
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,260
 - Did anyone do some walking backwards for this?

1334
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,820
 I did 15 minutes in my garden.

1335
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,660
 - Did you?

1336
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,940
 - 15 minutes, that's a lot.

1337
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,620
 - Yeah, well, I couldn't be bothered doing any research.

1338
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,260
 - I meant to say you look fantastic today.

1339
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,400
 - Thank you, well, you should see my heels.

1340
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,700
 (laughing)

1341
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,540
 - So how was it?

1342
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,420
 - Well, to be honest, I didn't really see much difference

1343
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,660
 in the 15 minutes I did.

1344
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,820
 Apart from, I would say it works slightly different muscles

1345
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,340
 in my legs, like my Achilles probably,

1346
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,340
 and my calf that normally wouldn't feel it

1347
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,460
 after 15 minutes walk.

1348
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,300
 I could feel it after.

1349
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,260
 - Also, your neighbors all think you're a witch now?

1350
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,100
 - Yeah.

1351
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,940
 - I'm no doubt.

1352
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,220
 (laughing)

1353
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,700
 - I did, because quite a lot of my neighbors' houses

1354
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,340
 overlook my garden.

1355
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,340
 And I didn't think, they probably think I'm a bit weird.

1356
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,260
 Yeah, they already know.

1357
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,420
 - Yeah, I'm sure you've done worse things in that garden.

1358
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,660
 (laughing)

1359
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,540
 - Where did those bags of money come from?

1360
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,800
 (laughing)

1361
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,060
 But it's quite good.

1362
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,140
 I read a few articles where it said that backwards running,

1363
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,180
 this post-book to backwards walking is quite good

1364
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,900
 in warming up if you're an athlete,

1365
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,540
 because it uses slightly different joints and tendons

1366
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,980
 as you would normally do.

1367
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,780
 Also, there was another person, an orthopedic specialist

1368
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,020
 called Nicole Hass, who in one of the papers she said,

1369
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,140
 that actually one of the main things is,

1370
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,500
 it's using your brain in a slightly different way.

1371
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,340
 - Yeah.

1372
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,460
 - 'Cause like one of the things you're doing quite a lot

1373
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,280
 when you're walking backwards, as I know,

1374
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,400
 is working out where everything is

1375
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,880
 and what you're not falling over.

1376
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,520
 'Cause my garden is not very big

1377
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,440
 and I had to do lots of laps of it to 15 minutes.

1378
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,960
 And all the time you're thinking,

1379
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,720
 where did I leave that barbecue?

1380
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,520
 - Yes, yes.

1381
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,440
 Well, next time you do it,

1382
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,080
 you should do what a man called Patrick Harmon did

1383
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,400
 when he took on a challenge to walk from San Francisco

1384
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,560
 to New York, which is he walked backwards,

1385
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,400
 but he had installed near the front of his chest

1386
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,920
 a car mirror so that he could see everything

1387
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,000
 that was behind him.

1388
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,180
 - I mean, it makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

1389
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,420
 - He said it was good for him.

1390
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,180
 So he did this in 1915?

1391
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,020
 - Yep.

1392
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,140
 - It took him about a year.

1393
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,420
 - Yeah, 290 days in total.

1394
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,580
 - About a year.

1395
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,460
 (laughing)

1396
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,140
 - A big chunk missing for the whole year.

1397
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,460
 - The bulk of a year.

1398
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,420
 (laughing)

1399
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,140
 - I'm really looking forward to going to your 60th birthday.

1400
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,140
 - Yeah, it's gonna be about 52.

1401
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,580
 (laughing)

1402
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,460
 - And he claimed that it had made his ankle so strong,

1403
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,720
 it would take a sledgehammer blow to sprain them.

1404
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,640
 So he clearly felt some kind of benefits.

1405
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,480
 - Yeah.

1406
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,020
 - It's interesting that he,

1407
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,640
 'cause he did that 1915, did you say?

1408
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,480
 - Yeah.

1409
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,880
 - 'Cause there was a guy called Pleny Wingo,

1410
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,680
 who he's the one in the Guinness World Record Book

1411
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,840
 because he walked 8,000 miles

1412
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,480
 from Santa Monica to Istanbul, so a bit further.

1413
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,320
 But I think he believed he was the first person

1414
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,520
 to come up with it.

1415
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,160
 - Twice as long, just when you say a bit further,

1416
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,000
 and almost a year.

1417
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,840
 - A bit further.

1418
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,680
 (laughing)

1419
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,880
 - Well, fact checker's striper today.

1420
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, more than actually, yeah.

1421
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,840
 - You don't want us doing down the backwards walkers,

1422
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,680
 do you?

1423
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,520
 They need to get there just as a--

1424
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,600
 - Some respect, please.

1425
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,960
 Pleny Wingo, yeah.

1426
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,280
 - He lost his business and--

1427
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,120
 - In the Great Depression.

1428
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,960
 - In the Great Depression.

1429
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,000
 So I'm so excited about it.

1430
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,960
 - We're gonna be seeing lots more

1431
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,520
 of this kind of great stuff soon.

1432
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,760
 (laughing)

1433
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,760
 So you're right, we're topical.

1434
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,600
 - Limber up.

1435
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,760
 He had the idea, 'cause he was listening to his daughter,

1436
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,160
 his 15 year old daughter,

1437
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,200
 her birthday party chatting to her friends saying,

1438
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,160
 everything that could ever be done has been done now,

1439
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,620
 'cause it was this age of stunts.

1440
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,400
 We've talked about flagpole sitting before,

1441
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,120
 everyone was sitting on flagpoles,

1442
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,520
 and we're crawling up mountains,

1443
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,600
 pushing peanuts up mountains with their noses.

1444
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,480
 And he said, "Not everything's been done.

1445
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,980
 "No one's ever walked backwards around the world."

1446
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,600
 And then he thought, "Bugger, now I've said that,

1447
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,880
 "I'll have to do it."

1448
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,920
 And he tried to do it, and he got as far as Turkey,

1449
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,320
 and then they kicked him out and told him to go home.

1450
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,360
 I don't think he did make his fortune.

1451
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,480
 It's very hard to tell.

1452
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,320
 - No, he didn't.

1453
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,160
 - It's pretty sure he didn't.

1454
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,000
 - He didn't.

1455
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,360
 - They said when he got to Turkey,

1456
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,920
 they said he had to leave the country for his own safety.

1457
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,760
 (laughing)

1458
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,460
 'Cause I think the idea was that people

1459
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,560
 were throwing things at him quite a lot.

1460
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,080
 - I'm surprised you got as far as that.

1461
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,240
 - Apparently, according to one article I read about him,

1462
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,720
 he was in New York City walking backwards,

1463
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,640
 and he agreed to walk backwards along the top ledge

1464
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,400
 of a 12 story building in return for money.

1465
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,400
 And then loads of people paid him to see him do this,

1466
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,520
 and he did it.

1467
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,640
 But the guy who was working with him

1468
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,120
 and collecting all the money off there,

1469
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,480
 onlookers just did a runner and took all his money off him.

1470
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,560
 - For the backwards runner.

1471
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,600
 - Well, if you're walking backwards,

1472
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,040
 it's hard to catch anyone, isn't it?

1473
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:10,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

1474
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,720
 - That's crazy.

1475
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,320
 - His wife left him, Mrs. Wingo.

1476
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,760
 - Oh no, I mean, I understand why she did it, but even so.

1477
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,800
 - But he was still walking backwards for decades.

1478
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,400
 So in 1976, he appeared on the Johnny Carson show,

1479
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,200
 one of these American talk shows saying,

1480
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,880
 "I'm doing it again!"

1481
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,520
 And he claimed he was gonna do another

1482
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,360
 sort of round the world thing.

1483
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,320
 That suggests that he didn't make his fortune

1484
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,160
 the first time.

1485
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,480
 - I don't think so.

1486
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,440
 - I think it does, sadly.

1487
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,080
 There is a profession who walked backwards

1488
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,640
 maybe more than any other.

1489
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,160
 And maybe, I'm not certain about this,

1490
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,120
 but it's a good, I think it's a good.

1491
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,840
 - Photographers?

1492
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,680
 - I don't know.

1493
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,520
 - Yeah, that's good.

1494
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,360
 - That's good content.

1495
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,680
 - I was reading a paper about sports people

1496
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,080
 and they said rugby league players,

1497
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,040
 handball athletes and soccer referees do a lot of baseball.

1498
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,680
 - Football referees is the one I saw.

1499
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,080
 - I think there's, is there not a famous one,

1500
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,880
 I think we might have even mentioned it before,

1501
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,840
 about at the White House,

1502
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,200
 it's people who are doing the tour guides,

1503
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,400
 they walk backwards forever.

1504
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,440
 - Pentagon, I think it was.

1505
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,360
 Yeah, where they have to memorize where the corner is

1506
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,560
 so that they can go around it.

1507
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,400
 Yeah. - Why?

1508
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,840
 - Is it so they keep an eye on people?

1509
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,680
 - Yeah.

1510
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,520
 - Oh.

1511
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,360
 - Just get the mirrors.

1512
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,720
 - Get the mirrors, exactly.

1513
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,600
 - But I've trained as a football referee

1514
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,440
 and for sure as part of the training,

1515
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,440
 they teach you how to run backwards well.

1516
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,280
 - Don't they?

1517
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,320
 - Yeah, or they don't teach you,

1518
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,000
 but they just say make sure you know how to run backwards.

1519
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,280
 (laughing)

1520
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,360
 - I used to do quite a lot, I'd say,

1521
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
 when I was like when I was a nipper.

1522
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,200
 - Yeah.

1523
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,720
 - I was running backwards or a referee.

1524
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,040
 - Running for the referee.

1525
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,520
 - Did a lot of, oh.

1526
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,400
 - Was that avoiding the wedgie as they chased you?

1527
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,240
 (laughing)

1528
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,880
 - Okay, okay, okay, you can't be wedgie.

1529
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,800
 (laughing)

1530
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,120
 - They could do a front wedgie.

1531
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,040
 - The front wedgie is horrible.

1532
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,920
 - It makes it look like a Disney tower.

1533
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,180
 (laughing)

1534
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,220
 - There's another group of people

1535
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,260
 who are becoming expert backward walkers in recent times,

1536
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,180
 and that is celebrities.

1537
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,180
 So Taylor Swift spends a lot of her time walking backwards

1538
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,580
 so that she can avoid the paparazzi taking photos of her.

1539
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,460
 - Is it so that they can't sell the photos

1540
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,820
 because they're trying to sell those photos

1541
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,660
 of her walking forward?

1542
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,500
 - Now, as in the paparazzi stood in one particular place

1543
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,220
 and you need to have your back to the paparazzo

1544
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,940
 so that they can't see your face.

1545
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,220
 I saw quite a recent news article

1546
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,700
 about her walking through the woods, right?

1547
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,620
 - Yeah, she went and did a whole mountain trail,

1548
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,180
 basically walking backwards

1549
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,260
 so that the paparazzi couldn't get shots of her.

1550
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,860
 - Back up ahead, she should do.

1551
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,620
 Back up ahead and hold for the eye.

1552
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,660
 - That's a good idea.

1553
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,980
 (laughing)

1554
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,620
 - But if someone's walking backwards,

1555
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,460
 so she's walking backwards

1556
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,140
 towards the paparazzi who were facing her.

1557
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,580
 - Let's say she's come out of the building,

1558
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,980
 there's paparazzi waiting outside.

1559
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,820
 She faces the other way to get in the car.

1560
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,020
 - But I would film that, and that's like...

1561
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,060
 - But it could be anyone.

1562
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,620
 It could be anyone with blonde hair.

1563
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,460
 - Oh, please.

1564
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,300
 I didn't know Taylor Swift asked anyone.

1565
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,820
 (laughing)

1566
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,980
 I wouldn't even recognize her face,

1567
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,460
 but there's an amazing woman called Justine Galloway.

1568
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,780
 I think we might have mentioned in our sports book

1569
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,980
 that we happened to write semi-recently.

1570
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,100
 She's a runner.

1571
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,900
 She's 44, and she used to run loads of marathons.

1572
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,660
 And then in 2011,

1573
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,140
 she was running her third Boston marathon,

1574
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,700
 and she got really good times.

1575
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,940
 And she suddenly her left leg

1576
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,700
 started staying up in the air too long,

1577
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,180
 sort of swung out to the left a bit,

1578
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,940
 and it just wasn't working properly.

1579
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,580
 And she basically got what is called runner's dystonia,

1580
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,420
 which is a bit like the yips in golf,

1581
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,380
 where you just suddenly kind of can't do it.

1582
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,640
 And within a few weeks, she couldn't run at all.

1583
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,260
 It's like this weird neurological issue

1584
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,340
 where your brain and your body will not connect at all.

1585
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,260
 And she was obviously devastating,

1586
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,060
 like running with her life.

1587
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,980
 And then she realized if she ran backwards, she was fine.

1588
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,820
 - Crazy.

1589
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,780
 - And now she's got the world record

1590
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,860
 for running a half marathon backwards.

1591
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,900
 - Does she do mirrors?

1592
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,740
 Or does she do?

1593
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,580
 - She does mirrors, yes.

1594
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,380
 - Does she, when you do a half marathon with her,

1595
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,180
 does she start at the end and go to the start?

1596
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,180
 She passes everyone halfway.

1597
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,380
 - Yeah, she always gets moaned down in the middle, so.

1598
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,220
 - So it is a competitive sport.

1599
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,500
 - Yeah, I mean, there are all sorts of records.

1600
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,580
 There aren't many full races of people running backwards,

1601
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,020
 but there's a guy called Aaron Yoda, who's the world's best.

1602
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,940
 - God hold her, he is.

1603
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,660
 - Runs backwards, speaks backwards.

1604
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,220
 (all laughing)

1605
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,660
 He's done a mile and five minutes, 54 seconds backwards,

1606
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,100
 which I'm quite sure is faster

1607
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,820
 than I could do a mile for four, for me, yeah, yeah.

1608
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,980
 - So walking backwards, right?

1609
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,340
 Imagine you're walking backwards

1610
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,780
 and stuff is happening in your peripheral vision.

1611
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,300
 Some people are better at noticing those things than others.

1612
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,740
 - Only if you're walking backwards?

1613
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,660
 - Only if you're walking backwards, yeah.

1614
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,500
 - Can we guess this?

1615
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,060
 - Is it like football, right?

1616
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:52,900
 - Scottish people.

1617
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,740
 - It's a class of people.

1618
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,500
 - I'd be a stud-ist if you went to that place.

1619
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,620
 - Is it a profession or a nationality?

1620
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,300
 - It's a hobby group.

1621
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,420
 - Oh, is that like birdwatchers or train spotters?

1622
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,380
 - Not them.

1623
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,420
 - Think of a hobby that slightly more normal people might do,

1624
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,020
 and the tunnel boring machine enthusiasts.

1625
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,820
 (all laughing)

1626
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,420
 Oh, what's a normal hobby?

1627
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,540
 It's something that cool people might do,

1628
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,020
 slightly more cool people than you.

1629
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,260
 It's people who play video games.

1630
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,340
 - Oh yeah, those jocks, those bloody jocks.

1631
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,660
 - So there was a study that was done.

1632
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,500
 - Are they cool?

1633
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,700
 Sorry, coming questions.

1634
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,620
 - I was just thinking cooler than boring enthusiasts.

1635
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,460
 - Oh, yeah.

1636
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,460
 - On a par for me.

1637
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,300
 - I actually was thinking,

1638
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,460
 I'd love to write a film script set on a tunnel boring machine.

1639
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,900
 I just think that'd be really cool.

1640
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,300
 - Like a really slow version of speed.

1641
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,460
 (all laughing)

1642
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,940
 - We gotta keep going at 0.25 miles an hour.

1643
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,580
 - It's gonna blow.

1644
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,900
 - So the thing is right,

1645
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,260
 they wanted to find out,

1646
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,180
 do people who play video games have better perception,

1647
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,580
 and especially people who play,

1648
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,460
 you know, like first person shooter games, okay?

1649
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,300
 So they tried that,

1650
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,020
 and they realized that actually,

1651
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,220
 people have equal perception.

1652
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,860
 If you, Andy, and someone who plays video games

1653
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,580
 are walking straight down a road,

1654
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,660
 then you equally can see things in your peripheral vision.

1655
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,820
 But for the people who play video games,

1656
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,100
 when you're going backwards,

1657
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,260
 they have much better perception.

1658
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,980
 And that's because in video games,

1659
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,780
 often these shooters, they are moving backwards.

1660
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,740
 Like when you move backwards on your joystick,

1661
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,460
 your character is so easy to do.

1662
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:31,060
 So they're seeing that quite often in their day-to-day hobby,

1663
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,460
 whereas we hardly ever see it,

1664
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,420
 'cause we hardly ever walk backwards.

1665
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,500
 That's cool, that's cool.

1666
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,340
 - I thought you were gonna say it

1667
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,940
 so that you had a peripheral view

1668
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,580
 on seeing whether or not your mom came in

1669
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,380
 to tell you to stop playing video games,

1670
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,460
 so you just built a better...

1671
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,860
 So video games are probably quite good.

1672
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,460
 (all laughing)

1673
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,500
 - Nature's joystick.

1674
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,580
 (all laughing)

1675
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,160
 (upbeat music)

1676
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,460
 - Okay, that's it.

1677
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,500
 That is all of our facts.

1678
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,900
