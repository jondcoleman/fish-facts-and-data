00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:14,00:00:15,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:15,00:00:17,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:17,00:00:19,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:19,00:00:20,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:24,00:00:25,and Anna Tyshinski.
00:00:25,00:00:27,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:27,00:00:30,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:30,00:00:33,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:33,00:00:37,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the first submarine"
00:00:40,00:00:44,"to go around the world was only seen by one civilian,"
00:00:44,00:00:46,a Filipino kayaker who saw the periscope
00:00:46,00:00:48,and thought it was a sea monster.
00:00:48,00:00:54,- It's pretty amazing because we have a photo of that man.
00:00:54,00:00:56,"Like this is, it looks--"
00:00:56,00:00:57,- Did they take the photo?
00:00:57,00:00:59,"- So we'll get into the big story,"
00:00:59,00:01:00,but there was a photographer on board.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"And so anytime the periscope went up,"
00:01:02,00:01:04,they took a photo of what the periscope was seeing.
00:01:04,00:01:07,"And in this shot, you had a man sitting there"
00:01:07,00:01:08,called Rufino.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"- Yeah, and we also know more about him"
00:01:10,00:01:12,'cause National Geographic went out looking for him.
00:01:12,00:01:13,- Yeah.
00:01:13,00:01:14,- And they found him and interviewed him.
00:01:14,00:01:15,And that's when they found out
00:01:15,00:01:17,that he thought it was a sea monster.
00:01:17,00:01:19,He immediately went home and painted the names
00:01:19,00:01:21,of Saints Peter and Paul on his boat
00:01:21,00:01:23,for protection against the sea monster.
00:01:23,00:01:24,- Sensible.
00:01:24,00:01:26,"- And by amazing coincidence,"
00:01:26,00:01:28,this submarine that we're about to talk about
00:01:28,00:01:30,started and ended at Saint Peter and Paul
00:01:30,00:01:33,Archipelago in the Atlantic.
00:01:33,00:01:33,- It's incredible to see this.
00:01:33,00:01:34,- What a coincidence.
00:01:34,00:01:35,- Yeah.
00:01:35,00:01:36,They've blown it wide open.
00:01:36,00:01:39,- Fervent evidence that we are living in a simulation.
00:01:39,00:01:41,- In a very unimaginative matrix.
00:01:41,00:01:45,"So yeah, this is a 1960, we're talking."
00:01:45,00:01:47,Middle of the Cold War.
00:01:47,00:01:51,"The Americans and the Soviets are not getting on very well,"
00:01:51,00:01:54,but maybe there's gonna be a peace summit in Paris.
00:01:54,00:01:55,"But before they do that,"
00:01:55,00:01:58,"the US decided to show off a bit and say,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,we've got a new submarine that can go all the way
00:02:00,00:02:01,around the world with no one noticing it.
00:02:01,00:02:03,And so that's why they did it.
00:02:03,00:02:05,It was called Operation Sandblast.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"- They could just say they'd done it, couldn't they?"
00:02:07,00:02:09,But literally we sailed all the way around the world
00:02:09,00:02:10,underwater without anyone noticing.
00:02:10,00:02:11,"- Yeah, but you're still here."
00:02:11,00:02:13,That's 'cause we went all the way around the world.
00:02:13,00:02:14,"- Yeah, we just finished."
00:02:14,00:02:16,They just should have sent it underwater
00:02:16,00:02:18,and they just had it coming through a big tape at the end.
00:02:18,00:02:19,- Yeah.
00:02:19,00:02:21,- They were really hardcore bright.
00:02:21,00:02:23,So there were a couple of moments where it looked dodgy
00:02:23,00:02:25,where really they should have come up.
00:02:25,00:02:26,And they didn't.
00:02:26,00:02:28,There's one instance where there was a member of the crew
00:02:28,00:02:29,"who had kidney stones,"
00:02:29,00:02:32,"and they did have to get him off the submarine,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,sort of halfway through the mission.
00:02:34,00:02:35,And they-
00:02:35,00:02:37,- They fired him out of the torpedo.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"- Basically, that might have been an option"
00:02:38,00:02:40,because what they ended up doing
00:02:40,00:02:42,was putting up a bit of the submarine out of the water
00:02:42,00:02:44,for him to be collected from it
00:02:44,00:02:46,while keeping the main hull underneath.
00:02:46,00:02:47,"- And they didn't know, like,"
00:02:47,00:02:48,"none of the crew knew what they were doing, did they?"
00:02:48,00:02:50,"Until they were out at sea, under sea."
00:02:50,00:02:52,There was just their captain captain beach.
00:02:52,00:02:54,It was quite nice giving it with sandblast.
00:02:54,00:02:55,- Amazing.
00:02:55,00:02:56,- Yeah.
00:02:56,00:02:57,"- And giving it, they were at sea."
00:02:57,00:02:58,What's the sea surrounded by?
00:02:58,00:02:59,The beach.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- Yeah, and it's got a beach under it, arguably, as well."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"- Well, let's discuss that, shall we?"
00:03:03,00:03:04,- Where is the beach?
00:03:04,00:03:06,I don't want to go on your package beach holiday.
00:03:06,00:03:07,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:03:07,00:03:09,I don't want to go on the picnic on the beach.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"Everyone, get your scuba gear on."
00:03:11,00:03:12,"But yeah, he didn't tell the crew"
00:03:12,00:03:15,until they were out seeing underwater.
00:03:15,00:03:16,And I think the crew had just been told
00:03:16,00:03:19,to prepare to be away a little bit longer than usual.
00:03:19,00:03:20,And then they're going around the world.
00:03:20,00:03:24,"- Yeah, they were told to get all the tax details in order"
00:03:24,00:03:26,'cause it was going to go over the tax year
00:03:26,00:03:27,while they were away.
00:03:27,00:03:27,- Really?
00:03:27,00:03:28,"- So they're like, whatever you do,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,make sure you pay your tax
00:03:30,00:03:31,because you're not going to be back in time for it.
00:03:31,00:03:33,"- It's a good excuse, though."
00:03:33,00:03:34,It's a very good excuse.
00:03:34,00:03:35,I love really like this.
00:03:35,00:03:38,"So the submarines these days,"
00:03:38,00:03:42,nuclear ones have their own way of making air on board.
00:03:42,00:03:43,But this one didn't have that capacity
00:03:43,00:03:45,'cause it was an early nuclear sub.
00:03:45,00:03:46,"It had to have its own,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,"it had to have a snorkel, basically."
00:03:48,00:03:49,"It would stick up the periscope and go,"
00:03:49,00:03:51,(gasps)
00:03:51,00:03:53,and then go back down again every night.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"- I actually, honestly,"
00:03:55,00:03:58,"this might just be a lying spot for me,"
00:03:58,00:04:01,but I didn't realize what a nuclear submarine was.
00:04:01,00:04:03,I thought a nuclear submarine was a submarine
00:04:03,00:04:04,that had nuclear bombs on it.
00:04:04,00:04:07,"I think because the British tried to once are,"
00:04:07,00:04:08,that's why I thought they all were.
00:04:08,00:04:09,- I just want to say the missiles are tried
00:04:09,00:04:10,at the submarines of Vanguard.
00:04:10,00:04:12,Sorry.
00:04:12,00:04:12,- Sure.
00:04:12,00:04:13,"- But yeah, no,"
00:04:13,00:04:16,will it can be a sub with nuclear missiles on board?
00:04:16,00:04:18,"- It can be, but by definition,"
00:04:18,00:04:19,a nuclear submarine is something
00:04:19,00:04:21,which is powered by a nuclear reactor.
00:04:21,00:04:23,And what that means is you can just stay under water
00:04:23,00:04:24,"for way longer,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,and these days you can make your own oxygen
00:04:26,00:04:27,using the nuclear reactor
00:04:27,00:04:29,"by taking in the sea water,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,"separating the hydrogen and oxygen,"
00:04:31,00:04:32,and that means you could stay under water
00:04:32,00:04:34,for months and years.
00:04:34,00:04:35,- Right. - It's so cool.
00:04:35,00:04:36,- There are various problems
00:04:36,00:04:38,with the fact that we can now have submarines
00:04:38,00:04:40,"under water forever, essentially."
00:04:40,00:04:42,There are various reasons why you can't do that.
00:04:42,00:04:44,So one of which is like all your clothes
00:04:44,00:04:45,"get so dirty in the end, you run out"
00:04:45,00:04:48,and people get claustrophobic and upset.
00:04:48,00:04:49,And another is rubbish.
00:04:49,00:04:51,I didn't know what they did with rubbish.
00:04:51,00:04:52,"- Oh, on this? - On submarines."
00:04:52,00:04:54,"- Oh, okay, yeah. - On sort of all submarines now,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"they bring on board lots of metal sheets,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,and then they have a special machine on board
00:04:59,00:05:03,"that turns the sheets into a cylinder to be a bin,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,"'cause obviously if they just brought on loads of bins,"
00:05:05,00:05:05,they take up too much space.
00:05:05,00:05:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:05:06,00:05:08,"- So then they throw-- - Space is in a premium, yeah."
00:05:08,00:05:09,- Space is a premium.
00:05:09,00:05:12,And then the bins all get secured
00:05:12,00:05:13,"once they're filled with rubbish,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,and then they just jettison them out of the submarine
00:05:15,00:05:17,with weights on them to take them to the bottom of the sea.
00:05:17,00:05:19,- To the bottom of the sea. - To the beach.
00:05:19,00:05:21,- To the beach! (laughing)
00:05:21,00:05:23,- The people sunbathing down there are pissed off about it.
00:05:23,00:05:25,"- That's crazy, 'cause the whole point of a submarine"
00:05:25,00:05:27,"is that, I mean, the whole game of being in a submarine"
00:05:27,00:05:29,"is that you're being quiet and undetectable,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,and enormous efforts are gone to
00:05:31,00:05:32,"to make submarines quiet and undetectable,"
00:05:32,00:05:35,but if they're just pooing out metal bins wherever they go.
00:05:35,00:05:36,- But you're not gonna see it.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"- The ocean is big, Andy."
00:05:38,00:05:40,"- No, I know, but the whole thing is,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"I mean, the amazing lengths they go to not to be spotted."
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- Well then, can I just say about the bins?"
00:05:44,00:05:46,Given that you've raised the issue.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- Oh my God, you sound like my neighbors."
00:05:48,00:05:52,"- What day do they go out again, is it?"
00:05:52,00:05:54,"- It's Tuesday this week, it's a bank holiday."
00:05:54,00:05:57,(laughing)
00:05:57,00:06:00,Some people on submarines say that they're so careful
00:06:00,00:06:01,about not drawing attention to themselves
00:06:01,00:06:03,"that eggs, old eggs they haven't eaten,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,are pre-broken before they're put
00:06:05,00:06:06,"in the trash disposal unit,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,"because if they broke after being released,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,they would generate enough sound
00:06:10,00:06:11,that they would be detectable.
00:06:11,00:06:12,- What?
00:06:12,00:06:14,That's how sensitive some other submarines are to noise.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Really? - Really?
00:06:15,00:06:16,"- Other submarines are constantly, yeah,"
00:06:16,00:06:19,they don't hear an egg break.
00:06:19,00:06:21,They absolutely get so quiet down there.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"- I've just, it's not that quiet under the water."
00:06:23,00:06:25,There's tons of animals down there.
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- It's pretty noisy, it's a lot."
00:06:26,00:06:28,How about the engine running the submarine?
00:06:28,00:06:29,What are they doing about that?
00:06:29,00:06:31,- That's very heavily buffered.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"- They put, you know, the egg boxes,"
00:06:32,00:06:33,they put them around them.
00:06:33,00:06:35,(laughing)
00:06:35,00:06:36,"- No, it is not how quiet they are."
00:06:36,00:06:38,"And so for example, bubbles."
00:06:38,00:06:39,- Oh yeah?
00:06:39,00:06:43,- They put the bubbles through a diffuser
00:06:43,00:06:45,to spread them out before they release them.
00:06:45,00:06:46,- Oh wow.
00:06:46,00:06:47,- 'Cause otherwise there's a big plume of bubbles
00:06:47,00:06:47,"at the surface, very obvious."
00:06:47,00:06:48,"Oh, there's a submarine down there."
00:06:48,00:06:50,"- Is that like, if you feel a big fart coming"
00:06:50,00:06:52,and you somehow managed to let it go out
00:06:52,00:06:54,in a very slow little--
00:06:54,00:06:55,- It's exactly like that.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"And spies, MI5 spies are trained to do that."
00:06:57,00:06:59,(laughing)
00:06:59,00:07:01,Just in case.
00:07:01,00:07:02,"- They're the only ships that fly Jolly Rogers,"
00:07:02,00:07:05,"which I should have actually phrased as,"
00:07:05,00:07:06,what flies a Jolly Roger?
00:07:06,00:07:07,- Submarines.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- I've screwed it up now, yeah,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,but if you hadn't done the research
00:07:11,00:07:13,"and I hadn't just said that, what would you have said?"
00:07:13,00:07:14,- I've known that for years.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"- Okay, but if you weren't a QI researcher."
00:07:17,00:07:19,- I just can't imagine the world where I would think.
00:07:19,00:07:20,(laughing)
00:07:20,00:07:20,I don't know that right now.
00:07:20,00:07:21,- I have a question.
00:07:21,00:07:22,- Yeah.
00:07:22,00:07:24,- Would be quite soggy.
00:07:24,00:07:25,(laughing)
00:07:25,00:07:26,- Kind of fly a flag under water.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- That's a good point.
00:07:27,00:07:29,They display it flattened.
00:07:29,00:07:31,I guess they fly it when they come up in triumph.
00:07:31,00:07:33,So I think traditionally if they've had a triumphant
00:07:33,00:07:37,"a sojourn, what do you call it, expedition?"
00:07:37,00:07:38,- Sojourn.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"- I don't think they call it sojourn, yeah."
00:07:39,00:07:40,(laughing)
00:07:40,00:07:42,I think they're pretty sure it most was.
00:07:42,00:07:44,"They go, ""Subs, you're going on a sojourn"
00:07:44,00:07:46,"""into the Baltic Sea now."""
00:07:46,00:07:47,- It's amazing.
00:07:47,00:07:48,There's no space on the submarine
00:07:48,00:07:50,'cause most people are wearing crevats.
00:07:50,00:07:52,The number of cigarette holders you have to have on board.
00:07:52,00:07:53,It just takes up loads of space.
00:07:53,00:07:54,- And then the actual battle itself
00:07:54,00:07:56,is called a box social.
00:07:56,00:07:58,(laughing)
00:07:58,00:07:59,"- Whatever they're called, mission."
00:07:59,00:08:00,"- Yeah, good, mission."
00:08:00,00:08:02,"- They, when you come back and you've had a good one,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,"you have the, you fly it."
00:08:04,00:08:05,Fly the Jolly Roger.
00:08:05,00:08:06,- If you've sunk somebody else.
00:08:06,00:08:07,"- I think if you've sunk someone else,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,but now I think they quite often do it
00:08:09,00:08:11,'cause sinkings happen very rarely these days.
00:08:11,00:08:14,And it's because it's a like middle finger
00:08:14,00:08:16,to firstly Lord Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson
00:08:16,00:08:18,who complained in 1901.
00:08:18,00:08:21,As I'm sure you'll remember that submarines
00:08:21,00:08:24,"were underhanded, unfair and damned un-English."
00:08:24,00:08:30,"And then in 1914 someone sunk someone else in the war,"
00:08:30,00:08:31,the great one.
00:08:31,00:08:34,"And they came back flying the Jolly Roger to say,"
00:08:34,00:08:34,"""Screw you."
00:08:34,00:08:36,"""You think we're underhand and piratee."""
00:08:36,00:08:37,That's what we've done.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:38,00:08:38,- Interesting.
00:08:38,00:08:41,"There's so many correspondence in the fish inbox,"
00:08:41,00:08:44,fin box about nuclear submarines.
00:08:44,00:08:46,Almost all our listeners seem to be on nuclear submarines.
00:08:46,00:08:47,It's stunning.
00:08:47,00:08:49,- I didn't know the wifi was that good down there.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Amazing.
00:08:50,00:08:51,- Yeah.
00:08:51,00:08:51,- They must pre-download.
00:08:51,00:08:52,(laughing)
00:08:52,00:08:53,"- Good point, yeah."
00:08:53,00:08:54,- Take a plunge.
00:08:54,00:08:55,- Yeah.
00:08:55,00:08:56,- What are they telling us?
00:08:56,00:08:57,"- Okay, well."
00:08:57,00:08:57,- State secrets.
00:08:57,00:08:59,- We've got some secret correspondence actually.
00:08:59,00:09:02,"Tim, I'll say Tim W writes."
00:09:02,00:09:03,It's okay 'cause his friend's brother
00:09:03,00:09:05,"is learning to operate a nuclear submarine,"
00:09:05,00:09:08,but you should not flush the loo at sea.
00:09:08,00:09:08,Why?
00:09:08,00:09:12,"- Well, there was once a U-boat that was sunk"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"because they flushed, it was kernel-slit."
00:09:14,00:09:15,- That's it.
00:09:15,00:09:16,- Yes.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"- And yeah, the whole thing went down."
00:09:18,00:09:21,- So that's a good reason not to do it.
00:09:21,00:09:23,But basically you shouldn't dump fresh water at sea.
00:09:23,00:09:24,- Okay.
00:09:24,00:09:29,- Because it has a different sonar signature to seawater.
00:09:29,00:09:32,It refracts sound waves differently.
00:09:32,00:09:34,And so it shows up as a massive blob.
00:09:34,00:09:34,"- Oh, come on."
00:09:34,00:09:35,- Wow.
00:09:35,00:09:36,- It gives you away.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- It gives you away.
00:09:37,00:09:39,- And it just keeps samples of different ocean water
00:09:39,00:09:41,that they are traveling in.
00:09:41,00:09:41,- 'Cause space.
00:09:41,00:09:43,- That gets put into the system whenever there's.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- Space is limited.
00:09:44,00:09:45,"No, that's a good idea."
00:09:45,00:09:45,That's a really good idea.
00:09:45,00:09:47,"- Well, it's actually, it's quite interesting."
00:09:47,00:09:49,I didn't realize this about oceans.
00:09:49,00:09:51,This story of the submarine going around the world
00:09:51,00:09:54,"has taught me this, that four days after"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"they were thought to be a sea monster in the Philippines,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,they were going in the Lombok Strait
00:09:58,00:10:00,and then they were making their way into the Indian Ocean.
00:10:00,00:10:03,"And then out of nowhere, they plunged"
00:10:03,00:10:08,"from periscope depth height to 125 feet in 40 seconds,"
00:10:08,00:10:12,because the density of the saltwater is different
00:10:12,00:10:14,in the Indian Ocean than it is to the Lombok Strait
00:10:14,00:10:15,that they were coming through.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"- Hang on, so it wasn't, it's not like there's a wall there"
00:10:18,00:10:20,and they hit it and suddenly drop like a rice grain.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"- I feel like it is, I think it is."
00:10:22,00:10:24,'Cause it came out of nowhere that they just plunged.
00:10:24,00:10:26,- I have a feeling that when you go from one ocean
00:10:26,00:10:30,"to another, you do get those like quite solid blocks."
00:10:30,00:10:30,- Really?
00:10:30,00:10:33,"- Yeah, because there's such different densities."
00:10:33,00:10:34,- They can't mix.
00:10:34,00:10:35,- Isn't that wild?
00:10:35,00:10:36,- It's crazy.
00:10:36,00:10:39,- I have a riddle for you.
00:10:39,00:10:40,- Yeah.
00:10:40,00:10:43,- The first people to successfully escape
00:10:43,00:10:45,from a submarine did it in 1851.
00:10:45,00:10:48,It was called La Plonge Marine Diver
00:10:48,00:10:50,and it was operated like a pedalo.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"So there were three crew, two crew on the pedalo bit,"
00:10:53,00:10:56,cycling along and then one bloke was captain.
00:10:56,00:11:00,"Anyway, they sank in a test dive in Kiel Harbor"
00:11:00,00:11:02,and they waited five hours for someone to rescue them.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"No one came, there's an escape hatch,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,but they can't push it open because they're underwater.
00:11:07,00:11:08,So the water pressure is too much.
00:11:08,00:11:10,And then the captain who was the inventor
00:11:10,00:11:12,"and he was a guy called Wilhelm Bauer,"
00:11:12,00:11:15,"he grabbed a small valve, unscrewed it and whipped it open."
00:11:15,00:11:18,"So water started coming in and his crewmates were like,"
00:11:18,00:11:19,"""What have you done?"
00:11:19,00:11:21,"""You've got mad, Wilhelm, you're going to kill us all."""
00:11:21,00:11:23,Why did he do it?
00:11:23,00:11:27,"- Is it the same reason as if you hold a straw,"
00:11:27,00:11:28,"the top of a straw and then put it in water,"
00:11:28,00:11:31,"the water stays in there because it releases pressure,"
00:11:31,00:11:34,which means then there isn't pressure holding the door closed.
00:11:34,00:11:35,"- Yes, 'cause what does the valve do?"
00:11:35,00:11:38,It lets water in from the outside.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"So as the water came in from the outside,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,then it equalized the pressure.
00:11:42,00:11:43,So suddenly you've got water inside as well as out.
00:11:43,00:11:44,So there's a really horrible moment
00:11:44,00:11:45,where you all have to hold your breath
00:11:45,00:11:47,as the whole thing fills up with water
00:11:47,00:11:48,and you're suffocating to death
00:11:48,00:11:50,'cause the CO2 levels are so extreme.
00:11:50,00:11:53,And then suddenly it hit the pressure equality
00:11:53,00:11:56,and it went pop open and it fired them up onto the surface
00:11:56,00:11:57,in the middle of their funerals.
00:11:57,00:11:58,- What?
00:11:58,00:12:00,"- Yeah, they were doing an impromptu service"
00:12:00,00:12:01,'cause it had been over seven hours.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"- Pretty quick, I'm sorry."
00:12:03,00:12:05,I would like more efforts to be made for me.
00:12:05,00:12:07,"- He's been in that toilet 20 minutes,"
00:12:07,00:12:08,should we have a beer or not?
00:12:08,00:12:10,"- That doesn't make any sense, Adam."
00:12:10,00:12:13,- The ones with the new partners.
00:12:13,00:12:14,- They were having a service.
00:12:14,00:12:16,They assumed they were dead.
00:12:16,00:12:19,"A little, not that the coffins weren't out yet."
00:12:19,00:12:20,- Have you seen the other way
00:12:20,00:12:22,that you can escape a submarine if it is sunk?
00:12:22,00:12:26,"- You disguise yourself as an egg, I know this."
00:12:26,00:12:28,"- No, what are the lifeboats of a submarine if it sinks?"
00:12:28,00:12:30,- Like smaller submarines?
00:12:30,00:12:31,- Like torpedoes?
00:12:31,00:12:33,"- No, it's a suit that you wear."
00:12:33,00:12:36,"It's a life raft, but you're in the life raft."
00:12:36,00:12:37,- You are in the raft.
00:12:37,00:12:38,- And you have a picture homer working
00:12:38,00:12:41,"in the nuclear power plant with that big helmet on,"
00:12:41,00:12:43,but it's all fabric and he can see
00:12:43,00:12:44,through a window in his face.
00:12:44,00:12:48,"It's, you could've just said picture a house chem suit"
00:12:48,00:12:50,and there's no need to bring the Simpsons in.
00:12:50,00:12:54,"That's another way, a more bland way"
00:12:54,00:12:56,of giving the picture to the audience.
00:12:56,00:12:59,So you go out of the submarine and you slowly rise
00:12:59,00:13:01,"and then you're just bobbing up there,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,waiting to be rescued.
00:13:02,00:13:03,- But I think a lot of the time
00:13:03,00:13:05,"if you're stuck, you're stuck, right?"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"- Yes, it's not soul proof this."
00:13:07,00:13:10,"- Yeah, I think it's almost never that you can get out."
00:13:10,00:13:11,"- We have one other person, right,"
00:13:11,00:13:15,who actually was a sonar operator on a nuclear submarine.
00:13:15,00:13:18,"This is so cool because with sonar, right,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,what you can do is it lets you count the number
00:13:21,00:13:22,of blades on a propeller.
00:13:22,00:13:24,So you can guess what kind of ship something is
00:13:24,00:13:26,by your knowledge of the propeller.
00:13:26,00:13:28,- Because you fire your sonar at the propeller
00:13:28,00:13:30,and sometimes it hits and sometimes it misses.
00:13:30,00:13:31,- Pretty much.
00:13:31,00:13:32,And then you can make an educated guess as to the kind
00:13:32,00:13:33,of propeller and therefore what kind
00:13:33,00:13:34,of submarine you're observing.
00:13:34,00:13:36,So the whole game is to cover up the propeller
00:13:36,00:13:38,when you're in a public port for secrecy.
00:13:38,00:13:40,So no one knows how many blades you've got
00:13:40,00:13:43,on your propeller in case someone spots you.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"And this, I should say it's a diesel electric submarine"
00:13:45,00:13:47,"as well, so it's slightly different."
00:13:47,00:13:49,But it's for sneaking around the Norwegian fjords
00:13:49,00:13:51,and for that kind of stuff.
00:13:51,00:13:54,"And I love this, I'm just going to read this."
00:13:54,00:13:57,The snorkel has a valve at the top that automatically closes
00:13:57,00:13:58,"if a wave goes over it, right?"
00:13:58,00:13:59,The snorkel bit.
00:13:59,00:14:03,"But then when that happens, the diesel engine suck loads"
00:14:03,00:14:05,of the air from the rest of the submarine
00:14:05,00:14:07,and that means the air pressure drops.
00:14:07,00:14:10,So it really hurts everyone's ears on board.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"But what that then means, if the air is moist,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,the air spontaneously condenses
00:14:14,00:14:17,and it starts raining inside the submarine
00:14:17,00:14:19,because of the pressure changes that have happened.
00:14:19,00:14:20,So he says that's an amazing experience.
00:14:20,00:14:21,"- Oh, wow."
00:14:21,00:14:23,"On propellers, this is going from memory"
00:14:23,00:14:25,"so it might be wrong, but I think it's right."
00:14:25,00:14:29,"There was an episode of, I think, Doctor Who"
00:14:29,00:14:31,where they needed a submarine.
00:14:31,00:14:33,They got this model of submarine
00:14:33,00:14:35,and they looked at the propeller
00:14:35,00:14:37,and it was exactly the same as one of the most
00:14:37,00:14:40,secret submarines that the UK had.
00:14:40,00:14:42,"And the UK defence were like, holy shit,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,where did they get the designs from?
00:14:44,00:14:45,That's absolutely ridiculous.
00:14:45,00:14:48,And they brought these people into a questioning
00:14:48,00:14:49,"and said, well, where did you get it from?"
00:14:49,00:14:51,And it turned out they'd been to Woolworth's
00:14:51,00:14:54,and just bought a toy submarine and used it
00:14:54,00:14:57,"and just by coincidence, it had the exact same"
00:14:57,00:14:59,specifications as this British nuclear submarine.
00:14:59,00:15:01,- Oh my God.
00:15:01,00:15:02,- That's amazing.
00:15:02,00:15:04,(upbeat music)
00:15:04,00:15:10,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:15:10,00:15:11,and that is my fact.
00:15:11,00:15:13,My fact this week is that the original
00:15:13,00:15:16,little mermaid production was almost delayed
00:15:16,00:15:19,because all of their underwater bubbles
00:15:19,00:15:22,got caught up in the Tiananmen Square incident.
00:15:22,00:15:26,"- And tell me Dan, what exactly was the Tiananmen Square incident?"
00:15:26,00:15:29,- It was a-
00:15:29,00:15:30,- For all of our global listeners.
00:15:30,00:15:33,- It was a sojourn by the Red Army.
00:15:33,00:15:39,"- This was quite a surprising fact that the little mermaid,"
00:15:39,00:15:43,which was the last entirely hand drawn
00:15:43,00:15:46,"and hand coloured movie that Disney was producing,"
00:15:46,00:15:49,decided that rather than photocopying
00:15:49,00:15:51,"drawings of underwater bubbles,"
00:15:51,00:15:53,"they would have each individual bubble,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,millions of them drawn by hand
00:15:55,00:15:57,and they couldn't do that on their own.
00:15:57,00:15:59,So they farmed that out to a company
00:15:59,00:16:01,that was called Pacific Rim in China.
00:16:01,00:16:04,"- Great film, great film."
00:16:04,00:16:08,- And the offices of Pacific Rim happened to be
00:16:08,00:16:10,right next to Tiananmen Square
00:16:10,00:16:12,and when suddenly all the chaos broke out
00:16:12,00:16:14,"in Tiananmen Square, all the protests"
00:16:14,00:16:16,"and all the military coming in,"
00:16:16,00:16:17,the bubbles were still being drawn
00:16:17,00:16:19,and they were locked up in a safe there
00:16:19,00:16:21,and the producers didn't know
00:16:21,00:16:22,whether or not they were going to be able to get them out.
00:16:22,00:16:24,They didn't know how long this was going to last.
00:16:24,00:16:26,- And they're so fragile bubbles.
00:16:26,00:16:29,"I mean, that will pop at the slightest tweak, won't it?"
00:16:29,00:16:30,"- Exactly, and it'll give away their location"
00:16:30,00:16:31,if one goes off as well.
00:16:31,00:16:33,"- If you look carefully, a lot of the bubbles"
00:16:33,00:16:34,in the little mermaid are actually eggs
00:16:34,00:16:37,"that have been just up to the user then, yeah, yeah."
00:16:37,00:16:39,But they did manage to get them out of the building.
00:16:39,00:16:40,They got them onto a ship.
00:16:40,00:16:42,So it's quite interesting there to ship
00:16:42,00:16:45,their bubbles back over to the States
00:16:45,00:16:47,"and then they made it into the film, but it's, yeah."
00:16:47,00:16:48,"- So if you look at the film,"
00:16:48,00:16:51,"so I was watching lots of clips, and once you know this,"
00:16:51,00:16:52,there are shed loads of bubbles.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"Every time they move, there's bubbles all over the shop."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- To be honest, like that's one of the best things"
00:16:57,00:17:00,about the movie is the way they animated the water.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"- Yeah, it's very good."
00:17:01,00:17:02,"And it would have been worse, I think,"
00:17:02,00:17:03,if they had done the photocopying.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"- Agreed, agreed."
00:17:04,00:17:06,- 'Cause it was quite interesting.
00:17:06,00:17:08,"So it's the Xerox process they called it,"
00:17:08,00:17:09,"which is a bit like photocopying,"
00:17:09,00:17:11,but for animation and for film.
00:17:11,00:17:13,And they should have used that
00:17:13,00:17:15,'cause that's what people had been using.
00:17:15,00:17:18,I think the last film to use the hand-drawn method
00:17:18,00:17:21,"was Sleeping Beauty, which was ages before that."
00:17:21,00:17:25,"But when you photocopy stuff, it gives it a black outline."
00:17:25,00:17:27,And this was so interesting
00:17:27,00:17:29,because if you watch any Disney film
00:17:29,00:17:30,"that was Sleeping Beauty in before,"
00:17:30,00:17:34,"so like Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,there's no black lines around the cartoons.
00:17:36,00:17:38,So they're all like realistic.
00:17:38,00:17:39,Like I'm wearing a yellow jumper.
00:17:39,00:17:40,There's no black line around it.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"There's just yellow jumper, then air."
00:17:42,00:17:44,"And that's if you watch Sleeping Beauty, you'll see that."
00:17:44,00:17:48,Every film after that has black lines around the cartoon.
00:17:48,00:17:50,So they look more cartoon-y and less realistic.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"And if you do want to sound like a big old snob,"
00:17:53,00:17:55,you can just say is a very inferior period
00:17:55,00:17:59,of animation for Disney before they fixed it.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"And sweetly, that was for Beauty and the Beast."
00:18:02,00:18:03,They brought the beauty back.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"- The co-director of The Little Mermaid, John Musker, said,"
00:18:06,00:18:10,'cause he was interviewed about the bubble thing.
00:18:10,00:18:12,"And he said, ""Yeah, no, we cared about the guy"
00:18:12,00:18:15,"""in front of the tank and that democracy might take root there."
00:18:15,00:18:18,"""But we were wondering, what's going on with our bubbles?"""
00:18:18,00:18:19,(laughing)
00:18:19,00:18:22,"- In the next paragraph, he reveals he was joking."
00:18:22,00:18:23,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:23,00:18:25,"'Cause this was an incident where,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"well, there was loads of protests in China,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"pro-democracy protests,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,and the Chinese government went in and killed a lot of people.
00:18:31,00:18:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:33,00:18:35,"James and I, you and I met Kate Adie,"
00:18:35,00:18:36,who was there at the time. - I am.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"- And the footage, The Little Mermaid premiere."
00:18:38,00:18:39,(laughing)
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Wow.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"- She's always been heart-hitting, but I had no idea."
00:18:42,00:18:44,Right in the thick of it.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"- Yeah, she's bubble-obsessed."
00:18:46,00:18:49,"She was there, and the footage that was taken,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"I think James, am I right in saying it's particularly"
00:18:51,00:18:53,"the footage of the man standing in front of the tank,"
00:18:53,00:18:56,"she had to get that back to a British embassy,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,"and she had some Chinese guards trying to take the camera,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,"at reals offer, so that she couldn't get through."
00:19:01,00:19:03,So she ended up kicking one of them in the nuts
00:19:03,00:19:06,and climbing over a wall in order to get into safety.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"And yeah, so that's how we have the footage."
00:19:09,00:19:10,"It was Kate Adie. - Oh, wow."
00:19:10,00:19:11,I didn't know that.
00:19:11,00:19:11,- I believe that's right.
00:19:11,00:19:14,"It's certainly what she told us, yeah."
00:19:14,00:19:16,"- Just a fact for Dan, about that,"
00:19:16,00:19:21,"the Simpsons, they have an episode where they go to China,"
00:19:21,00:19:25,"and in the middle of it, there is a picture on Tiananmen Square,"
00:19:25,00:19:28,"it says Tiananmen Square, on this site in 1989,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"nothing happened, which is obviously about the fact"
00:19:31,00:19:34,"that references to it are banned in China,"
00:19:34,00:19:38,"but then Disney decided to omit that episode of The Simpsons,"
00:19:38,00:19:39,so you can't watch that in China anyway.
00:19:39,00:19:40,- Really?
00:19:40,00:19:41,- Yeah.
00:19:41,00:19:43,- What's the Disney film that they made about Mermaid?
00:19:43,00:19:45,"- Little Mermaid, Andy."
00:19:45,00:19:46,- Uh-uh.
00:19:46,00:19:46,(laughing)
00:19:46,00:19:49,- The first Disney film about a mermaid was Splash.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"- You didn't say, you didn't set a specify first."
00:19:51,00:19:52,"- Yeah, you didn't."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"- You just said, what's the film they made?"
00:19:54,00:19:55,"- Oh, what was the first one?"
00:19:55,00:19:56,It was Splash.
00:19:56,00:19:57,- Daryl Hanna.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"- Daryl Hanna, and falling in love with Tom Hanks."
00:19:58,00:19:59,Who wouldn't?
00:19:59,00:20:01,- Walking out of the water with her bum out.
00:20:01,00:20:02,- Yeah.
00:20:02,00:20:03,- How it was a teenager when that came out.
00:20:03,00:20:05,- That must have been formative.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"- I think they've re-edited it,"
00:20:07,00:20:08,so she's got longer hair now.
00:20:08,00:20:11,"So I'm afraid, James, the next time you--"
00:20:11,00:20:11,- Really?
00:20:11,00:20:14,"- You want to see Daryl Hanna's bum,"
00:20:14,00:20:16,"you'll have to do it some other way, basically."
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Because, yeah, there's a waste to do that"
00:20:18,00:20:19,on the internet these days.
00:20:19,00:20:21,I don't believe so.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"No, yeah, so they made Splash way before"
00:20:23,00:20:25,"they made The Little Mermaid, like five years before."
00:20:25,00:20:27,"They were trying to make films for grown-ups,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,and this was their first one.
00:20:29,00:20:31,"You know, she's a mermaid, Tom Hanks is a man,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,and they fall for each other.
00:20:33,00:20:34,- But we've all seen Splash.
00:20:34,00:20:35,- It's the story of The Little Mermaid.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"- I can't believe you're leading with that,"
00:20:37,00:20:39,rather than the fact you just dropped in
00:20:39,00:20:41,that they've extended Daryl Hanna's hair
00:20:41,00:20:42,in the modern version to cover her bum.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"- Oh, they didn't give her a hairy bum, they extended."
00:20:44,00:20:46,(laughing)
00:20:46,00:20:47,I misunderstood.
00:20:47,00:20:50,- You didn't say which hair they extended in best.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"- Yeah, they've extended her back hair."
00:20:52,00:20:53,(laughing)
00:20:53,00:20:55,"- Yeah, they've extended her bum hair,"
00:20:55,00:20:56,and then they plait it into her head.
00:20:56,00:20:57,"- Oh, God."
00:20:57,00:21:02,- The British Board of Film Classification
00:21:02,00:21:05,have some things to say about The Little Mermaid.
00:21:05,00:21:08,"In the Additional Issues section of the website,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"it says, ""In one scene, a female character"
00:21:10,00:21:12,"""comically shakes her bottom,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,"""while singing about the importance of body language"
00:21:14,00:21:16,"""in attracting a man."""
00:21:16,00:21:18,- Hmm.
00:21:18,00:21:19,And what's the issue there?
00:21:19,00:21:20,- Violet.
00:21:20,00:21:20,- Not woke.
00:21:20,00:21:22,(laughing)
00:21:22,00:21:26,I had a look at a lot of other Disney movies on the BBFC
00:21:26,00:21:29,to see what their additional issues are.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"In Frozen, there is some very mild humor,"
00:21:31,00:21:34,including reference to picking your nose and eating it.
00:21:34,00:21:36,(laughing)
00:21:36,00:21:39,- Which is offensive to children.
00:21:39,00:21:40,- It's on there.
00:21:40,00:21:41,- Wow.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"- In Brave, there are moments of mild rude behavior,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,such as a Scotsman burying his behind
00:21:45,00:21:47,by lifting his kilt.
00:21:47,00:21:48,(laughing)
00:21:48,00:21:50,"- Well, they've extended his hair, so that's okay."
00:21:50,00:21:51,(laughing)
00:21:51,00:21:53,"- And in Honey, I Struck the Kids,"
00:21:53,00:21:54,"which was also a Disney movie,"
00:21:54,00:21:57,there are upsetting scenes when a friendly aunt is killed.
00:21:57,00:22:00,(laughing)
00:22:00,00:22:00,- So just beware.
00:22:00,00:22:01,- But this is someone's job.
00:22:01,00:22:02,- Wow.
00:22:02,00:22:03,'Cause there are those terrific Christian websites
00:22:03,00:22:05,which do this kind of forensic detail.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"- Well, this is on the BBFC."
00:22:07,00:22:08,- Wow.
00:22:08,00:22:10,"- I quite like how they did Ariel's whole look,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,'cause Daryl Hannah played a part
00:22:12,00:22:14,in how Ariel looked as well.
00:22:14,00:22:15,"- So she is the little mermaid, right?"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"- Yeah, so Ariel is the little mermaid."
00:22:17,00:22:18,"Splash had come out,"
00:22:18,00:22:20,"and so they changed her hair color,"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"Ariel's hair color to red,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,because the original hair color was too similar
00:22:24,00:22:25,to Daryl Hannah's.
00:22:25,00:22:29,So that had a very immediate influence on their movie.
00:22:29,00:22:33,"The actress, Alyssa Milano, was the face model for Ariel."
00:22:33,00:22:36,"There was a different body model who they had come in,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,"who was a comedian improviser,"
00:22:38,00:22:39,who came in and would do all the scenes.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"So you can see the footage of them doing the scenes,"
00:22:41,00:22:42,so all the body movements were equaled.
00:22:42,00:22:43,- Is that Sherry Stoner?
00:22:43,00:22:44,- Sherry Stoner.
00:22:44,00:22:46,"- Well, there are hardly any people alive"
00:22:46,00:22:48,"with the body of the little mermaid, aren't there?"
00:22:48,00:22:49,(laughing)
00:22:49,00:22:50,There was actually very little competition for that.
00:22:50,00:22:52,"- You're right, there is half of the body."
00:22:52,00:22:54,- A lot of her material as a stand-up
00:22:54,00:22:56,is about the fact that she has a massive tail.
00:22:56,00:22:56,(laughing)
00:22:56,00:22:57,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:22:57,00:22:59,But the most interesting one is the hair
00:22:59,00:23:01,and how it moves in the water.
00:23:01,00:23:04,"And that was inspired by the Space Shuttle astronaut,"
00:23:04,00:23:05,Sally Ride.
00:23:05,00:23:08,They looked at her hair in zero gravity
00:23:08,00:23:10,to create the water look that they needed.
00:23:10,00:23:11,So yeah.
00:23:11,00:23:13,- Someone who gets a lot of shit is Sebastian
00:23:13,00:23:14,and the little mermaid.
00:23:14,00:23:15,- The crab.
00:23:15,00:23:16,- Yeah.
00:23:16,00:23:17,- The friendly Jamaican crab.
00:23:17,00:23:18,- Oh.
00:23:18,00:23:19,- Under the sea.
00:23:19,00:23:20,- What's Sebastian's accent?
00:23:20,00:23:21,- Jamaica.
00:23:21,00:23:22,- Jamaica.
00:23:22,00:23:23,- Incorrect.
00:23:23,00:23:24,- Caribbean.
00:23:24,00:23:27,"- Well, I mean, you just broadened it."
00:23:27,00:23:28,So it's not fair.
00:23:28,00:23:30,(laughing)
00:23:30,00:23:32,"So Sebastian, he was originally gonna be called Clarence"
00:23:32,00:23:34,and he was gonna be like a posh English guy.
00:23:34,00:23:35,And they made a good move.
00:23:35,00:23:37,"'Cause you can imagine he was really strict,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,that Zazu type character.
00:23:39,00:23:41,You can imagine why they wanted to do that.
00:23:41,00:23:42,- Rowan Atkinson style voice.
00:23:42,00:23:43,- Exactly.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"And then they thought, let's make him more fun."
00:23:46,00:23:48,So they decided to make him Jamaican.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"But then they found the person to play him, Samuel E. Wright,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,who'd just been in a film playing Dizzy Gillespie.
00:23:53,00:23:56,"And Samuel E. Wright couldn't do a Jamaican accent,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,but he could do a Trinidadian accent.
00:23:58,00:24:00,"So actually, tell everyone you know,"
00:24:00,00:24:02,he doesn't speak with a Jamaican accent.
00:24:02,00:24:03,- That's really interesting.
00:24:03,00:24:04,- He speaks with a Trinidadian accent.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"- Because a few years later, when they made Cool Runnings,"
00:24:07,00:24:10,they brought in these four Jamaican actors.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"And they said, okay, can you do these lines?"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"And they said, well, you don't sound Jamaican."
00:24:15,00:24:17,"And they're like, well, we actually are Jamaican."
00:24:17,00:24:17,This is how we talk.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"And they're like, no, no, we need you to sound"
00:24:19,00:24:21,like the crab from The Little Mermaid.
00:24:21,00:24:22,- No way!
00:24:22,00:24:24,"James, we've pieced it together."
00:24:24,00:24:24,- It's amazing.
00:24:24,00:24:26,"The producer basically said,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"if you don't sound like Sebastian, I'm gonna get fired."
00:24:29,00:24:33,And so they all put on these kind of like fake Jamaican accents.
00:24:33,00:24:34,- That's amazing.
00:24:34,00:24:35,- That's bizarre.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- Wow.
00:24:36,00:24:39,"- Okay, so the reason that the crab was made Jamaican,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,"let's say Jamaican, despite the accent,"
00:24:41,00:24:44,was the songwriters were working literally
00:24:44,00:24:46,in the room next door to the animators.
00:24:46,00:24:48,And each other were influencing
00:24:48,00:24:49,how the movie was going along.
00:24:49,00:24:51,And one of the songwriters came in
00:24:51,00:24:53,"and said to the filmmakers,"
00:24:53,00:24:55,tell me about Sebastian the crab.
00:24:55,00:24:57,They said he's this British posh guy.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"They said, can you make him something more Caribbean?"
00:25:00,00:25:01,Can you make him Jamaican?
00:25:01,00:25:03,Because I think this song under the sea
00:25:03,00:25:06,will be great as like a Calypso-style song.
00:25:06,00:25:07,And the accent will go great with that.
00:25:07,00:25:09,And they changed it for that reason
00:25:09,00:25:11,'cause they were working in tandem together.
00:25:11,00:25:14,- So if you find a VHS of The Little Mermaid
00:25:14,00:25:16,"and it has a drawing of the penis on the cover,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"could be worth up to 30,000 pounds."
00:25:18,00:25:19,- Really?
00:25:19,00:25:20,- And it doesn't work if you just get one
00:25:20,00:25:22,and get it right on yourself.
00:25:23,00:25:26,- Is that true? - This is true.
00:25:26,00:25:28,- I thought this was sort of urban myth.
00:25:28,00:25:29,- There are mythy parts about it.
00:25:29,00:25:31,So there's a guy called Bill Morrison
00:25:31,00:25:33,"who was drawing all the artwork,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,a little mermaid who's doing all the different things.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"And they said, can you do the VHS?"
00:25:37,00:25:39,And they said it really last minute
00:25:39,00:25:40,and it was the middle of the night
00:25:40,00:25:42,and his deadline was just coming up there.
00:25:42,00:25:44,And he just sort of scribbled something together.
00:25:44,00:25:47,And it had to look like this sort of castle
00:25:47,00:25:48,in the background.
00:25:48,00:25:49,And castles have turrets.
00:25:49,00:25:51,And turrets can look phallic sometimes
00:25:51,00:25:52,if you're not concentrating.
00:25:52,00:25:54,- Your penises all have cretolations.
00:25:54,00:25:56,- Yeah.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- Yes, they do."
00:25:57,00:25:58,- Okay.
00:25:58,00:26:00,- How do you think we fire arrows out of them?
00:26:00,00:26:01,(laughing)
00:26:01,00:26:03,- When do you think the boiling oil comes from?
00:26:03,00:26:06,(laughing)
00:26:06,00:26:09,So he rushed to do it and then he made this thing
00:26:09,00:26:11,and no one noticed it for ages.
00:26:11,00:26:12,- So was it deliberate?
00:26:12,00:26:13,"- No, no, that's the thing."
00:26:13,00:26:14,"- It was just, yeah."
00:26:14,00:26:17,- The myth goes that it's some pissed off employee of Disney
00:26:17,00:26:19,who put a penis in there to piss everyone off.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"In actual fact, it was this guy who was doing his best"
00:26:21,00:26:24,and just happened to accidentally draw a penis
00:26:24,00:26:25,in the thing.
00:26:25,00:26:28,And then it basically came about that someone noticed it
00:26:28,00:26:29,once it had already been imprinted
00:26:29,00:26:31,and Disney were furious.
00:26:31,00:26:33,(laughing)
00:26:33,00:26:35,They're not really so relaxed about this kind of thing.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"They said, if we find out who did that,"
00:26:37,00:26:38,they're never gonna work for us again.
00:26:38,00:26:39,"And this guy's company was,"
00:26:39,00:26:42,this was most of their work doing stuff for Disney.
00:26:42,00:26:45,"So in the end, you either kind of pretend"
00:26:45,00:26:46,that you don't know anything about it
00:26:46,00:26:48,"or you say, look, it was us, but it was an accident."
00:26:48,00:26:49,And that's what they did.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"And eventually Disney sort of realized that they were,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,it was an accident and they carried into it.
00:26:54,00:26:56,- Imagine the Dick Mountain ride at Disneyland.
00:26:56,00:26:57,(laughing)
00:26:57,00:26:59,"- Very, very, very steep up."
00:26:59,00:27:02,"Very, very, very steep down the other side."
00:27:02,00:27:03,- Good.
00:27:03,00:27:06,- And Bill Morrison won for Dan.
00:27:06,00:27:09,He left this company and went to work for the Simpsons
00:27:09,00:27:10,where he did some drawing for them.
00:27:10,00:27:11,So there you go.
00:27:11,00:27:12,- Is that why Homer Simpson's head
00:27:12,00:27:14,also looks like a penis?
00:27:14,00:27:16,(laughing)
00:27:16,00:27:20,"- This was about bubbles in ""The Little Mermaid"""
00:27:20,00:27:23,"in ""Frozen"", which is another princess movie."
00:27:23,00:27:25,"Obviously not bubbles, but snow."
00:27:25,00:27:27,"Snowflake, stuff like that."
00:27:27,00:27:29,And there is a thing down which I'm sure you know about
00:27:29,00:27:32,"called the ""Diatlov Pass"" incident."
00:27:32,00:27:34,It's a conspiracy theory thing
00:27:34,00:27:37,about a load of kids who went walking
00:27:37,00:27:38,just outside of Katrinberg.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"- And disappeared, doesn't mean anything."
00:27:39,00:27:42,- They disappeared and we never know what happened to them.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"And last year, thanks to ""Frozen"","
00:27:44,00:27:46,we might have found out what happened to them.
00:27:46,00:27:49,And that's because the technology they used
00:27:49,00:27:51,"to make the snow in ""Frozen"" was so amazing,"
00:27:51,00:27:53,"like the computer programs,"
00:27:53,00:27:55,that you could use that to work out
00:27:55,00:27:58,what happens with avalanches.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"There was a scientist called Johann Gaum,"
00:28:00,00:28:04,who was from the Snow Avalanche Simulation Laboratory
00:28:04,00:28:05,in Switzerland.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"And he saw ""Frozen"" and he thought,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,"""What they're doing is amazing."""
00:28:08,00:28:08,"And he went over and he said,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"""Can I borrow your technology"
00:28:10,00:28:13,"""to show what happens with avalanches?"""
00:28:13,00:28:16,And he tried it and using the lie of the land
00:28:16,00:28:18,"in ""Diatlov"" and stuff like that,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,he showed that it was possible
00:28:19,00:28:22,that these kids might have been taken away by an avalanche
00:28:22,00:28:25,as opposed to a Yeti or aliens
00:28:25,00:28:26,or whatever everyone else thought.
00:28:26,00:28:27,"- Wow. - And that was ""Frozen""."
00:28:27,00:28:29,"- That was ""Frozen"" that did it."
00:28:29,00:28:30,- 'Cause I thought you were gonna say
00:28:30,00:28:33,"the other sort of wild theory about ""Frozen"""
00:28:33,00:28:36,is the reason that that title was picked for the movie
00:28:36,00:28:39,was to stop everyone from spreading the idea
00:28:39,00:28:41,"that Disney was ""Frozen"" cryogenically."
00:28:41,00:28:42,So if you went on Google
00:28:42,00:28:44,"and you put Disney, ""Frozen"","
00:28:44,00:28:46,you get the movie now as opposed to this-
00:28:46,00:28:47,- Walt Disney's head.
00:28:47,00:28:48,- Walt Disney's head has been-
00:28:48,00:28:50,"- That's so cryogenically. - ""Frozen"" cryogenically, yeah."
00:28:50,00:28:51,That is a theory out there.
00:28:51,00:28:54,(upbeat music)
00:28:54,00:28:59,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:59,00:29:00,and that is Andy.
00:29:00,00:29:04,- My fact is that the longest road tunnel in the world
00:29:04,00:29:08,is so long that the builders recruited a team of psychologists
00:29:08,00:29:11,to stop people crashing halfway through.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"So this is a tunnel called the Ladal Tunnel in Norway,"
00:29:13,00:29:16,and it is 24 kilometers long.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"So what's that, 17, 18 miles?"
00:29:17,00:29:18,"It's quite, it's long."
00:29:18,00:29:20,"- Yeah, it's the longest."
00:29:20,00:29:22,"- It's been over 25 years now,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,and it helps people drive between Oslo and Bergen.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"And it's partly because Norway is so crinkly,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,"and it's hard to get around,"
00:29:29,00:29:32,and the perilous crossing the mountain path is in winter.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"So you either fly little distances in small planes,"
00:29:35,00:29:36,"which is a big way of getting around there,"
00:29:36,00:29:40,"or you drive, but this allows you to drive much straight up"
00:29:40,00:29:41,'cause you're in a tunnel.
00:29:41,00:29:42,That's how tunnels work.
00:29:42,00:29:44,"- Yeah, it helps goods get through as well."
00:29:44,00:29:45,"- Completely, yeah, yeah, all of that."
00:29:45,00:29:49,"So it was a very impressive engineering project, but--"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"- Do we know the effect of the psychologist,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,"like what they said, and what happened?"
00:29:53,00:29:54,"- Yeah, that's the important part there."
00:29:54,00:29:56,"- Yeah, that's what they did."
00:29:56,00:29:59,They were consulted on how people can drive through
00:29:59,00:30:00,"this tunnel and not go crackers,"
00:30:00,00:30:03,"because it's 20 minutes of the same lighting,"
00:30:03,00:30:07,"the same panels passing you, it's hypnotic, you're driving."
00:30:07,00:30:10,- I'm already going crackers just from you saying that.
00:30:10,00:30:12,"- You've crashed into the wall, James, there we go,"
00:30:12,00:30:13,you've hit the wall.
00:30:13,00:30:13,- And no radio signal.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"Can't get radio forward in the middle of a tunnel, can you?"
00:30:15,00:30:16,- Exactly. - Always the annoying thing
00:30:16,00:30:17,about tunnels. - That's true.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"- It's like being in a nuclear submarine, basically."
00:30:19,00:30:21,- You should pre-download before you go through the tunnel.
00:30:21,00:30:22,- Pre-download before you go through.
00:30:22,00:30:24,- You've got to talk about this pre-download thing.
00:30:24,00:30:26,"- So the shrinks, basically,"
00:30:26,00:30:29,"they were a crack team of shrinks were called in and said,"
00:30:29,00:30:30,"""Oh, yes."""
00:30:30,00:30:32,"And they said, they said--"
00:30:32,00:30:34,- They were the people who were originally cast
00:30:34,00:30:34,in the place of Astrid.
00:30:34,00:30:38,"- Yeah, they were, and they said,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"""Well, you've got to break it up for people."
00:30:40,00:30:43,"You've got to make it feel more varied."""
00:30:43,00:30:46,"- I'll be honest, Andy, I think,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"without any psychological training,"
00:30:49,00:30:50,I reckon breaking things up
00:30:50,00:30:53,"so people don't get bored is pretty root one, isn't it?"
00:30:53,00:30:56,- Like this bit of me speaking.
00:30:56,00:30:57,And you've just helped to do that
00:30:57,00:30:59,by breaking it up so that people at home
00:30:59,00:31:01,haven't crashed themselves.
00:31:01,00:31:04,"- That's what this podcast is, is us breaking up"
00:31:04,00:31:09,Andy's monotonous words for the listener.
00:31:09,00:31:10,"- Okay, that's enough, Anna."
00:31:10,00:31:12,"Okay, let's do another five colloases, Andy."
00:31:12,00:31:13,- Thank you.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"- So basically, there are these mountain caves,"
00:31:15,00:31:17,"as they get called, strategically placed along."
00:31:17,00:31:19,"And every five minutes, you get to another mountain cave."
00:31:19,00:31:21,The lighting all changes completely.
00:31:21,00:31:25,The road opens out and it looks like you're driving into
00:31:25,00:31:27,a sort of beautiful mountain pass.
00:31:27,00:31:28,It looks like there's daylight above you.
00:31:28,00:31:29,It's really gorgeous.
00:31:29,00:31:30,- I think it looks quite tri--
00:31:30,00:31:32,I would feel like the drugs had kicked in
00:31:32,00:31:34,as soon as I got to certain bits of it.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"It's like avatar in there, all of a sudden."
00:31:36,00:31:37,- It is a bit.
00:31:37,00:31:39,"- It's like you're in an aquarium,"
00:31:39,00:31:42,like you're in the actual water with it surrounding you.
00:31:42,00:31:46,"It's like mountainous-y dark blue, trippy as hell."
00:31:46,00:31:48,"- I would want like, 'cause you're expecting a tunnel."
00:31:48,00:31:49,I'd go into that tunnel
00:31:49,00:31:51,and suddenly you're not really in a tunnel anymore.
00:31:51,00:31:53,I agree with that and I would freak the fuck out of me.
00:31:53,00:31:54,- You've had a lot of tunnel already.
00:31:54,00:31:57,You're filled to the back teeth with tunnel.
00:31:57,00:31:59,What you want is a bit of variety.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"I mean, I don't think people frequently go do"
00:32:01,00:32:04,"lally halfway along a tunnel, so it clearly works."
00:32:04,00:32:05,- It is a good idea.
00:32:05,00:32:06,"And I think one of the reasons it's a good idea,"
00:32:06,00:32:07,"them doing this,"
00:32:07,00:32:11,"is 'cause for the longest road tunnel in the world,"
00:32:11,00:32:12,not many vehicles drive through it.
00:32:12,00:32:14,So a thousand vehicles a day.
00:32:14,00:32:16,So basically the chances are you're gonna be driving through
00:32:16,00:32:17,"completely on your own,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,"which is what would freak you out, right?"
00:32:19,00:32:21,"Like if you're going behind a bunch of cars, it's fine."
00:32:21,00:32:23,- Have you ever been driving in like a place
00:32:23,00:32:26,which is so the same that you think maybe I have died?
00:32:26,00:32:27,"- Yes, I have."
00:32:27,00:32:28,- I have done that.
00:32:28,00:32:29,- Oh my God.
00:32:29,00:32:30,- I was driving down the coast of Croatia
00:32:30,00:32:33,and there's all these inlets.
00:32:33,00:32:34,And you kind of go on an inlet
00:32:34,00:32:36,and you come background again and you drive for a bit
00:32:36,00:32:38,and you have another inlet and another inlet
00:32:38,00:32:40,and another inlet and they're almost all identical.
00:32:40,00:32:43,"And like after about two hours of that,"
00:32:43,00:32:44,"you're just like, maybe I have died."
00:32:44,00:32:47,Maybe one of these times I missed the corner.
00:32:47,00:32:49,I was doing this forever.
00:32:49,00:32:50,- It's fractal.
00:32:50,00:32:51,- Yeah.
00:32:51,00:32:53,- Do you have that thing when you're driving
00:32:53,00:32:56,"where you sort of come to and you realize,"
00:32:56,00:32:57,"""Oh, I just drove half an hour there."""
00:32:57,00:32:59,"You know, and then your conscious mind"
00:32:59,00:32:59,"reasserts yourself and you're like,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"""Oh, and you've got a bloodied knife next to you"
00:33:01,00:33:03,"""on the outside of the seat."""
00:33:03,00:33:06,And there's bags full of money in the boot.
00:33:06,00:33:08,- But not that bag.
00:33:08,00:33:09,Oh no.
00:33:09,00:33:14,"I once, in fact, more than once"
00:33:14,00:33:17,when I worked in an office as an accountant
00:33:17,00:33:20,would sort of come to at the desk
00:33:20,00:33:22,and not remember how I got there.
00:33:22,00:33:24,"Like as in I just sort of, I got up,"
00:33:24,00:33:26,"got out of the house, got dressed,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,"drive the car all the way to the office,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"sat down, started work without even realizing,"
00:33:31,00:33:32,"""Yeah, yeah, promise, yeah."""
00:33:32,00:33:34,"- Yeah, I see that."
00:33:34,00:33:36,Have you ever woken up midway through a fact on fish?
00:33:36,00:33:37,(laughing)
00:33:37,00:33:40,- I'm hopeful it might happen eventually on this.
00:33:40,00:33:42,It's called highway hypnosis.
00:33:42,00:33:46,And people noticed it all the way back to 1921
00:33:46,00:33:48,when it was called road hypnotism.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"And basically what it is, is even when you're looking"
00:33:51,00:33:53,"at something, your eyes are making very slight movements"
00:33:53,00:33:54,all the time.
00:33:54,00:33:57,Like your eyes are always like darting this way
00:33:57,00:33:58,and that and whatever.
00:33:58,00:34:00,And normally they're a response to something
00:34:00,00:34:03,that's happening outside as a bird go past or whatever.
00:34:03,00:34:05,But what happens when you're driving for ages
00:34:05,00:34:09,is your eyes start to go in this sort of predetermined pattern.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"They start, they're still moving,"
00:34:11,00:34:13,"but they move left and right, then up, then down,"
00:34:13,00:34:15,"then left, then right, then up, then down and whatever."
00:34:15,00:34:18,And the thing is they don't really alert the brain properly.
00:34:18,00:34:20,The brain starts thinking that not really
00:34:20,00:34:21,anything is happening.
00:34:21,00:34:23,And then you start losing concentration.
00:34:23,00:34:25,- So you should roll your eyes
00:34:25,00:34:26,round and around and around.
00:34:26,00:34:27,"- Well, you should take a break."
00:34:27,00:34:29,"- Or have something, or watch something on your phone."
00:34:29,00:34:30,That's another.
00:34:30,00:34:32,(all laughing)
00:34:32,00:34:34,"- As long as you pre-downloaded it though,"
00:34:34,00:34:35,that's the impact of that.
00:34:35,00:34:38,"- This tunnel, in 2000, I love this,"
00:34:38,00:34:41,someone got married in the middle of the Laerdal tunnel.
00:34:41,00:34:41,Did you read this?
00:34:41,00:34:42,- No.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"- It was a young couple, young Norwegian couple."
00:34:45,00:34:48,And the groom was called Ronny Rinder.
00:34:48,00:34:51,"And he said that his mother-in-law had attended the wedding,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,but she had been slightly skeptical about it.
00:34:53,00:34:54,And I just love this.
00:34:54,00:34:59,"He said, ""She's scared of two things, dogs and tunnels."
00:34:59,00:35:01,"""We've recently bought two Alsatians,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"""and now we've got married in the tunnel."""
00:35:03,00:35:04,(all laughing)
00:35:04,00:35:06,And I would say maybe the psychologist shouldn't.
00:35:06,00:35:07,(all laughing)
00:35:07,00:35:09,- Another thing they have in this tunnel
00:35:09,00:35:12,is a rumble strip in the middle of the road.
00:35:12,00:35:13,- Okay.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"- And the idea is if you're driving along,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,you slightly fear off to the middle.
00:35:17,00:35:19,"You hear it rumble, it wakes you up."
00:35:19,00:35:22,These things were invented in 1955
00:35:22,00:35:25,by a guy called Harold Griffin.
00:35:25,00:35:29,And they were originally called Singing Shoulders.
00:35:29,00:35:30,(all laughing)
00:35:30,00:35:31,- That's better.
00:35:31,00:35:33,- But they caused a 44% reduction
00:35:33,00:35:36,on head-on fatal crashes if you have them on a road.
00:35:36,00:35:38,These are US figures.
00:35:38,00:35:39,- Wow.
00:35:39,00:35:41,- They should be the same in most countries.
00:35:41,00:35:42,- So head-on collisions are hugely caused
00:35:42,00:35:44,by falling asleep or losing concentration.
00:35:44,00:35:45,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:35:45,00:35:46,- Right.
00:35:46,00:35:48,- And there are large areas of Michigan
00:35:48,00:35:50,with no rumble strips.
00:35:50,00:35:52,"So most places in America,"
00:35:52,00:35:53,"they have to have them now on highways,"
00:35:53,00:35:55,but there are large areas of Michigan
00:35:55,00:35:56,with no rumble strips.
00:35:56,00:35:58,"Po-kwa, why?"
00:35:58,00:36:00,- Ooh.
00:36:00,00:36:01,- There's no double lane roads.
00:36:01,00:36:02,"- That's good, in Michigan."
00:36:02,00:36:04,- No.
00:36:04,00:36:07,- They have to transport something
00:36:07,00:36:10,"which is delicate, like eggs, to the market."
00:36:10,00:36:11,"And if they hit the rumble strips,"
00:36:11,00:36:12,they break all the eggs.
00:36:12,00:36:13,- All of that eggs for you.
00:36:13,00:36:14,- Exactly.
00:36:14,00:36:16,- And they're happy to have a full head-on collision
00:36:16,00:36:18,as long as they don't break a few eggs.
00:36:18,00:36:21,"- That actually weirdly, more eggs get lost"
00:36:21,00:36:23,by the rumble strips than in the full-on collision.
00:36:23,00:36:23,- Yeah.
00:36:23,00:36:25,"- No, it's a certain group of people"
00:36:25,00:36:27,who didn't want them to.
00:36:27,00:36:28,- The Amish.
00:36:28,00:36:29,- The Amish.
00:36:29,00:36:30,- Who are the Amish?
00:36:30,00:36:32,(laughing)
00:36:32,00:36:33,- The Amish.
00:36:33,00:36:34,- The Amish.
00:36:34,00:36:35,- Or Amish.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"- I've never, in my knowledge, called the Amish."
00:36:37,00:36:39,- Really?
00:36:39,00:36:40,Do they not like rumble strips?
00:36:40,00:36:41,- It's the horses.
00:36:41,00:36:42,The horses don't like them
00:36:42,00:36:45,and they refuse to cross rumble strips
00:36:45,00:36:47,'cause it makes them hard to set their feet down
00:36:47,00:36:49,'cause of the way that they're...
00:36:49,00:36:50,- Really?
00:36:50,00:36:51,- You can't step over them.
00:36:51,00:36:51,- Not that broad.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"- Yeah, but the horses just don't like it."
00:36:53,00:36:54,"So, there are certain areas."
00:36:54,00:36:56,- They didn't even leave 'cause they didn't have a...
00:36:56,00:36:57,(laughing)
00:36:57,00:36:59,I was trying to do a rumble horse neck.
00:36:59,00:37:00,- That was really good.
00:37:00,00:37:01,"- Didn't come out right, sorry."
00:37:01,00:37:02,"- It weren't to be, you saw it, though."
00:37:02,00:37:04,What you're doing with your lips there.
00:37:04,00:37:05,"- So, in any location in Michigan"
00:37:05,00:37:08,"where horse-drawn buggies utilise the roadway,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,"you're not supposed to use shoulder corrugations,"
00:37:10,00:37:11,"which is what they call them,"
00:37:11,00:37:14,unless a crash history exists.
00:37:14,00:37:14,- Right.
00:37:14,00:37:15,London has a new tunnel.
00:37:15,00:37:17,In the week we record this.
00:37:17,00:37:18,- No.
00:37:18,00:37:18,- Yeah.
00:37:18,00:37:20,Have you guys been reading about the Silver Town Tunnel?
00:37:20,00:37:21,- No.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"- Oh, it's so good."
00:37:22,00:37:22,It's great.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"It's just next to the Blackwall Tunnel,"
00:37:24,00:37:26,"which is very, very traffic-y tunnel in London, basically."
00:37:26,00:37:29,"It has to shut down, I think, 700 times a year."
00:37:29,00:37:31,It gets shut down 'cause the traffic just gets too crazy.
00:37:31,00:37:33,"So, they've just opened another tunnel next to it,"
00:37:33,00:37:36,but bikes can't go along it because it's for cars.
00:37:36,00:37:39,"So, they're running a sort of bike bus for it."
00:37:39,00:37:42,"But, it's amazing how they built it."
00:37:42,00:37:45,"So, you know, TBMs, tunnel boring machines?"
00:37:45,00:37:46,- Okay.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"- The one that built this tunnel was called Jill,"
00:37:48,00:37:49,"after Jill Weiner,"
00:37:49,00:37:51,who was London's first female bus driver.
00:37:51,00:37:51,- Okay.
00:37:51,00:37:54,"- And they wanted two tunnels, right?"
00:37:54,00:37:55,'Cause it's really big.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"Stop me awning, James."
00:37:56,00:37:58,(laughing)
00:37:58,00:38:01,"They wanted two big tunnels, right?"
00:38:01,00:38:04,"Normally, it's really hard to build two tunnels"
00:38:04,00:38:05,"with the same machine,"
00:38:05,00:38:06,'cause turning it round down there is a bastard.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"You know, it's really difficult."
00:38:08,00:38:09,"- So, reverse, just get some wing mirrors on there."
00:38:09,00:38:12,- Or don't they famously come out the other side?
00:38:12,00:38:15,"- Didn't they, sorry to interrupt,"
00:38:15,00:38:16,"but for the channel tunnel,"
00:38:16,00:38:21,"I think the boring machines, they just kept boring down."
00:38:21,00:38:21,- They sometimes do.
00:38:21,00:38:22,- And they buried them under the ground.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"- Sometimes they do, yeah."
00:38:24,00:38:27,"So, this one, they wanted to use it again."
00:38:27,00:38:29,"They wanted to get good use out of this machine,"
00:38:29,00:38:30,'cause it's a massive factory.
00:38:30,00:38:33,"Like, it's huge underground thing."
00:38:33,00:38:36,"So, they put it, I just love this, on nitrogen skates."
00:38:36,00:38:39,They put it on compressed nitrogen.
00:38:39,00:38:41,"Like, some skates would rest on compressed nitrogen,"
00:38:41,00:38:43,like a hovercraft.
00:38:43,00:38:45,And that allowed them to turn it round
00:38:45,00:38:47,in a special underground chamber.
00:38:47,00:38:48,And then go back the other way.
00:38:48,00:38:51,- They must have had to build a massive underground chamber.
00:38:51,00:38:54,"I mean, 'cause these things are up to 170 meters long."
00:38:54,00:38:56,"- So, I don't know what that chamber was like,"
00:38:56,00:38:57,but it's crazy.
00:38:57,00:38:58,"- Yeah, they are awesome."
00:38:58,00:39:00,And I think they do like to reuse them now.
00:39:00,00:39:02,They break up them up into little parts.
00:39:02,00:39:04,'Cause every one is like the width of the tunnel
00:39:04,00:39:05,that's specifically made for that one tunnel.
00:39:05,00:39:07,"So, you can't really reuse the whole thing,"
00:39:07,00:39:08,but you can take it apart and use it.
00:39:08,00:39:11,"But yeah, in the olden days, they did random shit with it."
00:39:11,00:39:12,"Like, as you say, in the channel tunnel,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,one of them was just like buried.
00:39:14,00:39:17,Another one in 2004 was--
00:39:17,00:39:18,- So great.
00:39:18,00:39:18,I can't wait for archaeologists to find that.
00:39:18,00:39:20,That's going to be a great day for them.
00:39:20,00:39:22,"- So, they literally just changed its directions"
00:39:22,00:39:24,and it bore its way down to the bottom of the--
00:39:24,00:39:26,- I think it's going to come out in Australia sometime soon.
00:39:26,00:39:27,(all laughing)
00:39:27,00:39:29,- It's going to split the world in half.
00:39:29,00:39:31,- I think it actually went into more of a lay-by.
00:39:31,00:39:34,"- Oh, it is buried on the--"
00:39:34,00:39:35,"- Yeah, and then they bricked it."
00:39:35,00:39:36,They bricked it up.
00:39:36,00:39:37,But it reminds me of that really sad Thomas Atank engine episode
00:39:37,00:39:40,where they bricked one of the engines in.
00:39:40,00:39:40,- Henry.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"- Henry, he's very sad."
00:39:41,00:39:42,- Why'd they do that?
00:39:42,00:39:43,- He's been naughty.
00:39:43,00:39:44,"- Oh, wow."
00:39:44,00:39:46,- He won't come out in the rain.
00:39:46,00:39:48,"Anyway, we'll save that."
00:39:48,00:39:50,But there was another one in 2004.
00:39:50,00:39:53,One of the TBMs using the channel tunnel was sold on eBay.
00:39:53,00:39:55,"There were obviously loads of prank bids,"
00:39:55,00:39:59,"but then it was actually sold for 39,999 pounds."
00:39:59,00:40:02,- What was posted in package then?
00:40:02,00:40:03,"- That's such a good question, Dan."
00:40:03,00:40:04,You've hit the nail on the head.
00:40:04,00:40:05,"I never thought I'd say this,"
00:40:05,00:40:08,"but if only the buyer had been as smart as you are,"
00:40:08,00:40:11,'cause he bought it and he signed the contract
00:40:11,00:40:13,and everything and then he got an email from him
00:40:13,00:40:15,who was called Steddenum.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"- Oh, no."
00:40:16,00:40:19,- Guess how much it was gonna cost him to collect it?
00:40:19,00:40:20,"- I mean, an insane amount of money."
00:40:20,00:40:21,So he paid how much for the thing?
00:40:21,00:40:23,- He paid 40 grand.
00:40:23,00:40:25,- Which is a bargain.
00:40:25,00:40:26,Is it for a big tunnel machine?
00:40:26,00:40:29,"Yeah, second hand."
00:40:29,00:40:30,Like that's a--
00:40:30,00:40:31,- Vintage.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- That's a really nice car, second hand, you know what I mean?"
00:40:33,00:40:34,- Yeah.
00:40:34,00:40:36,- Or you get a machine that could dig a channel.
00:40:36,00:40:39,"- I don't think they're that road worthy, but yeah."
00:40:39,00:40:40,"- Okay, what was--"
00:40:40,00:40:42,- Cost a quarter of a million pounds to move it.
00:40:42,00:40:43,- Wow.
00:40:43,00:40:46,(laughing)
00:40:46,00:40:47,- And can you back out on that sale?
00:40:47,00:40:49,Sometimes they're really strict on eBay about--
00:40:49,00:40:51,- You can't back out on the tunnel even.
00:40:51,00:40:51,You can't do anything.
00:40:51,00:40:54,(upbeat music)
00:40:54,00:41:00,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:41:00,00:41:02,and that is Anna.
00:41:02,00:41:04,- My fact this week is that walking backwards
00:41:04,00:41:07,is healthier than walking forwards.
00:41:07,00:41:08,- Wow.
00:41:08,00:41:10,"- With some caveats, like, you know,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,don't do it at Russia on a main road.
00:41:12,00:41:13,It's for a railway tunnel.
00:41:13,00:41:14,(laughing)
00:41:14,00:41:15,- Railway tunnel.
00:41:15,00:41:18,This is just sort of a raft of stuff that's come out
00:41:18,00:41:20,"in the last 20 years, I guess,"
00:41:20,00:41:22,about the various advantages.
00:41:22,00:41:25,"Most crucially, burns more calories."
00:41:25,00:41:28,So like the metabolic cost of walking backwards
00:41:28,00:41:31,seems to be significantly higher.
00:41:31,00:41:33,I think the first study was in 1995 that found this
00:41:33,00:41:35,and it found that oxygen intake and heart rate
00:41:35,00:41:37,"of the various, I think it was 27 subjects,"
00:41:37,00:41:42,increased between 38 and 119% walking backwards
00:41:42,00:41:43,compared to walking forwards.
00:41:43,00:41:46,"- Okay, I have to say, I'm not massively surprised by that"
00:41:46,00:41:48,given that for two million years
00:41:48,00:41:49,we've been evolving to walk forwards.
00:41:49,00:41:51,"Like, doing something hard is harder"
00:41:51,00:41:52,than doing something easy.
00:41:52,00:41:53,- I agree.
00:41:53,00:41:53,- It's like doing press-ups constantly
00:41:53,00:41:55,is harder than just lying there.
00:41:55,00:41:57,But that's because I'm involved with just lying there.
00:41:57,00:42:00,- You might as well say that walking like a kangaroo
00:42:00,00:42:02,is healthier than walking like a human.
00:42:02,00:42:03,(laughing)
00:42:03,00:42:04,"- Basically, doing anything really difficult"
00:42:04,00:42:06,that feels unnatural is better for you.
00:42:06,00:42:07,- Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:08,- Okay.
00:42:08,00:42:11,- I think so a lot of this stuff makes kind of perfect sense
00:42:11,00:42:14,"because it's doing stuff that you're not used to doing, right?"
00:42:14,00:42:17,So this is why it's often used in rehabilitation
00:42:17,00:42:19,for things like osteoarthritis
00:42:19,00:42:21,because let's say you've got knee problems
00:42:21,00:42:23,"'cause you put too much pressure on your knees,"
00:42:23,00:42:25,"you go for runs, you're walking on tarmac a lot,"
00:42:25,00:42:26,"you start walking backwards,"
00:42:26,00:42:28,suddenly you're putting pressure on different parts
00:42:28,00:42:31,that your quads are taking a lot more pressure
00:42:31,00:42:33,"or if you've got plantar fasciitis in your heels,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,"oh my God, it's a pain, isn't it?"
00:42:35,00:42:36,I feel for you.
00:42:36,00:42:38,"But if you start walking backwards,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,then you don't have such an impact on your heels.
00:42:40,00:42:43,- Did anyone do some walking backwards for this?
00:42:43,00:42:44,I did 15 minutes in my garden.
00:42:44,00:42:45,- Did you?
00:42:45,00:42:46,"- 15 minutes, that's a lot."
00:42:46,00:42:50,"- Yeah, well, I couldn't be bothered doing any research."
00:42:50,00:42:53,- I meant to say you look fantastic today.
00:42:53,00:42:55,"- Thank you, well, you should see my heels."
00:42:55,00:42:56,(laughing)
00:42:56,00:42:57,- So how was it?
00:42:57,00:43:00,"- Well, to be honest, I didn't really see much difference"
00:43:00,00:43:01,in the 15 minutes I did.
00:43:01,00:43:04,"Apart from, I would say it works slightly different muscles"
00:43:04,00:43:08,"in my legs, like my Achilles probably,"
00:43:08,00:43:11,and my calf that normally wouldn't feel it
00:43:11,00:43:12,after 15 minutes walk.
00:43:12,00:43:13,I could feel it after.
00:43:13,00:43:15,"- Also, your neighbors all think you're a witch now?"
00:43:15,00:43:16,- Yeah.
00:43:16,00:43:16,- I'm no doubt.
00:43:16,00:43:18,(laughing)
00:43:18,00:43:20,"- I did, because quite a lot of my neighbors' houses"
00:43:20,00:43:22,overlook my garden.
00:43:22,00:43:25,"And I didn't think, they probably think I'm a bit weird."
00:43:25,00:43:27,"Yeah, they already know."
00:43:27,00:43:29,"- Yeah, I'm sure you've done worse things in that garden."
00:43:29,00:43:30,(laughing)
00:43:30,00:43:32,- Where did those bags of money come from?
00:43:32,00:43:34,(laughing)
00:43:34,00:43:36,But it's quite good.
00:43:36,00:43:40,"I read a few articles where it said that backwards running,"
00:43:40,00:43:42,this post-book to backwards walking is quite good
00:43:42,00:43:44,"in warming up if you're an athlete,"
00:43:44,00:43:49,because it uses slightly different joints and tendons
00:43:49,00:43:50,as you would normally do.
00:43:50,00:43:54,"Also, there was another person, an orthopedic specialist"
00:43:54,00:43:57,"called Nicole Hass, who in one of the papers she said,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,"that actually one of the main things is,"
00:43:59,00:44:01,it's using your brain in a slightly different way.
00:44:01,00:44:02,- Yeah.
00:44:02,00:44:04,- 'Cause like one of the things you're doing quite a lot
00:44:04,00:44:06,"when you're walking backwards, as I know,"
00:44:06,00:44:08,is working out where everything is
00:44:08,00:44:09,and what you're not falling over.
00:44:09,00:44:11,'Cause my garden is not very big
00:44:11,00:44:14,and I had to do lots of laps of it to 15 minutes.
00:44:14,00:44:15,"And all the time you're thinking,"
00:44:15,00:44:17,where did I leave that barbecue?
00:44:17,00:44:19,"- Yes, yes."
00:44:19,00:44:20,"Well, next time you do it,"
00:44:20,00:44:23,you should do what a man called Patrick Harmon did
00:44:23,00:44:25,when he took on a challenge to walk from San Francisco
00:44:25,00:44:27,"to New York, which is he walked backwards,"
00:44:27,00:44:30,but he had installed near the front of his chest
00:44:30,00:44:32,a car mirror so that he could see everything
00:44:32,00:44:34,that was behind him.
00:44:34,00:44:36,"- I mean, it makes perfect sense, doesn't it?"
00:44:36,00:44:37,- He said it was good for him.
00:44:37,00:44:39,So he did this in 1915?
00:44:39,00:44:40,- Yep.
00:44:40,00:44:41,- It took him about a year.
00:44:41,00:44:43,"- Yeah, 290 days in total."
00:44:43,00:44:44,- About a year.
00:44:44,00:44:47,(laughing)
00:44:47,00:44:50,- A big chunk missing for the whole year.
00:44:50,00:44:51,- The bulk of a year.
00:44:51,00:44:53,(laughing)
00:44:53,00:44:56,- I'm really looking forward to going to your 60th birthday.
00:44:56,00:44:58,"- Yeah, it's gonna be about 52."
00:44:58,00:45:00,(laughing)
00:45:00,00:45:03,"- And he claimed that it had made his ankle so strong,"
00:45:03,00:45:05,it would take a sledgehammer blow to sprain them.
00:45:05,00:45:07,So he clearly felt some kind of benefits.
00:45:07,00:45:09,- Yeah.
00:45:09,00:45:11,"- It's interesting that he,"
00:45:11,00:45:12,"'cause he did that 1915, did you say?"
00:45:12,00:45:13,- Yeah.
00:45:13,00:45:15,"- 'Cause there was a guy called Pleny Wingo,"
00:45:15,00:45:18,who he's the one in the Guinness World Record Book
00:45:18,00:45:20,"because he walked 8,000 miles"
00:45:20,00:45:23,"from Santa Monica to Istanbul, so a bit further."
00:45:23,00:45:25,But I think he believed he was the first person
00:45:25,00:45:26,to come up with it.
00:45:26,00:45:30,"- Twice as long, just when you say a bit further,"
00:45:30,00:45:31,and almost a year.
00:45:31,00:45:31,- A bit further.
00:45:31,00:45:32,(laughing)
00:45:32,00:45:34,"- Well, fact checker's striper today."
00:45:34,00:45:35,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, more than actually, yeah."
00:45:35,00:45:37,"- You don't want us doing down the backwards walkers,"
00:45:37,00:45:38,do you?
00:45:38,00:45:39,They need to get there just as a--
00:45:39,00:45:40,"- Some respect, please."
00:45:40,00:45:41,"Pleny Wingo, yeah."
00:45:41,00:45:44,- He lost his business and--
00:45:44,00:45:45,- In the Great Depression.
00:45:45,00:45:45,- In the Great Depression.
00:45:45,00:45:47,So I'm so excited about it.
00:45:47,00:45:47,- We're gonna be seeing lots more
00:45:47,00:45:49,of this kind of great stuff soon.
00:45:49,00:45:51,(laughing)
00:45:51,00:45:54,"So you're right, we're topical."
00:45:54,00:45:55,- Limber up.
00:45:55,00:46:00,"He had the idea, 'cause he was listening to his daughter,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,"his 15 year old daughter,"
00:46:02,00:46:04,"her birthday party chatting to her friends saying,"
00:46:04,00:46:06,"everything that could ever be done has been done now,"
00:46:06,00:46:07,'cause it was this age of stunts.
00:46:07,00:46:09,"We've talked about flagpole sitting before,"
00:46:09,00:46:11,"everyone was sitting on flagpoles,"
00:46:11,00:46:12,"and we're crawling up mountains,"
00:46:12,00:46:14,pushing peanuts up mountains with their noses.
00:46:14,00:46:16,"And he said, ""Not everything's been done."
00:46:16,00:46:18,"""No one's ever walked backwards around the world."""
00:46:18,00:46:20,"And then he thought, ""Bugger, now I've said that,"
00:46:20,00:46:21,"""I'll have to do it."""
00:46:21,00:46:23,"And he tried to do it, and he got as far as Turkey,"
00:46:23,00:46:26,and then they kicked him out and told him to go home.
00:46:26,00:46:28,I don't think he did make his fortune.
00:46:28,00:46:29,It's very hard to tell.
00:46:29,00:46:30,"- No, he didn't."
00:46:30,00:46:31,- It's pretty sure he didn't.
00:46:31,00:46:32,- He didn't.
00:46:32,00:46:33,"- They said when he got to Turkey,"
00:46:33,00:46:35,they said he had to leave the country for his own safety.
00:46:35,00:46:36,(laughing)
00:46:36,00:46:38,'Cause I think the idea was that people
00:46:38,00:46:40,were throwing things at him quite a lot.
00:46:40,00:46:42,- I'm surprised you got as far as that.
00:46:42,00:46:45,"- Apparently, according to one article I read about him,"
00:46:45,00:46:47,"he was in New York City walking backwards,"
00:46:47,00:46:50,and he agreed to walk backwards along the top ledge
00:46:50,00:46:53,of a 12 story building in return for money.
00:46:53,00:46:57,"And then loads of people paid him to see him do this,"
00:46:57,00:46:58,and he did it.
00:46:58,00:47:00,But the guy who was working with him
00:47:00,00:47:02,"and collecting all the money off there,"
00:47:02,00:47:05,onlookers just did a runner and took all his money off him.
00:47:05,00:47:06,- For the backwards runner.
00:47:06,00:47:08,"- Well, if you're walking backwards,"
00:47:08,00:47:10,"it's hard to catch anyone, isn't it?"
00:47:10,00:47:10,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:47:10,00:47:11,- That's crazy.
00:47:11,00:47:13,"- His wife left him, Mrs. Wingo."
00:47:13,00:47:16,"- Oh no, I mean, I understand why she did it, but even so."
00:47:16,00:47:19,- But he was still walking backwards for decades.
00:47:19,00:47:23,"So in 1976, he appeared on the Johnny Carson show,"
00:47:23,00:47:25,"one of these American talk shows saying,"
00:47:25,00:47:26,"""I'm doing it again!"""
00:47:26,00:47:29,And he claimed he was gonna do another
00:47:29,00:47:30,sort of round the world thing.
00:47:30,00:47:32,That suggests that he didn't make his fortune
00:47:32,00:47:33,the first time.
00:47:33,00:47:34,- I don't think so.
00:47:34,00:47:36,"- I think it does, sadly."
00:47:36,00:47:38,There is a profession who walked backwards
00:47:38,00:47:39,maybe more than any other.
00:47:39,00:47:42,"And maybe, I'm not certain about this,"
00:47:42,00:47:44,"but it's a good, I think it's a good."
00:47:44,00:47:45,- Photographers?
00:47:45,00:47:46,- I don't know.
00:47:46,00:47:47,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:47:47,00:47:48,- That's good content.
00:47:48,00:47:50,- I was reading a paper about sports people
00:47:50,00:47:52,"and they said rugby league players,"
00:47:52,00:47:56,handball athletes and soccer referees do a lot of baseball.
00:47:56,00:47:58,- Football referees is the one I saw.
00:47:58,00:48:01,"- I think there's, is there not a famous one,"
00:48:01,00:48:02,"I think we might have even mentioned it before,"
00:48:02,00:48:04,"about at the White House,"
00:48:04,00:48:07,"it's people who are doing the tour guides,"
00:48:07,00:48:08,they walk backwards forever.
00:48:08,00:48:09,"- Pentagon, I think it was."
00:48:09,00:48:13,"Yeah, where they have to memorize where the corner is"
00:48:13,00:48:14,so that they can go around it.
00:48:14,00:48:15,Yeah. - Why?
00:48:15,00:48:16,- Is it so they keep an eye on people?
00:48:16,00:48:17,- Yeah.
00:48:17,00:48:18,- Oh.
00:48:18,00:48:19,- Just get the mirrors.
00:48:19,00:48:20,"- Get the mirrors, exactly."
00:48:20,00:48:22,- But I've trained as a football referee
00:48:22,00:48:24,"and for sure as part of the training,"
00:48:24,00:48:26,they teach you how to run backwards well.
00:48:26,00:48:27,- Don't they?
00:48:27,00:48:28,"- Yeah, or they don't teach you,"
00:48:28,00:48:31,but they just say make sure you know how to run backwards.
00:48:31,00:48:32,(laughing)
00:48:32,00:48:33,"- I used to do quite a lot, I'd say,"
00:48:33,00:48:35,when I was like when I was a nipper.
00:48:35,00:48:36,- Yeah.
00:48:36,00:48:37,- I was running backwards or a referee.
00:48:37,00:48:39,- Running for the referee.
00:48:39,00:48:40,"- Did a lot of, oh."
00:48:40,00:48:42,- Was that avoiding the wedgie as they chased you?
00:48:42,00:48:44,(laughing)
00:48:44,00:48:47,"- Okay, okay, okay, you can't be wedgie."
00:48:47,00:48:49,(laughing)
00:48:49,00:48:51,- They could do a front wedgie.
00:48:51,00:48:53,- The front wedgie is horrible.
00:48:53,00:48:54,- It makes it look like a Disney tower.
00:48:54,00:48:57,(laughing)
00:48:58,00:49:00,- There's another group of people
00:49:00,00:49:04,"who are becoming expert backward walkers in recent times,"
00:49:04,00:49:06,and that is celebrities.
00:49:06,00:49:11,So Taylor Swift spends a lot of her time walking backwards
00:49:11,00:49:14,so that she can avoid the paparazzi taking photos of her.
00:49:14,00:49:16,- Is it so that they can't sell the photos
00:49:16,00:49:17,because they're trying to sell those photos
00:49:17,00:49:18,of her walking forward?
00:49:18,00:49:21,"- Now, as in the paparazzi stood in one particular place"
00:49:21,00:49:24,and you need to have your back to the paparazzo
00:49:24,00:49:25,so that they can't see your face.
00:49:25,00:49:28,I saw quite a recent news article
00:49:28,00:49:29,"about her walking through the woods, right?"
00:49:29,00:49:31,"- Yeah, she went and did a whole mountain trail,"
00:49:31,00:49:33,basically walking backwards
00:49:33,00:49:35,so that the paparazzi couldn't get shots of her.
00:49:35,00:49:36,"- Back up ahead, she should do."
00:49:36,00:49:38,Back up ahead and hold for the eye.
00:49:38,00:49:39,- That's a good idea.
00:49:39,00:49:41,(laughing)
00:49:41,00:49:43,"- But if someone's walking backwards,"
00:49:43,00:49:44,so she's walking backwards
00:49:44,00:49:46,towards the paparazzi who were facing her.
00:49:46,00:49:47,"- Let's say she's come out of the building,"
00:49:47,00:49:48,there's paparazzi waiting outside.
00:49:48,00:49:50,She faces the other way to get in the car.
00:49:50,00:49:53,"- But I would film that, and that's like..."
00:49:53,00:49:54,- But it could be anyone.
00:49:54,00:49:55,It could be anyone with blonde hair.
00:49:55,00:49:56,"- Oh, please."
00:49:56,00:49:58,I didn't know Taylor Swift asked anyone.
00:49:58,00:50:00,(laughing)
00:50:00,00:50:01,"I wouldn't even recognize her face,"
00:50:01,00:50:05,but there's an amazing woman called Justine Galloway.
00:50:05,00:50:07,I think we might have mentioned in our sports book
00:50:07,00:50:09,that we happened to write semi-recently.
00:50:09,00:50:11,She's a runner.
00:50:11,00:50:13,"She's 44, and she used to run loads of marathons."
00:50:13,00:50:16,"And then in 2011,"
00:50:16,00:50:19,"she was running her third Boston marathon,"
00:50:19,00:50:20,and she got really good times.
00:50:20,00:50:22,And she suddenly her left leg
00:50:22,00:50:24,"started staying up in the air too long,"
00:50:24,00:50:26,"sort of swung out to the left a bit,"
00:50:26,00:50:27,and it just wasn't working properly.
00:50:27,00:50:31,"And she basically got what is called runner's dystonia,"
00:50:31,00:50:34,"which is a bit like the yips in golf,"
00:50:34,00:50:37,where you just suddenly kind of can't do it.
00:50:37,00:50:40,"And within a few weeks, she couldn't run at all."
00:50:40,00:50:42,It's like this weird neurological issue
00:50:42,00:50:45,where your brain and your body will not connect at all.
00:50:45,00:50:47,"And she was obviously devastating,"
00:50:47,00:50:49,like running with her life.
00:50:49,00:50:51,"And then she realized if she ran backwards, she was fine."
00:50:51,00:50:52,- Crazy.
00:50:52,00:50:54,- And now she's got the world record
00:50:54,00:50:56,for running a half marathon backwards.
00:50:56,00:50:57,- Does she do mirrors?
00:50:57,00:50:58,Or does she do?
00:50:58,00:50:59,"- She does mirrors, yes."
00:50:59,00:51:01,"- Does she, when you do a half marathon with her,"
00:51:01,00:51:04,does she start at the end and go to the start?
00:51:04,00:51:06,She passes everyone halfway.
00:51:06,00:51:09,"- Yeah, she always gets moaned down in the middle, so."
00:51:09,00:51:11,- So it is a competitive sport.
00:51:11,00:51:13,"- Yeah, I mean, there are all sorts of records."
00:51:13,00:51:16,"There aren't many full races of people running backwards,"
00:51:16,00:51:21,"but there's a guy called Aaron Yoda, who's the world's best."
00:51:21,00:51:22,"- God hold her, he is."
00:51:22,00:51:24,"- Runs backwards, speaks backwards."
00:51:24,00:51:27,(all laughing)
00:51:27,00:51:30,"He's done a mile and five minutes, 54 seconds backwards,"
00:51:30,00:51:32,which I'm quite sure is faster
00:51:32,00:51:34,"than I could do a mile for four, for me, yeah, yeah."
00:51:34,00:51:37,"- So walking backwards, right?"
00:51:37,00:51:39,Imagine you're walking backwards
00:51:39,00:51:41,and stuff is happening in your peripheral vision.
00:51:41,00:51:46,Some people are better at noticing those things than others.
00:51:46,00:51:47,- Only if you're walking backwards?
00:51:47,00:51:49,"- Only if you're walking backwards, yeah."
00:51:49,00:51:50,- Can we guess this?
00:51:50,00:51:52,"- Is it like football, right?"
00:51:52,00:51:52,- Scottish people.
00:51:52,00:51:53,- It's a class of people.
00:51:53,00:51:56,- I'd be a stud-ist if you went to that place.
00:51:56,00:51:58,- Is it a profession or a nationality?
00:51:58,00:52:01,- It's a hobby group.
00:52:01,00:52:05,"- Oh, is that like birdwatchers or train spotters?"
00:52:05,00:52:06,- Not them.
00:52:06,00:52:09,"- Think of a hobby that slightly more normal people might do,"
00:52:09,00:52:12,and the tunnel boring machine enthusiasts.
00:52:12,00:52:14,(all laughing)
00:52:14,00:52:16,"Oh, what's a normal hobby?"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"It's something that cool people might do,"
00:52:18,00:52:20,slightly more cool people than you.
00:52:20,00:52:22,It's people who play video games.
00:52:22,00:52:25,"- Oh yeah, those jocks, those bloody jocks."
00:52:25,00:52:27,- So there was a study that was done.
00:52:27,00:52:28,- Are they cool?
00:52:28,00:52:29,"Sorry, coming questions."
00:52:29,00:52:32,- I was just thinking cooler than boring enthusiasts.
00:52:32,00:52:33,"- Oh, yeah."
00:52:33,00:52:34,- On a par for me.
00:52:34,00:52:35,"- I actually was thinking,"
00:52:35,00:52:38,I'd love to write a film script set on a tunnel boring machine.
00:52:38,00:52:39,I just think that'd be really cool.
00:52:39,00:52:43,- Like a really slow version of speed.
00:52:43,00:52:44,(all laughing)
00:52:44,00:52:46,- We gotta keep going at 0.25 miles an hour.
00:52:46,00:52:50,- It's gonna blow.
00:52:50,00:52:52,"- So the thing is right,"
00:52:52,00:52:54,"they wanted to find out,"
00:52:54,00:52:57,"do people who play video games have better perception,"
00:52:57,00:52:58,"and especially people who play,"
00:52:58,00:53:01,"you know, like first person shooter games, okay?"
00:53:01,00:53:02,"So they tried that,"
00:53:02,00:53:04,"and they realized that actually,"
00:53:04,00:53:06,people have equal perception.
00:53:06,00:53:07,"If you, Andy, and someone who plays video games"
00:53:07,00:53:09,"are walking straight down a road,"
00:53:09,00:53:12,then you equally can see things in your peripheral vision.
00:53:12,00:53:14,"But for the people who play video games,"
00:53:14,00:53:16,"when you're going backwards,"
00:53:16,00:53:18,they have much better perception.
00:53:18,00:53:19,"And that's because in video games,"
00:53:19,00:53:22,"often these shooters, they are moving backwards."
00:53:22,00:53:24,"Like when you move backwards on your joystick,"
00:53:24,00:53:27,your character is so easy to do.
00:53:27,00:53:31,"So they're seeing that quite often in their day-to-day hobby,"
00:53:31,00:53:32,"whereas we hardly ever see it,"
00:53:32,00:53:34,'cause we hardly ever walk backwards.
00:53:34,00:53:35,"That's cool, that's cool."
00:53:35,00:53:36,- I thought you were gonna say it
00:53:36,00:53:37,so that you had a peripheral view
00:53:37,00:53:39,on seeing whether or not your mom came in
00:53:39,00:53:41,"to tell you to stop playing video games,"
00:53:41,00:53:43,so you just built a better...
00:53:43,00:53:45,So video games are probably quite good.
00:53:45,00:53:48,(all laughing)
00:53:48,00:53:52,- Nature's joystick.
00:53:52,00:53:55,(all laughing)
