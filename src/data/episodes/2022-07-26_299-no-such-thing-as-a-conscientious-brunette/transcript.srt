2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 >> And welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Washington, DC.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 [APPLAUSE]

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Starting with you, Andy.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 My fact is that one of the main reasons people failed to get into the US Army in the First World War was because the military required recruits to have a minimum of six teeth.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 [LAUGHTER]

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 >> And this was a problem.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 [LAUGHTER]

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 >> So this is from a book called Making the American Mouth by Alyssa Pickard, which is a great book and it's all about problems of dentistry.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And it turns out that the famously great American teeth were not always that great.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And in the First World War, you needed good teeth because you had to eat horrible, tough military rations.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And you had to have three pairs of decent opposing teeth.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 [LAUGHTER]

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And one in ten recruits failed because of that.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So this is the two million people who were rejected from the Army.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 That was the main reason.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And a few sources say 12, but they're quite a lot saying six as well.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 >> And one of the other reasons in war was certainly in the civil war where they had a similar problem is you would load one shot in each gun.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And to get your shot out, you had to rip it open with your teeth right.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 If you didn't have any teeth, you just like gummily, like sucking on it until a cartridge.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 >> So I read in the civil war.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So you know if you are disqualified from going to war, the category you're given is poor F.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 That's what they say.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You're a poor F and that means you're not able to go.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And this is for a modern day war as well.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And it's suggested, and I say it's suggested because it's probably definitely not true, that the poor F stands for four front teeth.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 >> Four things.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 >> All right.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 >> And what they're saying you didn't have those four?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 >> If you didn't have those four, you can't go to war because you can't buy open the clip for your gun.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 >> There was quite disparity in the civil war between the two sides though, teeth wise.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And in some other ways.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 [laughter]

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So actually historically, for the last 200 years, the northeast of the United States has had much worse teeth than the Southwest.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And the Confederate army had much better teeth and they just had better dental care.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And they're not really sure why this is actually because it's not about sort of socio-economic status.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 It doesn't really correlate with that.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Often wealthier people had worse teeth because they had sugar.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 They think it might be something in the soil quality. But anyway, it was like the month was the worst, I think. The month was the one where literally more than 10% of people in World War II, I think, even got rejected.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And I think in World War II, when teeth were still as bad, no progress made between the World Wars, they had this requirement again, which was like you've got to have the three pairs of opposing teeth.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And they actually had to change the rules because they realized they weren't going to get enough people going into the army.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 So they changed the rules to say, actually, you just need to have enough teeth in your lower arch, like on your lower jaw, to hold a denture.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 So basically, as long as you've got kind of one tooth there to hook a dent, a set of dentures on, then you're okay.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 It's actually still true that if you don't have enough teeth, you can't join the US Army.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I read all the rules today of what you can and can't do.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Did they accept you?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So they had, it says, "Inefficient, natural, healthy teeth is a reason for not being allowed in the army."

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Some of the things polydactually, so having too many fingers, that's insane.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I know, that reads you out.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 You can fire more guns faster.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 You think so, right?

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Yeah. How?

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So when did you throw your diagram down? You've got a gun on each finger. You're a super soldier.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 My bad. Thank you.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 If you have ingrowing toenails, you can't join the army.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Really?

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 That's what remedied quite easily.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Yeah, so if they're particularly bad ones, if you're taller than six foot seven, you can't join.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And if you have an unexplained absence of a testicle.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 What is a mystery missing testicle?

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 That's the mystery of it.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 It's not because they think you might be Hitler trying to try and take it down from the inside.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 At least, teeth were actually another way of getting out of war as well.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So at least one soldier in the, this is the first one war.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 If you've got wounded, if you threw away your false teeth and you no longer were able to eat the rations,

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 you might be invalidated out of the entire army.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 This is a good way of escaping military service.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 That's amazing.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 That's an extremely easy way.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 People were sort of shooting themselves in the knee caps and stuff to get out of military service.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Just chuck away adenters.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Yeah.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 They really needed to invent the blender in war, didn't they?

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Because this was the issue.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It was that they couldn't chew.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 If everything was a smoothie, they wouldn't have had to remove any of these people.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 That's true.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 That's true.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Having bad teeth is still a massive, massive problem for the army.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And so for over seven years, they've been working and they've put $12 million worth of research behind them.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 That's worth the research behind this into some combat chewing gum.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 That's what they're currently trying to invent.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 What does it do?

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Yeah.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Well, the idea is that it stimulates the flow of saliva in your mouth along you chew it, so it neutralizes acid.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 That's true of all chewing gum, surely.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I guess this is just like super soldier chewing gum.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Well, so then you start chewing it and you just get loads of water and saliva in your mouth.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Yeah, you're just dribbling away.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 No, it's, I mean, it's designed just to keep your teeth more healthy.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Because the big problem that they have is that 10% I believe it is of all the emergencies that they have

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 that are not frontline are teeth-based.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 10%.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So there's 47 different types of dental emergencies that they deal with that are graded in like a booklet that you can get.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yeah.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And they go from mildly uncomfortable, which is like gingivitis, all the way to totally avulsed tooth.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Avulsed?

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Well, you're the one with it in front of you, I don't know why you're looking at me.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It looks like you just fell on your keyboard.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So, yeah, so gingivitis or absolute toothache.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Oh, this is gosh.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And that's real, when you've got afford lucidude, it's really bad.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Yeah.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Sometimes it's so bad you can't even say it.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Yeah, that's what's happened.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So by the end of the 1990s, 6% of British people had non-of-the-natural teeth remaining.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 So I guess it's an old person you've got full dentures, 100%.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 In 1978, that was 37%.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Wow.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 37% of adults, zero teeth.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Wow.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Yeah.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Isn't it true that they used to deliberately knock them out?

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Yeah, they do.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Like on your 21st birthday as a present, they would not call your teeth out.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Yeah.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 So they have known only people who were off of that.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Yeah.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Yeah.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It wasn't like a punch in the face.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 No, I don't.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The idea was, wasn't it, that if you would lose them all, say when you were 21,

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 and replace them with dentures, and then you wouldn't have tooth problems as you go older?

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Yeah.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Right, yeah.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Do you know the most teeth anyone has ever had?

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Oh.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Oh.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Yeah.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 How many do we normally have 32?

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Yeah, give or take, yeah.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 It's about one time in the mouth.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 It's about one time in the mouth.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Oh.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Wasn't there a gummy this year who had sort of like hundreds or thousands or some lines?

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Seven thousand.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Okay.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Well, there we go.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Yes, again, Dan has absolutely guessed it out of the park.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It was 547.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Wow.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Now, these were very small teeth, obviously.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It was a boy in India.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 He had a slight pain in his jaw.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It was a little lump.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It was a thing called an odontoma, or an odontoma, and doctors removed it.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It grew to the size of a golf ball before they did.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And it was a little second inside.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 There were 526 tiny teeth.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Yeah.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It's just when stem cells go a bit haywire and start thinking, teeth?

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Yeah.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 But he woke up the next morning, absolutely loaded, right?

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Lift up your pillow.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 God.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I have a weird teeth in war story that I love, which is from the Second World War.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So this was after Japan had surrendered in World War II.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Then a lot of Japanese people were put on trial by the Allies, and that included the Japanese Prime Minister,

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 the decade Tojo, and he wanted to, so he was going to be executed in Japan, but he wanted to speak at his trial.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And he couldn't speak, because his teeth were in such terrible condition.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And so he was being looked after by US naval officers.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And he said, OK, well, I need some dentures, so I can at least speak at my trial.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And there was a dentist called Jack Mallory, who was in charge of doing this, and he made the prosthetics.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And I mean, how, yeah, how kind of dickhead is this?

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I know everyone I'd be for each other in World War II.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 But he engraved in his dentures, in Morse code, on the back of his dentures, the words "remember Pearl Harbor."

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Whoa!

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Yeah.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 That is a real move and a half.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And he gave these dentures to the Japanese Prime Minister, and he thought that's so great.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 He's going to have the words "remember Pearl Harbor" in his mouth for eternity.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And then he'd check him out.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 So this guy was in prison with his new dentures, and then this guy was like, "Shit, I'm going to get in trouble for this if anyone sees."

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Oh my God.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 So he told his superiors, and they had to do this whole operation, where they sort of broke back into the prison.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 In the dead of night, him and his dental associate installed the dentures back.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But they hadn't been installed in the mouth.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 He did have them in his cell with him.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 So maybe they were sort of on his bedside table or something.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 It's weird that he thought anyone would ever find out.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Sometimes you run your tongue around the end of the mouth.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Yeah, but you can't read Morse code.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Was he a Prime Minister?

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 No, he's a Prime Minister, so you know, yeah.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I'll try Ministers can do that.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I was sort of running you.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Running your chase going, gone.

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Hey, we need to move on in a second.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I've got a couple of facts about military recruitment, this kind of thing.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Oh yeah.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So to join the US Army in the First World War, there was an insane questionnaire that you had to answer if you wanted to sign up.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It was all yes-no questions, okay?

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And it was a list of a couple of hundred of the questions.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And just to test your aptitude to make sure you had sort of standard intelligence.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 So things, the question started quite simple.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Can a dog run?

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Okay, yes.

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You're right.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Oh James, okay, great.

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Is water dry?

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 No, no.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Great, okay, can you read?

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yes.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Okay, great.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So you're doing great so far.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 No, I'm doing really badly.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I was out two questions together.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 It gets a bit weirder then.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Our newspapers made of iron.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Well, I didn't think so until you said that.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Well, do handkerchiefs frequently injure human beings?

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Do conscientious brunettes exist?

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 It's really, these are real.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 That's easy.

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And then they get, then, and then, so those are the slow, sorry ones.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Then it goes completely bananas, right?

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So do vagrants commonly possess immaculate crovats?

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Do tendrils terminate in cerebral hemorrhage?

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Is a guitar a disease?

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Sorry, go back to the tendril one.

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 What's the answer to that one?

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Do tendrils terminate in cerebral hemorrhage?

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Yeah, I don't know with the answer.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 No.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 No, no with the answer.

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 What it seems to me is like a load of words that don't really make a sentence.

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Yeah.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Exactly.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 There's no yes or no answer.

234
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 You just have to go, "Huh?

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Next to it."

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 What exactly was this testing?

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Intelligence.

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It feels like it's testing the level of hallucination you're having.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Chisinski.

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 My fact this week is that the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library has been protected from wildfires by a herd of goats

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 that includes Vincent van Goet.

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Salina goatmez and goatzart.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 So, high brow and low brow references in that herd of goats.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And this is an amazing story this year that actually the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 which is just outside LA, hired 500 goats, and it's to clear up the sort of flammable scrub material

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 because that's a really useful way of creating a barrier against wildfires.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 You know, they eat all the stuff that the fire would eat, and then the fire can't move.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I've passed on a fire.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Just testing your IQ, James.

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And so, yeah, this is really cool.

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And then there were wildfires a few months later, and the brush created a fire break,

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 which massively slowed down the fire, and it meant that the fire fighters could defeat it,

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 and save Ronald Reagan's library, which contains various cool stuff, like Air Force One,

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 and a bit of the Berlin Wall and himself.

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Really? I think he's there. He's buried there.

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 He's buried there.

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 The less sensationalist way of putting it.

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Yes, sorry.

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He's not in the Dewey Decimal System.

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Those are incredible this kind of thing.

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I didn't realize how much they were being used.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Well, this company is a really cool one as well.

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 So, it started only last year, I think.

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 They've got really lucky. It's called 805 goats.

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I don't know why, because they don't have eight hundred and five goats.

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And it was started by this couple called Scott on Emily Morris.

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And he just had no experience in this, but he went to a talk where a firefighter was saying,

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 "What a shame, we don't have more goats to prevent fires."

269
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So, he decided, "I'll just buy some goats and hire them out."

270
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And he did it in a really weird order, though, so he left this talk,

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 and he started by booking in a bunch of weed clearing jobs.

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So, he ran around, advertised himself, said, "I'll clear a weeds with some goats."

273
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 This was before he bought any goats.

274
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Then he got loads of stuff booked in, and then he was like, "Oh, God, I've started this now.

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I've got to buy some goats."

276
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And then he bought a few dozen goats.

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And then he realized, "I live in a tiny house. I don't have anyone to put these goats."

278
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And so, then they actually appealed to her former school,

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 and they started to stay on their school grounds now.

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 But, yeah, he's a very happy man.

281
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 That's cool.

282
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It's now legal for you to hire goats in Washington, D.C.

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 As of 2019, there's a new law.

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Wow.

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I read the law.

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It says that the mayor shall allow goats to be temporarily imported into the district

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 for the purposes of eating grass, milking demonstrations, participating in yoga,

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and similar activities.

289
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Nice.

290
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 That's great.

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 It's very cool.

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 It seems like it's been going on for a while in America,

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 because I was reading that in 2015, you could actually order goats off Amazon.

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 So, it was live.

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Yeah, live goats.

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It was the Amazon launched a home delivery service.

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 In 2015, there was a bit of stuff like that going on with Amazon.

298
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So, in Japan, you could order a Buddhist monk to your house via Amazon

299
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 to do prayers for funerals and so on if you wanted.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But, yeah, it's been going on here, and it's specifically for that.

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 It's just the goats come in, and it's for fire clearance.

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And so, it's happening a lot.

303
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 There's GoFundMe's, which are called goatFundMe.

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Yeah.

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Yeah.

306
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I wonder what's happening solely because of the propensity for puns.

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I wonder if that's why all these startups have happened.

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Because it's just a good word to pun this.

309
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 This company, sorry, Selena Gomez has hired their goats.

310
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Really?

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And there's no reference to whether or not that's connected to the fact that one of their goats is called Selena GoFundMe's.

312
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Was there any kind of hilarious misunderstanding?

313
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Was someone mistook Selena Gomez for Selena GoFundMe's?

314
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Well, and Selena Gomez is currently chewing broth somewhere in California.

315
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And there's a really, really worried goat in a green room about to go on stage.

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 She's not the only Selena GoFundMe's.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 There's another Selena GoFundMe's out in New Zealand.

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 In Canterbury, they have a sort of RSPCA where they look after goats and they send them back out.

319
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 So they've got Selena GoFundMe's there.

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 They've got Eva Longhornia.

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Brilliant.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Jessica Alba.

323
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And Nicole Kidman.

324
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Nothing.

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Yeah, it's a baby goat.

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Kid is a baby goat.

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Yeah?

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 That's what I knew.

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That's the thing I knew about that one.

330
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 So not everyone is happy about this goat situation of how many are being hired.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 So in 2017, a Michigan union issued an official complaint saying that goats were taking the jobs of good honest humans.

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Basically, like people who mow lawns for 11 years.

333
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Exactly, yeah.

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The goats were clearing weeds, they were clearing brush and this is taking jobs from human union workers.

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And the Western Michigan University got a complaint about this.

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And the Washington Post did a calculation about the potential impact of goat labour.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And they found out that even if all stuff was given over to goats, it would only cost about 347 jobs.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 What do you mean if all stuff is given to goats?

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Well, not all jobs.

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 You can't have the goats as president of the United States.

341
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Well, can't you?

342
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Yeah, no, sorry, all kind of as many gardening jobs as possible that don't require fiddly stuff.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 There is a goat in the British army, of course.

344
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 That is William Billy Windsor, the second.

345
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And he is new, actually, he's quite young.

346
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 The previous one, William Billy Windsor the first, was a lance corporal in the first battalion, the Royal Welsh,

347
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 until he was demoted to fuselia after inappropriate behaviour during the Queen's official birthday celebrations.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 He apparently refused to keep in step and tried to headbutter drummer.

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Wow, yeah, that'll do it.

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And so he got, eventually he retired and they brought in this new one.

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 They went into the fields in Wales just looking for a goat.

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 It's the Queen's own herd.

353
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 They have to write to the Queen for permission, say can we hunt one of your goats and sort of bring it into the fold?

354
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Yeah, literally bring it into the fold.

355
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And the new one, because it's so young, he still gets his ration of two cigarettes a day.

356
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But he's not allowed to have his Guinness until he's a few years older.

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Does he smoke the cigarettes?

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 No, he eats them.

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Okay.

360
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Oh, there's a fact, so goats don't have upper front teeth.

361
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 They don't have upper front teeth, they just have the sort of...

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 So we are, maybe.

363
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 They just have this weird pad at the front, it's just a sort of dental pad.

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Yeah, it's kind of gross.

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's very sort of gummy, isn't it?

366
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I find that a bit gross.

367
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 It's like a huge ward of tissue.

368
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And that's why when you see them eat, they just sort of grind stuff sideways along it, don't they?

369
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I'm not judging them, but I think it's kind of gross.

370
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So they did a study recently, which show that goats are next to dogs, man's best friend.

371
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 They're man's second best friend.

372
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Really?

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 As in, they bond emotionally with us very well.

374
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And people always lump them in with sheep, and they're completely different.

375
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So they're not really into her.

376
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 They don't mind being in her, but they don't mind being out of it at all.

377
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 They're much more intelligent when they do intelligence tests.

378
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And they have this thing they do when they're in trouble.

379
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 They do the imploring puppy dog eyes thing at humans.

380
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So they did this test with them, where one of those classic kind of scientists doing an intelligence test,

381
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 where they got the goats to figure out that if they pulled a string and it released a lever,

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 and then they nodged that lever, then they could get access to a nice treat.

383
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And they actually did this on 12 goats.

384
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And they tested them, and they learned how to do it very quickly.

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And then they made the task impossible for them.

386
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And when they made it impossible, the goats all looked around at the humans,

387
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 with like a little raised eyebrow kind of help make expression.

388
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I know. But they were smart. So of those 12 goats, within four tries,

389
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 nine of them had completely mastered this trick, this puzzle solving trick.

390
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Two of them cheated, so it would disqualify.

391
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Wow.

392
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Which is how I shouldn't know you disqualified a goat from an intelligence test,

393
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 because they cheated. They tried to headbutt it open.

394
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And they do, you know, for someone who's your best friend, they do headbutt a lot.

395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Yeah.

396
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It's meant affectionately.

397
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 But yeah, so nine did it too, disqualified.

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And there was just one goat in this test that showed no signs of improvement

399
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 by her 22nd try.

400
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And they were offered that hopeless case.

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Have you heard of the, so the US Navy has a goat as well?

402
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 The Bay.

403
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Yeah. So the US Navy cadets, I'm sure a lot of people heard it before,

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 but I had no idea about this.

405
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 There's an official goat mascot called Bill the goat,

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and that either takes the form of a person in a costume.

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 But there is an actual goat as well.

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And the army and the Navy cadets for the last 70 years have been attempting to kidnap each other's goats

409
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 before the annual football match.

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Wow.

411
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 They will not stop.

412
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And do they succeed quite often?

413
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 They succeed quite a lot.

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 So well, the army are trying to kidnap a goat,

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 which is a lot easier than trying to kidnap the army mascot,

416
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 which is a mule, which is six times as heavy.

417
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 So almost always, you know, the goats have frequently been gone,

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 but the mule has only been gone once.

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And it was in 1991.

420
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And the Navy cadets were so annoyed about having repeatedly lost their goat.

421
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So they went a bit overboard.

422
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 They visited West Point Academy, disguised as tourists.

423
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They drew maps.

424
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 They planned their escape routes.

425
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 They studied the alarm systems.

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 They recruited a friendly mule farmer to tell them how to steal a mule.

427
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 They then went to West Point, disguised as soldiers.

428
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 They claimed to be the military police.

429
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 They tied up a sergeant there.

430
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 They locked everyone else at the mule stable in a room.

431
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 They cut the phone lines.

432
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And then they escaped.

433
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Only to be followed by the state police, the military police,

434
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 and three helicopters.

435
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Wow.

436
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 With a mule in tow.

437
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And at that point, the Pentagon intervened and they said,

438
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 "Can you please stop doing this?"

439
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 That's amazing.

440
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I found, so in the headline of this fact,

441
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 one of the goats was called Vincent Van Goet.

442
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And as well as finding another Selena goat mares,

443
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 I found another Vincent Van Goet.

444
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And Vincent Van Goet is a comic book character.

445
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And it's a goat that had superpowers.

446
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And it lived in Washington, D.C.

447
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Yeah.

448
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So this is your superhero, Vincent Van Goet.

449
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 I mean, it's not Spider-Man.

450
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Hold Batman.

451
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Wait till you hear the backstory, James.

452
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Yeah, he's a goat.

453
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Okay.

454
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And he was in a laboratory where they were doing tests.

455
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And this guy, called Derek Henderson, had passed away.

456
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And during some sort of weird experiment,

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 the consciousness of Derek Henderson went into the goat.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And became Vincent Van Goet.

459
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But no one knew that Derek Henderson had gone in there.

460
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 So this guy continues experimenting on this goat.

461
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And he gives him the ability for flight, laser vision,

462
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and superhuman strength.

463
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Without knowing that he has a view.

464
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Without knowing that Derek Henderson is inside him.

465
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So then two people called Quantum and Woody

466
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 come to pick up this goat.

467
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And it turns out that they're the children of Derek Henderson.

468
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So it's goat dad.

469
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It's goat dad.

470
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 But yes.

471
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 But they don't know that he's in there.

472
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 So he spends his whole time trying to go,

473
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 "I'm your dad inside a goat."

474
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And they eventually start believing through little cryptic codes

475
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 that he gives me text messages.

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Does the goat text?

477
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Well, it is.

478
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 They train it because it's a very good goat.

479
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 It can fly.

480
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 It's got lasers.

481
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And it's just been entrusted to random children.

482
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Well, no, they're the main people of the comic book.

483
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 So it's a text-to-speech device.

484
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 So they suddenly communicate with it and work out that it's the dad,

485
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Derek Henderson.

486
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But they don't properly believe it because it turns out the goat is a woman.

487
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 A female goat.

488
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 All right.

489
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Yeah.

490
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 So then they discover that the goat is pregnant.

491
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And she gives birth to Derek Henderson.

492
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Wait, wait, wait.

493
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Do you mean a human baby?

494
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 No, they think Derek Henderson is coming out.

495
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 They don't know what's going to come.

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But it turns out nothing.

497
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It's just a spirit that flies away.

498
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Well, wow.

499
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 That's.

500
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 That's your superhero.

501
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That is maybe the longest we've ever gone on this podcast

502
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 without a single fact we expect.

503
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 It won't be by the time that it's it.

504
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 That is it.

505
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 That sounds incredible.

506
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And now you're going to say we have to move on.

507
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And we all know that.

508
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But you all want to just wasted ten minutes of our time.

509
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Crazy comic book story.

510
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I just know that the people of DC know what incredible comic book

511
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 characters they have.

512
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Why he's called Vincent Van Gogh?

513
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 No fucking goat.

514
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Nothing in that suggest it.

515
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 We do need to move on in a second.

516
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Should we do that?

517
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Yep.

518
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Okay.

519
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It is time for fact number three.

520
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And that is my fact.

521
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 My fact this week is that the Apollo 12 moon landing footage

522
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 was faked.

523
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Okay.

524
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Is this a real factor or is it an a comic book?

525
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 So this is a fact that is actually in our latest book,

526
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 the book of the year 2019.

527
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And on the 12th of November,

528
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 it's going to be the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 12 moon landings.

529
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 The launch happened on the 14th.

530
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And this is a true fact.

531
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 What happened is when they landed,

532
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 they had one camera that was going to film the whole thing.

533
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And as they were starting to film and go on to the moon,

534
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 the camera was pointed directly towards the sun.

535
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And it burns out the camera entirely,

536
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 the only camera that we had there.

537
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Video camera.

538
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So as a result, they had no footage.

539
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And all the TV channels back in America,

540
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 suddenly were freaking out.

541
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 We had the audio, but we didn't have the visuals.

542
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So CBS had to cut to a long island studio where two actors in spacesuits

543
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 had to pretend that they were walking on the moon

544
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 while using the actual audio underneath it.

545
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And over NBC, they had two astronauts,

546
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Marion Nets, that were created by Bill Baird,

547
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 who was the puppeteer behind the lonely goat herd in the sound of music.

548
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Using that, underneath the audio of the Apollo 12 astronauts.

549
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 So they had to fake the footage.

550
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 There is actual fake footage of an Apollo moon landing,

551
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 which is real.

552
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Why did they have all these things at the ready?

553
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 So there was a lot of, obviously, demonstrations of what it might be like,

554
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 the experiments that they would be doing up there.

555
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 So there was a lot of news channels that were showing what were going on.

556
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And then there was a lot of fun things like the Marionettes that were made by this guy,

557
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 just to sort of play.

558
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 So they had that just in the studios.

559
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And they had to, as an emergency, go get those guys back in the suit.

560
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 We need visuals for this.

561
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 But that, I mean, that is the role of those Marionettes' life, isn't it?

562
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 They thought they were just there for this stupid segment and the ad break.

563
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And suddenly, they are the people on the moon.

564
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 That's so cool.

565
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Not that many people watched it.

566
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Did they have Apollo 12?

567
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Because I think, basically, everyone watched Apollo 11.

568
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And they thought it's probably going to be quite similar.

569
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And also, Apollo 11 was on a Sunday night.

570
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 So everyone was at home watching TV.

571
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 But Apollo 12 was at 6 in the morning on a Tuesday.

572
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 That was a way to watch it.

573
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 It was, I mean, even, who were the guys?

574
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Who were the guys?

575
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 So Alan Bean was on there.

576
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 He was one of them Pete Conrad.

577
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Yeah, so Pete Conrad didn't seem that impressed.

578
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And they asked him what the moon was like.

579
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And he said, it's very light, gray-like concrete.

580
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 If I wanted to go out and look at something that looks like the moon,

581
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I'd go and look at my driveway.

582
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 That's very, very easy.

583
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He was a fun character.

584
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 So he had a bet that was made before he went to the moon.

585
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Because someone on Earth who was interviewing him said,

586
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 oh, so what are you going to say when you get on the moon?

587
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 It doesn't matter what you're going to say,

588
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 because I know you're told what to say.

589
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And he said, no, no, I'm not told what to say.

590
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I can say whatever I want.

591
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And she went, of course, it's written for you.

592
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Neal's thing was obviously written for him as well.

593
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So he said, I bet you I can say what I want to say.

594
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 And I'll tell you right now, we'll come up with it together,

595
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 what I'm going to say.

596
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 So the first words, the third man said when he landed on the moon was,

597
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 what, Pete?

598
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Man, that may have been a small one for Neal,

599
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 but that was a long one for me.

600
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 That was his first words on the moon.

601
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It was a $500 bet.

602
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 He never got the 500.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Because he was sure.

604
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 He was sure.

605
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 I can do the sure.

606
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 There's five foot five.

607
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Yeah.

608
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 And it was a play on Neal's quotes.

609
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 How much do we need to spell out?

610
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 He wasn't really such a cool character, Conrad.

611
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So he was actually supposed to be in the Mercury 7,

612
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 who were the original seven people who were going to work

613
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 for an actor to be going out into space, like the original seven.

614
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 He was asked to do the exams, but he was kind of a wild card,

615
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 and he thought the exams were really invasive and annoying.

616
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And so, for instance, they did a rule shack test on him,

617
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 where they show you a blob of ink and they ask you what you can see in it.

618
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And he basically was like, this is going to be bullshit.

619
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And so when the psychiatrist said, what do you see in this blob of ink?

620
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 He described in extreme and graphic detail a sexual, basically a porn film,

621
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 that he was seeing in the blob of ink.

622
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And so then they were like, OK, thank you, sir.

623
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And then they pushed a blank card towards him

624
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 and said, OK, well, what do you make of this?

625
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And then he just turned it around and pushed it back and went.

626
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 It's upside down.

627
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 That's very good.

628
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Do you say that was Conrad?

629
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Yeah.

630
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Conrad, he was quite conscientious when they got up there, though,

631
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 because when they got there, they had to set up this generator

632
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 that was powered by plutonium.

633
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And there was a problem, a snag.

634
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 So the plutonium got stuck inside its container.

635
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And being suggested, why don't we just hit it with a hammer?

636
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And Conrad said, no, obviously, we can't do that.

637
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 We're on the moon rationals.

638
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 We can't just hit it with a hammer.

639
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Being did it anyway.

640
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And it worked.

641
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 It freed it up and it got the thing working.

642
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And being later said, never come to the moon without a hammer.

643
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 So he became an artist when he came back to Earth.

644
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And those paintings you can still buy on his website.

645
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He drew a lot of the polo paintings.

646
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 So he would do Neil Armstrong, he would do buzz and so on.

647
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 But he would also do these works that were sort of chipped

648
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 into steel and stone.

649
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And he did it using the hammer that he did exactly what he just said.

650
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Oh, did we?

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Yeah, on the moon.

652
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 That's very cool.

653
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 They had to use a sextant to get to the moon.

654
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Did you know this?

655
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 No, I don't.

656
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 What?

657
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 So this is amazing.

658
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 So Apollo 12 got hit by lightning as it was taking off.

659
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Not once, but twice.

660
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And this was stressful.

661
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Because they're taking off.

662
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 They're burning 15 tons of fuel every single second.

663
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 This is a high stakes better than the mission.

664
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And it just banged twice with lightning.

665
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And the electric's got completely fried.

666
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 No one knew for a long time that they'd been hit by lightning.

667
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 They just saw everything turned off.

668
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And they had no idea.

669
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 So they say, oh, can we restart?

670
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 So anyway, normally once they got up into orbit of Earth,

671
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 they need to set the course for the moon.

672
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And they would normally have an automatic program to do that for them.

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 That wasn't working, thanks to this.

674
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 So they needed to use a sextant to chart the stars, basically.

675
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 And say, that's where we need to go.

676
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Surely you can just see where the moon is, though, can't you?

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And just like, why do you need to look at the stars?

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 The moon's probably bigger than all those stars.

679
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Okay, first of all, the moon is not bigger than all those stars.

680
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Can I take a point?

681
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Yeah, you're right.

682
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I can only assume it's a bit more complicated than that.

683
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 I don't know.

684
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 What are they doing with a sextant?

685
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Do they have an abacus on board?

686
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I think they got trained with star charts just in case.

687
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Yeah, just in case.

688
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Yeah, handy.

689
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Another thing, someone I think we should mention was Dick Gordon.

690
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Always the third person on the moon voyages is forgotten.

691
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 The guy who's up there in the command module hovering above the moon

692
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 or circling the moon when they're down on the moon in the lunar module.

693
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 So Dick Gordon's up there.

694
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And I think it was quite a long wart time they were out there.

695
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I think it was in the 36 hours or something.

696
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 They were down there.

697
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And he's just on his own circling the moon.

698
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 They did two spacewalks about eight hours of spacewalking.

699
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And then it is very dusty.

700
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And they got covered in kind of black dust.

701
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 So by the time they were returning to the command module, they were dirty.

702
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And so they went back up to see Dick and be like, hey, look what we've done.

703
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And they went back up in the lunar module.

704
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And they latched onto the command module that he was flying.

705
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And Dick pulls the hatch down.

706
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Takes one look at them and says, you're not coming in here like that.

707
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Covered in filth.

708
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And he makes him take all of their clothes off.

709
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And so they re-entered the command module completely naked.

710
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Oh.

711
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Amazing.

712
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 I think it was a prank.

713
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 I think he'd been up there on his own.

714
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I think he knows fuckers got to walk on the moon.

715
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Yeah.

716
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Can we talk a bit about how they fake the Apollo 11 moon landing?

717
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

718
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Right, OK.

719
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 No, just about the theory.

720
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Because it's very, you know, it's been carefully thought about by quite a lot of people.

721
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 It's obviously not true.

722
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 But, you know, the theory is that Stanley Kubrick was hired.

723
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 But I did not know that the theory runs that he was hired to direct three Apollo missions.

724
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And that there was especially a design set in Alabama.

725
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And that Kubrick did Apollo 11, did Apollo 12, fake both.

726
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 But then refused to direct Apollo 13 because NASA rejected his screenplay.

727
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 He wrote a screenplay where it all goes catastrophically wrong as happened with Apollo 13.

728
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And as I said, no, that's not glorious enough.

729
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 OK.

730
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 But then they did end up using his screenplay in the end.

731
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I see.

732
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 So I haven't actually seen Apollo 13, but is that different to the real one?

733
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 No, no, no, no.

734
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 It did go very badly wrong.

735
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Yes, but in the film, it's the same thing happened.

736
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Yes, what did they have?

737
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 What do you mean?

738
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Yeah, of course.

739
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Well, it's OK.

740
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 He didn't change the ending.

741
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 That would have been insensitive, actually.

742
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 I come to think about it.

743
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 So...

744
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Can you imagine a big gym lover watching that movie?

745
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 You just killed me at the end?

746
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 What?

747
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 It's Hollywood.

748
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 The telegraph wrote about this.

749
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Famous, famous. There was a deathbed video of Stanley Kubrick in which he purportedly confessed to faking the moon like this.

750
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Really?

751
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Yeah, he says the US government perpetrated a fraud.

752
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 They wanted to go to moon.

753
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 They weren't quite ready yet, but they needed a Cold War victory.

754
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And was that a real video?

755
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Well, the telegraph wrote up how people can tell.

756
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 There are some signs that it's not genuinely authentically Kubrick.

757
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 So the telegraph wrote, perhaps the biggest giveaway is the fact that the man in the video quite clearly isn't Kubrick.

758
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Yeah.

759
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Some of the footage went up online.

760
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 It's just an old man in the bed.

761
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 But the interview footage also includes someone off camera calling him Tom.

762
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And instructing him how to act.

763
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 So...

764
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 When you said the conspiracy theorists have thought this through carefully.

765
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 I think there are a few holes.

766
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 It feels a bit weird talking about it because we think it's the most insane thing to discuss.

767
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 But the stats are really bizarre on people who think the moon landing is a fake.

768
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 So in Britain, one-sixth of people, like one in six humans in the UK thinks they were staged.

769
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And not only that, but worryingly.

770
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 And I think as older people get quite a hard time in the UK these days amongst the hipsters.

771
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 But they're the ones who have their head screwed on when it comes to this.

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 So in the over 55s, it's one-eighths of people.

773
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 But in people aged 24 to 35, it's more than a fifth of us.

774
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Who think it's fake?

775
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And it's just the internet.

776
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 The web of knowledge has told us the truth.

777
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Well, 53% of people who do think it was faked.

778
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 53% of them think that man did land on the moon, but just later.

779
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Okay.

780
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 So they think we didn't... Apollo 11 didn't land on the moon.

781
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Although I'm sure we got around to it eventually.

782
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 That's what a lot of people think.

783
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Really?

784
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 How pointless.

785
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Do you remember Bart Sibrell?

786
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 You'll remember him, I'm sure.

787
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

788
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 He's a conspiracy theorist and filmmaker who had an encounter famously with Buzz Aldrin,

789
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 in which Buzz Aldrin punched him.

790
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 And because he was following him around and, yeah, yeah.

791
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 So this is how it was written up by the Guardian.

792
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Sibrell, 37, demanded that Aldrin swear on a Bible that he had really landed on the moon.

793
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 Aldrin, 72, declined to do so.

794
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And then his fist really landed on Sibrell's face.

795
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 [Laughter]

796
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 James and I met Buzz Aldrin.

797
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Yeah, we did.

798
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 It was kind of...

799
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 We did a show with him in the UK and it was a bit scary because every question you asked him,

800
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 there was a sense when he looked back at you because he took a few seconds before he answered any question.

801
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 It was almost, you know, like imagine the time lag when they sent messages to space.

802
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 It was that similar kind of distance and you thought he's going to punch me.

803
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 He's going to punch me every single time.

804
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 And I asked him the thing about, do you remember the...

805
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Yeah, so we said that there was more processing power in a musical birthday card than there was on the Apollo 11 mission.

806
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Yeah.

807
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 He did not like that one bit.

808
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 He did it.

809
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 [Laughter]

810
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 We were at the card of us.

811
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Yeah, he went, could this land on the moon?

812
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 It slammed down the ground.

813
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 We went for a drink with him afterwards, didn't we?

814
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And my wife was who's Russian.

815
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 And we left her and him together because we had to get one of the other guests out.

816
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 And she was just stuck with Buzz Aldrin.

817
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Didn't really have anything to say to him and just went, "Sorry about the Cold War."

818
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 [Laughter]

819
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

820
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 And that is James.

821
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that Australian poppy fields have crop circles.

822
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 They are caused by wallabies getting high and jumping around in circles.

823
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 [Laughter]

824
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Very nice.

825
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 We think.

826
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Corrid could be alien.

827
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 This could be alien.

828
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 So this was an interview with Tasmania's Attorney General Laura Giddings.

829
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Because Tasmania makes about 50% of the world's legally grown opium.

830
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 So they have loads and loads of poppy fields.

831
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 And she said, "Basically, it's a real problem. They're wrecking the crop.

832
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 They get really, really high and then just start going round and round in circles."

833
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And then it kills all the poppies.

834
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 And it's bad enough for Tasmanian poppy farmers because like everyone's trying to stop people from taking opiates and stuff like that.

835
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 So it's really, they're really struggling to sell their opiates.

836
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Let's think of those guys in this, yeah.

837
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 [Laughter]

838
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Does it damage the wallabies?

839
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Or are they kind of okay after they're over the come down?

840
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 I don't know what.

841
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 I think they're fine because they keep going back for more.

842
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Yeah. So I think they're all right.

843
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 There's cases in some people have worked out that they get high off these kind of poppies.

844
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 So there's a Dublin society who, well a Dublin society had to step in because some people over there were purposefully feeding them and watching them do this.

845
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 And I think the wallabies.

846
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Yeah, yeah.

847
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Wow.

848
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 And I think it did cause them hot.

849
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 There's a lot of wallabies overseas in many places that you wouldn't expect them to be.

850
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 We have them in the UK.

851
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Yeah, exactly.

852
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 I love man. There's about over 100 on the island of man. Sorry, this means nothing to you.

853
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 You wouldn't expect to see them there.

854
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 They're not the only ones who like opium though, right?

855
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 So parents are addicted to opium.

856
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Oh, yeah.

857
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And humans.

858
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 [Laughter]

859
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 It's parents' humans and wallabies.

860
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 This is in part of India.

861
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 And this is a real problem.

862
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 So India again does a lot of growing opium from additional purposes.

863
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 And they're ruining farmers crops.

864
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 And so there's one farmer in the state of Madhya Pradesh who estimates that he's lost 10% of his crop to parents who just like eat it and get high.

865
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 And they don't respond very well to it in the end.

866
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 So they absolutely love it.

867
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 They're addicted.

868
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And they've even learned not to squawk.

869
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 So these are parents that usually squawk when they're doing stuff.

870
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 But they know that they shouldn't draw attention to themselves.

871
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 So they do it very quietly.

872
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 But they get really, really woozy.

873
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 You know, they go into an opiate kind of stupor.

874
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 They get into a very deep sleep.

875
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 So they often fall off their purchase and die.

876
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Because they're taking it, which is very sad.

877
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 And they get terrible withdrawal.

878
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 So the opium sees an ends.

879
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 And they've got no dealer left.

880
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 And lose their appetite.

881
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 And just sort of some of them, you know, starve themselves to death.

882
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Or just horrible cold turkey, cold parrot.

883
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 [Laughter]

884
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 It's an issue.

885
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 It's so much, there's so much more of this overseas than there is in the UK.

886
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 One of the main stories about this kind of thing happening in the UK

887
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 involved a drunk pony called Fat Boy,

888
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 who ate too many fermented apples and fell into a swimming pool in Cornwall.

889
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 [Laughter]

890
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Wow. Did he, was he OK?

891
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 He was fine.

892
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 [Laughter]

893
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And there was, you were right to say that humans like opium.

894
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Thank you.

895
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 In 2014, there was a Chinese noodle shop owner who was found guilty of lacing his noodles

896
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 with opium poppy seeds so that his customers kept coming back.

897
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Wow.

898
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 And they only found out when one of his customers was given a routine urine test by traffic police.

899
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Wow.

900
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 And they was like, honestly, I've just had some noodles.

901
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 [Laughter]

902
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Because you kind of eat poppy seed bagels, you can fail drugs tests.

903
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 And that's why, yeah, in the US, I'm Britain.

904
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 I think now they've introduced this rule that if you're in prison

905
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 and you are allowed like on bail or if you are allowed out for the day,

906
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 you have to summon a form promising you won't eat poppy seed bagels

907
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 because you'll show up positive.

908
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And there was even in 2014, the Queen's race horse,

909
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 who was called estimate, I think one race,

910
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 and then tested positive for opiates.

911
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And the argument was that there had been some poppy seeds mixed in with the feed.

912
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Because it doesn't feel like something that would help a race horse to run quickly, doesn't it?

913
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 No, it's not what you'd instinctively go for.

914
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 But she had to fall for the £81,000 prize money, so please donate generously.

915
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 [Laughter]

916
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Wallabies?

917
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Yeah.

918
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Wallabies, I didn't know anything about Wallabies before this,

919
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 but there are loads of different species of them.

920
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 And there are obviously pouch animals that basically small kangaroos,

921
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 I guess, to be unscientific about it.

922
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 But the tamar wallabie can breathe through its skin.

923
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Wow.

924
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 It's so cool.

925
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 It's not for very long.

926
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 It's just after it's born.

927
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 So it's absolutely tiny when it's born.

928
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 But on the day they're born, they get a third of their oxygen through their skin.

929
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 Because they're just about the size of a bean.

930
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 And they are small enough that they have a big surface area to weight ratio.

931
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 So it's more effective.

932
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 It's more efficient for them to get those.

933
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 I don't know, the oxygen molecules just managed to sort of pervade into their body.

934
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 But they're really, really tiny.

935
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 And then they forget by the time they're an adult.

936
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 They don't forget.

937
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 They don't remember.

938
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 No one's asked them if they remember it.

939
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 I mean, they don't remember how to do it, sorry.

940
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Yeah, yeah.

941
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 They might remember having done it, though.

942
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Maybe.

943
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 But they aren't, they're kind of gross when they're like that, aren't they?

944
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 They're like a tiny little worm when they're first born.

945
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 And of course, they do the huge trick and we still don't really understand how, at what is basically a fetal stage,

946
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 they climb up through the fur and into the pouch.

947
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 But they do it.

948
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 And then they clock on to the teeth in the pouch.

949
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And then the teeth swells up, the mother's teeth swells up in their mouth.

950
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 So they're stuck on it, which I always think must be so uncomfortable.

951
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 And they can't take their mouth off the mother's teeth for a couple of months.

952
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 They're just random.

953
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Really?

954
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Are they like kangaroos that they make different types of milk?

955
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 So the baby, when it first comes, it needs the real lots of cream.

956
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 But then as it gets bigger, another baby comes along, gets that, and then it gets the half and half.

957
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Yeah.

958
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 And while they're doing that, they can also be growing a new baby in their uterus.

959
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 So they can have sort of a kid that's jumping in and out of the pouch on one teeth.

960
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Then the very newborn wormy one on the other.

961
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 And then the growing a third one in their uterus, they're like a superman.

962
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 They be on a documentary or a reality TV show, or something.

963
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And they do that without having extra sex, as in they say again.

964
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 What?

965
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 Well, so usually if you want a second kid, sex has to happen, right?

966
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Sure.

967
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 I'm so glad you know that with somebody who has a second kid on the way.

968
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Weirdly though, we didn't have sex a second time, so...

969
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Do you think your wife is a wallaby?

970
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Dan's wife is actually a scientist in the body of a wallaby.

971
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 (Laughter)

972
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 So what they do is when they have sex, they...

973
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 The first bit goes in it and they conceive, but they save some of the sperm.

974
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And once they have the wallaby go out, the sperm goes round into the other...

975
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 They have a few vaginas.

976
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 I'm not sure how many.

977
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Sure, sure.

978
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 But I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

979
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 I mean, how do they...

980
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 Because I've heard about it, we've talked a bit about this, but I don't understand how they keep sperm cells alive that they've received mating.

981
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 I don't understand where and how you keep them.

982
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 Well, let me tell you, you are asking the wrong guy.

983
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 (Laughter)

984
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 That is cool.

985
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 I didn't know they could do that.

986
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 I knew they could save a fetus when it had been fertilized.

987
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 So they'll have an embryo growing.

988
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 It'll just start growing.

989
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 And they'll be like, "Oh, I don't want to get pregnant yet."

990
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 And so they just pause their pregnancy and it's called something like pregnancy pause or something.

991
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 And they're going to hold, but the pregnancy on hold for like a year.

992
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 But yeah, that's when the sperm has fertilized the egg and this little baby just sits there and waits in them for a year or so.

993
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Oh, yeah, that's extraordinary.

994
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 That's amazing.

995
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 Yeah, I found out...

996
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Okay, so I grew up in Australia.

997
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 So there's a wallaby and a kangaroo.

998
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 I only found out while researching this today, there's a wallaroo.

999
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 And a wallaroo is not a wallaby and a kangaroo mating and a mixed breed.

1000
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Right.

1001
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 This is a separate...

1002
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 This is, you've got small, large, we've now got medium.

1003
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 This is the medium size wallaby to...

1004
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 I can't believe you've never seen a wallaroo.

1005
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 And a pattern melon, which again, a pattern melon is a smaller version.

1006
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 You've got pattern melon wallaby, wallaroo, kangaroo.

1007
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 There's another one too.

1008
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 They're all over the shop.

1009
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Is there?

1010
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 Yeah.

1011
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 They all look kind of the same though.

1012
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 I'd never heard of that.

1013
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 That's very impressive.

1014
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Yeah.

1015
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 That's cool to me.

1016
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 There were giant kangaroos, of course.

1017
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Oh no, sorry, giant wallabies.

1018
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 We're there.

1019
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 The giant wallaby weighed 330 pounds or 150 kilos.

1020
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 And the giant short-faced kangaroo weighed 530 pounds, so about 240 kilos.

1021
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 And its closest living relative is the banded hair wallaby, which weighs 4 pounds.

1022
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 Yeah.

1023
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 Yeah, they had one that's the size of small cars, which had teeth longer than knife blades.

1024
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 And they had five meter long lizards.

1025
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 They had birds that weighed half a ton.

1026
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 And they had tottuces the size of small dinosaurs.

1027
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 They just say the size of dinosaurs, but it was the size of small dinosaurs.

1028
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 But all these things existed at the same time as humans were in Australia.

1029
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 When the humans first came over, all these massive things were there.

1030
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 That must have been a terrifying time to be in Australia.

1031
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 Or humans did sort out that problem.

1032
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 They did.

1033
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Yeah, yeah.

1034
00:47:44,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 >> They are so good at that. >> I've got a NASA Apollo fact. We're too late for that. I'll just go for anyway. >> Wow. If this doesn't end up there being a wallaby on the moon, then you've broken some serious codes here.

1035
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 >> It was a guy called Walter Kuniger who was charged with the task of trying to work out what the best way to walk on the moon was. He spent years and years doing it up until the point where they went to the moon and he produced a five volume report on the best ways to move around on the moon.

1036
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 According to him, the best way to move around the moon with your gate as a human is to jump like a kangaroo. The kangaroo hop is how he wanted Neil Armstrong to go around the moon. >> What does that even mean though? Kangaroos use their tail to push themselves around this stuff, don't they?

1037
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 >> Yeah, so he just thought you're pushing both feet and you're landing and if you get the balance right, that's the perfect gate for getting distance. >> So not moving Alex independently. >> Exactly, not moving Alex independently and they didn't do it because they thought it would look shit.

1038
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 >> Despite five volumes of work. >> All right, that was tangentially related to Marsoo Fields. We'll let it go. Do you know there's a wallaby with a purple neck?

1039
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 And this was thought to be a mythical creature. People talked about there being a purple neck, and everyone said it's not true, and people said they've seen it in Australia.

1040
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 And then people kept on having these sightings, and it's like purple die on its neck. And then everyone would just say, no, it's obviously just rubbed up against some purple paint.

1041
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 And there was a hundred year period where scientists were just telling these people who saw them. It's just rubbed against a purple wall or something.

1042
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 Anyway, they finally, they finally sort of categorized the purple neck rock wallaby, and it's really cool. It's a new species discovered in 2001.

1043
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 And it basically is the creeps purple die onto its neck and kind of its face. And it's quite hard sometimes to spot because when it rains it washes off. And it just looks like a wallaby again.

1044
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 So where does the ink come from? From within their body. What happens? Do we know what?

1045
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 What happens? You know fucking I did.

1046
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 We're going to have to wrap up in Sunish.

1047
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Oh, we could go back to some stone animals. Oh, yeah. You get stone platypuses in Australia. What happens is, it's kind of interesting with those guys.

1048
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 So what happens is you get drugs that are flushed into the rivers by humans. And then that's eaten by larvae. And then the larvae are eaten by spiders.

1049
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 And then the spiders are eaten by the platypuses. And all the way up that food chain, everyone is kind of getting stoneed.

1050
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 But it's really weird because it's this thing called bio accumulating. So it becomes more and more concentrated as it goes up through the food chain. So as you go further and further up they're just getting more and more into it.

1051
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 And it's especially bad with antidepressants. I think you get platypuses who take like 50% of what you would expect a human to take for antidepressants every single thing.

1052
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 They're small. They're small. They're like this big. So it's bigger. It's not great for a podcast.

1053
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 I have to say James, I don't think they're out with that big. I think they're more like this big.

1054
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 That's mad. So it's like the old lady who swore to fly basically. But if the end of that rhyme was and then she got massively got the munchies.

1055
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 It's like if the fly had a little bit of drugs in it and then whatever it was, the bird had a bit more and the cat had a bit more. And by the time you get the horse, it's just full of cats and then.

1056
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 It's time to wrap up. Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

1057

 We're going to try the land. Anna is not yet in the order. Wow.

1059
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 I didn't know even what the answer was.

1060
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 It's either yes or no.

1061
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 I normally have a lot to revise. Good to James. Okay.

1062
