00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 - Hey guys, we have a few exciting bits of news

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,880
 before we start today's show.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,720
 One is, next week, we have a special guest on the show.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,880
 Do you wanna say it, Dan?

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,680
 - It's Stephen Fry.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,520
 - Oh!

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,280
 - Yes, Stephen Fry, he brought a fact and he sat with us

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,720
 for a couple of hours to just chew over

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,760
 the best, facty stuff we could think.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,560
 - It's great, it's next Friday, don't miss it.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,320
 And to celebrate that, actually, next Friday at 5 p.m.,

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,720
 GMT, we're gonna be doing a Reddit AMA.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,480
 So, that's Reddit, R-E-D-I-T.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,760
 We're gonna be answering questions from all over the world

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,760
 about everything that you might want to know about us

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,720
 and also everything else in the world.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,400
 So, if you go to no such thing as a fish.com/reddit,

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,960
 we will be there, check it out.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,240
 - That's right, we'll be there for an hour

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,440
 just answering every single question you have.

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,480
 And lastly, just to remind you, in case you haven't

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,280
 been listening to the episodes for the last few weeks,

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,720
 we have a book out, such a book.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,320
 It's such a book, I mean, it's the book of the year.

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,520
 It's the book of the year, 2018.

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,600
 - People have been calling at that.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
 - That's the title.

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,080
 - Yeah, we've not given them much option,

29
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,000
 but that's what they've been calling it anyway.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,520
 - It's a fabulous book, it contains all the weirdest

31
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,600
 and most bizarre and wonderful and funny things

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,680
 that have happened around the entire world this year.

33
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,720
 And honestly, guys, if you want to do one thing

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,080
 to support the podcast, this is a perfect thing to do.

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 It's on Amazon, it's in Waterstones,

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,760
 it's in all good indie book shops,

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,760
 it's called The Book of the Year 2018.

38
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,160
 Please do get yourself a copy,

39
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,240
 it makes a perfect Christmas present.

40
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,880
 - Outside of that, come back Friday.

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
 - Stephen Fry is gonna be on Stephen Fry Day.

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
 - I love it.

43
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
 - Stephen Fry Day.

44
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,000
 - I love it even more the second time you said it.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,640
 - Okay, on with the show.

46
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,980
 (horn honking)

47
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,920
 - Do you know what the, who the, what the, what the, what the,

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,760
 what the, who the, what the, what the, what the, what the,

49
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,480
 do you know what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the.

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:58,040
 - This is a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you from our book of the year 2018 tour live at the Union Chapel in London.

52
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
 (cheering)

53
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:12,040
 - My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Aniches Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

54
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,040
 - And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 - And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:32,040
 - My fact this week is that when you went to the toilet on a World War II U-boat, you had to summon a specially trained member of the crew to flush it after you'd been.

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
 (laughing)

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 - This is one of the jobs on German U-boats in the second World War.

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
 - Well, I would just never go, ever.

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
 (laughing)

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,040
 - Yeah, there must have been a lot of people going, I didn't actually use it.

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,040
 - I just came and someone's not flushed that. (laughing)

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 - Walsers, that's disgusting.

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 - It was because it was quite a complicated thing to do because the pressure outside in a submarine is a lot of water on you often.

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 And so it's quite hard to force something out into that water.

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,040
 And so for a long, and the German U-boats had no storage tanks, so you had to just flush it straight out into the ocean.

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,040
 And so for a long time, you could only use the toilets on them when they were right on the surface.

68
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
 And then as soon as you went down, it was like, hold it in.

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,040
 - Wow. - But there must have been some really desperate people going, we need to go up now.

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
 - Yeah. (laughing)

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,040
 - I need to fire a torpedo. (laughing)

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
 (laughing)

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,040
 - But then they developed this system which meant the lose could be flushed to a lower depth.

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
 But it was very complex to do so.

75
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 So there was a series of levers to pull you out to do it in the right order.

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
 And these things were called Thunderboxes, these new toilets that they designed.

77
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040
 - Wow. - And if you pulled the wrong lever, you literally got drenched in sewage.

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,040
 Or something worse could happen. You know, you could open a hole in the submarine and the whole thing goes down.

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,040
 So people had to be specially trained to use them. And when you did go to the loop, you had to do someone one of those people.

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,040
 - But I think it is still quite dangerous, isn't it? Well, not dangerous so much as, like you might get a face full of poo.

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,040
 - Yeah. - Because I read that the current ones, it's like a big slot machine, like a big lever.

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,040
 And you pull down the lever, and the poo might go down, or you might get a face full of it.

83
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,040
 - What? - Which is the worst. I mean, the worst you can have in a slot machine is you lose your pound, isn't it?

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
 - But yeah, that apparently happens. - That's pretty right.

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
 - Give you a modern submarine. - Modern submarines, yeah.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
 - Do they not have lids for the toilet?

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 - No. - Do they not know?

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
 - We know how, like, my toilet has a lid, right?

89
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,040
 - So I was doing all right for themselves.

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,040
 - All that podcast money rolling in.

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
 - There did used to be actual disasters that happened when people screwed this up.

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,040
 So in 1945, there was a particularly bad moment where the captain of the U-1026 submarine tried to use the loo.

93
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
 And because he was captain, he thought, "I'm sure I can flush this myself."

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
 So he tried to interpret the flushing manual.

95
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
 Next to it, he mess it up. He failed.

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:03,040
 It started flooding. He had to call the specialist in, who opened a valve in a panic, which started letting water in from outside and just flooding all the batteries.

97
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,040
 This released chlorine gas into the submarine. They had to surface. They all got spotted by the enemy.

98
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
 They were off the coast of Scotland, actually, I think.

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
 And so they were all either killed or taken prisoner.

100
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
 - Oh, my God. - So that's the worst thing that can happen if you screw up going to the loo.

101
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,040
 - Having the flushing manual, beside the toilet, it's a bit of a conundrum when you run out of toilet paper.

102
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,040
 I looked into the submarine toilets in general.

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,040
 So I didn't know this. Some Marines or German U-boats in the second one bore.

104
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,040
 They had two toilets, generally, but they had about 50 men on them.

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
 So that's already, you know, 20 minutes. - A managed toilet.

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,040
 Well, no.

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,040
 So you've got 25 men sharing each small toilet.

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,040
 And the problem was, in the early days of a cruise, there was so little space.

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
 They were all in an area about the size of a double-dacker bus.

110
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,040
 So one of the toilets at the beginning of a cruise would be used to store fresh food.

111
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,040
 So all the fresh food stuff would be in the toilet.

112
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,040
 So you'd have 50 men sharing the other small toilet.

113
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,040
 - Yeah. - And then, and it all went moldy in there because it's so damp all the time.

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,040
 - Yeah. - And you weren't allowed more than one change of pants and socks.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
 And all the other clothes you only had one of.

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,040
 - But you can do it inside out as many times as you like, right?

117
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
 - You would have fit in really well.

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,040
 - I make that 12 pairs of pants you've got effectively.

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,040
 You also couldn't use the loo when you were anywhere near the enemy.

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
 So if you were stalking the enemy, it was feared that using the toilet

121
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 would make such a loud noise of clanking metal.

122
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,040
 And then it would cause floating debris to appear outside of your submarine.

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
 And so it was thought that they could spot you.

124
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,040
 And so you could, as soon as you were actually fighting, you couldn't go.

125
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
 And I would have thought the time you were going to really need the loo is when they go.

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
 Okay, we're attacking now.

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,040
 - Yeah, also what, so an enemy ship would spot just a popping turse.

128
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,040
 - What kind of binoculars?

129
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,040
 - What could happen is, and this happens with current submarines,

130
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,040
 is they fire out the waste and then loads of fish and crabs and stuff like that

131
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
 all kind of flock toward it because they all want the nutrients.

132
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,040
 So that could work. Like Seagulls coming down to eat that one solitary turd.

133
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 - Yes.

134
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
 - Oh man.

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
 - But yeah, life on board submarines.

136
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 - That was nice fun.

137
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
 - They do have fun sometimes.

138
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,040
 They have a thing called angles and dangles.

139
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
 - Okay.

140
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,040
 - They go in a 25 degree angle when they're kind of going down into the water.

141
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,040
 And what they do is they put the slippiest, slipperyest thing they can find all over the ship

142
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 and then just slide down all the corridors.

143
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
 - No!

144
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 - That sounds amazing, isn't it?

145
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
 - Wow. That sounds incredible.

146
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 - Yeah. They used to play good games as well.

147
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 I think it was quite boring, like a lot of war.

148
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 You know, you did nothing for a long time, but then you died.

149
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
 And so...

150
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
 - That's life, I know.

151
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
 - Oh.

152
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,040
 - But yeah, I was reading some logs of the games they used to play.

153
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 The captain of One You Boat organized a guess a number of P's in the bag game, which sounds very fun.

154
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,040
 Or guess the number of rotations the propeller would make in a certain amount of time.

155
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,040
 And then if you won that, if you were the one who got closest and the captain would take over your roles, your duties for the day.

156
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
 So if you were the toilet flusher, the captain would have to do that.

157
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,040
 They had frequent singing, limerick, ing, and lying competitions, apparently.

158
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
 - Lying, as in telling lies.

159
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,040
 - I guess so, yeah, or just being prostrate, telling lies, yeah.

160
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,040
 - They had to share their bunks with what beneath their bunks were torpedoes at the beginning of the voyage, because there was just no space.

161
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
 - Did they?

162
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
 - Yes, they would just be lying next to a torpedo.

163
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
 - Oh, very careful, yeah.

164
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,040
 - I do like how makeshift some of the adventures that some Marines have as a result of things like a toilet breaking or...

165
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
 Or just as so many things can go wrong on a submarine.

166
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,040
 I read this amazing story, there was the R14, it was a submarine back in 1921.

167
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,040
 And basically what happened is, is its engine died, and it didn't have enough battery in order to propel it back to land.

168
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
 And they were off the coast of Hawaii.

169
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,040
 And so they were stuck, they were above surface, and they didn't know how to move.

170
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
 They were at a standstill.

171
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,040
 And so the captain ordered for them to go down and get all of the hammocks and all the material from bunks and come back up.

172
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,040
 And they put them up, and all the bedsheets came up, and they set these huge sails.

173
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
 They manufacture these giant sails, yeah.

174
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,040
 And within 64 hours, they managed to sail to the coastline of Hawaii.

175
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,040
 They picked up enough wind to go at like one hour.

176
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
 - Is that nice?

177
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
 - Yeah, no way.

178
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
 - Yeah, is that awesome?

179
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
 - So all that practice they'd done as kind of seven-year-old boys on their beds.

180
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,040
 You know, when you made your bed into a boat.

181
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
 - Oh.

182
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
 - It came in handy.

183
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
 - It's very hard with a fitted sheet, I find.

184
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,040
 So this fact is at least partly about toilets.

185
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
 - Yes.

186
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,040
 - So in order to find out about it, I searched online, and I found a website called toiletguru.com.

187
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
 I cannot recommend it highly enough.

188
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
 It's so good.

189
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,040
 It's just a guy called Bob Cromwell, who has a website about toilets.

190
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,040
 And he has an FAQ page about why he's doing it, because he photographs toilets all over the world.

191
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,040
 And they're not brilliant photos, but they're good.

192
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 But they're good, and the website is very informative and interesting.

193
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
 So I just want to say, I'm pro toiletguru.com.

194
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,040
 But the FAQ, it's so clear that he's written the questions.

195
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
 Like a guru, really?

196
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,040
 He says, it's purely a self-appointed title.

197
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 There is no formal sanctioning body.

198
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,040
 [laughter]

199
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
 Next question.

200
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
 Am I obsessed with toilets?

201
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
 No, I'm just willing to admit I find the topic somewhat interesting.

202
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,040
 So why a site just on toilets?

203
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
 He says, "Why not?"

204
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,040
 But a site about toilets, I must be obsessed, right?

205
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
 And here he really goes for it.

206
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
 He says, "I don't see it that way.

207
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
 I'm just the guy with a silly site that spun off a collection of travel pictures.

208
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,040
 I regularly get messages from people saying, "I have spent the last four hours reading about toilets on your website,

209
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
 and I would like to know why you are so obsessed.

210
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
 Excuse me.

211
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 You just spent how long thinking about toilets and reading my site?

212
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,040
 And you think, "I am fixated on the topic."

213
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,040
 [laughter]

214
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,040
 One of the spun off from just his holiday photos is everything.

215
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
 Who does that?

216
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
 In the holiday pictures.

217
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
 You go and show the album to your family.

218
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
 That's so true.

219
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
 This is the number two I left in Tokyo.

220
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
 [laughter]

221
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,040
 I too was looking into toilets, but specifically because the job of this person was to avoid disaster.

222
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
 So I looked into dangerous toilets.

223
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
 And I found one.

224
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
 This goes back to 10-16.

225
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,040
 And this is the death of King Edmund.

226
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
 King Edmund died on the toilet.

227
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 And so he sat on the toilet and he died.

228
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,040
 And the way he died was at the time, Knut of Denmark,

229
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,040
 he was trying to extend his empire into the Britain.

230
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,040
 And so he sent someone, one of his Vikings,

231
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 who broke into the bathroom of King Edmund,

232
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,040
 hid inside the toilet underneath it.

233
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:09,040
 And when he sat down, he raised a sword right through the bum hole all the way up.

234
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
 And killed him.

235
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
 No.

236
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
 Yes.

237
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,040
 [laughter]

238
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
 Sorry, the Vikings got access to his toilet.

239
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,040
 Why does he have to hide under the toilet for the King?

240
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
 I would just like to find the door.

241
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
 That's how you get into the bum hole most easy.

242
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 Stopped being on top of a cupboard.

243
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
 It's perfect vantage point.

244
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,040
 But you can kill, you don't have to kill someone.

245
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
 That, yeah.

246
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
 Cool.

247
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
 That's a good fact.

248
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
 He might have got into the toilet and thought I'll hide somewhere else.

249
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
 And there were no cupboards or anything, you know.

250
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,040
 And he heard Edmund kind of walking down the corridor.

251
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
 And he looked frantically around.

252
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
 Oh, it was sick.

253
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
 No.

254
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
 Oh, the B-Day.

255
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
 No, not big enough.

256
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
 That's one of those amazing scenes in the film with the door open.

257
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
 And there's no one in there.

258
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
 That's an audience.

259
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
 You're like, where's he going?

260
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
 He's like, oh, Faggot, he's got a toilet cover.

261
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
 Hi, he's doing all right for himself.

262
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,040
 [laughter]

263
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,040
 What could be more dangerous speaking of dangerous toilets

264
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
 than Hitler's toilet?

265
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
 Hmm.

266
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 Yeah.

267
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 Ooh.

268
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,040
 And so Hitler's toilet, Hitler's ship's toilet

269
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,040
 is a tourist attraction in New Jersey at the moment.

270
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,040
 So at the end of the war, Hitler had a yacht and he was going to

271
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
 sail up the tents, kind of, loading it over the British.

272
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,040
 And what happened was the British took it off him and then

273
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
 dismantled it and sold it for scrap.

274
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,040
 And the toilet happened to end up in a shop in New Jersey.

275
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,040
 And there's a guy called Greg Koffelt.

276
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
 And if you go down to his shop and say,

277
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
 can I see Hitler's toilet please?

278
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
 He'll just show you around.

279
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
 Oh.

280
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
 And again, here it is.

281
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,040
 And he says, it's not something to be proud of, but it exists.

282
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 [laughter]

283
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,040
 Apparently, it wasn't in his shop for a little while

284
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,040
 because he took it to the UK in an attempt to sell it

285
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
 on a TV game show.

286
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
 Which game?

287
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
 I don't know.

288
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
 All I could think is bargain hum.

289
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
 Yeah.

290
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
 Yeah.

291
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
 Yeah.

292
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
 That doesn't sound like it does.

293
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 [laughter]

294
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
 Antique's Roadshow?

295
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
 [laughter]

296
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
 One of those nice, stately home guards.

297
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,040
 That's a really low-rend edition of Antique's Roadshow.

298
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,040
 And we need to move on to our next act.

299
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 Just one more submarine.

300
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
 I didn't know this.

301
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
 I thought it was incredible.

302
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,040
 So did you know that the Brits had to find a way in World War II

303
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
 of defeating the German U-Boats.

304
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
 They were a massive danger.

305
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
 And so they planned to make an aircraft carrier

306
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,040
 that was more effective because our aircraft didn't have the range

307
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
 to hit the U-Boats from land.

308
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
 And so a guy called Jeffrey Pike, working for the government,

309
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
 proposed, and this is a thing called Operation Haber Cook.

310
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
 It was approved by Churchill.

311
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
 He proposed that we build an aircraft carrier

312
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
 made completely of ice.

313
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
 So this massive ice ship.

314
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
 Wow.

315
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
 And yeah, so he went to Churchill.

316
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
 He took this pan to Churchill.

317
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
 He said, "Can I do this, make this ice thing?"

318
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,040
 And then, after researching further, Pike realised it was unsuitable

319
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
 because it would melt.

320
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
 [laughter]

321
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,040
 That's the kind of thinking that won us the war, Anna.

322
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 [laughter]

323
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
 But then, so I remember this story.

324
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,040
 And what happened was he then started putting stuff in the ice, didn't he?

325
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
 Yeah.

326
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
 Like little bits of soda, star something.

327
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
 And then that stopped it from melting.

328
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
 It did.

329
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
 And is it right?

330
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
 This is probably a myth.

331
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
 But did he go and see Churchill again?

332
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
 And Churchill was in the bath.

333
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
 Is that true or not?

334
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
 He didn't.

335
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
 But yeah, it was called Pike Crete, named after him.

336
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
 And yeah, he convinced Lord Mountain Baton that it was a good idea.

337
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
 And Mountain Baton really liked it.

338
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
 So he said, "I'll go and talk to Churchill."

339
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
 And Mountain Baton used to tell this story after dinner, after dinner parties.

340
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
 He said he went to checkers to show Churchill this special Pike Crete

341
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
 that was so good at floating.

342
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,040
 And he was told that Churchill was in the bath, so he'd have to wait.

343
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,040
 And Mountain Baton said, "Good, that's exactly where I want him to be."

344
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,040
 And he marched straight up into his bathroom, pushed the door open, and said,

345
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,040
 "Hey, Churchill, I do mind if I put this bit of thing in the bath with you

346
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,040
 and show you how effective it will be as an aircraft carrier."

347
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
 And that's what he did.

348
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,040
 And that was the last ever ridiculous plan to come out of checkers, wasn't it?

349
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
 [laughter]

350
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 Very nice.

351
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,040
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

352
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,040
 Okay, my fact this week is that Alexander Graham Bell taught his dog to say,

353
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
 "How are you, Gragmama?"

354
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 No.

355
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
 [laughter]

356
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,040
 I'm going out on a limb and saying, "No, he didn't."

357
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
 [laughter]

358
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
 He's so dead, he's so absolutely dead, kind of.

359
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
 Boy.

360
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,040
 If anyone could record the evidence, he could, so where is it?

361
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
 Well, this was before all of the telephone stuff that he did.

362
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
 It was when he was quite young.

363
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,040
 So when he was really young, his father devised a system of transcribing words

364
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
 by just the shape that you make of your mouth.

365
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
 So he would say, "If you make your mouth like this, like this,

366
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
 it will make these kind of sounds."

367
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,040
 If you make someone's face go wider, it goes more of an e-sound.

368
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
 If you make it go narrow, it's more of an o-sound.

369
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,040
 And so once he kind of learned this, when he got a bit older,

370
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,040
 he decided to try it on his dog.

371
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,040
 And so first of all, he organised so that the dog would growl on command

372
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,040
 by giving him treats and things like that.

373
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,040
 And then, as the dog would growl, he would kind of move his face.

374
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
 And he managed to get the dog to say, "Mama."

375
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
 So he got, "Mama."

376
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
 So he made the lips go down like that.

377
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,040
 Then he got to say, "Ga-a-au-an-u."

378
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,040
 And when you put it all together, it sounded a bit like,

379
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 "Ga-a-au-a-au-gamama."

380
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,040
 And this was his party trick, and he did it all the time.

381
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,040
 And what a patient dog.

382
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,040
 Well, the thing is that he then tried to get the dog to do it

383
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
 without any kind of movements of the lips

384
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
 and just see if he could do it by himself.

385
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 Right.

386
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
 And he said that even though he took kind of an interest in the experiments,

387
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,040
 he was never able alone to do anything but growl.

388
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,040
 What did I express taking an interest in the experiments?

389
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,040
 I have another fact about Alexander Graham Bell as a boy.

390
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
 Okay.

391
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
 So he was born Alexander Bell.

392
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
 Okay.

393
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 He didn't have a middle name until he was 10 years old.

394
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,040
 And then he got jealous of his brothers who did have middle names.

395
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
 And he asked his father, "Can I have a middle name?"

396
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
 And his father said, "Yes."

397
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
 Which one would he like?

398
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
 He said Graham.

399
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,040
 And that was his 11th birthday present.

400
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
 Wow.

401
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
 It was a middle name.

402
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
 I did that.

403
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
 When I was 12, I asked for a new middle name.

404
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,040
 Because I didn't really have one properly.

405
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
 So my name is Daniel Craig Schreiber.

406
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,040
 But everyone else in my family, including my sister,

407
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
 has Craig as her middle name.

408
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
 And we'd moved to Australia from Hong Kong.

409
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,040
 And I said, "When I go to school, I want to have a new middle name."

410
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 And no one will know that it was never there before.

411
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
 And they said, "Yes."

412
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
 And I did it.

413
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
 What was it?

414
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
 So it was a full name.

415
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,040
 Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber.

416
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,040
 And I swear to God, that's true.

417
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,040
 It was on my opening school report,

418
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
 it's Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber.

419
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,040
 And then someone pointed out that that was really uncool.

420
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,040
 And also it spells out Dix.

421
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:23,040
 [laughter]

422
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
 No wonder they called me that.

423
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
 [laughter]

424
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
 There are many reasons.

425
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,040
 Also as a kid, he used to help his dad.

426
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,040
 So he came from a long line of people who experimented with--

427
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
 Middle names.

428
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
 Middle names.

429
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
 Yeah.

430
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
 With sound and with how we speak and with speech.

431
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,040
 And so his father invented kind of a system of notating

432
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,040
 the different sounds that humans can make and writing it on a board.

433
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,040
 And he said that you could make any sound in any language.

434
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
 And he could write the notation for it.

435
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
 And this could be a universal language.

436
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
 And he used to deploy his son to help him.

437
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 So he'd be giving a lecture to a big lecture theatre of people.

438
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,040
 And he'd say someone in the audience, preferably someone who's from a different country.

439
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
 You know, a Russian person.

440
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
 Why don't you give me one of your words in Russian.

441
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
 And this Russian person would give him the word.

442
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,040
 And then Alexander's dad would write on the board his special notation for that word.

443
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,040
 And then he'd call his little 10-year-old son in who'd trot in and look at the board.

444
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
 And he'd be able to make that sound.

445
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
 And it was like a weird kind of magic trick.

446
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,040
 So he did do a lot of work with the deaf.

447
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,040
 I think he's kind of a controversial figure because he argued for eugenics.

448
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,040
 And he was president of the Second International Eugenics Congress.

449
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,040
 But he also came from, so his mother was deaf, his fiance was deaf.

450
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
 And he taught deaf children a lot.

451
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,040
 He almost missed the big debut of the telephone because he wanted to teach a class of deaf children.

452
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
 Oh, really?

453
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,040
 So he had a very mixed opinion.

454
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
 I can't quite understand.

455
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:58,040
 Also, he's controversial just because, I think, as is semi well accepted now, he didn't invent the telephone.

456
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,040
 And so that's, I know, I hate to break it to you.

457
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,040
 Well, this is all bollocks then, my notes.

458
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
 Yeah, you're thinking of a different guy.

459
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,040
 No, the US House of Representatives actually voted on this in 2002, which I didn't realize.

460
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,040
 So actually, it turns out sort of two other people invented it before him.

461
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,040
 So Miyuchi was an Italian who invented the telephone,

462
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
 but then he couldn't afford to keep wow.

463
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
 And he's in tonight.

464
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,040
 Big fan.

465
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 But yeah, the House of Representatives in the US voted on whether or not he invented the telephone.

466
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 And they voted for the fact that Bell actually didn't invent it.

467
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
 It was Miyuchi.

468
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,040
 And then, actually, 10 days later, Canada voted, and unanimously said, Bell did invent it.

469
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,040
 And that is the cause of all tensions between those countries.

470
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,040
 Well, Bell did have the patents in America, didn't he?

471
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
 Yes.

472
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
 Miyuchi couldn't afford to keep up the patent.

473
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
 But yes, he did.

474
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,040
 He tried to sell the patents to Western Union for $100,000.

475
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 And his thinking behind that was that one day there will be a telephone in every American city.

476
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
 Cool.

477
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 And Western Union rejected the idea as idiotic.

478
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
 I like as well though.

479
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,040
 He obviously, he may not have invented it, but he definitely knew the technology.

480
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,040
 He understood how it worked, and he built his own versions.

481
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,040
 And there are stories of him where if he was passing someone using the telephone and it wasn't working,

482
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,040
 he would just go up to them, take the phone off them, and fix it for them.

483
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,040
 So there's a case of a town that he retired to called Baddock.

484
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,040
 And when he was living there, he passed someone who couldn't make it work.

485
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,040
 He unscrewed a bit of the phone, and there was a fly trapped on the inside.

486
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 That was just, you know, somehow it was messing it up.

487
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,040
 Took the fly out, put the phone back on, and the guy went, wow, how did you know that?

488
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,040
 He went, I invented this.

489
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
 I guess that's why he did it, just for the punchline, but yeah.

490
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,040
 Imagine Steve Jobs walking up to you and fixing your Mac.

491
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 It would be amazing.

492
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
 Yeah.

493
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
 And extremely impressive now.

494
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 So Belle didn't have a phone in his study towards the end of his life, and he retired.

495
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
 Yeah, he completely changed course.

496
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
 He invented a lot of other things as well.

497
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
 But I think we've briefly mentioned this on QA.

498
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,040
 Anyway, he did want people to answer the phone, a Hoi Hoi, and he campaigned.

499
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,040
 And he said a Hoi, when he answered the phone, till the end of his life.

500
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,040
 So Mr Burns is the only one doing it correctly.

501
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,040
 The other thing is what advice was on ending a call.

502
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 So the first ever phone book, it wasn't really a book actually,

503
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
 because there were only 50 numbers in it, because almost no one had a phone.

504
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,040
 But it said that users should begin chats with a firm and chery holler.

505
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:40,040
 And the advice for ending a call is to end the call by saying firmly that is all.

506
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 And I'm going to start doing it.

507
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,040
 Okay, love you, love you, that is all.

508
00:23:51,040 --> 00:24:00,040
 He did some weird experiments before the whole phone, seeing the phone idea.

509
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,040
 So he wants stolen ear off a corpse, and this is actually one of the most important things he did.

510
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,040
 He stole an ear off a corpse.

511
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
 He actually always makes you do it, I think.

512
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,040
 He stole an ear off a cadaver, and it was to create a phonograph.

513
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,040
 So he then linked this ear up to a stylus, like a recording stylus.

514
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:22,040
 And then he got it to inscribe lines in a glass plate, and he'd shout into this dead person's ear.

515
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,040
 Whoever that person was, and the stylus would sort of write what he was shouting.

516
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:33,040
 Or, you know, write with the vibrations, the waveforms that he was shouting, because it was using the bones of the ear to do that.

517
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,040
 And this was the thing he had in his house that he kept this dead guy's in.

518
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
 Wow, did it work?

519
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
 Yeah, it worked.

520
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
 Did it?

521
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
 I mean, the dead guy couldn't hear anything.

522
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,040
 What's it like on the other side?

523
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,040
 Oh, we've got to get the mouth back.

524
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,040
 Trim number two to the morgue.

525
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,040
 We're going to have to move on shortly to our next facts.

526
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,040
 Oh, some things on clever dogs.

527
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,040
 So there's an amazing book by John Bonderson, all about, like, really clever dogs.

528
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,040
 And he says that in the 1920s, Germany had a load of animal psychologists

529
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
 who thought that dogs were nearly as intelligent as humans.

530
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,040
 And Hitler believed this, Hitler believed it, and that he had these kind of schools

531
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,040
 where the dogs could go in and hopefully learn how to speak and communicate.

532
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,040
 I mean, he was Hitler, so he wasn't entirely saying we know that much.

533
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,040
 But he thought that they'd be able to communicate with the masters and become more effective soldiers.

534
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,040
 It was claimed, and I don't believe any of these things.

535
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,040
 I do believe the grammar, I think, that I don't think any of these are true.

536
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,040
 But it was claimed that they could write poetry.

537
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:49,040
 One apparently could reply mine furrow when asked who Hitler was.

538
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,040
 And another one mastered the alphabet using a different number of barks for each letter

539
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,040
 and announced that he would be voting for Hindenburg in the next election.

540
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
 Here's another weird thing.

541
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:07,040
 There's a place called Port Lim, which is near Folkston, and they have this beautiful zoo.

542
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,040
 And none of the baboons were responding to what they were saying every time they spoke to them.

543
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,040
 They just were like, well, that's not following that command.

544
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,040
 And it turns out it's because these baboons were from France.

545
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,040
 So the Port Lim, zoo people had to learn French in order to speak to the baboons

546
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
 with the commands that they were used to in a previous zoo.

547
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 I think that's lazy.

548
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,040
 If they're going to come here, they can bloody well learn all of them.

549
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,040
 Wow.

550
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,040
 Well, that answers one question I've always wanted to know the answer to.

551
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:46,040
 OK, it's time for back number three.

552
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
 And that is Andy.

553
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:57,040
 My fact is that to stop being eaten by predators, some crustaceans were disgusting tasting snails as backpacks.

554
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,040
 This is in the southern ocean around Antarctica.

555
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,040
 And there are these tiny little crustaceans like creatures they are called amphipods.

556
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,040
 And these guys are called hyperiola dillatata.

557
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
 I hope that's how it's pronounced.

558
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
 If you're one of these listening.

559
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,040
 Wow.

560
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
 And so scientists found them.

561
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
 And they found them over a number of decades.

562
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
 They've observed this.

563
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
 They've got these mollusks.

564
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
 They're these little creatures.

565
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,040
 They're called sea butterflies or sea angels sometimes.

566
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
 They're quite sweet little things.

567
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
 And they're clamped on their backs like a backpack.

568
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
 And they're being held in position.

569
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:37,040
 The amphipod is spending two pairs of legs just holding its backpack on.

570
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 So it's a big expenditure of energy to keep this thing on you.

571
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,040
 And it turns out that these little mollusks are eating chemicals.

572
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,040
 Or they have chemicals inside them which taste horrible to fish.

573
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
 And so the fish will approach an amphipod.

574
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,040
 And if it's got a snail backpack on, it will say, no, I know that tastes disgusting.

575
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
 I will not eat it.

576
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
 And they swim away.

577
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
 Yeah.

578
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
 And the amphipods are vives.

579
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,040
 And it's so bad for the little snails because usually when there's a partnership like that,

580
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
 usually they both slightly benefit.

581
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
 In this case, the snails actually trapped.

582
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,040
 And it starves while it's there, unfortunately.

583
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
 And it starves to death even.

584
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
 So yeah.

585
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
 Yeah, it's not all fun and games, Andy.

586
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
 That's the one.

587
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
 Those guys sea angels.

588
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
 They are quite cute little animals, aren't they?

589
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,040
 They get the name because their shape resembles a snow angel.

590
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
 You know, when you do that in the snow, that's really nice.

591
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,040
 And when they find, when two sea angels find each other and they want to have little baby sea angels,

592
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:42,040
 they stab each other with suckers to stick together, leaving scars on their bodies.

593
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,040
 So you can tell how many sexual partners a sea angel has had by the number of physical scars on their body,

594
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,040
 not just the mental scars that we laugh.

595
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,040
 So slouch aiming in their world is probably rife, I would imagine.

596
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,040
 Maybe.

597
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
 You can see how promiscuous someone is.

598
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:08,040
 I bet they have real feminist issues with that in the cross-station world.

599
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:14,040
 I don't know if we've mentioned before that they're not the only undersea creatures to create backpacks for themselves.

600
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,040
 So sponge crabs are called that because they wear sponges.

601
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
 They wear sea sponges.

602
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:29,040
 And it's for a similar reason for evading predators, so they wear them as hats, but they look so cool.

603
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,040
 What's on their back and shoulders is hat come rucksack.

604
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,040
 And it's a disguise, but also sponges release chemicals.

605
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,040
 And so it's often chemicals that protect them from predators because they taste gross or they poison them.

606
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,040
 And if you look them up, they look so weird because they often replace their hats if they find a better one.

607
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:54,040
 If there's like a more colorful, fun-looking sponge, then they will take that back back off and put the new one on.

608
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,040
 They'll take it back, they'll get a refund, they'll put the new sponge on.

609
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:05,040
 Yeah, and it's mainly to find the best fitting sponge, so they need to find a sponge that exactly fits the shape of their back.

610
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
 You do, actually.

611
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,040
 They're so creative with their defense mechanisms.

612
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,040
 When you read about it, I was reading one, this one's pretty exciting.

613
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:23,040
 This is a crustacean called the ostracod, and the ostracod does this thing where it doesn't use its defense mechanism until it's actually in the mouth of the predator.

614
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
 That's trying to kill it.

615
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,040
 Yeah, so wait for it.

616
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,040
 I'm really not sure about this.

617
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
 Wait for it.

618
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 So what happens is there's a cardinal fish which eat these particular crustaceans, the ostracod.

619
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,040
 So they eat them and they're in the mouth and they close up the mouth.

620
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
 They realize that they've been eaten.

621
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:49,040
 And so what these little crustaceans do is they shake up like crazy and they go by a luminescent.

622
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,040
 Now, the cardinal fish is transparent.

623
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,040
 So the one thing you don't want when you're in the deep is to be spotted by other predators by this huge light.

624
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 So suddenly from inside their body they were glowing orb and they immediately vomit up these little crustaceans who then swim away.

625
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,040
 And the cardinal fish swims the hell out of there because he doesn't want to be near any of the other predators.

626
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
 How amazing is that?

627
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
 That's so good.

628
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
 That's amazing.

629
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
 Yeah.

630
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,040
 It's only just this light bulbs lit up in them saying I'm food.

631
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,040
 It would be so cool to see your food after you're eating it inside you.

632
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,040
 But not if it's then going to attract something to make you food.

633
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
 No, no, no, no.

634
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
 But no, yeah, it would be cool.

635
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,040
 So salmon eat crustaceans.

636
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,040
 And it's because of that that they are the color they are.

637
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
 So salmon, wild salmon, a pink.

638
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,040
 And they are lots of different shades of pink and that's all about the crustaceans they eat.

639
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
 It's the same with flamingos.

640
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:54,040
 So some salmon will eat like lots and lots of a certain type of prawn, let's say, or a bit of krill.

641
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
 And that will make them very pink.

642
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,040
 So I think the Alaskan Sokai salmon is the reddest of all.

643
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
 Because it eats slightly different stuff.

644
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
 But farm salmon doesn't eat any of this.

645
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:14,040
 Because they're just fed like farming pellets of apparently ground up feathers and soybeans and chicken fat and weird stuff like that.

646
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,040
 But obviously people are used to seeing salmon being pink.

647
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,040
 So farm salmon that you buy would normally be gray.

648
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,040
 But the farmers add pigment to their food to make them the right color that people expect them to be.

649
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:31,040
 And they have a thing called a salmon fan, which was invented by a farm's youthful company.

650
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,040
 And it's basically the, what's the paint?

651
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,040
 It's like the paint range, but for salmon color.

652
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:44,040
 So if you're salmon farming, you go to the salmon fan and you pick the exact shade of pink that you want your salmon to be.

653
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
 And then they can send you the matching food for it.

654
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
 That's not good.

655
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
 It is amazing.

656
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
 You think everyone would just go for the same color, wouldn't they?

657
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:59,040
 But it depends if you want, if you want to be selling, you know, you're a lask and expensive salmon or some cheaper, more mass produced salmon.

658
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
 That is amazing.

659
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:06,040
 But apparently if salmon goes beyond a certain lightness, people just won't eat it at all regardless of what type it is.

660
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
 Because there it is.

661
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:15,040
 If any food that I expect to be a different color is gray, I will sniff it at least.

662
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,040
 Just on color and crustaceans.

663
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
 Do you know that the mentis shrimp?

664
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,040
 Do you know how many colors a mentis shrimp can see?

665
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,040
 Oh, so how many do you reckon we can see?

666
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
 Oh, lots.

667
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
 10,000.

668
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
 10,000.

669
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
 Okay.

670
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,040
 The mentis shrimp, I mean, that was just a complete guess.

671
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,040
 Yeah, I'd like to say more than that.

672
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
 I'll say 11,000.

673
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,040
 Okay, Anna, do you want to get in on this?

674
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
 I couldn't name all of them by the way.

675
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
 I don't want to be put on the spot later.

676
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,040
 Richard of your gave battle in vain, 7 in the rainbow, I think at 7.

677
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,040
 Okay, 7, 10,000, 11,000.

678
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:59,040
 So the mentis shrimp is able to perceive 100 septillion different types of color.

679
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
 That's 10 to the power 26.

680
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
 Wow.

681
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 I can name every single one of them.

682
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:12,040
 Just much of going to be in queue with that guy.

683
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
 Pretty crazy though.

684
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
 Oh, the nest there.

685
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,040
 You didn't say how many we can see.

686
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,040
 You know, that in fact means nothing to us.

687
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
 That's very cool.

688
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,040
 There's a kind of terrapod, which is the same as this little animal called a filefish,

689
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,040
 and they eat coral and live in coral, and they get the smell of the coral from the coral.

690
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,040
 And it stops predators from being able to find them because they smell like their house.

691
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 If you know anything, that's good.

692
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,040
 It's like if you ate nothing but onions, and you lived in a bag of onions.

693
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,040
 I would question the life choices that have brought me to this point.

694
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,040
 Also, are you going, "The onions haven't noticed me yet?"

695
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
 Who's spotting you there?

696
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
 No, it's the people who want to eat you.

697
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
 It's not that the coral wants to eat them, I don't think.

698
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:11,040
 But if you went to France, it would be a disaster because they'd love to eat you.

699
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,040
 I found the most bizarre thing about crustaceans, a certain type of crustacean, which is a crab.

700
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,040
 I found out a thing about crabs.

701
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
 I found that.

702
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,040
 So, Sartre, Jean-Paul Sartre, I'm sure you've all read his complete works.

703
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,040
 He took mescaline in 1929, so mescaline like a hallucinogenic drug.

704
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,040
 And he was, as a result of that, followed around by a team of crabs for years.

705
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
 The French have very strict rules about mescaline, don't they?

706
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,040
 They have a special crab police division, which they set to observing.

707
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
 They do.

708
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,040
 So, are you saying, which I think you are, that he thought he was being followed by crabs?

709
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
 He said, he gave an interview.

710
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,040
 I can't remember who he first gave the interview to, but he said he took mescaline.

711
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,040
 And he suddenly realized that there were just crabs all around him.

712
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
 And then the interviewer said, "What loads of them?"

713
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,040
 He said, "Yeah, well, like four or five."

714
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,040
 So, he just has four or five crabs, and they followed him everywhere.

715
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,040
 And he would say, when he was writing, sometimes he'd be able to get rid of them.

716
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,040
 But as soon as he got up to go anywhere, they'd follow him.

717
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
 So, he would go to university.

718
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,040
 He would give lectures, get up in the morning, and he'd walk, and they'd walk with him.

719
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
 And this was for years.

720
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,040
 And he said, how many seats would you like for the film, sir?

721
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,040
 Six.

722
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,040
 No, they could sit on each other's laps, I think.

723
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
 But yeah, he started talking to them.

724
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,040
 And he got really used to them. He would wake up every morning and say,

725
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,040
 "Good morning, my little ones. How did you sleep?"

726
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
 And...

727
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
 Did they talk back?

728
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
 Yeah, they chapsed it away.

729
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,040
 But then, when he went to class, he knew that it had to be quiet.

730
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,040
 So, he said, he used to tell them to be quiet in lectures.

731
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
 So, he could work.

732
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
 And they would be.

733
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,040
 But the lecture ended, and then they start chatting away again.

734
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
 Wow.

735
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
 And yeah, happened for years.

736
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
 He had some therapy in the end.

737
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,040
 They went away.

738
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,040
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

739
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
 And that is my fact.

740
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:19,040
 My fact this week is that there is a rock band made up entirely of NASA astronauts called MaxQ.

741
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:27,040
 The band has a constantly rotating lineup as they can't be sure that all members will be on Earth at the same time.

742
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 There's just so many of them.

743
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,040
 And it does extend beyond going up into space.

744
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
 Sometimes they're in training to go into space.

745
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
 Sometimes they're retired.

746
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,040
 Sometimes just doing other busy.

747
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,040
 But yeah, so this is a fact that I stumbled on.

748
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,040
 In fact, it was while we were researching the book this year.

749
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,040
 Because we have a fact about one of its members, one of MaxQ's members.

750
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
 And it's Andrew Foistel.

751
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,040
 And he was the captain of the International Space Station this year.

752
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
 And he's in the band.

753
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:06,040
 And the fact about him that's in the book is that NASA sent him up to space despite the fact that he has a fear of heights.

754
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,040
 But he admitted that it's fine once he gets to space, the fear of heights.

755
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
 It's the way up.

756
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
 And even ladders, he's just like, whoa.

757
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,040
 When you say NASA sent him up despite the fact, it sounds like they sort of forced him to go up.

758
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,040
 He was saying, no, please, really, I just want to be in the lab.

759
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,040
 Just keep going up the ladder. It'll be fine eventually.

760
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,040
 That's so weird. Because if I, you know, I don't really like spiders.

761
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,040
 But if you presented me with a spider the size of a house, I would like it even less.

762
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
 I wouldn't make my peace with it.

763
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
 Right.

764
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,040
 But if you were in space, it would look so tiny, you wouldn't even see it.

765
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
 And then that's...

766
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 That's not the same logic, is it?

767
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
 No, I've...

768
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,040
 He brought work on a bad analogy to start with.

769
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,040
 So people play music in space.

770
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
 Sometimes these guys are mostly on Earth, aren't they?

771
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
 These guys are on Earth.

772
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
 Yeah, yeah, this is, yeah, they're an Earth band.

773
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,040
 But people do play music in space. Chris Hadfield famously did it.

774
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,040
 There was an astronaut called Ellen Achoa, who plays the flute in space.

775
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,040
 But she has to keep her feet in the foot loops.

776
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,040
 Because even the tiny amount of blowing on the flute will move her around.

777
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
 Yeah.

778
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
 That is amazing, isn't it?

779
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,040
 What a great way to sort of exit a conversation, just...

780
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,040
 Well, that'd be awesome.

781
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
 I've fluted my way out of that.

782
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
 Yeah.

783
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
 Take that.

784
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,040
 You know, that's not what a flute looks like.

785
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
 What's a flute, look back?

786
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
 Did you do the clarinet?

787
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
 Oh, you did the flute sideways.

788
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
 Oh, you did the flute sideways.

789
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
 I'm going to float into you.

790
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,040
 Worst getaway ever.

791
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,040
 Do you know, they've had backpipes on the International Space Station.

792
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
 Wow.

793
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
 So there's a lot of instruments that have been there.

794
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
 I cannot think of something...

795
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
 You're in a very confined space.

796
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
 Oh.

797
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,040
 I cannot imagine that being good for everyone's mental health.

798
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
 Yeah.

799
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
 Do you want to hear something even worse?

800
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,040
 Ages ago, instead of, you know, an instrument being played,

801
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
 in order to get the astronauts to calm down,

802
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 they would play in the International Space Station just to calm them.

803
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
 You know, elevator music?

804
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
 That used to just be played.

805
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
 Wow.

806
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
 Yeah.

807
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
 Can you imagine being stuck in an elevator?

808
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
 That's what it would have been like.

809
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
 They still play the music sometimes.

810
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,040
 So the music that wakes them up in the morning is picked by the capsule communicator,

811
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,040
 also known as the Capcom, who is an astronaut who's on the ground.

812
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,040
 So they don't have responsibility for the music that they pick.

813
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
 Wow.

814
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
 What?

815
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
 To wake people up.

816
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
 Surely.

817
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
 I think they do pick things they like.

818
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
 Yeah.

819
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
 And they do.

820
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
 They ask, you know, if it's going to be a poor McCartney song,

821
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
 they might ask poor McCartney to record a, you know,

822
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
 "Hello, wake up. You're in space."

823
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
 And then they wake up and...

824
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,040
 That was good.

825
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
 Yeah.

826
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,040
 And it would be songs sometimes relevant to certain missions.

827
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,040
 So when Chris Fatt had fielded, had to do his first spacewalk.

828
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
 He was the first Canadian, I believe, to do that.

829
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
 His wife was able to pick that morning's song.

830
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 And she picked a song that was dear to him.

831
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 And the lyrics suggested going out into the frontiers.

832
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
 And so it's quite a cool tradition.

833
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,040
 Yeah.

834
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
 Voice still actually started on another band while he was in space.

835
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
 So Max Q, he had on Earth.

836
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
 And up in space, he had Astro Hawaii.

837
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
 That was the name of the band.

838
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,040
 And it had five of the ISS' astronauts, as well as cosmonauts.

839
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,040
 And so the instruments included two guitars, two flutes,

840
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,040
 which I now know what that is.

841
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,040
 And an improvised drum, which was played using the metallic unit

842
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,040
 that usually stores Russian cosmonauts' feces.

843
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
 So that was there.

844
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
 Nice.

845
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
 That was their drum.

846
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
 They've had so many, oh, in space.

847
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
 They're all kind of music lovers, aren't they?

848
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
 Yeah.

849
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
 Even from, like, really early flight, so in 1965,

850
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,040
 it was a classic, you know, back before NASA started clamping down

851
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
 on smuggling stuff into space.

852
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
 Everyone just took loads of shit up there.

853
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,040
 And Walter Shira, Jr., and Thomas Stafford,

854
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
 snuck bells and a harmonica up there.

855
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
 And they'd practice what they were going to do before.

856
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
 So they'd met together for secret rehearsals.

857
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
 And they thought, well, we'll prank ground control on the way down.

858
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
 And tell them that we can hear something weird,

859
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
 and then crack him to song.

860
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
 [LAUGHTER]

861
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
 And they did it.

862
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,040
 And I just never know where they're hiding these things.

863
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,040
 Well, surely some-- You can hide them harmonica very easily.

864
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
 No, you could.

865
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,040
 Is it where I think, like, every time you farted, they'd notice.

866
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,040
 [LAUGHTER]

867
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:24,040
 They-- yeah, it is a big part of their culture, apparently.

868
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,040
 To the point where there's an inside thing that has said

869
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,040
 that whenever astronauts are being interviewed,

870
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
 potential astronauts are being interviewed by NASA,

871
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,040
 one of the questions that comes up is,

872
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
 do you play a musical instrument?

873
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
 It's that much of a thing.

874
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,040
 Does it affect your chances of getting in?

875
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,040
 Yeah.

876
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
 No, no, no.

877
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
 I said it does.

878
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
 It's just like, yes, the organ.

879
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
 And I'd love one up there.

880
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 Exactly.

881
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,040
 Well, we'll give you a call if anything opens up.

882
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
 It's not like Buzz Alder.

883
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
 We would have let you go on first.

884
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
 But Neil plays the banjo.

885
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,040
 He's just more qualified to step out first.

886
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,040
 But it's quite a nice story about how Max Q came about

887
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,040
 to begin with, because the ban was set up

888
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
 after the disaster of the challenger,

889
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 when the challenger rocket exploded on the way to space.

890
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,040
 And actually, there was an astronaut on board

891
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,040
 who was going to be the first person to record music up in space

892
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
 for an album.

893
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
 So he was on board the challenger,

894
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
 and he had his saxophone with him.

895
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
 And that obviously exploded.

896
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
 So, unfortunately, that never happened.

897
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,040
 And so, what they ended up deciding to do was,

898
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
 why didn't they throw a big fun day to get morale up

899
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,040
 and throw a big party and they'll have acts come on stage

900
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
 and they'll do stuff.

901
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
 And Max Q was formed in that moment.

902
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
 I was looking at what some other things

903
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,040
 that astronauts do to relax.

904
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
 So, here's one thing that they do.

905
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
 They play Scrabble.

906
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,040
 But obviously they travel Scrabble, right?

907
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
 Well, they're in a microgravity environment.

908
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,040
 So, they have Velcroed onto the back of every single piece.

909
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
 A tiny patch.

910
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
 A tiny patch of Velcro on.

911
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,040
 And the board is attached to the ceiling in the dining room.

912
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,040
 So, you can just look up while you eat and ponder your next move.

913
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
 With the microgravity thing,

914
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,040
 I was really interviewed with Samantha Christopher Rattie,

915
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,040
 who broke the record for the longest time a woman has spent in space

916
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
 a few years ago.

917
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
 It was 200 days.

918
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
 And she was talking about when you come back

919
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,040
 after being in a zero gravity environment and how it feels.

920
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,040
 And she did say, I step out of the module

921
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
 and it feels like there's some kind of evil giant

922
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,040
 trying to press me into the ground.

923
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,040
 And for weeks and weeks, you're like that.

924
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,040
 And I think it took her a couple of years to get back to normal.

925
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,040
 And she said, walking is like lifting tree trunks.

926
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,800
 But also, you have trouble speaking, because your tongue is so used to being weightless,

927
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,760
 that lifting it up off the bottom of your mouth is too much effort.

928
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,760
 So you just say, errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

929
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,960
 There's a lot, yeah, there's a lot of things they have to read accustomed to when they come back down.

930
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:53,600
 So, a lot of astronauts who return are known to just drop their cup of tea in the air.

931
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,080
 Just have it, yeah, just have it smash everywhere.

932
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,600
 You've been to a real asshole in space, Frank.

933
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,920
 You mentioned the moon astronauts, the Apollo 11 astronauts.

934
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,520
 Yeah. When they got back, I didn't realise they filled in a custom declaration form.

935
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,080
 Yes.

936
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,920
 Yeah, it's so great, when you look at it, it's basically, it's a custom declaration that lists the origin and the destination.

937
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,720
 So the origin is Cape Kennedy, the destination was Honolulu, which they actually missed by a few hundred miles,

938
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,240
 but not important. And then it has to list a stop-off. So it says stop-off moon.

939
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:35,760
 And it's just so great on this like normal little bit of paper, Honolulu, get going to eat moon.

940
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,120
 And then it says anything to declare, you know, you've got to declare anything you're carrying.

941
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,720
 And they've just had to write moon, rock, and moon dust samples.

942
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,440
 Oh, and these crabs that we found up there.

943
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,720
 I'm sorry. Was, was that a harmonica I just heard?

944
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:00,960
 I find this amazing about when you're in the ISS.

945
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,040
 So you're always kind of your weightless and you're always pushing yourself off things.

946
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,200
 But one of the rooms is so big that sometimes you can get stuck in the middle of the room.

947
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,280
 Oh, my God, you've got nothing to push out of you.

948
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,960
 Oh, you're just like, basically, you're right, waiting for someone to get you.

949
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,200
 Oh, you kind of, I guess you could blow your way.

950
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,280
 You could have emergency flute on you at all times.

951
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:31,360
 So what you were saying about playing the flute and having to rip your feet under,

952
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,160
 one of the harder instruments to play is the keyboard.

953
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,320
 Because every time you press one of the keys, you push the instrument away from you.

954
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,920
 So often when they're playing it, if they haven't got a proper grip,

955
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,480
 they just have to chase the keyboard as they're, as they're playing their song.

956
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,240
 Another thing they do to kind of wind down, they do a lot of this exercise.

957
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,400
 Because you need to keep your muscles okay, because otherwise, the atrophy,

958
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,360
 the atrophy, sorry.

959
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,040
 But the problem is if you're doing your exercise and you're sweating,

960
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,040
 the sweat hangs around your body because it's got nowhere to go.

961
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,800
 There's no gravity pulling it down.

962
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,520
 And you could end up with a big blob of sweat around there.

963
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,600
 And if you move your head really quickly,

964
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,480
 the sweat blob just slowly moves in space.

965
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,640
 And then it could smash your friend in the face, a big, like a water balloon of sweat.

966
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,680
 That's awesome.

967
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,560
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

968
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:32,400
 Some stuff on bands and concerts and stuff like that in unusual places.

969
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,440
 The Institute Marquez had a concert quite recently featuring Alex Ubego and Sharon Call from the Cause.

970
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,800
 And they had the youngest ever audience because it was a live concert for embryos.

971
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,040
 What?

972
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,320
 Yeah, apparently it helps the development of the embryos if they're getting lots of music,

973
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,000
 according to Sharon Call from the Cause.

974
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,840
 I'm sorry.

975
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,000
 And who am I to doubt Sharon Call from the Cause?

976
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,960
 How do they applaud?

977
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
 [laughter]

978
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,200
 Wait, are they in...

979
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,000
 Wums?

980
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,960
 Uh, no, they're not there in the lab.

981
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,760
 They're fricking there.

982
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
 Yeah, it's in vitro stuff.

983
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,120
 Oh, cool.

984
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,520
 That's a weird gik.

985
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,520
 It had to be weird.

986
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,960
 I'm saying it on the podcast.

987
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,840
 I'm not going to say, "Hey, the Cause was did a gig in Dublin."

988
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,360
 To a load of normal humans.

989
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,480
 But it's just...

990
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,520
 No, you're right, though.

991
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,120
 It's sort of like, "How so since the Cause broke up, how's your solo career going?"

992
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,520
 Actually, some exciting gigs coming up.

993
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,120
 I'm playing to unborn embryos.

994
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,000
 Actually, that is exciting when you think about it.

995
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,320
 I did find one space band thing.

996
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,440
 So this was in 2010.

997
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,000
 It was a London synth pop band called Monarchy.

998
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,640
 And they announced that they were going to play their debut gig,

999
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,000
 their debut gig in Cape Canaveral and beam it into space.

1000
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,800
 And the Guardian reported on it.

1001
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,800
 They said all that really means is sending a signal out of the atmosphere

1002
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,960
 without it being bounced back by a satellite.

1003
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,240
 So because they weren't allowed into the actual NASA site.

1004
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,840
 So the Guardian reported that it was not interstellar communication.

1005
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,160
 It was simply a gig broadcast to no one.

1006
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,080
 Not long after, Monarchy were dropped by Mercury Records

1007
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,000
 before their album had been released.

1008
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,920
 Can I just say my fact that I really like and it's about,

1009
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,720
 you know, people, unexpected people being in bands.

1010
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,320
 So people you don't expect to be in bands.

1011
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
 And I know it's a favorite fact of someone in the audience

1012
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,520
 who's our colleague, James, other James.

1013
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,600
 We call him, which is good for his ego.

1014
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,560
 James Rosson, yeah, this is James Rosson.

1015
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,320
 McCauley Culkin plays in a band, played in a band.

1016
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
 And it's called the Pizza Underground.

1017
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,520
 And what they do is they do covers of Velvet Underground.

1018
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,360
 But instead of the Velvet Underground lyrics,

1019
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,560
 they're all about pizza.

1020
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,760
 And I was reading about the inspiration for it.

1021
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,800
 And the Glock player in the band explained that...

1022
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,240
 Is that Glock a kind of pistol?

1023
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,280
 It's a very, very, very dangerous gig to attend.

1024
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,920
 The Glock player in the band, she explained that

1025
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,920
 actually all of Velvet Underground songs were originally written about pizza.

1026
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,120
 But they had to be re-worded to accommodate the standards of their day.

1027
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,360
 And so McCauley Culkin, is there writing that wrong?

1028
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,640
 That is amazing.

1029
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,320
 These NASA people, they need all of their people to be on earth

1030
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,760
 otherwise they can't do a gig.

1031
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,480
 So I thought I'd look at a few reasons that people couldn't do gigs.

1032
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:40,960
 Oh, yeah.

1033
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,800
 Neil Jung once had to cancel an entire tour

1034
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,280
 after cutting this finger while making a ham sandwich.

1035
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,040
 And the Kings of Leon abandoned a show halfway through in July 2010

1036
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,160
 after pigeons began shitting in Jared's mouth.

1037
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
 [laughter]

1038
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,760
 I'm with the pigeons.

1039
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,440
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

1040
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
 Thank you so much for listening.

1041
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,560

 You can go to our website.

1052
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,800
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1053
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,160
 We have everything up there linked to this book that everyone in the audience has.

1054
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,040
 You don't need that anymore.

1055
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,000
 We have future tour dates.

1056
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 And we have all of our previous episodes.

1057
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 And just quickly, we are now going to give away a book

1058
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,520
 to the best fact of our audience here tonight.

1059
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,600
 This fact is from Daniel Simon.

1060
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,520
 Are you all okay?

1061
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,200
 Hey, Daniel.

1062
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,000
 And the fact is this.

1063
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,360
 In 2015, France called on its allies for more help in Marley.

1064
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,600
 Luxembourg agreed to double their military presence in the country

1065
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
 and promptly added one more soldier.

1066
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:13,680
 And okay, we'll be back again next week with more facts.

1067
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,320
 We'll see you then.

1068
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,280
 Goodbye.

1069
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,280
 [Applause]

1070
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:27,280
