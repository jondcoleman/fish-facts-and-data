00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:10,700
 Very quickly, just to remind you, we are going on tour in the very, very near future.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:18,220
 So if you are in Edinburgh, Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London or Manchester,

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,120
 we are coming to your city.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,060
 We'll then be going off to Australia and New Zealand, almost all of those tickets are

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,060
 sold out.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,240
 If you are in the UK or Ireland, then do get your tickets as soon as you possibly can.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
 It's going to be a whole load of fun.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,920
 We're going to do a podcast.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360
 It's going to be an all new podcast every night, but then there's also going to be loads

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,240
 of extra fun stuff happening, which you would never get if you only listened to this free

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,640
 podcast.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,520
 And the hope is that we'll be there afterwards to say hi to everyone and sign whatever you

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,560
 want signing and take lots of selfies, because actually one of the main fun bits about doing

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,760
 these shows is getting to meet you guys.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,820
 So we can't wait to be on tour and we hope that lots of you come to join us to find out

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,820
 more about that.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,180
 And to get your tickets, go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live where you can get links to all of the

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,180
 venues.

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,340
 Okay, not much more to say, apart from buy mine and Anna's book, buy Dan's book, buy

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,700
 Andy's book, you know our names.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,540
 Just go on to your bookselling place of choice and type them in and you'll find all the very

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,200
 lovingly made books by the four of us that are just right for you to buy and read over

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
 your summer holidays.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,120
 But that's enough selling.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,160
 Back to our bread and butter, the four of us doing our thing in the QI offices in Holborn.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,040
 Really hope you enjoy the show and hopefully see lots of you on our tour.

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
 Okay, on with the podcast.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:59,820
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,180
 to you from the QI offices in Holborn.

31
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,180
 My name is Dan Shriver.

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,540
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,520
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,480
 seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

35
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,200
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:26,280
 Okay, my fact this week is that if you like kimchi, you're a victim of government propaganda.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
 So does anyone here like kimchi?

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
 Yeah.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
 No.

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
 What?

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,320
 Well, you know, I don't know what kind of like weird political messages I'm propounding,

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,000
 although I quite like South Korea, they're not doing too bad these days.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,100
 Do you like BTS?

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,620
 Do you watch Squid Game?

45
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,120
 Did you enjoy Parasite at the movies?

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,360
 I don't know what BTS is, but the other two things I did.

47
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
 Wow.

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,480
 Did you dance to Gangnam Style when it came out all those years ago?

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,780
 All these things are part of How You, which is a South Korean government promoted push

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,500
 of the country's culture.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,100
 And this is all about diplomatic cultural exchanges between countries.

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,820
 And at the moment, Korea are especially good at it.

53
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
 Yeah.

54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
 So what are they doing?

55
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,640
 Are they sort of responsible for kimchi advertising worldwide and stuff or getting in front of

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
 me?

57
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
 Absolutely.

58
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,440
 So they might pay TV broadcasters in Europe or in the U.S. to have documentaries about

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
 Korean dishes.

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,000
 They might get newspapers to write about Korean dishes.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,360
 They might provide assistance to restaurants that are going to have Korean food on the

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 menus.

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,120
 This is crazy because I'm obsessed with bibimbap.

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
 Oh, yeah.

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
 Yeah.

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
 I love it.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
 Same.

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 Yeah.

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,180
 Well, that's why, because they started this around 1996.

70
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
 That's perfect timing.

71
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,400
 The timing matches up by day.

72
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,300
 So what had happened was Korea had had a problem economically.

73
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,820
 There was a big crash around the mid-90s and the government had to ask the IMF for an

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,660
 emergency loan and it was a big embarrassment to the whole country.

75
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,500
 And around the same time, Japan was making its own kimchi and they were selling that around

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,800
 the world, much to the chagran of the South Koreans because the only good kimchi comes

77
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,200
 from South Korea and they put those two things together and a couple of presidents decided

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,520
 that they were going to rebrand the nation.

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,680
 I completely understand that.

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
 Yeah.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 I mean, countries do it all the time.

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,440
 I can also see who the propagandists worked on.

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,080
 They don't make good kimchi in the world.

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,520
 Imagine if France started making pork pies.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 I'd be furious.

86
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
 Would you?

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
 Yeah.

88
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,040
 And then you went and you travelled to China and they were like, "Oh, have you heard about

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
 the French pork pies?"

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,780
 The French Milton Mubri.

91
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,580
 I would feel patriotic suddenly.

92
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
 Yeah.

93
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,840
 So South Korean kimchi, it's all this particular kind of cabbage, isn't it called a napa cabbage?

94
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
 Yeah.

95
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 So I should quickly say what kimchi is.

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
 It is a fermented vegetable and fish relish.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,820
 You kind of get loads of vegetables and fish paste and stuff like that.

98
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,720
 You put it in a big bundle of cabbage and then you put it in brine and you leave it to ferment

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
 and then it becomes, to some people, delicious, I personally can't stand it.

100
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
 Really?

101
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,680
 I have a problem with fermented food in general.

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
 Interesting.

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
 I don't know why.

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,760
 It's the national dish of North and South Korea.

105
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,120
 There are 2 million tons of it eaten in the South alone every year.

106
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,120
 Over 60% of people in South Korea eat kimchi at three meals a day.

107
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
 It's a lot.

108
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
 Yeah.

109
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,440
 And even this is, I love this, there's a ritual, a traditional thing where every autumn

110
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
 families make their own kimchi, right?

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,880
 And I think it's called Kimjang.

112
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
 Yeah.

113
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,400
 And it's a sort of, it's a traditional thing, obviously not everyone does it.

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
 Some people just get this from the supermarket.

115
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,920
 But Samsung, the electronics giant, make special kimchi fridges and thousands of people in

116
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,160
 South Korea have a fridge that's just for the kimchi.

117
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
 I don't think thousands.

118
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,800
 I think it's 98% of the population.

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
 Yeah, it's everyone.

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
 It's literally everyone in South Korea.

121
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 Yeah, thousands.

122
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 I just mean many thousands.

123
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 You're not specifying.

124
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
 Thousands.

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
 Thousands of thousands.

126
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 It's stunning.

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,920
 And there's supposedly, it feels like a massive swizz to me because all those special kimchi

128
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,320
 features are things like it stays the same temperature.

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,320
 No, no, it is important because most your fridge at home is going to be around three

130
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,640
 or four degrees.

131
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,320
 But if you put kimchi in that fridge, it'll go off in a few days.

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
 Yeah.

133
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 It needs to be colder.

134
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
 It needs to be colder.

135
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
 And then it needs to be less airflow going around.

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
 Yeah, I love that.

137
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
 It's got less moving air.

138
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
 No, no, it needs to be warmer than a freezer.

139
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,600
 No, I can't think of a single temperature warmer than freezing.

140
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,760
 Let me tell you one degree, which is the exact temperature.

141
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,800
 Because the traditional way to keep it is you'd bury it outside.

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,760
 So you'd make it in the autumn, you'd bury it outside and during the winter it would

143
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
 stay at one degree.

144
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,000
 Do you think there's lots of buried kimchi still in South Korea?

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
 Is it like squirrels, do you reckon?

146
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 Oh, there must be.

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 And there's just, they can never find it again.

148
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,960
 Kimchi pirates just going around trying to find the lost buried treasure.

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
 Yeah.

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 Mr Kim.

151
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,600
 Let you open it and it is just rotten fish and vegetables.

152
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
 Is it the thing that it never goes off?

153
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
 If it's at the right.

154
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 I will.

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
 It can't.

156
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
 It's fermented.

157
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,720
 Not many more months, but I think it would eventually go off.

158
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,240
 Can I tell you a kimchi saying?

159
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
 Yeah, please.

160
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,840
 Don't drink kimchi soup thinking that someone will give you rice cake.

161
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,280
 Translation, translation please.

162
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
 Don't do that.

163
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,680
 So it's don't do something, expecting something else will happen.

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
 So it's like look before you leap.

165
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,880
 Oh, that's quite good.

166
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,120
 Say one more time.

167
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,560
 Don't drink kimchi soup thinking that someone will give you rice cake.

168
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,800
 Or is it just literal?

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,640
 It's just, this is bad etiquette.

170
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,040
 No, there's a pretty exact analogy actually.

171
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,840
 Is there a reason you'd want rice cake after kimchi soup?

172
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,760
 It comes next in the traditional form of the meal.

173
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
 Right.

174
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,920
 That is what you would expect.

175
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,000
 So don't do phase one of a process, assuming someone's going to help you out with the next

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 bit.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Right.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So what's the British phrase that...

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Is it not that?

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
 That's a very common phrase one.

181
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,520
 It's like my old grandma used to say, don't do phase one of a process.

182
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,160
 It's just don't count your chickens, you know, don't assume, it's not guaranteed that you'll

183
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
 get rice cake, just because you're going to kimchi soup, but in that case it sort of is

184
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
 guaranteed because you're having a traditional Korean meal.

185
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
 Yeah, I don't think that is quite exactly the same, is it?

186
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,640
 Why are you not counting your chickens?

187
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,760
 Don't count your chickens, yeah.

188
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,320
 So it's like if you have ten eggs, don't think that's definitely going to be ten chickens

189
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,240
 because one of them might not turn into a chicken.

190
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
 Okay, cool.

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,480
 I feel like that phrase needs a little caveat at the top that says, prior to hatching,

192
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
 don't count your chickens.

193
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 Oh, he didn't do the full saying.

194
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,280
 The full saying is don't count your chickens before they've hatched.

195
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
 Oh, right.

196
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,800
 Dad, you've never heard this saying.

197
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 No.

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,960
 You've never heard don't count your chickens.

199
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
 That's stunning.

200
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
 I've heard that bit of it, weirdly.

201
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
 You've heard don't count your chickens, yeah.

202
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,960
 That's just as everyone knows the second bit.

203
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,360
 What did you think it meant when you just heard don't count your chickens?

204
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
 It's bad luck to count chickens.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
 So we went to the petting zoo today.

206
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,960
 Oh, how many chickens were there?

207
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,000
 Well, you know what they say.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
 That's so weird.

209
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,600
 Only 7% of kimchi in Korea is commercially produced as in that you buy it in shops.

210
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 Wow.

211
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 7%.

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
 And the rest is sort of artisan.

213
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 The rest is homemade.

214
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
 Really?

215
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
 Yeah.

216
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
 And it's part of this festival that one of you mentioned.

217
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
 Yeah.

218
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 Yeah.

219
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,960
 And you mentioned basically at one time a year, everyone just makes kimchi.

220
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
 And it's like.

221
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
 It lasts the year, right?

222
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
 It lasts the year.

223
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
 Yeah.

224
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,040
 And it's huge because it's like everyone does it at the same time because it's like

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
 kimchi season.

226
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
 Yeah.

227
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
 Yeah.

228
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
 So one has to buy cabbage at the same time.

229
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
 So the price of cabbage goes through the roof.

230
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
 Every year.

231
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
 It's harvest time, I guess.

232
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
 Yeah.

233
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
 And then you buy it.

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,640
 But it's always in the news at this time every year saying don't forget to get your

235
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,000
 cabbage before it's don't count your cabbages.

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,040
 That's so cool.

237
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,840
 Apparently at the moment there's a bit of a worrying time for kimchi in South Korea because

238
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,080
 they're actually importing more kimchi now than they are exporting.

239
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
 They are.

240
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,880
 It's the world has woken up to it.

241
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,560
 China particularly has woken up to it.

242
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,020
 And so if you buy kimchi in a market, let's say in the UK, it's probably more likely from

243
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,880
 China these days than it is from South Korea.

244
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,480
 But the Chinese say it's fine because actually they invented it.

245
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,800
 I think they sort of claimed that a similar Chinese pickled cabbage fell under the bracket

246
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 of kimchi.

247
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 I know.

248
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,480
 But it's like saying, oh, our pork roll is actually a pork pie.

249
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 Yeah.

250
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
 Exactly.

251
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 It's like saying that, isn't it?

252
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 It's rubbish.

253
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
 A fermenting, huge deal.

254
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
 At the moment, very trendy.

255
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
 Yeah.

256
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,400
 And I think it's the answer to all our health problems.

257
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,760
 And I am so looking forward to in 10 years' time when everyone realizes that was complete

258
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
 bullshit.

259
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
 No.

260
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
 We're all going to live forever because of that.

261
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
 Because of the microbiome.

262
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
 Suddenly diversifying.

263
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,520
 But it's good for you, isn't it?

264
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,280
 I'm sure it is good for you.

265
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,720
 It is obviously really drummed into us how good for you it is.

266
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
 And it is such an interesting process.

267
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,200
 So I didn't quite realize that the only reason fermenting happens is because it's dead.

268
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,360
 So the bacteria that eat the cabbage or anything that ferments, the cabbage is spending its whole

269
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,400
 life fighting them off, and it's just as soon as you chop it, they can suddenly go for it.

270
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 That's great.

271
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,840
 And then it can't just be any fermenting.

272
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,480
 I think this is why you add salt to it.

273
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
 You can't just let any bacteria eat it.

274
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 Because that's just rotting, right?

275
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
 It's just rot.

276
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
 Yeah.

277
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
 Yeah.

278
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
 Don't just leave cabbage out and wait for it to...

279
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
 I'm always a bit confused about what is fermenting and what is rotting.

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,600
 I thought fermentation involves the particular, is something to do with the brine and the salt

281
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
 and the, I mean that.

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
 It is.

283
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 But I agree.

284
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
 I didn't know either.

285
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,400
 It used to be it's just about the type of bacteria that are doing it, and as long as

286
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,760
 you use the salt, so you sort of feed the right type of bacteria, they turn it, they

287
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 ferment it properly.

288
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,880
 But the thing is, like, there are lots of types of bacteria that do this, and I don't want

289
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,720
 to get all antibacterial and pro-bacterial phage like I always do.

290
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,040
 But there are some bacterias that do do fermentation that are really bad for you.

291
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,520
 And so sometimes people who do like homemade fermentation, like where you're making your

292
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,400
 sourdough, or you're making homemade kimchi, or artisan cheeses, or whatever, any kind

293
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,520
 of stuff like that, if you get the wrong kind of bacteria, it can make you sick.

294
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,280
 And most people who would be fine, like, for the four of us around here would probably

295
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,520
 be fine, but, you know, if you have underlying health issues, it can be a problem.

296
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
 Yeah, yeah, of course.

297
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 Right.

298
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 I didn't even consider that.

299
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,480
 I really like it with this fact, is it's basically what's known as gastrodiplomacy as well, right?

300
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,040
 Because they're using food in order to spread culture around the world.

301
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,840
 And this started, there was in the early 2000s, Thailand really were leading the way with

302
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
 this.

303
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
 Oh, yeah.

304
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,960
 There was this thing with people going, why are there so many Thai restaurants in America?

305
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,400
 We don't have that bigger population of Thai people here.

306
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,440
 It doesn't make sense.

307
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
 And that's what it was.

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,160
 It was a government program where you were able to get a loan for millions of dollars

309
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,920
 from Thailand if you were going to open a restaurant over in America.

310
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,280
 And you had different packages, so there were different styles of Thai restaurants that you

311
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
 could set up.

312
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,320
 The sort of more McDonald's-like fast food, Chaney one, which was just not that good food,

313
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,800
 all the way up to the high-end Thai, which, you know, golden leaf kind of thing.

314
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,960
 And all the arts that you might see in those places might have been created by government

315
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
 propaganda people who wanted to just push.

316
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
 It's so weird.

317
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 It's so interesting.

318
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,120
 I think we said before that they invented Pad Thai for that reason.

319
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
 Yeah.

320
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
 Right, yeah.

321
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,960
 I think it is like a really important thing and not to get too political, but our government

322
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,280
 slash our government until last week, we'll see what happens.

323
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,720
 Like the idea of them kind of taking money away from cultural stuff, which is what has

324
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,480
 happened over the last 10 years or so, is such an own goal.

325
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,760
 Because Britain has, over the last century or so, had so much soft diplomacy through,

326
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,800
 be it the Spice Girls, or be it like Downton Abbey, or...

327
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,320
 They were there to promote pepper and cream, isn't it?

328
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 Yeah.

329
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
 The original draft of the Spice Girls.

330
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,440
 It was before then we had the opium girls, of course.

331
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:40,880
 But yeah, to take away money and to make the BBC World Service and stuff, lose money and

332
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
 all that kind of stuff.

333
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 No, it's true.

334
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
 It is nonsense.

335
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
 Are you just trying to get government funding for the podcast, James?

336
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,840
 Well, we are a cultural jewel in the crown of the nation, I would say, but there's so

337
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
 many countries to it.

338
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
 It's really...

339
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,280
 It's not just the Thai government, the USA.

340
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,040
 They have the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership, and they have the American Chef Corps who

341
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,000
 were recruited, teach you to flip burgers.

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 What is that?

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,120
 So, in fact, that's almost the opposite of it, because it was specifically sort of...

344
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,040
 It's more than just burgers and hot dogs guys, and it was about all the great American cuisine

345
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,120
 that there is, and all the different kinds of American cuisine.

346
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,800
 I've got to be honest, they're very good in a lot of ways at propaganda, but that element

347
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
 hasn't worked on me so far.

348
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
 Fair enough.

349
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,480
 But you would get a special jacket with an American flag and your name embroidered in

350
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,240
 gold if you were part of the Chef Corps, and you would travel around the world cooking

351
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,760
 for foreign diplomats, traveling abroad, you know, it was a sort of crack unit of chefs,

352
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,520
 and they did some sort of Native American cooking or different from all the different

353
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
 parts of it.

354
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
 Grits.

355
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,840
 Probably some burgers as well.

356
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
 Grits.

357
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
 Grits.

358
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
 Yeah.

359
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,560
 Movie industries are often used as sort of that kind of soft diplomacy, and in fact,

360
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
 there are kimchi westerns.

361
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
 No, like spaghetti westerns.

362
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
 Exactly that.

363
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
 What really?

364
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
 Kimchi...

365
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,440
 So, the spaghetti western was a western filmed in Italy, right, because it matched broadly

366
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
 like the American western.

367
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,840
 It was usually filmed in Spain, made by Italian directors.

368
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
 Is it?

369
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 Yeah.

370
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,360
 So, is this a western that's filmed in Korea?

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
 It's just what you think.

372
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,760
 Yeah, it was a specific decision by the Korean government in the 2000s.

373
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,160
 The film industry was going quite badly.

374
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,920
 I think Hollywood was swamping all of their homemade films, so they thought let's make

375
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,880
 our own westerns, and they'll be called kimchi westerns, and the first one was called The

376
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,360
 Good, The Bad and The Weird, drawing very slightly on American traditions.

377
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,760
 Is it a proper like western cowboy plot?

378
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
 Absolutely, yeah.

379
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,440
 So, it seems very much based on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, you know.

380
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,240
 There are three protagonists who are after the same treasure, who are all sort of after

381
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
 each other.

382
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,640
 Is it buried kimchi?

383
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,440
 That film is actually sequel 2, for a fridge full of kimchi, that's based on for a fistful

384
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
 of dollars.

385
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 Yeah, yeah.

386
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,920
 Dan was looking in very much a don't count your chickens play.

387
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,720
 That's why I've been silent for the last 10 minutes, because I've been trying to think

388
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,560
 of a South Korean western title, and I couldn't think of one, and I'd argue you didn't really

389
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
 do either.

390
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:09,040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

391
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,200
 My fact is, there is an entire railway tunnel in Derbyshire, which was constructed so the

392
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,560
 railway could be hidden from the Duke of Rutland.

393
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,760
 No one wanted him to get on the railway?

394
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,640
 He never paid, despite being very rich, he's a fair dodger.

395
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,360
 So this comes from a great website called peakrail.co.uk, which is about the Peak District

396
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,560
 Railways, not about, like, this is Peak Rail.

397
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,760
 And it's about the Duke of Rutland, who, there is still a Duke of Rutland, I believe, it's

398
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,440
 a, you know, like in the way there always is, there's always another one.

399
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,440
 And he was a big old landowner, this is the middle of the 19th century, and it was when

400
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
 the railways were going gangbusters across the whole UK, hundreds of railway companies

401
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,760
 were springing up, building lines, going out of business, consolidating, it was just a

402
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,080
 railway fever had gripped Britain, it was a great time, I wish I'd been there.

403
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,960
 And the Duke of Point Blank refused a railway to go across his estate, you know, not through

404
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,680
 his house or anything, just across some of the many, many acres he owned, and the rail

405
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,960
 company had to go underground.

406
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,720
 And there's a long tunnel, it's about a thousand yards long, really is quite a big railway

407
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,800
 tunnel, and it's 12 feet deep, because they just needed to hide it very slightly from

408
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
 the Duke.

409
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,160
 You could do a cutting, couldn't you?

410
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,960
 They could have done a cutting, which is basically a sort of V-shaped trench, and you just have

411
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
 it going along that.

412
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
 That would have preserved the view.

413
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
 Like a ha-ha.

414
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,640
 Like a ha-ha, exactly.

415
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,400
 But the Duke apparently did not want to see smoke and steam rising above his gardens,

416
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,800
 so they had to just cover over, that is a thing called cut and cover, where you dig a

417
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,640
 little bit and you cover it back over.

418
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,400
 So it's the most pointless railway tunnel, it was probably really expensive, and it's

419
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 all for the Duke of Rutland.

420
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,980
 And they don't use it anymore, right?

421
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,880
 It's like, it's out of, yeah, they don't use it anymore.

422
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,560
 Did it get beaching in the 60s?

423
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,120
 Oh, as in Mr. Beaching, I can't recall actually whether it was part of that, but anyway, that

424
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,080
 line doesn't use that tunnel anymore, and they're thinking of opening it up so cyclists

425
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
 can go through it.

426
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,440
 Oh, that's a really nice one, because it's always nice and flat when they sort of use

427
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,120
 an old railway line for that kind of thing.

428
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,600
 Just for, sorry for it to any international visitors who are used about.

429
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,840
 Beaching reference, I feel like Dan went into his chicken's glaze again.

430
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,800
 I think the Duke of Rutland probably dealt with the confused people, isn't it?

431
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
 What?

432
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,520
 For international listeners as well, Rutland, it's a small county, which is in...

433
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,600
 And a Duke is a member of the nobility.

434
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 Yeah, in front of the Americans listening, a train is the kind of thing we've got.

435
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,240
 No, it's in the East Midlands, it's got population about 41,000, and it's got this really interesting

436
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,040
 fact about it, which is that it is the smallest county in England, but only when the tide

437
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,680
 is out on the Isle of Light.

438
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,720
 So when the tide's in, that is the smallest county, it goes out.

439
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,920
 So it becomes the smallest county once every day, and then loses that award.

440
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,200
 The Duke of Rutland, he was the sixth Duke, the one we're talking about.

441
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,640
 He was also a Tory MP for Stamford, he won Stamford with 200 votes versus his Liberal

442
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,880
 opponents one vote in 1837.

443
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,080
 And according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and I quote, "His present

444
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,560
 wealth and future dukedom meant that his Tory colleagues had to bear with him.

445
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,480
 It is his idol to pretend," wrote Robert Blake, "that he was anything other than a

446
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
 stick."

447
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,800
 Apparently he was absolutely useless, but because he was so rich, they were like, "Oh,

448
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,560
 well, you're going to have to be part of the party now."

449
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,880
 I couldn't find evidence for, but I would like it to be true, for the fact that...

450
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,960
 So he never married, and he had a couple of crushes, apparently, and there seem to be

451
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,560
 claims that when he died, he left his friend's wife, Lady Miles, a yacht, his yacht, in his

452
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
 will.

453
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,480
 Which I really like as a move, but I don't know if it's true, but yeah...

454
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,520
 It's reported in multiple places, isn't it?

455
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,280
 Yeah, it does seem to be, and I like the idea of being the husband, because are you happy

456
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,760
 that you now kind of co-own a yacht that was left by a dead person?

457
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,080
 Are you suggesting that he fancied this woman?

458
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,160
 I don't know if you leave someone a yacht if you're just frenzy.

459
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,640
 Yeah, I think there was a suggestion to why it was left.

460
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
 It was 125.

461
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,760
 All right, I'm just saying, if you've got a yacht, you have to give it to someone.

462
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,320
 You've got no heirs, so...

463
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,120
 You and I could just be mates.

464
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
 Why specify the lady rather than both of them, though?

465
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 That's true.

466
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,160
 I think if my spouse got left a yacht by someone...

467
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,960
 By James, when James died, for instance.

468
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,640
 Yeah, you're not having any of your yachts.

469
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,480
 I narrow my eyes across the breakfast table.

470
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,360
 Can I just say, if anyone listening to this podcast would like to give my wife a yacht,

471
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,160
 I could not a yacht.

472
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,880
 Scandal-wise, it was interesting, I was reading about the current family, and I found an article

473
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,680
 which is all a bit sort of gross when you see the wealth, the amazing kind of...

474
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,760
 It's a bit odd, but there's all these tiny details that are so bizarre.

475
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,480
 So one thing is, is that him and the Duchess are no longer together, but they're both living

476
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,600
 with new partners in very separate bits of this giant beaver castle.

477
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,040
 I mean, it's pretty easy to do that when you've got a castle, isn't it?

478
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
 Yeah.

479
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,400
 If you live in an apartment in Tottenham, it's pretty hard to still live with your ex.

480
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
 Yeah.

481
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 It's all these...

482
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,720
 You get reports of all these little details that have been added to this castle.

483
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,560
 So there's a button that gets pressed, which opens a safe behind the bed that brings out

484
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,520
 a giant erection jug set that's just...

485
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 What do you mean?

486
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
 An erection jug set?

487
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,080
 It's like a penis erection done as a jug, but it's hidden in a safe behind the bed.

488
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
 Right.

489
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
 That you can sort of have reveal.

490
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
 It's very odd.

491
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
 It's just the way you said an erection jug set.

492
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,840
 Like we all knew what that was.

493
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
 That's a phrase back in Australia.

494
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,160
 It's like the Counted Chickens of Oz.

495
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,240
 You clarified a penis erection.

496
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,680
 Oh, a penis erection.

497
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
 Oh, dear.

498
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,680
 I did not know that, that's very...

499
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
 Who installed that?

500
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,120
 Have you seen this?

501
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
 No.

502
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,640
 It's just reported in this article.

503
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,320
 The interviewer sat down to chat to him.

504
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,760
 He sat on a sofa with a photo next to him that was framed in sign that says, "Dear David,

505
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,520
 looking forward to the time when I can completely cut off your head.

506
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
 Love from Rambo."

507
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,880
 It's from Sylvester Stallone.

508
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,000
 To David, the current Duke.

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,400
 They got their earl ships slash juke them, slash all that kind of stuff in the wars of

510
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,200
 the roses, I think, and they became earls.

511
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,400
 And then during this time when they were becoming politicians with the wigs, that's when they

512
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,600
 became dukes.

513
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,760
 So for American listeners, an earl is less than a duke.

514
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,960
 And for ordinary British people, it's really...

515
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,440
 But the 5th Earl of Rutland supposedly wrote Shakespeare's plays.

516
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
 Oh, good.

517
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
 Yeah.

518
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
 Who was that then?

519
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,600
 He's the 5th Earl of Rutland.

520
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,440
 He will have been called something manners, because they're all called manners, aren't

521
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
 they?

522
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
 Yeah.

523
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
 A lot of them are James Manners.

524
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
 Right.

525
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,360
 And the evidence is that he had a close relationship with the Earl of Southampton, who also didn't

526
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,880
 write the plays of James Manners.

527
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,560
 I think they were interested in each other's penis erections, but the poem Venus and the

528
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,480
 Donis was dedicated to the Earl of Southampton, and we don't have much evidence that Shakespeare

529
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 knew him.

530
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
 Right.

531
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
 But we do know that this guy knew him.

532
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,760
 But also Rutland went to Italy and taught, and two of his students were called Rosencrantz

533
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 and Gildestern.

534
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
 What?

535
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 Oh.

536
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
 The actual names.

537
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
 Yeah.

538
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
 With those, what the hell?

539
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,280
 They're definitely 100% where students, when he was teaching in Padua, so that's how

540
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 he should have led with that evidence.

541
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
 Yeah.

542
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 He has to be asked to resist on.

543
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
 No way.

544
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,920
 I thought they were sort of made up words by Shakespeare, who as it turns out is this

545
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
 random Duke.

546
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,000
 Can I tell you about a member of the Manners family?

547
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Yeah.

548
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 He was a slightly more recent one.

549
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,760
 I think it was late 19th, 30th, 20th century, so his Ralph Ptolemac was his name.

550
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,240
 And he was very fond of history.

551
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,880
 He had 15 children.

552
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,000
 The names included his first names, Plantagenet, Saxon.

553
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Love it.

554
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,160
 Iduolo, Leonès, Lílf, Lyona, Lyonella, Leonetta, and a boy who was, he became a captain in

555
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,400
 the First World War, right?

556
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,520
 His name was Lyonae, Sextus, Dennis, Oswald, Fraudatifilius, Ptolemac, Ptolemac, Dioralana,

557
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,320
 Plantagenet, Ptolemac, Ptolemac.

558
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
 Wow.

559
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,760
 I'm just shouting that under a hectic situation, but he's being fine now.

560
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
 Doug!

561
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,280
 You should have just said Doug.

562
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,120
 You didn't even say my old name.

563
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,640
 Very much the Elon Musk of his day, in fact.

564
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,360
 I mean, he's the Jacob Rees-Mogg of his day.

565
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
 Yeah, he is.

566
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
 Yeah, yeah.

567
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 More opposite.

568
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
 God.

569
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
 Wow.

570
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,240
 There was also around that time Lady Diana Manners, who was useful because she could

571
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
 be nicknamed Bad Mrs. Bad Manners.

572
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
 Very good.

573
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
 He was Bad Manners.

574
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,400
 But the reason I raised her is because she was part of a group that I didn't know existed

575
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
 called The Coterie.

576
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
 Oh, yeah.

577
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
 Or sometimes The Corrupt Coterie.

578
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,520
 Have you guys heard of this?

579
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 No.

580
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 No.

581
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,720
 It really sounds like one of those groups that you kind of want to be a member of, but

582
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
 it's also awful.

583
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,720
 It's like a Bullyington Club for the pre-First World War generation, and she was really

584
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,560
 the linchpin of it.

585
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
 They were incredibly glamorous.

586
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,400
 They were basically, you took all the aristocrats in the UK, and all the cool ones, who went

587
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,100
 to all the fun parties, were in The Coterie, and they were wild.

588
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,360
 They would spend their whole time gambling, drinking, but just also injecting heroin a

589
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,160
 lot, snorting a lot of cocaine.

590
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,200
 They loved taking chloroform, and she, throughout her life, apparently she'd go to parties and

591
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,280
 liven them up all the time by taking heroin, and no one really minded because, you know.

592
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
 When was this?

593
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,000
 This was just before the First World War, because sort of sadly, does taking heroin

594
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
 liven people up?

595
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,520
 If you're Lady Bad Manners, I think maybe it does.

596
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,480
 And they were all, and this is what you get for being a spoiled aristocrat with bad habits,

597
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,080
 pretty much all wiped out in the First World War.

598
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
 Right.

599
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,600
 So she married almost the last remaining one, who returned, who was called Duff.

600
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
 Duff Cooper.

601
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,000
 Because there's one other thing about one of the daughters of the current Manners family.

602
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,080
 So this is Eliza.

603
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,040
 She recently was fined half the normal amount that you would be fined for a speeding ticket

604
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,720
 because of cash flow issues.

605
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,360
 Oh, can you do that?

606
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
 Yeah.

607
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,640
 Because I've had two speeding tickets in the last month.

608
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
 Really?

609
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,240
 Although I did get mine halved as well.

610
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
 Cash flow issues?

611
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
 No.

612
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
 Okay.

613
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
 Just paying promptly.

614
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
 That's what you do.

615
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
 You pay within 28 days, you get a half.

616
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,080
 No, mine happened within two minutes of each other, so they said it was the same lapse

617
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
 of judgement.

618
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,120
 If you just stay speeding, that's what that film is about, actually, with Keanu Reeves.

619
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,960
 Just trying not to avoid getting two tickets.

620
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,760
 Can I tell you an aristocratic railway thing?

621
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
 Yeah.

622
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
 Yeah.

623
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,920
 Back to the old Duke of Rutland.

624
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,160
 So, Dukes loved opposing railways.

625
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,560
 It was for a while their main hobby.

626
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,960
 I mean, they were being built on their land, right?

627
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
 Completely.

628
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,520
 They didn't take their sides, but actually, the whole country was being dug up for railways

629
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,320
 at that time, which is a good thing, of course, but they owned most of the land, so...

630
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 Exactly.

631
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,760
 And there were lots of clashes, because you could have your land compulsorily purchased.

632
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,400
 And railway makers wanted to build straight, normal routes over relatively flat ground,

633
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
 because that's obviously what you'd build a railway.

634
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,560
 And Dukes would sometimes, or landowners would sometimes hire thugs to stop surveyors surveying

635
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,080
 the land for a railway, as then they would hire gangs of heavies to go and beat up the

636
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,640
 surveyors who were just trying to say, "Oh, yes, it could go over there, couldn't it?"

637
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,640
 And they had to do it at night, or they had to have decoy teams of surveyors, the railway

638
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
 companies.

639
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,320
 It's quite hard to survey at night, I would say.

640
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
 You're right.

641
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,520
 It does rely on vision quite extensively.

642
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
 Yeah.

643
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
 But it was such...

644
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,640
 It was a violent time.

645
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,640
 One railway company was warned, "We have barricaded the towing path and have in readiness

646
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,680
 a few cannons from Lord Harborer's yacht."

647
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:43,320
 But it was genuinely a perilous time, all except the third Duke of Sutherland, who built

648
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,720
 his own private railway line, and loved it, and would drive it himself.

649
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
 Yeah.

650
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 And he was one of the...

651
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
 I admire this guy so much.

652
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,400
 He had a cab built with a four-person upholstered seat at the back, right, so that the Duke could

653
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,560
 sit in the cab while the driver was driving it.

654
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
 So you literally up front in the engine.

655
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,800
 Oh, in the train.

656
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 Yeah, yeah.

657
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 Right, right.

658
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,520
 So guests he had on his upholstered seat have included King Edward VII, King George V,

659
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
 King Alfonso of Spain.

660
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,840
 And was this the original format for that, where a famous person gets a celebrity in

661
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,560
 their car and interviews with them?

662
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,200
 Yeah, that's it.

663
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,440
 Kaiser Wilhelm II was in this train, Winston Churchill, one of the key pro tags of the

664
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
 World Wars.

665
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
 And where did it go?

666
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,360
 Did it go anywhere, or was it just a little obstructive rail outside his house?

667
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,480
 It is far, far north in Scotland.

668
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 Right.

669
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,040
 It's really, really far up north.

670
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,080
 But he had the power to drive his own train until the killjoys at British Rail revoked

671
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 it in 1949.

672
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
 Okay.

673
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,000
 So for me, it's where the rot set in, you know, if a deer can't drive his own train.

674
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Yeah.

675
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,160
 What kind of a world are we living in?

676
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,640
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

677
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
 And that is my fact.

678
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,640
 My fact this week is that legendary guitar maker, Les Paul, had his arm permanently fused

679
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,520
 at roughly a 90 degree angle so that he could forever strum a guitar.

680
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
 It's magical.

681
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,080
 It's a, yeah, it's, it was an interesting moment in his life.

682
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
 That's what he said.

683
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,280
 Is it like, he's like, he's like Robocop basically.

684
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
 Not really.

685
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,960
 Well, no, but let me hear me out.

686
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
 What did Robocop do?

687
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,080
 Was he someone who sculpted his whole body to perform certain tasks?

688
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,160
 Robocop was, whereas they tried to save a human by creating a mechanical body, whereas

689
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,480
 this guy just had a little bit of bone put into his elbow.

690
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
 Robocop was fused.

691
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,520
 Robocop was based on Les Paul, that's what I said.

692
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,840
 I feel like he said, hey, doc, can you fuse my arm at 90 degrees so that I can forever

693
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
 masturbate?

694
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
 And they said, what?

695
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,480
 I said, I strum a guitar.

696
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
 I strum a guitar.

697
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:47,400
 Oh my God, imagine if it was that one day a doctor will say, well, you want to know

698
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,320
 what really happened.

699
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
 Yeah.

700
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
 So, okay, what happened?

701
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,680
 This is the story of Les Paul's horrible accident.

702
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,320
 He was out driving on a long trip to California with his partner at the time who became his

703
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,960
 wife called Mary Ford.

704
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
 And she was at the wheel.

705
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
 He was getting rest.

706
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,240
 He was laying down on the car seat when suddenly the car swerved and they were going off a

707
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,280
 bridge, put his arm on her, he said, this is it.

708
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,160
 They both thought they were going to die.

709
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,880
 But fortunately, because it was a convertible car, they were able to fling out of it and

710
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
 they survived.

711
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,800
 So actually, the very fact that he was laying down, didn't have a seatbelt on, she didn't

712
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,280
 have a seatbelt on, meant they kind of were able to survive.

713
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,160
 I read that claim that he said, actually, it was a good thing we didn't have seatbelts.

714
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
 Yeah.

715
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
 Are we sure?

716
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,280
 No, that was a theory at the time, actually, because there were motor racing drivers who

717
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,440
 didn't want to wear seatbelts because they wanted to be thrown away from the wreckage

718
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,640
 if it was ever a crash.

719
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
 Right.

720
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
 I just feel like, obviously, we're saying seatbelts are good.

721
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,140
 Yeah, it was a belief at the time.

722
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,140
 It was a belief at the time.

723
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,000
 At the time, there was arguments that seatbelts might trap you in wreckage.

724
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 You want to be as far away as possible from that car crash.

725
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Yeah, yeah.

726
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Okay.

727
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,360
 Now, they survived what was said to be a 20-foot plunge into a ravine, but they shouldn't

728
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,440
 have then survived because no one should have known that they were there.

729
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,560
 But it just so happens that, as they careered off the road, they crashed into a telephone

730
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,720
 and telegraph pole, and they phoned and in the car.

731
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
 On the way down.

732
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
 No, no.

733
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
 No, no.

734
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,120
 No, so when those lines went down, the lines of the area went down, some emergency services

735
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,360
 came to rectify that, and then they saw this car down there.

736
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
 This was eight hours later.

737
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
 They're like, what's that?

738
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,480
 And they found them.

739
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,480
 So he was seriously injured, broken nose, punctured spleen, broken vertebrae, pelvis was done,

740
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,120
 and he'd shattered his elbow, his right elbow.

741
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,920
 So the plan was, they were going to amputate his arm, but a doctor said, no, I think we

742
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,080
 can fix this.

743
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,240
 And so what they did was they decided to take some of his leg bone and they put it in place

744
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,520
 of the elbow, but in doing so, they needed to fuse it into one position.

745
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,080
 So usually someone who is having that would have it in a arm out position.

746
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
 He said.

747
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
 What was they?

748
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
 Or maybe a slight.

749
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
 I don't know.

750
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
 I don't think what I would go for.

751
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
 What would you go for?

752
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
 Hand on the hip.

753
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
 Peace sign.

754
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
 Yeah.

755
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
 It's all about where it is.

756
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
 I get to move my arm.

757
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
 Okay.

758
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
 It's about arm position.

759
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
 No, you get to move your fingers.

760
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 You don't get to move your arm.

761
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,400
 I will go for a salute in that case.

762
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
 Patriotic.

763
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
 Salute position.

764
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,200
 That could facing the wrong way look like a sig hyal.

765
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,760
 I will never be facing the wrong way.

766
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,360
 I'll always be facing the king.

767
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
 Yeah.

768
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,160
 The correct answer is for the four of us to do Y, M, C and A.

769
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,880
 So what he ended up doing was he said to his doctor, put my forefinger in my belly button

770
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
 when you set it.

771
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,600
 That's how I hold the guitar and I'll still be able to play.

772
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,840
 That's what they did.

773
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
 And so, yeah.

774
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,760
 But thank God he did do this because he was a genius of guitar creation.

775
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,840
 I think actually that's why they did it.

776
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,720
 I read that he overheard the two surgeons, one of them saying we're going to have to

777
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,960
 cut his arm off and the other one saying, well, he's a guitarist, so maybe we should

778
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
 try and save it.

779
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
 Wow.

780
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
 Yeah.

781
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
 I mean, thank God.

782
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,880
 I'd never heard of, I'd heard of Les Paul very, very vaguely as a brand before.

783
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 Yeah.

784
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,880
 I know that you've heard of a Gibson or a Stratocaster or whatever, but I don't really,

785
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,600
 I don't know any of the stories about them.

786
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
 And he was amazing.

787
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,720
 I mean, he invented the modern electric guitar.

788
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
 Yeah.

789
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,880
 He kind of, he innovated.

790
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
 He advanced it.

791
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,000
 There were, there's other claims to earlier models, but he's the one who basically was

792
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,920
 a combination of an artist and an inventor and just got it out there and people saw it

793
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
 and.

794
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
 His one went forward.

795
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
 Yeah.

796
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
 Exactly.

797
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,920
 One of the reasons was when he had his accident, he couldn't play guitar for a while, of course,

798
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,400
 because, you know, it's getting better, but while he was waiting, he was reading electronics

799
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,840
 manuals and he was learning how to be an electronics master.

800
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,320
 So he did this other thing.

801
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,320
 There was a brilliant essay about Les Paul on this.

802
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,480
 I think it was called The Quietest.

803
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,080
 It's a great website and it's about how the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody is partly thanks

804
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
 to the Nazis.

805
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
 Okay.

806
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
 Hear me out.

807
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,360
 I knew we had to thank him for something.

808
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
 Okay.

809
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,080
 So he, he did these experiments with multi-track recording, right?

810
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
 Yeah.

811
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,320
 So he was working with Bing Crosby, friend of the podcast, I'd say.

812
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
 Is he?

813
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
 I'd say.

814
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
 Acquaintance of the podcast.

815
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
 Yeah.

816
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
 He's popped in.

817
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
 He's popped in.

818
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,720
 And he, because he wanted to pre-record his radio show.

819
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,040
 And one of his staff found a guy called Jack Mullen, who'd been in the U.S. Army Signal

820
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,400
 Corps and who had acquired, probably next, two real-to-real recorders from Nazi Germany

821
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
 in 1945.

822
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
 Oh.

823
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,200
 You know, there's a lot of moving objects about and he's come across them somehow.

824
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
 And he had worked.

825
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
 It was a time of moving stuff about.

826
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
 It was a time of that.

827
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
 Borders.

828
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
 Yes.

829
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
 And he'd worked out that.

830
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
 He sort of back-formed it.

831
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,440
 You know, he'd found these real-to-real recorders, he'd back-formed it.

832
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,120
 And Crosby invested that.

833
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,200
 And he notified Les Paul, who comes into the story here, and he added an extra playback

834
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,000
 system to this real-to-real thing, which meant you could hear what was on the tape as you

835
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 recorded it.

836
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Hmm.

837
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 That was the brilliant innovation.

838
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Yeah.

839
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 The eight-track recorder.

840
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Absolutely.

841
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Just revolutionized music.

842
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And one extra thing.

843
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Yeah.

844
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,640
 So, and Bohemian Rhapsody is possible because of that, basically, that bit with all the

845
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 voices in the middle.

846
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
 Oh, I see.

847
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
 That's the point of that.

848
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,080
 Well, sort of every song is thanks to that, really.

849
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
 Well, yeah.

850
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
 Of modern music.

851
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,000
 Well, that makes you think when you next listen to something, you know, you're basically

852
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 collaborating.

853
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 So, yeah.

854
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Anyone who likes pop music, according to Andy, is a Nazi.

855
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,640
 Which coincidentally is, I've already thought.

856
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,360
 He used to do a show with his wife on TV as well with Mary Ford, and it was from their

857
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
 house.

858
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,640
 And the thing was, is that he was inventing so much stuff so quickly that was so impossible

859
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,200
 really for a layman to understand that he'd created a fictitious invention called the

860
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,800
 pulverizer, which he said, "I'm just going to press the pulverizer, and it's going to

861
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
 make this work."

862
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,040
 And that's where he was playing pre-recorded multi-track and so on.

863
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,800
 But it sent the whole industry into a kind of, "What is this pulverizer?

864
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
 We have no idea what this is."

865
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
 Hang on.

866
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 So, sorry.

867
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
 What was he claiming it was doing?

868
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,160
 He was using a pre-recorded multi-track that he'd already recorded, and they were singing

869
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,760
 on top of it live for the TV show.

870
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
 Yeah.

871
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,800
 Rather than having to explain this new technology of what was going on or every little innovation

872
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,200
 that he was making, he would just say, "The pulverizer has invented this."

873
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,080
 Yeah, because I always, you know, hear about multi-track stuff and recording over it, being

874
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
 an invention.

875
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,800
 And I always think, "I reckon of the few technological things I could have invented

876
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
 that."

877
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
 I always think, "It's not piss easy.

878
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,040
 You just get a bit of music, you play it, and you play something else over it."

879
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
 Yeah.

880
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
 Come on, guys.

881
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
 It was thanks to him innovating it.

882
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,800
 I'm not saying it could have been done, but he was the one who thought to do it, as in

883
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
 his genius was.

884
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,120
 It wasn't technically an impossible thing to do.

885
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
 Got it.

886
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
 It was the idea.

887
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
 Exactly.

888
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
 Yeah, yeah.

889
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
 Actually, I heard him in an interview with The New York Times.

890
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,080
 He said, "The only reason I invented these things is because I didn't have them."

891
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
 Yeah.

892
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
 So, he knew there was a thing he needed.

893
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,960
 He knew it was quite an easy thing to invent, but no one had invented it, so he's like,

894
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
 "Oh, I have to make it."

895
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
 So cool.

896
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,120
 You said that he did the show with Mary Ford, which is true, and that he was in the

897
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:45,680
 car crash with Mary Ford, which is also true, but she was originally called Colleen Summers,

898
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,200
 and he changed her name to Mary Ford because he thought it was better for their showbiz

899
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,320
 life.

900
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,240
 He found the name in a phone book, but she wasn't even known as Colleen Summers in the

901
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
 car crash.

902
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,440
 She was known as Iris Watson, and that is because, and this was in all the newspapers,

903
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,920
 he was in a car crash with Iris Watson, and that's because he was having an affair with

904
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,440
 Mary Ford/Colleen Summers, and they wanted to keep it out of the newspapers, so they

905
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
 gave a false name.

906
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,320
 So, there's some poor bitty named Iris Watson somewhere, who everyone suddenly thinks is

907
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
 shagging.

908
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
 That's amazing.

909
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,920
 He almost died another time, in fact, didn't he?

910
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,080
 He almost electrocuted himself in the 40s.

911
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,600
 In 1941, he was jamming around with some friends, and he stuck his hand in the transmitter.

912
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,040
 I don't even know how he used to do a hand in a transmitter, but I guess it was more

913
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,240
 janky then, and it electrified him really badly, and I think he was only saved because

914
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,280
 his basis threw himself at him and got him away from it just before he died.

915
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,700
 He was, I think, fully unconscious, had to be entirely immersed in a tub of ice immediately

916
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,200
 afterwards, which apparently helped.

917
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,400
 I don't know if it does, but that's what they did anyway, I guess, and then he spent

918
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,880
 weeks in full head-to-toe comedy bandages, which again, I don't know if that helps either,

919
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
 but yeah.

920
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
 That's amazing.

921
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
 He almost died then, so.

922
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
 Wow.

923
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,880
 That must have been hard for him to wank when he was in there.

924
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
 Oh, God.

925
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,600
 You got the tissues ready made, though, haven't you?

926
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,040
 Guitars are so innovative with the engineering side of their instruments.

927
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,880
 Brian May made his own guitar, which he still uses.

928
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,480
 Hendrix just used to walk around with a broom handle, just a big broom because he couldn't

929
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,920
 afford a guitar, but he just wanted to practice the movement and shapes on it, so everywhere

930
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,680
 he went, he just had a mop, basically, and then when he got a guitar, he was left-handed,

931
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,100
 but there was only right-handed guitars around him, so he had to learn it both upside down,

932
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,360
 or then he would have to take someone's guitar, un-string all the strings, re-string it backwards.

933
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,080
 Could be a left-handed broom, or...

934
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
 Good point.

935
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,120
 It might have been the worst, only right-handed ones, yeah.

936
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
 Did he re-string...

937
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
 Is it like putting the toilet seat down?

938
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,520
 Did he re-string the strings before he gave it back to the person?

939
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
 You would.

940
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
 That'd be annoying.

941
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
 Yeah.

942
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,400
 Yeah, one of the most influential guitarists of the 20th century was someone I hadn't

943
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,920
 heard of called Libba Cotten, so she was born in 1893, and she was a folk and blues musician,

944
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,240
 and lots of people say that they were influenced by her, so she was a big influence in like

945
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,520
 bluegrass and jazz and stuff like that, and it's very plinky-plunky, plicky-plucky the

946
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,800
 way she plays, but she was left-handed, and again, so she was, I think, about 12 when

947
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,760
 she saved enough money for my job, she was working to get a guitar, but yeah, had to

948
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,760
 flip it upside down, as you do, and so she would always play the high notes with her

949
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,920
 thumb and finger, and then the low notes with her little finger, and she was amazing, so

950
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,680
 she played from age 12 to 17, she wrote a couple of songs, but people didn't hear about

951
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,680
 her, she then got married, stopped playing until her 50s, and then she bumped into in

952
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,400
 a department store, in fact, she rescued the daughter of a woman called Ruth Seeger, who

953
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,320
 was a kind of famous musician, and she became their housekeeper and re-taught herself a

954
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,960
 guitar from scratch, again, still playing it back to front, and she released these songs

955
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,640
 that became huge influences, and they, like, shot into the charts, I think Bob Dylan says

956
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,400
 he's massively influenced by her.

957
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,200
 Because she just sounded different than any other guitarist, right, because she was playing

958
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
 it in this different way.

959
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,440
 Yeah, the plicky-ploppy way.

960
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
 It is amazing.

961
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,160
 Like, and it's often necessity as the mother of invention, because you don't have teachers

962
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,640
 in those days, you would just learn it.

963
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,120
 Yeah, you're just self-taught, so you do it.

964
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,920
 Have you heard of Carol Kaye?

965
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
 Yeah.

966
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
 Throwing the Beach Boys.

967
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,680
 Yeah, so she was the bass player in Good Vibrations, for instance, but not just the Beach Boys.

968
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,960
 She was the bass player for These Boots Are Made For Walking, La Bamba, I'm A Believer,

969
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,840
 the theme for the Batman TV show, Suspicious Minds, Riding Stone Cowboy, like, pretty much

970
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,960
 any song you can name from the '60s and '70s, she was the bass player in it, and she had

971
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,320
 a different way of playing, just like this woman you were talking about, Anna, because

972
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,880
 she started off as a normal guitarist, an acoustic guitarist, and so she would play

973
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,080
 with a pick, and she then turned up at a session, and the bassist hadn't turned up, and they

974
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,280
 said, "Oh, can you play bass?"

975
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,760
 And she was like, "Okay, fine, it's just pretty much the same.

976
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
 I'll be able to do it."

977
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,080
 And so she always played bass with a pick, whereas normally you would play bass with

978
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
 your fingers.

979
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,480
 But her sound was so different than anyone else, and she just became the one bassist

980
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
 that everyone wanted on it.

981
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
 So you're like, "What, easy technology?

982
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,040
 All you need is that idea."

983
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,640
 Yeah, but if you do watch any old Beach Boys documentaries of the making of that period,

984
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,120
 the sort of love that comes out from Brian Wilson watching her play is pretty phenomenal.

985
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
 It's amazing.

986
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,400
 It is extraordinary, all these names that kind of disappear, yet what a massive influence

987
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
 they've had.

988
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,560
 Like Les Paul is a really good example, and Mary Ford, them as a double act.

989
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,840
 They had 36 gold records, 11 number one pop songs.

990
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
 They were huge.

991
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
 Yeah, it's a lot.

992
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
 That's huge.

993
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,000
 They sold millions and millions, and I only know him as a guitarist.

994
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,280
 And I hadn't heard of Mary Ford.

995
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,000
 Yeah, but like in 50 years time, will people remember who Dua Lipi was?

996
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 I don't now.

997
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Do you know what I mean?

998
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Andy has another BTS.

999
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Biggest band on the planet.

1000
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Exactly.

1001
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 BTS, like...

1002
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Behind the scenes.

1003
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 Yeah, exactly.

1004
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 That's what I think.

1005
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 That's what he should do as his thing.

1006
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Like BTS, BTS.

1007
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 That's what he should do.

1008
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Amazing.

1009
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Is it a band?

1010
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 There you go.

1011
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 Did you know that spiders play guitars?

1012
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 Oh, they do.

1013
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Good.

1014
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 They are good.

1015
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Because they've got eight hands.

1016
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 They've got eight hands.

1017
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 Be like chewing banjoes, but they could do it on their own.

1018
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 I think that's exactly what they do.

1019
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Yep, they play their webs as guitars.

1020
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 So this is amazing.

1021
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,600
 They tune their webs, and they adjust all the different threads on their webs to different

1022
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
 tightnesses.

1023
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,400
 So they're very aware of exactly what the tightness is that they've adjusted it to.

1024
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,000
 And that means whatever lands on that thread, they're going to know what it is.

1025
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 So if it plays like an A-sharp, they're like, "Ah, that's a mosquito."

1026
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Exactly that.

1027
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 That's incredible.

1028
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 And they can tell a thing.

1029
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Other spiders gather round and go, "Oh yeah, nice web, nice web."

1030
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Who's made that top radial bit for you?

1031
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Yeah, they do.

1032
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 And then they eat them.

1033
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

1034
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 My fact is that firefighters are allowed to scoop water out of people's swimming pools

1035
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 to put out fires.

1036
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 I should hope so.

1037
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 I would be furious if I found out they weren't allowed to do that, if there was a fire nearby.

1038
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Oh yeah, really.

1039
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 I don't know.

1040
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 If I was a duke and I had a big swimming pool, and I went out to dive in from my big diving

1041
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 bar, and there was no water in the pool.

1042
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 I'd all be taken to put out some fire in the peasants' village.

1043
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 I'd be furious.

1044
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 You're right.

1045
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 James, were you the one Tory voter in last week's election?

1046
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Well, exactly as you say, Andy, it's one of those things you're like, "I'm glad that's

1047
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 true, but I'm sort of glad they've laid down the law at some point."

1048
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 And this seems to be true.

1049
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 Firefighters know it worldwide.

1050
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 There are slightly different rules.

1051
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 So in California, the fire department says you can take water from any safe source, and

1052
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 it's completely up to the discretion of the pilot what you use.

1053
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 So if you are a socialist pilot who hates people with swimming pools, you can go there first.

1054
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 So they're doing it via helicopter, which we should point out.

1055
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Sorry, yes.

1056
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Sorry, you're not just wandering over with a bucket.

1057
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Yes.

1058
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 So there'll be a firefighter in a helicopter, and they've got a bucket underneath, which

1059
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 are called Bambi buckets, for reasons I couldn't ascertain.

1060
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Oh, yeah.

1061
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 And you lower...

1062
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 I imagine that once you've got a big bucket of water underneath your helicopter, you're

1063
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 probably moving around like a deer on ice.

1064
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 That's nice.

1065
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Oh, maybe it is that.

1066
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 That's good.

1067
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 I was thinking, because it looks a bit almost like an upside down deer, because it's got

1068
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 like wobbly leg bits attaching it to the helicopter.

1069
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Nice triangle.

1070
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Anyway, these are some of the biggest buckets on the planet.

1072
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 I'm very excited about it.

1073
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Are they?

1074
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 Yeah.

1075
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 Honestly, I spent a fair little bit of time trying to find out the biggest bucket on the

1076
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 planet.

1077
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Yeah.

1078
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 And there's not readily available data.

1079
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Okay.

1080
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 So these helicopters.

1081
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Yeah.

1082
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 So they're pretty cool.

1083
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Yeah, and they don't call ahead.

1084
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 You know, you could be just getting ready to go out in your swimming pool and you'll see

1085
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 a giant bucket descend from the sky.

1086
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Can you be in the...

1087
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Has anyone ever been lifted up?

1088
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Scoot up.

1089
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 I'm in the bucket.

1090
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 That's my child.

1091
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Yeah.

1092
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 So they have to do a proper safety scan before they descend.

1093
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 So you'd hope that would include...

1094
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 You never know.

1095
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 You never know what's in there.

1096
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 That's interesting though.

1097
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Could you see?

1098
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 I was reading a blog and this guy says, "We can see very well and we will see you."

1099
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 But if you run out and start waving your hands at the helicopter, sort of saying, "No,

1100
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 please."

1101
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 No, I go to have a swim.

1102
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 I want to have a swim.

1103
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 He's like, "We do take that into account."

1104
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 But also what I love about it is that the house is tracked.

1105
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 They mark down where it is.

1106
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 And if you ask them, they will reimburse you your water.

1107
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 They don't bring back water.

1108
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 They don't bring back water.

1109
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 They will reimburse you the money to fill.

1110
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 Right, right, right.

1111
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Or if any damage was done in the process of lowering the big bucket.

1112
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Which almost never...

1113
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 Sorry, I want to say in defense of human beings, based on, in fact, two separate firefighters,

1114
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 they said no one's ever done that.

1115
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Except there was one person...

1116
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 Right.

1117
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 I think there was one company where it was completely destroyed, like a nursery school,

1118
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 where the whole thing was...

1119
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 But yes, I think people don't tend to call the fire department and go, "I mean, no one

1120
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 you rescued 100 people yesterday."

1121
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Yeah.

1122
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 I think the pool's a bit shallower.

1123
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 But just hear me out, right?

1124
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Yeah.

1125
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 The fire department has scoped out the swimming pool.

1126
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 They've said, "Yes, we're good to go."

1127
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 Right, the bucket is descending.

1128
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Meanwhile, I walk out, I've got my...

1129
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 I'm probably reading my book, and I've got my headphones in, so I don't notice.

1130
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 The helicopter above you.

1131
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 Have you been there many low-flight helicopters?

1132
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 I've got very big, surrounded headphones, you know.

1133
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 You're listening to BTS.

1134
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 I'm trying to catch up on this great stuff.

1135
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 I think it's possible.

1136
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 So, it's possible that I'll be scooped, that I'll end up in the bucket.

1137
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 I've been underneath helicopters at various heights, and I can tell you, you would 100%

1138
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 know there was a helicopter if it was within, you know, 20 or 30 meters of you.

1139
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 Also, you're jumping in the pool with your big noise-canceling headphones on.

1140
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 I've invested in special waterproof headphones, and it's a windy day already, so I don't

1141
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 notice the downdraft.

1142
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 What proof book?

1143
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 It's one of those bath books.

1144
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 You always take us on holiday, don't you?

1145
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 I forgot the bath and a caretina.

1146
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 It's really big.

1147
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Do you remember there was that story about...

1148
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 And it was definitely fake, but for a long time before the internet really snopes and

1149
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 all that, it went out there at schools, where a scuba diver was found in a tree.

1150
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Do you remember that?

1151
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 It was always told as a riddle, I think.

1152
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 It was like a scuba diver's in a tree in a forest.

1153
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 How did they get there?

1154
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 That's true.

1155
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 It's that there used to be a sea here, but over time, you know, like coastal erosion,

1156
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 and stuff.

1157
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 I think what we're talking about right now is just a real idiot scuba diver that doesn't

1158
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 realise that you're supposed to go in water.

1159
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 He's like, "I'm here to see some wildlife."

1160
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 It's Occam's razor, that's it.

1161
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 He's going to the beach in the afternoon, but he's going to the forest in the morning,

1162
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 but he doesn't want to go home in between the pick of his stuff.

1163
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 These helicopters, by the way, some of these helicopters, they don't do the bucket system.

1164
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 I love this.

1165
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 This is the big ones, I think it's the, there are some Chinooks, which do this.

1166
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 Maybe it's some of those, maybe it's a different helicopter, but they have snorkels.

1167
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 They have retractable snorkels, which they drop down like an elephant's trunk into your

1168
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 pool and suck up into the body of the, they can suck 4,000 gallons in a minute.

1169
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Wow.

1170
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Which is quite, now that sounds fast, right?

1171
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 It sounds fast, but I did a little bit of maths.

1172
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 It would still take that helicopter 122 minutes exactly to empty an Olympic pool because of

1173
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 the size.

1174
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 So that's two hours and two minutes it would take to suck up an Olympic pool, which is

1175
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 the same duration of some like it hot.

1176
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 So you could watch the whole thing in the cockpit while you did that.

1177
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 And then when you're going to put out the fire, they're like, "I actually like it hot."

1179
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 But the weight must be insane.

1180
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Yeah.

1181
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 So they couldn't suck up an Olympic pool.

1182
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 Obviously, but even the amount you say is a thousand gallons.

1183
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 That feels heavy though.

1184
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 I know, I know.

1185
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 It is.

1186
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Wow.

1187
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 So as well as being able to take your water without asking from your pools, another thing

1188
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 that firefighters can do is they can smash the hell out of your car if they need to, right?

1189
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 And this does happen a fair chunk and it's often in the news.

1190
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 Just to let off steam after work.

1191
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 It's a long day fighting fires.

1192
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 So one example is I was reading about a guy who parked his new BMW outside a house in

1193
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 East Boston and he parked it in front of a fire hydrant.

1194
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 This is a big, big problem.

1195
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 You shouldn't obviously do that, highly illegal, but people do do it.

1196
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 And if a fire breaks out and the fire engine gets there and they need the hydrant, what

1197
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 they'll often do is if they don't have enough people to literally pick up and lift the car

1198
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 out of the way, they'll smash through the windows so that they can thread the hose all the way through that.

1199
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 That's interesting that the hose just can't go over.

1200
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Yeah, right.

1201
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 Why do you need to take it through the window?

1202
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 It's not tight as in the angle on the other side.

1203
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 That would have to be really tight.

1204
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 What they say, yeah, is it's all to do with if you want the ultimate amount of water to

1205
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 seamlessly come through, you can't have any kinks.

1206
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 The reason we often hear about these stories is the car owner say, you smashed up my car,

1207
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 you need to pay for this.

1208
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 And any time it goes to court, the judge will throw it out and give them a fine.

1209
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 So in this case, this guy has fined $100 for his two day old new car that he parked outside.

1210
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 Wait, he was fined for making a fuss?

1211
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 So it's like, not only are you not being reimbursed, but we're also fining you for what you did.

1212
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 Have we talked about fireman's poles before?

1213
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 I'm not sure we have.

1214
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 So it used to be that you'd have the fire engine on the ground floor and then you'd live one floor above that.

1215
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 And then you'd have another floor above that.

1216
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 Guess what's kept in that?

1217
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 Like just old stuff that you don't need around the house anymore, but you don't really want to throw out.

1218
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 Yeah, that's right.

1219
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 The strippers?

1220
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 The strippers?

1221
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 No, it's not the strippers.

1222
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 The horses though, because the horses would live in a fire station.

1223
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 And the olden days would go up.

1224
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 But they live on the ground floor.

1225
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 This isn't the old.

1226
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 This is in the days of horses though.

1227
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 Right.

1228
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 The hay.

1229
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 The hay.

1230
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 The hay.

1231
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 The hay loft.

1232
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 Wow.

1233
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 And you would have poles to, I think, transport the hay.

1234
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 So apparently a binding pole, which helps you move the hay around.

1235
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 You could just drop it.

1236
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 It feels like the pole's not necessary in the haydown.

1237
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 There was a Chicago firefighter who dropped down the pole.

1238
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 Allegedly, this was his Fosbury Flop moment where he slid down the pole to respond quickly.

1239
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 And the captain of that company, David Kenyon.

1240
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 Oh my God.

1241
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 So they're basically like, we've put this pole in for literally no reason.

1242
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 We couldn't just drop the hay down.

1243
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Completely pointless.

1244
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 And then this guy actually finds a use for it.

1245
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 Yeah.

1246
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 And then their crew was suddenly arriving first at every fire in the city because they're doing their poles.

1247
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 And get this, only one cat has ever been able to use a fireman's pole.

1248
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 Wow.

1249
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 Okay.

1250
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 What is that?

1251
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 Am I surprised at it so many or so few?

1252
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Yeah.

1253
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 We'd wrap itself around and go down.

1254
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 Yeah.

1255
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Wow.

1256
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 It was called Sam the Cat.

1257
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 And it was the mascot for the Long Beach, California fire station in the '60s.

1258
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 And the crew taught Sam to use the pole.

1259
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 I reckon tons of cats can.

1260
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 They just choose not to.

1261
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 No.

1262
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 What I think is nice is that fireman's poles are still going despite many articles over

1263
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 the last 30 years that keep claiming they're being phased out.

1264
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 Right.

1265
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 I've read they're being phased out.

1266
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 I'm surprised Europe hasn't gotten rid of them.

1267
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Like, EU?

1268
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 Yeah.

1269
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 Brussels.

1270
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 No, it's woke, isn't it?

1271
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 Because of woke.

1272
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 I'm trying to build on my character of being a produke.

1273
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Of course.

1274
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 Of course.

1275
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 Yeah.

1276
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 Brexit it.

1277
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 Got it.

1278
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 I think there have been a few less.

1279
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 And from what if I have to say, I think there are accidents.

1280
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,500
 So I think there was one person who said that two of the people I've worked with have ended

1281
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,500
 up in hospital from going down a pole ill-advisedly.

1282
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,500
 Right.

1283
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,000
 Is that slide injuries, as in you burning yourself on the friction?

1284
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,500
 Or is it you've hurt yourself because you've done it upside down for a laugh or whatever?

1285
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
 Or you've fallen.

1286
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
 Someone did fall in the hole of Seattle Firemen.

1287
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
 Yes, I did.

1288
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
 Like, well, there was one person.

1289
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,500
 What most of them say is it's members of the public, because now the fire station is often

1290
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,000
 open to members of the public or partners.

1291
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,500
 They don't know that this is the fireman's pole.

1292
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
 What?

1293
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,500
 How can you not know?

1294
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
 Because!

1295
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
 Maybe this goes to the back.

1296
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,500
 I don't know.

1297
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,500
 One story that kicked off a big campaign to get them phased out was in, I think it was

1298
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,500
 2002.

1299
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:03,500
 And the pole is you open a door on the second floor, and that's the pole door.

1300
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
 I did not know that.

1301
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
 And you go in, I think, often.

1302
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
 I thought it was totally free range.

1303
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
 Yeah, I thought you had to just be careful.

1304
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,500
 In which case, you could understand someone falling down.

1305
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500
 Absolutely.

1306
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
 Someone went in and thought they were going to the loo.

1307
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:19,500
 They thought it was a toilet cubicle, stepped in, fell straight through the hole.

1308
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
 That's amazing.

1309
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,500
 That's quite funny.

1310
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,500
 That's incredible.

1311
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,500
 Quite an awkward moment, because you will have shot yourself by the time they get you

1312
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
 down.

1313
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,500
 Just want to go in the toilet.

1314
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,500
 Just as you're recovering, a bale of hay crashes on top of your head.

1315
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
 But they're still going.

1316
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
 They're around a lot, yeah.

1317
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
 That's great.

1318
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
 I think a lot of them in America.

1319
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,500
 And apparently I think some firefighters don't use them, and some firefighters do.

1320
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,500
 And some, one of them said his chief uses it, like literally he'll come down with a

1321
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,500
 cup of coffee in his hand, just use it to get up and down.

1322
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
 That's what you would.

1323
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
 I got a little riddle for you guys.

1324
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
 Great.

1325
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
 Okay, why in Germany...

1326
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
 That's not riddle, it's just a question.

1327
00:53:53,500 --> 00:54:00,500
 Why in Germany are firefighters having to fight fires in tanks?

1328
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,500
 Okay.

1329
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,500
 Is tank German for fire engine?

1330
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
 No, but that's a lovely thought.

1331
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,500
 They have lots of spare tanks because they're not allowed to use any of their military weapons,

1332
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
 because Germany has a famously paired down army.

1333
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,500
 So they've accidentally made too many tanks, and they don't have enough fire engines.

1334
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
 They're going along to the fires in tanks?

1335
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,500
 Yeah.

1336
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
 Shortage of fire engines?

1337
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,500
 No.

1338
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,500
 Using the big sort of cannon in front of the tank as a hose?

1339
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
 They probably are using it like that.

1340
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,500
 Put a big sponge on the tank's barrel, put a big sponge on the front of the tank, and

1341
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
 just sort of squeegee the fire out of existence.

1342
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,500
 Lovely.

1343
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,500
 Okay, good thought.

1344
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,500
 No, it's not that.

1345
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,500
 Okay.

1346
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,500
 It's much like Bohemian Rhapsody, very closely connected to the Nazis.

1347
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
 Putting tracks on top of each other.

1348
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
 No, it's a World War II thing.

1349
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:52,500
 What this is, is that there are tens of thousands of unexploded bombs that landed during World

1350
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,500
 War II that are still out in forests and so on, they're buried underneath.

1351
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
 You know what?

1352
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
 I don't want to be on the Nazi side.

1353
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,500
 I think those bombs were probably not dropped by the Nazis.

1354
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1355
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
 I was saying it was dropped to get rid of...

1356
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,500
 The Nazis are connected.

1357
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
 It's related.

1358
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,500
 It's related.

1359
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,500
 I think you're allowing it.

1360
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,500
 They started it.

1361
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,500
 Yeah, yeah.

1362
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:15,500
 So basically, fires would start and bombs would be exploding set off by the fire.

1363
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,500
 And so because you don't know where they are, it's too dangerous to go in, they would often

1364
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
 have to use a tank.

1365
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,500
 And this is recent.

1366
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,500
 This is only a few years ago.

1367
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
 Wow.

1368
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,500
 Is this happening on the wrecks in Germany?

1369
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,500
 Because I feel like unexploded World War II bombs every couple of years, maybe you get

1370
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,500
 one, but is it...

1371
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
 Yeah, yeah.

1372
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,500
 Is that a lot?

1373
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,500
 There are definitely areas where there are more, aren't there?

1374
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
 There are some areas of France that you still can't go in.

1375
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,500
 Yeah.

1376
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,500
 And is the tank...

1377
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,500
 The idea is that a tank is more bomb-proof.

1378
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,500
 Because I still be nervous in a tank.

1379
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,500
 It just gives you a bit more protection.

1380
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,500
 It gives you a bit more than, say, just walking or...

1381
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
 Yeah, or a truck.

1382
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,500
 Yeah.

1383
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
 Imagine there's a fire in this room.

1384
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,500
 Okay.

1385
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
 God forbid.

1386
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,500
 We're on what floor?

1387
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
 The third floor?

1388
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,500
 Yeah.

1389
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,500
 Fourth floor.

1390
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,500
 But we need to get out to the building.

1391
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,500
 Maybe out of the windows.

1392
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,500
 We can't go down the stairs.

1393
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,500
 Right.

1394
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,500
 What are we hoping for on the ground?

1395
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,500
 A big trampoline.

1396
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,500
 Oh, like a mattress.

1397
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
 A big trampoline.

1398
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
 A big trampoline or mattress.

1399
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,500
 Exactly.

1400
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:11,000
 So this is the Broder Life Net, which is this thing that you see in old movies where you

1401
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,500
 get a load of firefighters all holding a big trampoline.

1402
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,500
 And it's got a little target in the middle of it.

1403
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,500
 And you jump out and hopefully you're fine.

1404
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,500
 That really was a thing.

1405
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,500
 It existed from 1887 when it was invented.

1406
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,500
 And it was still being used as late as 1960.

1407
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
 Wow.

1408
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,500
 Right.

1409
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,500
 But the reason that they don't use them anymore is because they quite often went wrong.

1410
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,500
 Of course.

1411
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,500
 It must be so hard.

1412
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,860
 It must be terrifying jumping onto one of those things.

1413
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,860
 Yeah.

1414
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
 There's a lot of problems.

1415
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,500
 Basically, you're probably in a place with lots of smoke.

1416
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,340
 So being able to see the trampoline is hard enough.

1417
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:55,500
 And then quite often people would be like, "Oh, we need to save the safe in the corner

1418
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,660
 with all our erection vases in, so let's throw that out first."

1419
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,540
 And obviously they would throw heavy things out, and then that would mean that the trampoline

1420
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,540
 would break.

1421
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,540
 Right.

1422
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,540
 Or quite often more than one person would jump out at the same time.

1423
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,700
 Like two or three people would hold hands and jump out.

1424
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,500
 And that would be too heavy and that would break.

1425
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,300
 Or quite often you would just miss and you would hit a fireman.

1426
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,300
 Right.

1427
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,300
 Yeah.

1428
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,300
 Yeah.

1429
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,220
 Like it was really the reason that they don't exist anymore is because they did save some

1430
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,820
 lives, but actually their hit rate was quite low.

1431
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,620
 But surely I'd rather a trampoline than nothing.

1432
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
 Yeah.

1433
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,960
 So when you say, "Why were they faced?"

1434
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
 Was there something better to replace it?

1435
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,960
 Yes, there was.

1436
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,080
 It was like these big sort of cherry-picker machines.

1437
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,080
 Oh, right.

1438
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,860
 They can pluck you out of your window.

1439
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,860
 Yeah, yeah.

1440
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,060
 So once you get over, like, six, seven stories, these things don't work anyway.

1441
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,060
 Right.

1442
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,620
 And they managed to get these kind of cherry pickers that would be able to get that high.

1443
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,700
 So you didn't need the trampolines anymore.

1444
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,580
 I'm imagining a situation where someone's on the fourth floor, the whole building's on

1445
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,660
 fire, they've looked out the window, their swimming pool is below them.

1446
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:02,700
 And they think, "Yes, they leaped down to safety, landed it, a giant bucket comes down,

1447
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:11,780
 picks them up and trumps them back into the fire."

1448
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,780
 Okay, that's it.

1449
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,900
 That is all of our facts.

00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,260
