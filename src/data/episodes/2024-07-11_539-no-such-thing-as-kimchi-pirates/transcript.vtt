00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.700
 Very quickly, just to remind you, we are going on tour in the very, very near future.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.220
 So if you are in Edinburgh, Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London or Manchester,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.120
 we are coming to your city.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.060
 We'll then be going off to Australia and New Zealand, almost all of those tickets are

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.060
 sold out.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.240
 If you are in the UK or Ireland, then do get your tickets as soon as you possibly can.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.920
 It's going to be a whole load of fun.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.920
 We're going to do a podcast.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.360
 It's going to be an all new podcast every night, but then there's also going to be loads

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.240
 of extra fun stuff happening, which you would never get if you only listened to this free

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.640
 podcast.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.520
 And the hope is that we'll be there afterwards to say hi to everyone and sign whatever you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.560
 want signing and take lots of selfies, because actually one of the main fun bits about doing

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.760
 these shows is getting to meet you guys.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.820
 So we can't wait to be on tour and we hope that lots of you come to join us to find out

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 more about that.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.180
 And to get your tickets, go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live where you can get links to all of the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 venues.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.340
 Okay, not much more to say, apart from buy mine and Anna's book, buy Dan's book, buy

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 Andy's book, you know our names.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.540
 Just go on to your bookselling place of choice and type them in and you'll find all the very

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 lovingly made books by the four of us that are just right for you to buy and read over

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.800
 your summer holidays.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.120
 But that's enough selling.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.160
 Back to our bread and butter, the four of us doing our thing in the QI offices in Holborn.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.040
 Really hope you enjoy the show and hopefully see lots of you on our tour.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.880
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:59.820
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.180
 to you from the QI offices in Holborn.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.180
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.540
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.520
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.480
 seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.280
 Okay, my fact this week is that if you like kimchi, you're a victim of government propaganda.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.800
 So does anyone here like kimchi?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 Yeah.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 No.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 What?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.320
 Well, you know, I don't know what kind of like weird political messages I'm propounding,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.000
 although I quite like South Korea, they're not doing too bad these days.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.100
 Do you like BTS?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.620
 Do you watch Squid Game?

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.120
 Did you enjoy Parasite at the movies?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360
 I don't know what BTS is, but the other two things I did.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 Wow.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.480
 Did you dance to Gangnam Style when it came out all those years ago?

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.780
 All these things are part of How You, which is a South Korean government promoted push

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.500
 of the country's culture.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.100
 And this is all about diplomatic cultural exchanges between countries.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.820
 And at the moment, Korea are especially good at it.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.820
 Yeah.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.820
 So what are they doing?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.640
 Are they sort of responsible for kimchi advertising worldwide and stuff or getting in front of

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640
 me?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 Absolutely.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 So they might pay TV broadcasters in Europe or in the U.S. to have documentaries about

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.960
 Korean dishes.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.000
 They might get newspapers to write about Korean dishes.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.360
 They might provide assistance to restaurants that are going to have Korean food on the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360
 menus.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.120
 This is crazy because I'm obsessed with bibimbap.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120
 Yeah.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 I love it.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 Same.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120
 Yeah.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.180
 Well, that's why, because they started this around 1996.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.180
 That's perfect timing.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.400
 The timing matches up by day.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.300
 So what had happened was Korea had had a problem economically.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.820
 There was a big crash around the mid-90s and the government had to ask the IMF for an

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.660
 emergency loan and it was a big embarrassment to the whole country.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.500
 And around the same time, Japan was making its own kimchi and they were selling that around

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.800
 the world, much to the chagran of the South Koreans because the only good kimchi comes

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.200
 from South Korea and they put those two things together and a couple of presidents decided

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.520
 that they were going to rebrand the nation.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.680
 I completely understand that.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680
 Yeah.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 I mean, countries do it all the time.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.440
 I can also see who the propagandists worked on.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.080
 They don't make good kimchi in the world.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.520
 Imagine if France started making pork pies.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520
 I'd be furious.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520
 Would you?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 Yeah.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.040
 And then you went and you travelled to China and they were like, "Oh, have you heard about

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040
 the French pork pies?"

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.780
 The French Milton Mubri.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.580
 I would feel patriotic suddenly.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 Yeah.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.840
 So South Korean kimchi, it's all this particular kind of cabbage, isn't it called a napa cabbage?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.840
 Yeah.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.840
 So I should quickly say what kimchi is.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.280
 It is a fermented vegetable and fish relish.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.820
 You kind of get loads of vegetables and fish paste and stuff like that.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.720
 You put it in a big bundle of cabbage and then you put it in brine and you leave it to ferment

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.280
 and then it becomes, to some people, delicious, I personally can't stand it.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 Really?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.680
 I have a problem with fermented food in general.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 Interesting.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.680
 I don't know why.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.760
 It's the national dish of North and South Korea.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.120
 There are 2 million tons of it eaten in the South alone every year.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 Over 60% of people in South Korea eat kimchi at three meals a day.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 It's a lot.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 Yeah.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.440
 And even this is, I love this, there's a ritual, a traditional thing where every autumn

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440
 families make their own kimchi, right?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.880
 And I think it's called Kimjang.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.880
 Yeah.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.400
 And it's a sort of, it's a traditional thing, obviously not everyone does it.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.720
 Some people just get this from the supermarket.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.920
 But Samsung, the electronics giant, make special kimchi fridges and thousands of people in

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.160
 South Korea have a fridge that's just for the kimchi.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160
 I don't think thousands.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.800
 I think it's 98% of the population.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 Yeah, it's everyone.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 It's literally everyone in South Korea.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 Yeah, thousands.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 I just mean many thousands.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800
 You're not specifying.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.800
 Thousands.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 Thousands of thousands.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 It's stunning.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.920
 And there's supposedly, it feels like a massive swizz to me because all those special kimchi

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.320
 features are things like it stays the same temperature.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.320
 No, no, it is important because most your fridge at home is going to be around three

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.640
 or four degrees.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.320
 But if you put kimchi in that fridge, it'll go off in a few days.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320
 Yeah.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.320
 It needs to be colder.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320
 It needs to be colder.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320
 And then it needs to be less airflow going around.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320
 Yeah, I love that.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320
 It's got less moving air.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.320
 No, no, it needs to be warmer than a freezer.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.600
 No, I can't think of a single temperature warmer than freezing.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.760
 Let me tell you one degree, which is the exact temperature.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.800
 Because the traditional way to keep it is you'd bury it outside.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.760
 So you'd make it in the autumn, you'd bury it outside and during the winter it would

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.760
 stay at one degree.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.000
 Do you think there's lots of buried kimchi still in South Korea?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.400
 Is it like squirrels, do you reckon?

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400
 Oh, there must be.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400
 And there's just, they can never find it again.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.960
 Kimchi pirates just going around trying to find the lost buried treasure.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.960
 Yeah.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.960
 Mr Kim.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.600
 Let you open it and it is just rotten fish and vegetables.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.320
 Is it the thing that it never goes off?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.320
 If it's at the right.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.320
 I will.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.320
 It can't.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320
 It's fermented.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.720
 Not many more months, but I think it would eventually go off.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.240
 Can I tell you a kimchi saying?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240
 Yeah, please.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.840
 Don't drink kimchi soup thinking that someone will give you rice cake.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.280
 Translation, translation please.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.280
 Don't do that.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.680
 So it's don't do something, expecting something else will happen.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.560
 So it's like look before you leap.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.880
 Oh, that's quite good.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.120
 Say one more time.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.560
 Don't drink kimchi soup thinking that someone will give you rice cake.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.800
 Or is it just literal?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.640
 It's just, this is bad etiquette.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.040
 No, there's a pretty exact analogy actually.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.840
 Is there a reason you'd want rice cake after kimchi soup?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.760
 It comes next in the traditional form of the meal.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760
 Right.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.920
 That is what you would expect.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.000
 So don't do phase one of a process, assuming someone's going to help you out with the next

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 bit.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Right.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 So what's the British phrase that...

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Is it not that?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.560
 That's a very common phrase one.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.520
 It's like my old grandma used to say, don't do phase one of a process.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.160
 It's just don't count your chickens, you know, don't assume, it's not guaranteed that you'll

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.360
 get rice cake, just because you're going to kimchi soup, but in that case it sort of is

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.360
 guaranteed because you're having a traditional Korean meal.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.240
 Yeah, I don't think that is quite exactly the same, is it?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.640
 Why are you not counting your chickens?

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.760
 Don't count your chickens, yeah.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.320
 So it's like if you have ten eggs, don't think that's definitely going to be ten chickens

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.240
 because one of them might not turn into a chicken.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.240
 Okay, cool.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.480
 I feel like that phrase needs a little caveat at the top that says, prior to hatching,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480
 don't count your chickens.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480
 Oh, he didn't do the full saying.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.280
 The full saying is don't count your chickens before they've hatched.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280
 Oh, right.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.800
 Dad, you've never heard this saying.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 No.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.960
 You've never heard don't count your chickens.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.960
 That's stunning.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.960
 I've heard that bit of it, weirdly.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960
 You've heard don't count your chickens, yeah.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.960
 That's just as everyone knows the second bit.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.360
 What did you think it meant when you just heard don't count your chickens?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.000
 It's bad luck to count chickens.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.240
 So we went to the petting zoo today.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.960
 Oh, how many chickens were there?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.000
 Well, you know what they say.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.080
 That's so weird.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.600
 Only 7% of kimchi in Korea is commercially produced as in that you buy it in shops.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600
 Wow.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600
 7%.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600
 And the rest is sort of artisan.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 The rest is homemade.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.600
 Really?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.600
 Yeah.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 And it's part of this festival that one of you mentioned.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600
 Yeah.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.600
 Yeah.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.960
 And you mentioned basically at one time a year, everyone just makes kimchi.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960
 And it's like.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.960
 It lasts the year, right?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960
 It lasts the year.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960
 Yeah.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.040
 And it's huge because it's like everyone does it at the same time because it's like

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.040
 kimchi season.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.040
 Yeah.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040
 Yeah.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040
 So one has to buy cabbage at the same time.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.040
 So the price of cabbage goes through the roof.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.040
 Every year.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040
 It's harvest time, I guess.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.040
 Yeah.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.040
 And then you buy it.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.640
 But it's always in the news at this time every year saying don't forget to get your

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.000
 cabbage before it's don't count your cabbages.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.040
 That's so cool.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.840
 Apparently at the moment there's a bit of a worrying time for kimchi in South Korea because

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.080
 they're actually importing more kimchi now than they are exporting.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.080
 They are.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.880
 It's the world has woken up to it.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.560
 China particularly has woken up to it.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.020
 And so if you buy kimchi in a market, let's say in the UK, it's probably more likely from

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.880
 China these days than it is from South Korea.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.480
 But the Chinese say it's fine because actually they invented it.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.800
 I think they sort of claimed that a similar Chinese pickled cabbage fell under the bracket

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800
 of kimchi.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800
 I know.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.480
 But it's like saying, oh, our pork roll is actually a pork pie.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480
 Yeah.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 Exactly.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
 It's like saying that, isn't it?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480
 It's rubbish.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480
 A fermenting, huge deal.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480
 At the moment, very trendy.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.480
 Yeah.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.400
 And I think it's the answer to all our health problems.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.760
 And I am so looking forward to in 10 years' time when everyone realizes that was complete

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.760
 bullshit.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.760
 No.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.760
 We're all going to live forever because of that.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.760
 Because of the microbiome.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.760
 Suddenly diversifying.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.520
 But it's good for you, isn't it?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.280
 I'm sure it is good for you.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.720
 It is obviously really drummed into us how good for you it is.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.360
 And it is such an interesting process.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.200
 So I didn't quite realize that the only reason fermenting happens is because it's dead.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.360
 So the bacteria that eat the cabbage or anything that ferments, the cabbage is spending its whole

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.400
 life fighting them off, and it's just as soon as you chop it, they can suddenly go for it.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 That's great.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.840
 And then it can't just be any fermenting.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.480
 I think this is why you add salt to it.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.480
 You can't just let any bacteria eat it.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
 Because that's just rotting, right?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 It's just rot.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480
 Yeah.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480
 Yeah.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.760
 Don't just leave cabbage out and wait for it to...

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.000
 I'm always a bit confused about what is fermenting and what is rotting.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.600
 I thought fermentation involves the particular, is something to do with the brine and the salt

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 and the, I mean that.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600
 It is.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 But I agree.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600
 I didn't know either.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.400
 It used to be it's just about the type of bacteria that are doing it, and as long as

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.760
 you use the salt, so you sort of feed the right type of bacteria, they turn it, they

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760
 ferment it properly.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.880
 But the thing is, like, there are lots of types of bacteria that do this, and I don't want

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.720
 to get all antibacterial and pro-bacterial phage like I always do.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.040
 But there are some bacterias that do do fermentation that are really bad for you.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.520
 And so sometimes people who do like homemade fermentation, like where you're making your

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.400
 sourdough, or you're making homemade kimchi, or artisan cheeses, or whatever, any kind

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.520
 of stuff like that, if you get the wrong kind of bacteria, it can make you sick.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.280
 And most people who would be fine, like, for the four of us around here would probably

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.520
 be fine, but, you know, if you have underlying health issues, it can be a problem.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.520
 Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.520
 Right.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.520
 I didn't even consider that.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.480
 I really like it with this fact, is it's basically what's known as gastrodiplomacy as well, right?

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.040
 Because they're using food in order to spread culture around the world.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.840
 And this started, there was in the early 2000s, Thailand really were leading the way with

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840
 this.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.960
 There was this thing with people going, why are there so many Thai restaurants in America?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.400
 We don't have that bigger population of Thai people here.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.440
 It doesn't make sense.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440
 And that's what it was.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.160
 It was a government program where you were able to get a loan for millions of dollars

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.920
 from Thailand if you were going to open a restaurant over in America.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.280
 And you had different packages, so there were different styles of Thai restaurants that you

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.280
 could set up.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.320
 The sort of more McDonald's-like fast food, Chaney one, which was just not that good food,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.800
 all the way up to the high-end Thai, which, you know, golden leaf kind of thing.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.960
 And all the arts that you might see in those places might have been created by government

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.960
 propaganda people who wanted to just push.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960
 It's so weird.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960
 It's so interesting.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.120
 I think we said before that they invented Pad Thai for that reason.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.120
 Yeah.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.120
 Right, yeah.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.960
 I think it is like a really important thing and not to get too political, but our government

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.280
 slash our government until last week, we'll see what happens.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.720
 Like the idea of them kind of taking money away from cultural stuff, which is what has

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.480
 happened over the last 10 years or so, is such an own goal.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.760
 Because Britain has, over the last century or so, had so much soft diplomacy through,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.800
 be it the Spice Girls, or be it like Downton Abbey, or...

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.320
 They were there to promote pepper and cream, isn't it?

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320
 Yeah.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320
 The original draft of the Spice Girls.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.440
 It was before then we had the opium girls, of course.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:40.880
 But yeah, to take away money and to make the BBC World Service and stuff, lose money and

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.880
 all that kind of stuff.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.880
 No, it's true.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880
 It is nonsense.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.880
 Are you just trying to get government funding for the podcast, James?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:50.840
 Well, we are a cultural jewel in the crown of the nation, I would say, but there's so

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840
 many countries to it.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840
 It's really...

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.280
 It's not just the Thai government, the USA.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.040
 They have the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership, and they have the American Chef Corps who

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.000
 were recruited, teach you to flip burgers.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 What is that?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.120
 So, in fact, that's almost the opposite of it, because it was specifically sort of...

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.040
 It's more than just burgers and hot dogs guys, and it was about all the great American cuisine

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.120
 that there is, and all the different kinds of American cuisine.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.800
 I've got to be honest, they're very good in a lot of ways at propaganda, but that element

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.120
 hasn't worked on me so far.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.120
 Fair enough.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.480
 But you would get a special jacket with an American flag and your name embroidered in

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.240
 gold if you were part of the Chef Corps, and you would travel around the world cooking

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.760
 for foreign diplomats, traveling abroad, you know, it was a sort of crack unit of chefs,

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.520
 and they did some sort of Native American cooking or different from all the different

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520
 parts of it.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.520
 Grits.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.840
 Probably some burgers as well.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.840
 Grits.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.840
 Grits.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840
 Yeah.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.560
 Movie industries are often used as sort of that kind of soft diplomacy, and in fact,

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560
 there are kimchi westerns.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.560
 No, like spaghetti westerns.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560
 Exactly that.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.560
 What really?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560
 Kimchi...

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.440
 So, the spaghetti western was a western filmed in Italy, right, because it matched broadly

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440
 like the American western.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.840
 It was usually filmed in Spain, made by Italian directors.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840
 Is it?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840
 Yeah.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.360
 So, is this a western that's filmed in Korea?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.360
 It's just what you think.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.760
 Yeah, it was a specific decision by the Korean government in the 2000s.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.160
 The film industry was going quite badly.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.920
 I think Hollywood was swamping all of their homemade films, so they thought let's make

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.880
 our own westerns, and they'll be called kimchi westerns, and the first one was called The

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.360
 Good, The Bad and The Weird, drawing very slightly on American traditions.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.760
 Is it a proper like western cowboy plot?

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.440
 So, it seems very much based on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, you know.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.240
 There are three protagonists who are after the same treasure, who are all sort of after

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240
 each other.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.640
 Is it buried kimchi?

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.440
 That film is actually sequel 2, for a fridge full of kimchi, that's based on for a fistful

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440
 of dollars.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.920
 Dan was looking in very much a don't count your chickens play.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.720
 That's why I've been silent for the last 10 minutes, because I've been trying to think

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.560
 of a South Korean western title, and I couldn't think of one, and I'd argue you didn't really

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.560
 do either.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:09.040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.200
 My fact is, there is an entire railway tunnel in Derbyshire, which was constructed so the

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.560
 railway could be hidden from the Duke of Rutland.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.760
 No one wanted him to get on the railway?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.640
 He never paid, despite being very rich, he's a fair dodger.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.360
 So this comes from a great website called peakrail.co.uk, which is about the Peak District

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.560
 Railways, not about, like, this is Peak Rail.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.760
 And it's about the Duke of Rutland, who, there is still a Duke of Rutland, I believe, it's

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.440
 a, you know, like in the way there always is, there's always another one.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.440
 And he was a big old landowner, this is the middle of the 19th century, and it was when

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.600
 the railways were going gangbusters across the whole UK, hundreds of railway companies

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.760
 were springing up, building lines, going out of business, consolidating, it was just a

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.080
 railway fever had gripped Britain, it was a great time, I wish I'd been there.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.960
 And the Duke of Point Blank refused a railway to go across his estate, you know, not through

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.680
 his house or anything, just across some of the many, many acres he owned, and the rail

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.960
 company had to go underground.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.720
 And there's a long tunnel, it's about a thousand yards long, really is quite a big railway

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.800
 tunnel, and it's 12 feet deep, because they just needed to hide it very slightly from

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800
 the Duke.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.160
 You could do a cutting, couldn't you?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.960
 They could have done a cutting, which is basically a sort of V-shaped trench, and you just have

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960
 it going along that.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
 That would have preserved the view.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960
 Like a ha-ha.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.640
 Like a ha-ha, exactly.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.400
 But the Duke apparently did not want to see smoke and steam rising above his gardens,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.800
 so they had to just cover over, that is a thing called cut and cover, where you dig a

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.640
 little bit and you cover it back over.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.400
 So it's the most pointless railway tunnel, it was probably really expensive, and it's

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400
 all for the Duke of Rutland.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.980
 And they don't use it anymore, right?

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.880
 It's like, it's out of, yeah, they don't use it anymore.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.560
 Did it get beaching in the 60s?

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.120
 Oh, as in Mr. Beaching, I can't recall actually whether it was part of that, but anyway, that

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.080
 line doesn't use that tunnel anymore, and they're thinking of opening it up so cyclists

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080
 can go through it.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.440
 Oh, that's a really nice one, because it's always nice and flat when they sort of use

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.120
 an old railway line for that kind of thing.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.600
 Just for, sorry for it to any international visitors who are used about.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.840
 Beaching reference, I feel like Dan went into his chicken's glaze again.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.800
 I think the Duke of Rutland probably dealt with the confused people, isn't it?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.800
 What?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.520
 For international listeners as well, Rutland, it's a small county, which is in...

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.600
 And a Duke is a member of the nobility.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.600
 Yeah, in front of the Americans listening, a train is the kind of thing we've got.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.240
 No, it's in the East Midlands, it's got population about 41,000, and it's got this really interesting

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:43.040
 fact about it, which is that it is the smallest county in England, but only when the tide

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.680
 is out on the Isle of Light.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.720
 So when the tide's in, that is the smallest county, it goes out.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.920
 So it becomes the smallest county once every day, and then loses that award.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.200
 The Duke of Rutland, he was the sixth Duke, the one we're talking about.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:04.640
 He was also a Tory MP for Stamford, he won Stamford with 200 votes versus his Liberal

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.880
 opponents one vote in 1837.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.080
 And according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and I quote, "His present

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.560
 wealth and future dukedom meant that his Tory colleagues had to bear with him.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.480
 It is his idol to pretend," wrote Robert Blake, "that he was anything other than a

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.480
 stick."

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.800
 Apparently he was absolutely useless, but because he was so rich, they were like, "Oh,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.560
 well, you're going to have to be part of the party now."

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.880
 I couldn't find evidence for, but I would like it to be true, for the fact that...

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.960
 So he never married, and he had a couple of crushes, apparently, and there seem to be

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:45.560
 claims that when he died, he left his friend's wife, Lady Miles, a yacht, his yacht, in his

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.560
 will.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.480
 Which I really like as a move, but I don't know if it's true, but yeah...

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.520
 It's reported in multiple places, isn't it?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.280
 Yeah, it does seem to be, and I like the idea of being the husband, because are you happy

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.760
 that you now kind of co-own a yacht that was left by a dead person?

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.080
 Are you suggesting that he fancied this woman?

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.160
 I don't know if you leave someone a yacht if you're just frenzy.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.640
 Yeah, I think there was a suggestion to why it was left.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.640
 It was 125.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.760
 All right, I'm just saying, if you've got a yacht, you have to give it to someone.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.320
 You've got no heirs, so...

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.120
 You and I could just be mates.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.600
 Why specify the lady rather than both of them, though?

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600
 That's true.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.160
 I think if my spouse got left a yacht by someone...

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.960
 By James, when James died, for instance.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.640
 Yeah, you're not having any of your yachts.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.480
 I narrow my eyes across the breakfast table.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.360
 Can I just say, if anyone listening to this podcast would like to give my wife a yacht,

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.160
 I could not a yacht.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.880
 Scandal-wise, it was interesting, I was reading about the current family, and I found an article

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.680
 which is all a bit sort of gross when you see the wealth, the amazing kind of...

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.760
 It's a bit odd, but there's all these tiny details that are so bizarre.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.480
 So one thing is, is that him and the Duchess are no longer together, but they're both living

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.600
 with new partners in very separate bits of this giant beaver castle.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.040
 I mean, it's pretty easy to do that when you've got a castle, isn't it?

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.040
 Yeah.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.400
 If you live in an apartment in Tottenham, it's pretty hard to still live with your ex.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400
 Yeah.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400
 It's all these...

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.720
 You get reports of all these little details that have been added to this castle.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.560
 So there's a button that gets pressed, which opens a safe behind the bed that brings out

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.520
 a giant erection jug set that's just...

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520
 What do you mean?

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520
 An erection jug set?

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:30.080
 It's like a penis erection done as a jug, but it's hidden in a safe behind the bed.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.080
 Right.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.280
 That you can sort of have reveal.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280
 It's very odd.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.280
 It's just the way you said an erection jug set.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.840
 Like we all knew what that was.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840
 That's a phrase back in Australia.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.160
 It's like the Counted Chickens of Oz.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.240
 You clarified a penis erection.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.680
 Oh, a penis erection.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680
 Oh, dear.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.680
 I did not know that, that's very...

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680
 Who installed that?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.120
 Have you seen this?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120
 No.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.640
 It's just reported in this article.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.320
 The interviewer sat down to chat to him.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.760
 He sat on a sofa with a photo next to him that was framed in sign that says, "Dear David,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.520
 looking forward to the time when I can completely cut off your head.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520
 Love from Rambo."

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.880
 It's from Sylvester Stallone.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.000
 To David, the current Duke.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.400
 They got their earl ships slash juke them, slash all that kind of stuff in the wars of

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.200
 the roses, I think, and they became earls.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.400
 And then during this time when they were becoming politicians with the wigs, that's when they

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.600
 became dukes.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.760
 So for American listeners, an earl is less than a duke.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.960
 And for ordinary British people, it's really...

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.440
 But the 5th Earl of Rutland supposedly wrote Shakespeare's plays.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440
 Oh, good.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440
 Yeah.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440
 Who was that then?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.600
 He's the 5th Earl of Rutland.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.440
 He will have been called something manners, because they're all called manners, aren't

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440
 they?

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440
 Yeah.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
 A lot of them are James Manners.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440
 Right.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.360
 And the evidence is that he had a close relationship with the Earl of Southampton, who also didn't

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.880
 write the plays of James Manners.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.560
 I think they were interested in each other's penis erections, but the poem Venus and the

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.480
 Donis was dedicated to the Earl of Southampton, and we don't have much evidence that Shakespeare

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.480
 knew him.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.480
 Right.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.480
 But we do know that this guy knew him.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.760
 But also Rutland went to Italy and taught, and two of his students were called Rosencrantz

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 and Gildestern.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760
 What?

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760
 Oh.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.760
 The actual names.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.760
 Yeah.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760
 With those, what the hell?

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.280
 They're definitely 100% where students, when he was teaching in Padua, so that's how

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280
 he should have led with that evidence.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.280
 Yeah.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.280
 He has to be asked to resist on.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.280
 No way.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.920
 I thought they were sort of made up words by Shakespeare, who as it turns out is this

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920
 random Duke.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.000
 Can I tell you about a member of the Manners family?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Yeah.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 He was a slightly more recent one.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.760
 I think it was late 19th, 30th, 20th century, so his Ralph Ptolemac was his name.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.240
 And he was very fond of history.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.880
 He had 15 children.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.000
 The names included his first names, Plantagenet, Saxon.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Love it.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.160
 Iduolo, Leonès, Lílf, Lyona, Lyonella, Leonetta, and a boy who was, he became a captain in

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.400
 the First World War, right?

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.520
 His name was Lyonae, Sextus, Dennis, Oswald, Fraudatifilius, Ptolemac, Ptolemac, Dioralana,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.320
 Plantagenet, Ptolemac, Ptolemac.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320
 Wow.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.760
 I'm just shouting that under a hectic situation, but he's being fine now.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760
 Doug!

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.280
 You should have just said Doug.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.120
 You didn't even say my old name.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.640
 Very much the Elon Musk of his day, in fact.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.360
 I mean, he's the Jacob Rees-Mogg of his day.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.360
 Yeah, he is.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.360
 More opposite.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.360
 God.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.360
 Wow.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.240
 There was also around that time Lady Diana Manners, who was useful because she could

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.240
 be nicknamed Bad Mrs. Bad Manners.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240
 Very good.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240
 He was Bad Manners.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.400
 But the reason I raised her is because she was part of a group that I didn't know existed

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.640
 called The Coterie.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.640
 Or sometimes The Corrupt Coterie.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.520
 Have you guys heard of this?

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520
 No.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 No.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.720
 It really sounds like one of those groups that you kind of want to be a member of, but

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720
 it's also awful.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.720
 It's like a Bullyington Club for the pre-First World War generation, and she was really

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.560
 the linchpin of it.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.560
 They were incredibly glamorous.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.400
 They were basically, you took all the aristocrats in the UK, and all the cool ones, who went

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.100
 to all the fun parties, were in The Coterie, and they were wild.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.360
 They would spend their whole time gambling, drinking, but just also injecting heroin a

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.160
 lot, snorting a lot of cocaine.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.200
 They loved taking chloroform, and she, throughout her life, apparently she'd go to parties and

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.280
 liven them up all the time by taking heroin, and no one really minded because, you know.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280
 When was this?

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.000
 This was just before the First World War, because sort of sadly, does taking heroin

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.080
 liven people up?

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.520
 If you're Lady Bad Manners, I think maybe it does.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.480
 And they were all, and this is what you get for being a spoiled aristocrat with bad habits,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.080
 pretty much all wiped out in the First World War.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.080
 Right.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.600
 So she married almost the last remaining one, who returned, who was called Duff.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.600
 Duff Cooper.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.000
 Because there's one other thing about one of the daughters of the current Manners family.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.080
 So this is Eliza.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:04.040
 She recently was fined half the normal amount that you would be fined for a speeding ticket

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.720
 because of cash flow issues.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.360
 Oh, can you do that?

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.360
 Yeah.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.640
 Because I've had two speeding tickets in the last month.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.640
 Really?

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.240
 Although I did get mine halved as well.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240
 Cash flow issues?

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.240
 No.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.240
 Okay.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.240
 Just paying promptly.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.240
 That's what you do.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240
 You pay within 28 days, you get a half.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.080
 No, mine happened within two minutes of each other, so they said it was the same lapse

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.080
 of judgement.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.120
 If you just stay speeding, that's what that film is about, actually, with Keanu Reeves.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.960
 Just trying not to avoid getting two tickets.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.760
 Can I tell you an aristocratic railway thing?

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760
 Yeah.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.760
 Yeah.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.920
 Back to the old Duke of Rutland.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.160
 So, Dukes loved opposing railways.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.560
 It was for a while their main hobby.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.960
 I mean, they were being built on their land, right?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.960
 Completely.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.520
 They didn't take their sides, but actually, the whole country was being dug up for railways

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.320
 at that time, which is a good thing, of course, but they owned most of the land, so...

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320
 Exactly.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.760
 And there were lots of clashes, because you could have your land compulsorily purchased.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.400
 And railway makers wanted to build straight, normal routes over relatively flat ground,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.600
 because that's obviously what you'd build a railway.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.560
 And Dukes would sometimes, or landowners would sometimes hire thugs to stop surveyors surveying

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.080
 the land for a railway, as then they would hire gangs of heavies to go and beat up the

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.640
 surveyors who were just trying to say, "Oh, yes, it could go over there, couldn't it?"

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.640
 And they had to do it at night, or they had to have decoy teams of surveyors, the railway

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.640
 companies.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.320
 It's quite hard to survey at night, I would say.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320
 You're right.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.520
 It does rely on vision quite extensively.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.520
 Yeah.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.520
 But it was such...

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.640
 It was a violent time.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.640
 One railway company was warned, "We have barricaded the towing path and have in readiness

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.680
 a few cannons from Lord Harborer's yacht."

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:43.320
 But it was genuinely a perilous time, all except the third Duke of Sutherland, who built

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.720
 his own private railway line, and loved it, and would drive it himself.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.720
 Yeah.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720
 And he was one of the...

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720
 I admire this guy so much.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.400
 He had a cab built with a four-person upholstered seat at the back, right, so that the Duke could

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.560
 sit in the cab while the driver was driving it.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.400
 So you literally up front in the engine.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.800
 Oh, in the train.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800
 Right, right.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.520
 So guests he had on his upholstered seat have included King Edward VII, King George V,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.520
 King Alfonso of Spain.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.840
 And was this the original format for that, where a famous person gets a celebrity in

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.560
 their car and interviews with them?

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.200
 Yeah, that's it.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.440
 Kaiser Wilhelm II was in this train, Winston Churchill, one of the key pro tags of the

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440
 World Wars.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440
 And where did it go?

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.360
 Did it go anywhere, or was it just a little obstructive rail outside his house?

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.480
 It is far, far north in Scotland.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480
 Right.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.040
 It's really, really far up north.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.080
 But he had the power to drive his own train until the killjoys at British Rail revoked

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.080
 it in 1949.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.080
 Okay.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.000
 So for me, it's where the rot set in, you know, if a deer can't drive his own train.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Yeah.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.160
 What kind of a world are we living in?

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.640
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.760
 And that is my fact.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:57.640
 My fact this week is that legendary guitar maker, Les Paul, had his arm permanently fused

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.520
 at roughly a 90 degree angle so that he could forever strum a guitar.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.520
 It's magical.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.080
 It's a, yeah, it's, it was an interesting moment in his life.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080
 That's what he said.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.280
 Is it like, he's like, he's like Robocop basically.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.280
 Not really.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.960
 Well, no, but let me hear me out.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960
 What did Robocop do?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.080
 Was he someone who sculpted his whole body to perform certain tasks?

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.160
 Robocop was, whereas they tried to save a human by creating a mechanical body, whereas

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.480
 this guy just had a little bit of bone put into his elbow.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480
 Robocop was fused.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.520
 Robocop was based on Les Paul, that's what I said.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.840
 I feel like he said, hey, doc, can you fuse my arm at 90 degrees so that I can forever

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840
 masturbate?

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840
 And they said, what?

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.480
 I said, I strum a guitar.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.480
 I strum a guitar.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:47.400
 Oh my God, imagine if it was that one day a doctor will say, well, you want to know

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.320
 what really happened.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320
 Yeah.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.840
 So, okay, what happened?

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.680
 This is the story of Les Paul's horrible accident.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.320
 He was out driving on a long trip to California with his partner at the time who became his

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.960
 wife called Mary Ford.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960
 And she was at the wheel.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.960
 He was getting rest.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.240
 He was laying down on the car seat when suddenly the car swerved and they were going off a

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.280
 bridge, put his arm on her, he said, this is it.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.160
 They both thought they were going to die.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.880
 But fortunately, because it was a convertible car, they were able to fling out of it and

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880
 they survived.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.800
 So actually, the very fact that he was laying down, didn't have a seatbelt on, she didn't

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.280
 have a seatbelt on, meant they kind of were able to survive.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.160
 I read that claim that he said, actually, it was a good thing we didn't have seatbelts.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160
 Yeah.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.160
 Are we sure?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.280
 No, that was a theory at the time, actually, because there were motor racing drivers who

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.440
 didn't want to wear seatbelts because they wanted to be thrown away from the wreckage

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.640
 if it was ever a crash.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.640
 Right.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.640
 I just feel like, obviously, we're saying seatbelts are good.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.140
 Yeah, it was a belief at the time.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.140
 It was a belief at the time.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.000
 At the time, there was arguments that seatbelts might trap you in wreckage.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 You want to be as far away as possible from that car crash.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Okay.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.360
 Now, they survived what was said to be a 20-foot plunge into a ravine, but they shouldn't

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.440
 have then survived because no one should have known that they were there.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.560
 But it just so happens that, as they careered off the road, they crashed into a telephone

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.720
 and telegraph pole, and they phoned and in the car.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.720
 On the way down.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.720
 No, no.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.720
 No, no.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:13.120
 No, so when those lines went down, the lines of the area went down, some emergency services

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.360
 came to rectify that, and then they saw this car down there.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360
 This was eight hours later.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.360
 They're like, what's that?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.480
 And they found them.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:25.480
 So he was seriously injured, broken nose, punctured spleen, broken vertebrae, pelvis was done,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.120
 and he'd shattered his elbow, his right elbow.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.920
 So the plan was, they were going to amputate his arm, but a doctor said, no, I think we

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.080
 can fix this.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.240
 And so what they did was they decided to take some of his leg bone and they put it in place

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.520
 of the elbow, but in doing so, they needed to fuse it into one position.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.080
 So usually someone who is having that would have it in a arm out position.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.080
 He said.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.080
 What was they?

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.080
 Or maybe a slight.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080
 I don't know.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.080
 I don't think what I would go for.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.080
 What would you go for?

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080
 Hand on the hip.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.080
 Peace sign.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.080
 Yeah.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.080
 It's all about where it is.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.080
 I get to move my arm.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.080
 Okay.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.080
 It's about arm position.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.080
 No, you get to move your fingers.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080
 You don't get to move your arm.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.400
 I will go for a salute in that case.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400
 Patriotic.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.400
 Salute position.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.200
 That could facing the wrong way look like a sig hyal.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.760
 I will never be facing the wrong way.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.360
 I'll always be facing the king.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360
 Yeah.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:20.160
 The correct answer is for the four of us to do Y, M, C and A.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.880
 So what he ended up doing was he said to his doctor, put my forefinger in my belly button

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.880
 when you set it.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.600
 That's how I hold the guitar and I'll still be able to play.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.840
 That's what they did.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840
 And so, yeah.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.760
 But thank God he did do this because he was a genius of guitar creation.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.840
 I think actually that's why they did it.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.720
 I read that he overheard the two surgeons, one of them saying we're going to have to

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.960
 cut his arm off and the other one saying, well, he's a guitarist, so maybe we should

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960
 try and save it.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960
 Wow.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.960
 Yeah.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.960
 I mean, thank God.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.880
 I'd never heard of, I'd heard of Les Paul very, very vaguely as a brand before.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880
 Yeah.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.880
 I know that you've heard of a Gibson or a Stratocaster or whatever, but I don't really,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.600
 I don't know any of the stories about them.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600
 And he was amazing.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.720
 I mean, he invented the modern electric guitar.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720
 Yeah.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.880
 He kind of, he innovated.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880
 He advanced it.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.000
 There were, there's other claims to earlier models, but he's the one who basically was

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.920
 a combination of an artist and an inventor and just got it out there and people saw it

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.920
 and.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920
 His one went forward.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.920
 Yeah.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920
 Exactly.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.920
 One of the reasons was when he had his accident, he couldn't play guitar for a while, of course,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.400
 because, you know, it's getting better, but while he was waiting, he was reading electronics

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.840
 manuals and he was learning how to be an electronics master.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.320
 So he did this other thing.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.320
 There was a brilliant essay about Les Paul on this.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.480
 I think it was called The Quietest.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:39.080
 It's a great website and it's about how the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody is partly thanks

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080
 to the Nazis.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080
 Okay.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.080
 Hear me out.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.360
 I knew we had to thank him for something.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360
 Okay.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.080
 So he, he did these experiments with multi-track recording, right?

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.080
 Yeah.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.320
 So he was working with Bing Crosby, friend of the podcast, I'd say.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.320
 Is he?

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.320
 I'd say.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.320
 Acquaintance of the podcast.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.320
 Yeah.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.320
 He's popped in.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320
 He's popped in.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.720
 And he, because he wanted to pre-record his radio show.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.040
 And one of his staff found a guy called Jack Mullen, who'd been in the U.S. Army Signal

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.400
 Corps and who had acquired, probably next, two real-to-real recorders from Nazi Germany

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400
 in 1945.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.400
 Oh.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.200
 You know, there's a lot of moving objects about and he's come across them somehow.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200
 And he had worked.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.200
 It was a time of moving stuff about.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200
 It was a time of that.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.200
 Borders.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.200
 Yes.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.200
 And he'd worked out that.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.200
 He sort of back-formed it.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.440
 You know, he'd found these real-to-real recorders, he'd back-formed it.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.120
 And Crosby invested that.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:33.200
 And he notified Les Paul, who comes into the story here, and he added an extra playback

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.000
 system to this real-to-real thing, which meant you could hear what was on the tape as you

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 recorded it.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Hmm.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 That was the brilliant innovation.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Yeah.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 The eight-track recorder.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Absolutely.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Just revolutionized music.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 And one extra thing.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Yeah.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.640
 So, and Bohemian Rhapsody is possible because of that, basically, that bit with all the

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640
 voices in the middle.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.640
 Oh, I see.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.640
 That's the point of that.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.080
 Well, sort of every song is thanks to that, really.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.080
 Well, yeah.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.080
 Of modern music.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.000
 Well, that makes you think when you next listen to something, you know, you're basically

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 collaborating.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 So, yeah.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Anyone who likes pop music, according to Andy, is a Nazi.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.640
 Which coincidentally is, I've already thought.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.360
 He used to do a show with his wife on TV as well with Mary Ford, and it was from their

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360
 house.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.640
 And the thing was, is that he was inventing so much stuff so quickly that was so impossible

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.200
 really for a layman to understand that he'd created a fictitious invention called the

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.800
 pulverizer, which he said, "I'm just going to press the pulverizer, and it's going to

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800
 make this work."

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.040
 And that's where he was playing pre-recorded multi-track and so on.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.800
 But it sent the whole industry into a kind of, "What is this pulverizer?

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 We have no idea what this is."

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800
 Hang on.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800
 So, sorry.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800
 What was he claiming it was doing?

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.160
 He was using a pre-recorded multi-track that he'd already recorded, and they were singing

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.760
 on top of it live for the TV show.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.760
 Yeah.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.800
 Rather than having to explain this new technology of what was going on or every little innovation

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.200
 that he was making, he would just say, "The pulverizer has invented this."

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.080
 Yeah, because I always, you know, hear about multi-track stuff and recording over it, being

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.080
 an invention.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.800
 And I always think, "I reckon of the few technological things I could have invented

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800
 that."

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800
 I always think, "It's not piss easy.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.040
 You just get a bit of music, you play it, and you play something else over it."

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040
 Yeah.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040
 Come on, guys.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040
 It was thanks to him innovating it.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.800
 I'm not saying it could have been done, but he was the one who thought to do it, as in

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800
 his genius was.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.120
 It wasn't technically an impossible thing to do.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120
 Got it.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.120
 It was the idea.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120
 Exactly.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.120
 Actually, I heard him in an interview with The New York Times.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.080
 He said, "The only reason I invented these things is because I didn't have them."

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.080
 Yeah.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080
 So, he knew there was a thing he needed.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.960
 He knew it was quite an easy thing to invent, but no one had invented it, so he's like,

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.960
 "Oh, I have to make it."

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:34.960
 So cool.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.120
 You said that he did the show with Mary Ford, which is true, and that he was in the

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:45.680
 car crash with Mary Ford, which is also true, but she was originally called Colleen Summers,

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.200
 and he changed her name to Mary Ford because he thought it was better for their showbiz

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.320
 life.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.240
 He found the name in a phone book, but she wasn't even known as Colleen Summers in the

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240
 car crash.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.440
 She was known as Iris Watson, and that is because, and this was in all the newspapers,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.920
 he was in a car crash with Iris Watson, and that's because he was having an affair with

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.440
 Mary Ford/Colleen Summers, and they wanted to keep it out of the newspapers, so they

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.440
 gave a false name.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.320
 So, there's some poor bitty named Iris Watson somewhere, who everyone suddenly thinks is

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320
 shagging.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320
 That's amazing.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.920
 He almost died another time, in fact, didn't he?

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.080
 He almost electrocuted himself in the 40s.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.600
 In 1941, he was jamming around with some friends, and he stuck his hand in the transmitter.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.040
 I don't even know how he used to do a hand in a transmitter, but I guess it was more

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:39.240
 janky then, and it electrified him really badly, and I think he was only saved because

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.280
 his basis threw himself at him and got him away from it just before he died.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.700
 He was, I think, fully unconscious, had to be entirely immersed in a tub of ice immediately

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.200
 afterwards, which apparently helped.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.400
 I don't know if it does, but that's what they did anyway, I guess, and then he spent

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:59.880
 weeks in full head-to-toe comedy bandages, which again, I don't know if that helps either,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880
 but yeah.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880
 That's amazing.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880
 He almost died then, so.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880
 Wow.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.880
 That must have been hard for him to wank when he was in there.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880
 Oh, God.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.600
 You got the tissues ready made, though, haven't you?

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.040
 Guitars are so innovative with the engineering side of their instruments.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.880
 Brian May made his own guitar, which he still uses.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.480
 Hendrix just used to walk around with a broom handle, just a big broom because he couldn't

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.920
 afford a guitar, but he just wanted to practice the movement and shapes on it, so everywhere

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.680
 he went, he just had a mop, basically, and then when he got a guitar, he was left-handed,

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.100
 but there was only right-handed guitars around him, so he had to learn it both upside down,

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.360
 or then he would have to take someone's guitar, un-string all the strings, re-string it backwards.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.080
 Could be a left-handed broom, or...

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.080
 Good point.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.120
 It might have been the worst, only right-handed ones, yeah.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120
 Did he re-string...

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.120
 Is it like putting the toilet seat down?

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.520
 Did he re-string the strings before he gave it back to the person?

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520
 You would.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.520
 That'd be annoying.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.520
 Yeah.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.400
 Yeah, one of the most influential guitarists of the 20th century was someone I hadn't

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.920
 heard of called Libba Cotten, so she was born in 1893, and she was a folk and blues musician,

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:11.240
 and lots of people say that they were influenced by her, so she was a big influence in like

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:15.520
 bluegrass and jazz and stuff like that, and it's very plinky-plunky, plicky-plucky the

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.800
 way she plays, but she was left-handed, and again, so she was, I think, about 12 when

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.760
 she saved enough money for my job, she was working to get a guitar, but yeah, had to

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.760
 flip it upside down, as you do, and so she would always play the high notes with her

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.920
 thumb and finger, and then the low notes with her little finger, and she was amazing, so

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.680
 she played from age 12 to 17, she wrote a couple of songs, but people didn't hear about

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.680
 her, she then got married, stopped playing until her 50s, and then she bumped into in

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.400
 a department store, in fact, she rescued the daughter of a woman called Ruth Seeger, who

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.320
 was a kind of famous musician, and she became their housekeeper and re-taught herself a

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.960
 guitar from scratch, again, still playing it back to front, and she released these songs

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.640
 that became huge influences, and they, like, shot into the charts, I think Bob Dylan says

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.400
 he's massively influenced by her.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.200
 Because she just sounded different than any other guitarist, right, because she was playing

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200
 it in this different way.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.440
 Yeah, the plicky-ploppy way.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.440
 It is amazing.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.160
 Like, and it's often necessity as the mother of invention, because you don't have teachers

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.640
 in those days, you would just learn it.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.120
 Yeah, you're just self-taught, so you do it.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.920
 Have you heard of Carol Kaye?

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.920
 Yeah.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920
 Throwing the Beach Boys.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.680
 Yeah, so she was the bass player in Good Vibrations, for instance, but not just the Beach Boys.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.960
 She was the bass player for These Boots Are Made For Walking, La Bamba, I'm A Believer,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.840
 the theme for the Batman TV show, Suspicious Minds, Riding Stone Cowboy, like, pretty much

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.960
 any song you can name from the '60s and '70s, she was the bass player in it, and she had

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.320
 a different way of playing, just like this woman you were talking about, Anna, because

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.880
 she started off as a normal guitarist, an acoustic guitarist, and so she would play

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:57.080
 with a pick, and she then turned up at a session, and the bassist hadn't turned up, and they

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.280
 said, "Oh, can you play bass?"

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.760
 And she was like, "Okay, fine, it's just pretty much the same.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.760
 I'll be able to do it."

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.080
 And so she always played bass with a pick, whereas normally you would play bass with

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.080
 your fingers.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.480
 But her sound was so different than anyone else, and she just became the one bassist

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.480
 that everyone wanted on it.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.480
 So you're like, "What, easy technology?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.040
 All you need is that idea."

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.640
 Yeah, but if you do watch any old Beach Boys documentaries of the making of that period,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.120
 the sort of love that comes out from Brian Wilson watching her play is pretty phenomenal.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120
 It's amazing.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.400
 It is extraordinary, all these names that kind of disappear, yet what a massive influence

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400
 they've had.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.560
 Like Les Paul is a really good example, and Mary Ford, them as a double act.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.840
 They had 36 gold records, 11 number one pop songs.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.840
 They were huge.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.840
 Yeah, it's a lot.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840
 That's huge.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.000
 They sold millions and millions, and I only know him as a guitarist.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.280
 And I hadn't heard of Mary Ford.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.000
 Yeah, but like in 50 years time, will people remember who Dua Lipi was?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 I don't now.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Do you know what I mean?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Andy has another BTS.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Biggest band on the planet.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 Exactly.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 BTS, like...

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Behind the scenes.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 That's what I think.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 That's what he should do as his thing.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Like BTS, BTS.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 That's what he should do.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Amazing.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Is it a band?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 There you go.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Did you know that spiders play guitars?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Oh, they do.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Good.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 They are good.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 Because they've got eight hands.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 They've got eight hands.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 Be like chewing banjoes, but they could do it on their own.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 I think that's exactly what they do.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 Yep, they play their webs as guitars.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 So this is amazing.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.600
 They tune their webs, and they adjust all the different threads on their webs to different

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600
 tightnesses.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.400
 So they're very aware of exactly what the tightness is that they've adjusted it to.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.000
 And that means whatever lands on that thread, they're going to know what it is.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 So if it plays like an A-sharp, they're like, "Ah, that's a mosquito."

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Exactly that.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 That's incredible.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 And they can tell a thing.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Other spiders gather round and go, "Oh yeah, nice web, nice web."

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Who's made that top radial bit for you?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Yeah, they do.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And then they eat them.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 My fact is that firefighters are allowed to scoop water out of people's swimming pools

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 to put out fires.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 I should hope so.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 I would be furious if I found out they weren't allowed to do that, if there was a fire nearby.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Oh yeah, really.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 I don't know.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 If I was a duke and I had a big swimming pool, and I went out to dive in from my big diving

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 bar, and there was no water in the pool.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 I'd all be taken to put out some fire in the peasants' village.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 I'd be furious.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 You're right.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 James, were you the one Tory voter in last week's election?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Well, exactly as you say, Andy, it's one of those things you're like, "I'm glad that's

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 true, but I'm sort of glad they've laid down the law at some point."

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 And this seems to be true.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Firefighters know it worldwide.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 There are slightly different rules.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 So in California, the fire department says you can take water from any safe source, and

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 it's completely up to the discretion of the pilot what you use.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 So if you are a socialist pilot who hates people with swimming pools, you can go there first.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 So they're doing it via helicopter, which we should point out.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Sorry, yes.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Sorry, you're not just wandering over with a bucket.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Yes.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 So there'll be a firefighter in a helicopter, and they've got a bucket underneath, which

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 are called Bambi buckets, for reasons I couldn't ascertain.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 And you lower...

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 I imagine that once you've got a big bucket of water underneath your helicopter, you're

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 probably moving around like a deer on ice.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 That's nice.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Oh, maybe it is that.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 That's good.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 I was thinking, because it looks a bit almost like an upside down deer, because it's got

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 like wobbly leg bits attaching it to the helicopter.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Nice triangle.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Anyway, these are some of the biggest buckets on the planet.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 I'm very excited about it.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Are they?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 Yeah.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Honestly, I spent a fair little bit of time trying to find out the biggest bucket on the

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 planet.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Yeah.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 And there's not readily available data.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 Okay.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 So these helicopters.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 Yeah.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 So they're pretty cool.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 Yeah, and they don't call ahead.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 You know, you could be just getting ready to go out in your swimming pool and you'll see

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 a giant bucket descend from the sky.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Can you be in the...

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Has anyone ever been lifted up?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 Scoot up.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 I'm in the bucket.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 That's my child.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 Yeah.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 So they have to do a proper safety scan before they descend.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 So you'd hope that would include...

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 You never know.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 You never know what's in there.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 That's interesting though.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Could you see?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 I was reading a blog and this guy says, "We can see very well and we will see you."

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 But if you run out and start waving your hands at the helicopter, sort of saying, "No,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 please."

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 No, I go to have a swim.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 I want to have a swim.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 He's like, "We do take that into account."

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 But also what I love about it is that the house is tracked.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 They mark down where it is.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 And if you ask them, they will reimburse you your water.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 They don't bring back water.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 They don't bring back water.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 They will reimburse you the money to fill.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Right, right, right.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 Or if any damage was done in the process of lowering the big bucket.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 Which almost never...

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Sorry, I want to say in defense of human beings, based on, in fact, two separate firefighters,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 they said no one's ever done that.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 Except there was one person...

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Right.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 I think there was one company where it was completely destroyed, like a nursery school,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 where the whole thing was...

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 But yes, I think people don't tend to call the fire department and go, "I mean, no one

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 you rescued 100 people yesterday."

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 Yeah.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 I think the pool's a bit shallower.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 But just hear me out, right?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Yeah.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 The fire department has scoped out the swimming pool.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 They've said, "Yes, we're good to go."

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 Right, the bucket is descending.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 Meanwhile, I walk out, I've got my...

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 I'm probably reading my book, and I've got my headphones in, so I don't notice.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 The helicopter above you.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Have you been there many low-flight helicopters?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 I've got very big, surrounded headphones, you know.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 You're listening to BTS.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 I'm trying to catch up on this great stuff.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 I think it's possible.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 So, it's possible that I'll be scooped, that I'll end up in the bucket.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 I've been underneath helicopters at various heights, and I can tell you, you would 100%

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 know there was a helicopter if it was within, you know, 20 or 30 meters of you.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 Also, you're jumping in the pool with your big noise-canceling headphones on.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 I've invested in special waterproof headphones, and it's a windy day already, so I don't

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 notice the downdraft.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 What proof book?

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 It's one of those bath books.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 You always take us on holiday, don't you?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 I forgot the bath and a caretina.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 It's really big.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 Do you remember there was that story about...

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 And it was definitely fake, but for a long time before the internet really snopes and

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 all that, it went out there at schools, where a scuba diver was found in a tree.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 Do you remember that?

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 It was always told as a riddle, I think.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 It was like a scuba diver's in a tree in a forest.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 How did they get there?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 That's true.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 It's that there used to be a sea here, but over time, you know, like coastal erosion,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 and stuff.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 I think what we're talking about right now is just a real idiot scuba diver that doesn't

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 realise that you're supposed to go in water.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 He's like, "I'm here to see some wildlife."

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 It's Occam's razor, that's it.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 He's going to the beach in the afternoon, but he's going to the forest in the morning,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 but he doesn't want to go home in between the pick of his stuff.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 These helicopters, by the way, some of these helicopters, they don't do the bucket system.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 I love this.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 This is the big ones, I think it's the, there are some Chinooks, which do this.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 Maybe it's some of those, maybe it's a different helicopter, but they have snorkels.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 They have retractable snorkels, which they drop down like an elephant's trunk into your

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 pool and suck up into the body of the, they can suck 4,000 gallons in a minute.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Wow.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 Which is quite, now that sounds fast, right?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 It sounds fast, but I did a little bit of maths.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 It would still take that helicopter 122 minutes exactly to empty an Olympic pool because of

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 the size.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 So that's two hours and two minutes it would take to suck up an Olympic pool, which is

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 the same duration of some like it hot.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 So you could watch the whole thing in the cockpit while you did that.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 And then when you're going to put out the fire, they're like, "I actually like it hot."

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 But the weight must be insane.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Yeah.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 So they couldn't suck up an Olympic pool.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 Obviously, but even the amount you say is a thousand gallons.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 That feels heavy though.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 I know, I know.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 It is.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 Wow.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 So as well as being able to take your water without asking from your pools, another thing

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 that firefighters can do is they can smash the hell out of your car if they need to, right?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 And this does happen a fair chunk and it's often in the news.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Just to let off steam after work.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 It's a long day fighting fires.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 So one example is I was reading about a guy who parked his new BMW outside a house in

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 East Boston and he parked it in front of a fire hydrant.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 This is a big, big problem.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 You shouldn't obviously do that, highly illegal, but people do do it.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 And if a fire breaks out and the fire engine gets there and they need the hydrant, what

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 they'll often do is if they don't have enough people to literally pick up and lift the car

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 out of the way, they'll smash through the windows so that they can thread the hose all the way through that.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 That's interesting that the hose just can't go over.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 Yeah, right.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 Why do you need to take it through the window?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 It's not tight as in the angle on the other side.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 That would have to be really tight.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 What they say, yeah, is it's all to do with if you want the ultimate amount of water to

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 seamlessly come through, you can't have any kinks.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 The reason we often hear about these stories is the car owner say, you smashed up my car,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 you need to pay for this.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 And any time it goes to court, the judge will throw it out and give them a fine.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 So in this case, this guy has fined $100 for his two day old new car that he parked outside.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 Wait, he was fined for making a fuss?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 So it's like, not only are you not being reimbursed, but we're also fining you for what you did.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 Have we talked about fireman's poles before?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 I'm not sure we have.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 So it used to be that you'd have the fire engine on the ground floor and then you'd live one floor above that.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 And then you'd have another floor above that.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 Guess what's kept in that?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 Like just old stuff that you don't need around the house anymore, but you don't really want to throw out.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 Yeah, that's right.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 The strippers?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 The strippers?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 No, it's not the strippers.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 The horses though, because the horses would live in a fire station.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 And the olden days would go up.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 But they live on the ground floor.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 This isn't the old.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 This is in the days of horses though.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 Right.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 The hay.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 The hay.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 The hay.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 The hay loft.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 Wow.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 And you would have poles to, I think, transport the hay.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 So apparently a binding pole, which helps you move the hay around.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 You could just drop it.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 It feels like the pole's not necessary in the haydown.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 There was a Chicago firefighter who dropped down the pole.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Allegedly, this was his Fosbury Flop moment where he slid down the pole to respond quickly.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 And the captain of that company, David Kenyon.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 Oh my God.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 So they're basically like, we've put this pole in for literally no reason.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 We couldn't just drop the hay down.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Completely pointless.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 And then this guy actually finds a use for it.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 Yeah.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 And then their crew was suddenly arriving first at every fire in the city because they're doing their poles.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 And get this, only one cat has ever been able to use a fireman's pole.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 Wow.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 Okay.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 What is that?

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 Am I surprised at it so many or so few?

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Yeah.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 We'd wrap itself around and go down.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 Yeah.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 Wow.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 It was called Sam the Cat.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 And it was the mascot for the Long Beach, California fire station in the '60s.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 And the crew taught Sam to use the pole.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 I reckon tons of cats can.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 They just choose not to.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 No.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 What I think is nice is that fireman's poles are still going despite many articles over

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 the last 30 years that keep claiming they're being phased out.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 Right.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 I've read they're being phased out.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 I'm surprised Europe hasn't gotten rid of them.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 Like, EU?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 Yeah.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Brussels.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 No, it's woke, isn't it?

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 Because of woke.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 I'm trying to build on my character of being a produke.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 Of course.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 Of course.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 Yeah.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 Brexit it.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 Got it.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 I think there have been a few less.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 And from what if I have to say, I think there are accidents.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.500
 So I think there was one person who said that two of the people I've worked with have ended

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.500
 up in hospital from going down a pole ill-advisedly.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.500
 Right.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.000
 Is that slide injuries, as in you burning yourself on the friction?

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.500
 Or is it you've hurt yourself because you've done it upside down for a laugh or whatever?

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.500
 Or you've fallen.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.500
 Someone did fall in the hole of Seattle Firemen.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.500
 Yes, I did.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.500
 Like, well, there was one person.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.500
 What most of them say is it's members of the public, because now the fire station is often

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.000
 open to members of the public or partners.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.500
 They don't know that this is the fireman's pole.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.500
 What?

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.500
 How can you not know?

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.500
 Because!

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.500
 Maybe this goes to the back.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.500
 I don't know.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:57.500
 One story that kicked off a big campaign to get them phased out was in, I think it was

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.500
 2002.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:03.500
 And the pole is you open a door on the second floor, and that's the pole door.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.500
 I did not know that.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.500
 And you go in, I think, often.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.500
 I thought it was totally free range.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.500
 Yeah, I thought you had to just be careful.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.500
 In which case, you could understand someone falling down.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.500
 Absolutely.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.500
 Someone went in and thought they were going to the loo.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:19.500
 They thought it was a toilet cubicle, stepped in, fell straight through the hole.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.500
 That's amazing.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.500
 That's quite funny.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.500
 That's incredible.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.500
 Quite an awkward moment, because you will have shot yourself by the time they get you

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.500
 down.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.500
 Just want to go in the toilet.

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.500
 Just as you're recovering, a bale of hay crashes on top of your head.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.500
 But they're still going.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.500
 They're around a lot, yeah.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.500
 That's great.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.500
 I think a lot of them in America.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.500
 And apparently I think some firefighters don't use them, and some firefighters do.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:45.500
 And some, one of them said his chief uses it, like literally he'll come down with a

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.500
 cup of coffee in his hand, just use it to get up and down.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.500
 That's what you would.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.500
 I got a little riddle for you guys.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.500
 Great.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.500
 Okay, why in Germany...

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.500
 That's not riddle, it's just a question.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:54:00.500
 Why in Germany are firefighters having to fight fires in tanks?

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.500
 Okay.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:06.500
 Is tank German for fire engine?

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.500
 No, but that's a lovely thought.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.500
 They have lots of spare tanks because they're not allowed to use any of their military weapons,

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.500
 because Germany has a famously paired down army.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.500
 So they've accidentally made too many tanks, and they don't have enough fire engines.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.500
 They're going along to the fires in tanks?

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.500
 Yeah.

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.500
 Shortage of fire engines?

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.500
 No.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.500
 Using the big sort of cannon in front of the tank as a hose?

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.500
 They probably are using it like that.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:33.500
 Put a big sponge on the tank's barrel, put a big sponge on the front of the tank, and

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.500
 just sort of squeegee the fire out of existence.

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.500
 Lovely.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.500
 Okay, good thought.

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.500
 No, it's not that.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.500
 Okay.

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.500
 It's much like Bohemian Rhapsody, very closely connected to the Nazis.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.500
 Putting tracks on top of each other.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:45.500
 No, it's a World War II thing.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:52.500
 What this is, is that there are tens of thousands of unexploded bombs that landed during World

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.500
 War II that are still out in forests and so on, they're buried underneath.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.500
 You know what?

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.500
 I don't want to be on the Nazi side.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.500
 I think those bombs were probably not dropped by the Nazis.

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.500
 I was saying it was dropped to get rid of...

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.500
 The Nazis are connected.

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.500
 It's related.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.500
 It's related.

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.500
 I think you're allowing it.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.500
 They started it.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:15.500
 So basically, fires would start and bombs would be exploding set off by the fire.

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:19.500
 And so because you don't know where they are, it's too dangerous to go in, they would often

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:20.500
 have to use a tank.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.500
 And this is recent.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.500
 This is only a few years ago.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.500
 Wow.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.500
 Is this happening on the wrecks in Germany?

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.500
 Because I feel like unexploded World War II bombs every couple of years, maybe you get

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.500
 one, but is it...

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.500
 Is that a lot?

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.500
 There are definitely areas where there are more, aren't there?

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.500
 There are some areas of France that you still can't go in.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:36.500
 Yeah.

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.500
 And is the tank...

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.500
 The idea is that a tank is more bomb-proof.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.500
 Because I still be nervous in a tank.

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.500
 It just gives you a bit more protection.

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.500
 It gives you a bit more than, say, just walking or...

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.500
 Yeah, or a truck.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.500
 Yeah.

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.500
 Imagine there's a fire in this room.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.500
 Okay.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.500
 God forbid.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.500
 We're on what floor?

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.500
 The third floor?

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.500
 Yeah.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.500
 Fourth floor.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.500
 But we need to get out to the building.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:55.500
 Maybe out of the windows.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.500
 We can't go down the stairs.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.500
 Right.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.500
 What are we hoping for on the ground?

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.500
 A big trampoline.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.500
 Oh, like a mattress.

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.500
 A big trampoline.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.500
 A big trampoline or mattress.

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.500
 Exactly.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:11.000
 So this is the Broder Life Net, which is this thing that you see in old movies where you

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.500
 get a load of firefighters all holding a big trampoline.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.500
 And it's got a little target in the middle of it.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.500
 And you jump out and hopefully you're fine.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.500
 That really was a thing.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.500
 It existed from 1887 when it was invented.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.500
 And it was still being used as late as 1960.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.500
 Wow.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.500
 Right.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.500
 But the reason that they don't use them anymore is because they quite often went wrong.

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.500
 Of course.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.500
 It must be so hard.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.860
 It must be terrifying jumping onto one of those things.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:41.860
 Yeah.

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:42.860
 There's a lot of problems.

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:46.500
 Basically, you're probably in a place with lots of smoke.

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.340
 So being able to see the trampoline is hard enough.

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:55.500
 And then quite often people would be like, "Oh, we need to save the safe in the corner

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.660
 with all our erection vases in, so let's throw that out first."

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:03.540
 And obviously they would throw heavy things out, and then that would mean that the trampoline

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.540
 would break.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.540
 Right.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.540
 Or quite often more than one person would jump out at the same time.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.700
 Like two or three people would hold hands and jump out.

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.500
 And that would be too heavy and that would break.

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.300
 Or quite often you would just miss and you would hit a fireman.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.300
 Right.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.300
 Yeah.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.300
 Yeah.

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.220
 Like it was really the reason that they don't exist anymore is because they did save some

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.820
 lives, but actually their hit rate was quite low.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.620
 But surely I'd rather a trampoline than nothing.

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.620
 Yeah.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.960
 So when you say, "Why were they faced?"

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:30.960
 Was there something better to replace it?

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.960
 Yes, there was.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.080
 It was like these big sort of cherry-picker machines.

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.080
 Oh, right.

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.860
 They can pluck you out of your window.

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.860
 Yeah, yeah.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:42.060
 So once you get over, like, six, seven stories, these things don't work anyway.

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.060
 Right.

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.620
 And they managed to get these kind of cherry pickers that would be able to get that high.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.700
 So you didn't need the trampolines anymore.

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:54.580
 I'm imagining a situation where someone's on the fourth floor, the whole building's on

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.660
 fire, they've looked out the window, their swimming pool is below them.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:02.700
 And they think, "Yes, they leaped down to safety, landed it, a giant bucket comes down,

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:11.780
 picks them up and trumps them back into the fire."

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.780
 Okay, that's it.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.900
 That is all of our facts.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.260
