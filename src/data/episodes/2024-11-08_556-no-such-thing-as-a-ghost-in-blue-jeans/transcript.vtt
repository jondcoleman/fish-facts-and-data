 [MUSIC]

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.280
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.340
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Theater Royal Drury Lane.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:32.040
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.880
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 facts from the last seven days.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.640
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.400
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.880
 >> My fact is that the very theater we're recording this show in,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.000
 the Theater Royal Drury Lane was known in 1794 as the Fireproof Theater.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.660
 >> I think you know what's coming.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.360
 >> In 1809, it burned down.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.760
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 >> Yeah, so that's, but then they built it again.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.560
 That's the brilliant thing about theaters, yeah, yeah.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.000
 >> It really is fireproof this time, almost certainly.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.320
 >> Yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.040
 And in fact, I think it's the second, it's burned down twice.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.020
 So there have been four theaters on this, so no, it's not.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.180
 >> What was the chances it'll happen a third time?

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.440
 >> Things don't happen in threes, famously, that's the point.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.640
 So it was built in 1663, no, bad year for

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.340
 people who know a thing or two about big fires in London, 1663.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.300
 And then 1666 came along.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.520
 >> So it wasn't a bad year.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.000
 >> No, that was, yeah.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.400
 >> And did they do a warm up?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.120
 >> No, okay.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.400
 >> They do a rehearsal fire of London three years earlier.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.560
 >> My point is that it avoided the great fire of London.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.760
 Then in 1672, it caught up with the curve and it burned down.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.500
 Then it was rebuilt, then it was demolished and rebuilt again,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.900
 more than a century later, 1794.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.700
 Okay, and that was the one that was supposedly fireproof.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 And it did have amazing systems, like I think they pioneered things like

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.180
 the Iron Curtain, and they had, this is so cool, hydraulics that relied on

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.380
 the river Thames itself, had the water flowed in from the river.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.100
 >> That's cool. >> It's awesome, it sounds really cool.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.180
 >> And Iron Curtain is where the left-wing people in the audience

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.440
 had to go on one side and the right-wing people on the other side, wasn't it?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.660
 >> In fact, sorry, all Iron Curtains until the 1970s were Thames

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.280
 water, so they had- >> Even the ones in Leeds.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.960
 >> Oh my God, sorry, I'm being London centric.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.800
 >> Wow, that's cool.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.040
 >> Anyway, do we know what was, was it like during a production that it burnt down,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.720
 or actually don't know about the 1809 fire?

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.120
 >> It was usually because they had, the lights were made of actual fire, weren't

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.640
 they? >> Yeah.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.640
 >> That's the thing, they used lots of candles and things like that.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.760
 >> Right, yeah.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.080
 >> I think Richard Sheridan was in charge, wasn't he, of Troy Lane at the time.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.880
 And when it was going down, he obviously left the building because it was on fire.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.380
 And he sat on the street with a glass of wine in his hand and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.500
 said, a man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fire side.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
 >> Very droll, very droll.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 >> Mm-hm, that's, yeah, you don't believe it, Dan?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.220
 >> No, I believe it, I just, I can't tell if that's awesome or if he's a wanker.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.180
 I can't, quite, your building's burning down.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.780
 You're like, let me warm myself over the fire.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.300
 Do you know, by the way, because there's a bunch of pubs that are around here, but

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.960
 there's also that giant Masonic building that's just outside of here, right?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.760
 So just speaking of sitting in pubs, if you walk past the pub, maybe not tonight,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.840
 but usually on a lunchtime around Friday,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.280
 you'll see a lot of men who are in black suits with briefcases sitting on the table.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.840
 And they are the Masonic people going inside.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.560
 And inside those briefcases, more often than not, there's a wizard's wand.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.120
 >> What?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.280
 >> Yeah, they still use wizard wands as part of ritual.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.840
 So if you opened up their briefcase, it would be like Harry Potter.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.340
 >> What is it?

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.300
 >> A stick.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.260
 >> It's a wand.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.340
 >> Yeah, not like a classic magician with the two white ends on the black stick.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.900
 >> Oh, so it is just a stick?

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.940
 >> No, it's- >> Is it a wand or a stick?

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.060
 If it works, it does anything, it's a wand.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 And if not, it's a stick.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.060
 >> So they're all sticks?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.860
 >> I think that's what I'm thinking.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.380
 >> Sheridan, by the way, who was the owner who was doing the drinking outside,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.860
 he once fought a duel on Henrietta Street down the road.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.040
 He'd eloped with a girl who'd been promised by her family to another man.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.920
 And this man came back and they decided to have a duel.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.080
 And the duel was so bloody that that was the time that the weapon of choice for

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.280
 duelists became the pistol, whereas previously it had been swords.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.160
 >> What, cuz they just- >> They just cut each other up so much.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.760
 >> Really?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.880
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.160
 >> Wow, that's so weird that in a duel you'd be like, hey,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.360
 you've gone too far, we're taking your swords away.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.200
 That's the point, isn't it?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.440
 >> I mean, they often would just deliberately nick each other.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.060
 They wouldn't actually try and kill each other.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.780
 It'd be whoever drew blood first.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.780
 >> And you're not supposed to maul the person.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.860
 It wasn't just meant to tear them to shreds like a rabid dog.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.500
 It was meant to be one clean shot, isn't it?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.020
 >> Is it?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.220
 >> Yeah, you wouldn't have gone down well in the world of dueling.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.820
 >> It's actually- >> And with his magic wand.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.180
 >> Come on, fuck's sake, it's not working.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.060
 >> Dear.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.420
 >> It's a shame that in this fire, they didn't have one of their famous water-based

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.340
 shows, cuz I think we've talked a bit before about how in the olden days,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.680
 stagecraft was so much more impressive.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.640
 So here tonight, for the listener, it's kind of shit.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.800
 We've got two tables, a couple of tablecloths, and a projector screen behind us.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.600
 Back in the day, they would create a flood on stage.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.520
 The whole stage would be transformed into a lake.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.360
 >> Can I just say thank you to our Sound and Lights team, who have worked very

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.040
 hard today to get this working.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.320
 >> Yeah, no.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.680
 >> Yeah.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.120
 >> But they did used to do amazing things.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.320
 So this stage was flooded quite a few times.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.580
 There was an earthquake simulated here where the whole thing vibrated.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.420
 But one of the best floods was actually in a show that apparently saved the

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.700
 Jury Lane Theater.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.260
 So this was in 1803, and it was a show called The Caravan.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.660
 And after it was put on, the manager of this theater said we were about to go

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.060
 under, they were really struggling, thank God for this play.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.380
 And basically, the reason it was so successful was because it was the era of

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.860
 famous dogs.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.140
 And the star of the show was a dog.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.840
 So at the end of the show, there was a big flood, which simulated a lake.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.480
 Someone's son fell into the lake of a boat, and then this trained live dog

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.520
 every night on stage jumped into the lake on stage and rescued this boy.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.480
 This dog, Carlo, became the biggest celebrity of his day.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.520
 People thought he was better than any other actor.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.340
 He got louder applause than David Garrick.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.480
 He actually had a spin-off biography written about him the year after,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.600
 called The Life of Carlo.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.560
 It was great.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.140
 He eventually got in trouble because his agent started demanding too much

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.640
 money.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.280
 So there was a bit of a scuffle over whether he was going to perform one

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.260
 night and a bit of a riot.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.280
 But yeah, the dog's day is a theater.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.960
 It is an amazing-- just for us to, for a second,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.800
 appreciate the history of this place.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.280
 The greatest clown of all time, arguably, Grimaldi,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.960
 used to perform on this stage.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.280
 And the first ever production of the West End of My Fair Lady with Julie

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.400
 Andrews and Rex Harrison, that happened right here on this stage.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.560
 Monty Python recorded albums here.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320
 Dame Edna Everidge did shows here.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.240
 Like, this is a--

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.040
 Frozen is on here.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.080
 Yeah.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.680
 Is it?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680
 Yeah.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.440
 Wow.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.080
 Did you hear about The Horses in 1909?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.160
 This was a good show.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.400
 I actually wrote down the name of the show.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.120
 This stage, if you can picture this now,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.600
 was home to 12 horses galloping at the audience

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.160
 on a special horse treadmill to do a horse race.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.760
 I think they had like 12 treadmills along.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.240
 And imagine how terrifying it was.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.560
 They were running full bolt at you right now.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.960
 Like an OK Go video.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960
 Yeah.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.000
 Exactly.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.200
 It's the original OK Go.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.040
 That's amazing.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.960
 It's just mad.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.760
 And that did malfunction, I think.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.320
 I think it was called The Whip, the play.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.800
 And it malfunctioned on the first night.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.680
 It also featured a train crash live on stage.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.320
 That's right.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.400
 And they brought on a real train and sort of crashed it.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.320
 It was a real train.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.200
 Yeah, not a real train.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.640
 It had a bit of a different train every night.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.320
 And in the first night-- so the main horse, the equine hero,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.520
 was supposed to win the race.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.680
 And the first night, the horse lost the race somehow.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.000
 Which sounds a bit awkward because it

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.200
 has to change the whole plot.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.320
 And the person in the horse box behind it,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.440
 it crashed and flew up into the rafters,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.240
 disappeared off stage, and ended up

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.840
 dangling from the-- what are they called?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.240
 The bits that hang down from the theater backstage?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.720
 The flies.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.960
 The ropes, flies.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.240
 I think it also-- performances in this particular room have done--

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.800
 it's done weird things to people.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.640
 And there's quite a few stories of the royals that used to come.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.760
 So for example, George V saw an actor called Frank Benson,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.760
 who was so good at Julius Caesar, that right after--

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.560
 and this is in 1916--

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.680
 he had a sword taken out of the props room

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.600
 to knight him immediately.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.080
 No.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.800
 Because he was like, you were so great.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.360
 I'm going to make you a sir right here.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.120
 Get a pop.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.600
 He was in his bloodied toga.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.120
 Yeah, that was pretty upsetting for him.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.400
 You see the actual king coming towards you with a sword.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.120
 And then another king, apparently--

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.360
 this is the 18th century--

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.920
 he saw a play called The Mysterious Husband.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.760
 And he got so emotional that he went, it's banned.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.880
 He was like, that's so amazing.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.640
 That's incredible.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.320
 Never again.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.640
 No one can see this.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.680
 That was Sarah Siddons, though, who

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.480
 was the greatest actress ever known to man.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.480
 I think it was George III, who was mad.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.720
 But Sarah Siddons-- there was a thing called Siddons fever.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.400
 Audiences would go into fainting fits

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.240
 and shrieking in peroxis, and she was the Beatles of her day.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.400
 And they had to be helped out of the theater.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.080
 And she was such a compelling actress

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.120
 that there were various occasions

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.760
 where the audience had to be reassured.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.080
 So at one point in a scene, her lovers strangled before her,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.400
 and she falls lifeless onto the stage.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.280
 And the audience gets so upset and thinks

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.400
 that she's really dead.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.520
 So the manager actually had to come on stage

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.120
 and explain to the audience that she was just acting.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.320
 She was fine.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.960
 You mentioned George III of cast.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.120
 There was an assassination attempt on him

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.160
 in this very theater in 1800.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.320
 And it was by a man called James Hadfield, who also

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.760
 thought he was George III.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.200
 Oh, so there can only be one.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.280
 What was he doing here?

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.000
 This is not right.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.560
 Exactly.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.000
 And they came over, and he tried to kill him,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.960
 and then he got arrested.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.160
 And I think he was the first person to plead insanity,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.920
 I think, and to be found not guilty, in fact, for insanity.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.600
 That's incredible.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.000
 And I think they might have changed the law

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.720
 to say that you can detain people,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.440
 even if they're found not guilty after that.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.680
 Because he was, obviously, a very dangerous human being.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.800
 Right.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.040
 God save the king.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.360
 Apparently, this was the first major performance of that song.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.720
 He got a rapturous applause.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.800
 And then subsequently, people were like,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.800
 have you heard this new track?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.680
 It's amazing.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.640
 And then it became the song of the nation.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.720
 Yeah, it was during the war with Scotland, wasn't it?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.640
 Essentially, that that happened.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.280
 They were singing God Save the King.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.520
 And actually, the Scots were singing God Save the King

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.400
 at the same time.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.240
 But they were talking about a different king.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.800
 And it was why they added the extra verse, which was,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.480
 may he sedition hush, and like a torrent rush,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.960
 rebellious Scots to crush.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.320
 God save the king, which is still in there.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.040
 It's still in, but it's not like it's not a fan favourite.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.680
 Could we mention the ghost quickly?

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.520
 We can't mention the ghost, right?

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.800
 Well, the thing is, is like everyone says

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.040
 that this is the most haunted theatre in the world

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.120
 that apparently has five ghosts in here.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.960
 Now, I don't personally believe in ghosts.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.000
 I love hearing the stories.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.920
 And we've spoken to, just with James and I,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.720
 just before we came on stage.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.160
 We spoke to a mysterious old lady.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.600
 No, OK, so some of the famous ghosts here

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.520
 are Joseph Grimaldi, supposedly.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.400
 Yeah, you get like, if you look in the corners,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.600
 you might see some floating clown heads.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.320
 Yeah, and also supposedly for acts on stage.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.320
 If Grimaldi feels as if you're not doing well,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.640
 you get kicked up the butt.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.480
 And that has happened to a few people,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.760
 according to a vet fielding, on the most haunted.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.720
 But the most interesting thing is,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.720
 it's not about the anecdotes that you read in the papers,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.680
 it's the real life story.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.080
 So we were on the side of stage,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.040
 and we spoke to two of the guys who work here,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.440
 and they often have to go up,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.400
 right up into there where the chandeliers are,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.160
 and there's a big, vacuous space there

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.480
 that they can go in and they can alter things.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.120
 And the first guy that we spoke to, who's called Spex,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.440
 he said he saw some blue legs, just blue legs.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.680
 How good is this guy's eyesight?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.040
 His nickname is Spex.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.760
 Is it possible he saw someone in jeans in a dark top?

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.600
 And can I just say thank you again

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.360
 to all the people who've helped make this happen tonight?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.120
 And Ben was the second guy who separately saw it,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.280
 something happened with blue legs.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.560
 He was like, "I saw blue legs up there."

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.480
 And he was like, "I saw blue legs."

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.480
 The denim jean has been the most popular trouser

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.120
 in the world for a century.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.280
 Well, what are they doing up there in the ceiling?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.280
 Probably being spooky.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.720
 Exactly.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.320
 Panto was pretty well invented here, modern Panto.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.880
 Are we leaving ghosts? We're done with ghosts.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880
 Sorry, sorry.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.200
 No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.080
 But modern Panto was basically invented here.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.840
 Oh, no, it wasn't. Thank you.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.160
 It's just these were you guys,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 because I gave you the feed line twice and there was nothing.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.120
 And James had to step in and that's unprofessional.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.440
 You should have all said it.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.400
 I had to because he would have done it three, four, five times.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.440
 You'll all feel a bit of a bump up your bum now

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.800
 from Joseph Cromaldi himself.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.800
 Oh, no, they won't.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.240
 There was Augustus Harris.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.680
 There's a bust of him on the corner of the building.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.680
 It's fantastic.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.360
 He was one of the manager's kind of late 19th, early 20th century,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.280
 and he basically invented modern pantomime.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.760
 And the shows that went on here were extraordinary.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.920
 There was one production of Alibaba and the 40 Thieves,

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.280
 which featured 500 people on this stage.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.360
 OK. What?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.360
 There is a scene in this play where each of the 40 thieves

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.240
 comes out of the cave, like at the back of the stage.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.920
 Each of them brings out their own band of followers.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.920
 It took 40 minutes for everyone to come out of this bloody cave.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920
 Wow.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.800
 It started at 7.30pm and ended at one in the morning, the show.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800
 Wow.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.240
 And that's what we'll be doing in tribute tonight.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.640
 I'm going to have to move us on in a sec to our next one.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.160
 You mentioned David Garak earlier.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.880
 He ran the place before Sheridan.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.600
 And he had a thing where he wanted to ban young, drunk men

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.400
 from sitting on the stage.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.120
 He said, no more.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.240
 We're not having it.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.080
 But it took him 15 years to eventually get the last one off.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.960
 And it used to be that there were lots of riots in theatres and stuff,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.760
 didn't you?

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.880
 And it always used to happen.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.640
 It would be like the poshos would be in the stalls, like you guys.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.480
 And then the scum would be right up there.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.480
 [CHEERS]

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.960
 It's going to change.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.560
 The greasy scumbags, as Washington Irving wrote about them,

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.160
 saying that if they didn't like the show, they would throw stuff.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.040
 But it wouldn't be able to reach the stage.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.680
 So it just hit the people in the stalls.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.160
 And he said, your advice was just to sit down quietly,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.120
 bend your back to it and let it happen.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.120
 Wow.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.960
 Right.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.280
 It was even King's writer's here, right?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.840
 And this is such a cool thing about this theatre,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.760
 which is that it's the only theatre in the world,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.240
 according to its website, which has two royal boxes.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.640
 Because the King had a punch up here once.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.920
 Again, this was King George III of madness of fame.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.440
 And there were two King and the George III.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.000
 No, it was him and his son, Prince Regent.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.920
 And they were having a big old feud.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.080
 Because I think the Prince Regent kept saying, you're really mad, dad.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.000
 Let me take over.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.240
 And he was like, no, I'm not.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.440
 And so they came to Drury Lane one night to see a show.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.080
 They had a massive punch up together.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.800
 And so the theatre said, listen, lads, you can't be doing that.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.800
 From now on, we're going to make two royal boxes.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800
 Lads.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.120
 We're going to have to make two boxes now.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.800
 I sat in the Prince of Wales box earlier.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800
 I think it's up here.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800
 It's on the side.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.040
 There's people in there.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.920
 Wait, what's that?

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.480
 A pair of blue legs.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.200
 Oh.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.440
 Hey, do you know, just a very random thing.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.480
 But we can't really see any of you with the lights like this.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.880
 And when Barry Humphries did the Dame Edna show here,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.440
 it's got this fascinating document

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.360
 where it's the entire map of the audience.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.760
 And there's a key, a legend at the bottom,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.360
 where anyone who Dame Edna had a very specific joke to tell to,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.240
 there would be the word that would say the type of person

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.400
 that was in the crowd that the joke needed to be made of.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.000
 So before Barry Humphries came on stage every night,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.400
 he memorized the paper.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.640
 And what would he say, like middle-aged man here?

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.640
 Exactly.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.960
 So he would say that in the legend.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.440
 So he'd be like, oh, you know, middle-aged men, like you, sir.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.800
 And he wouldn't know where he-- that was memory.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.640
 He had to hope that that person was still sitting there.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.640
 That was the same with me saying the scumbags were up there.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640
 Yes.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:54.600
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.600
 My fact this week is that the president of Slovenia's previous job

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:04.040
 was to stop people naming cakes after Melania Trump.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040
 Right.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.480
 I was this kind of on a one-on-one basis,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.720
 as in, did she wait until someone had named a cake after Melania

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.160
 Trump and then tell them to stop, or did she just tell people,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.680
 don't do that if you were thinking about it?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.320
 It was sort of the latter, really.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.840
 She said, you know, the population of Slovenia,

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.360
 if you are thinking about doing this.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.040
 But it was based on the fact that a lot of people already were.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.280
 I think it wasn't so much people in the kitchen making a cake

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.920
 and going, I shall name the Melania as companies selling cakes

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.440
 and going, this is a Melania cake.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.880
 No, she had spies in every home, James.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.320
 Shall I say why she wanted to do this?

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.320
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.520
 Otherwise, it's very confusing.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.920
 But she was a lawyer.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.840
 And it's a woman called Natasha Pirce-Moussa.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.600
 And before she became president, she did a PhD in law

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.040
 and immediately founded her own law firm in 2016,

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.960
 which was Pirce-Moussa and Partners.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.800
 And Melania Trump immediately hired her,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.000
 because this is roundabout the time, I don't know if you remember,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.120
 when Donald Trump was becoming president of America,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.800
 Melania was getting a lot more attention.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.280
 And the people of Slovenia, the bakers of Slovenia,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.840
 were capitalising on it and naming all sorts of stuff after her.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.720
 And so Melania said to Pirce-Moussa,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.120
 look, can you send a press release out to all these cake makers

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.560
 saying, stop naming the cake makers?

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.040
 There was a lot of stuff.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.480
 There was honey from Melania's home garden.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.120
 There was the Melania breakfast pudding.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.600
 Sounds amazing, a breakfast pudding.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.640
 There was a local salami named First Lady after her.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.240
 Right, my favourite one was a pancake maker

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.080
 who created a Melania Trump-themed pancake.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.920
 And when he was asked by reporters

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.600
 if he was worried about copyright infringement,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.920
 he said, no, I'm not worried about copyright infringement.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.880
 I don't really know what copyright infringement is.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.840
 So I shall not worry about it.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.680
 That's very funny.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.680
 Yeah, there was an underwear line, some higher-heeled shoes.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.080
 But also Ljubljana named a Christmas tree Melania.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.120
 And the jealous asked, are they going to make them change that name?

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.280
 And they said, no, we have nothing against the Christmas tree named Melania,

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.520
 because this has nothing to do with commercial purposes.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.960
 So they're just trying to stop people from making money off the back of her,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.840
 which I think is fair enough.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.720
 Yeah, not criticising, absolutely fair enough.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.520
 She's a good job.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.440
 You'll not find a single thing in Slovenia named after Melania Trump anymore.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.080
 But yeah, it was interesting.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.920
 And she's an interesting woman.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.800
 She did have lots of jobs.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.920
 She was a TV presenter, Piz Mutsar.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.680
 And came in a lawyer.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.680
 And she was also the lawyer who, when everyone was saying

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.200
 that Melania had been an escort before she met Trump,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.960
 she was the one who shut all those down as well.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.280
 Oh, right.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.560
 OK, right.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.840
 I found something just...

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.240
 I know we'll come back to Slovenian politics in a moment, but...

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.400
 Please.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.040
 There is...

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.680
 This is interesting.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.280
 An orchid named after Melania Trump, made by a guy in America

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.920
 called Arthur Chadwick, OK?

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.200
 OK.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.440
 I'd never heard of him before.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.440
 He's an orchid breeder.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.000
 And you can kind of experiment with orchids.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.440
 You can make your own new variants.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.640
 And, you know, there's a lot of kind of craft and science behind it.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.480
 And every single election Arthur Chadwick makes two new orchids,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.800
 and he names them after the two potential first ladies.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.440
 Wow.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.400
 So there is a Michelle Obama orchid.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.240
 Is there a Bill Clinton one?

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.440
 Yes, because he keeps a reject orchid pile.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.680
 Oh, he doesn't just stomp them down when they lose.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.560
 No, he doesn't. No.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.800
 And because some of them are beautiful.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.680
 Yeah, so if Hillary Clinton had won that election,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.160
 then Bill Clinton would have...

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.880
 That orchid would have been sort of made public.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.600
 But as it is, it's just sort of festering in his greenhouse.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.400
 And he's really sad about that because, you know,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.640
 he says the Anne Romney is a real stunner

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.160
 in a definitely not creepy tone of voice like that.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.000
 Yeah, so there is just this huge pile of orchids

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.240
 that are either, you know, the winners or the others.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.880
 That's interesting. Why does he not just release them all

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.400
 if he's invented a new plant like that?

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.600
 I don't know.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.840
 That's pretty incredible.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.840
 But yeah, weird things that you can trademark.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.640
 Cakes do get trademarked, I wouldn't say all the time,

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.240
 but relatively often, I would say.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.360
 There was, in 2012, a local baker called Mary's Cakes and Pastries

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.600
 in Alabama received a cease and desist letter

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.080
 from the University of Alabama for using their A.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.720
 And turns out the university trademarked the letter A.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.720
 Oh, wow.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.560
 Was it a particular style of letter A?

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.360
 It was a style of A, yes.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.120
 Was it like a font or a...

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.240
 It was a font that they'd created, yeah.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.160
 I mean, but I think her argument was,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.960
 they get eaten really quickly if they're good enough cakes.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.440
 So that A is not going to be sitting there for ages.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.920
 That doesn't work. If I make a Mars bar and I say,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.640
 "Well, it's really tasty, so people will eat it straight away."

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.800
 So it doesn't matter.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.040
 See, this is why I'm not a lawyer.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040
 You're absolutely right.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.240
 It doesn't work as a defence at all, does it?

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.160
 Have you heard about the illegal bakeries of Florence?

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.480
 No, no. These are great.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.920
 These are sort of underground late-night bakeries in Florence

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.200
 because it's not allowed to sell pastries directly to the public

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.320
 if you're a baker.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.200
 What? What?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.040
 I know, I know.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.920
 But the city has a kind of pastry underworld.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.440
 Can you...? I just feel like we need to revisit.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.520
 Do we know why? Is this just a Florentine mystery?

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.000
 It must be that the people who own the shops

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.880
 have their own unions and stuff, right?

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.360
 There's probably some complicated reason

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.480
 which I didn't bother researching, but you're absolutely right.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.640
 I'm sorry.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.600
 But just if we take that as red,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.680
 a quite unlikely sounding thing that if you're a baker,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.320
 you're not allowed to sell bread to the public, whatever.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.240
 But at night, you knock on a door, you go down an alley,

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.560
 you do it in the reverse order.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.560
 You...

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.160
 Come and find me!

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.360
 You go down the alley, you knock on the door,

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.760
 you get a coin, you get a euro out,

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.440
 and you pass it through the window into the wizened hand

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.400
 of the night Florentine baker.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.040
 And you take whatever you're given, right?

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.320
 So they'll give you something. Oh, really?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.400
 Yeah. A mini cake, a piece of bread,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.720
 probably one of those things.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.920
 And if you're loud or drunk, they serve nobody.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.000
 They ban the whole queue, you know?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.600
 They just say, "Right, go away, I'm not interested."

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.680
 They shell a chop for half an hour.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.440
 I was like when one person in class at school was a dick in class

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.880
 and you all got detention. That's it.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.880
 That's not fair.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.520
 That's what happens in the late night Florentine bakeries.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.760
 I love Andy. I've got to say, I love this new method

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.680
 of you making a fact even more interesting

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.120
 by entering misters into it.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.640
 You put a coin through a door.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.840
 That's just buying something, Andy, isn't it?

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840
 Yeah, that's Tesco.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840
 No.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.320
 No, no.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.440
 It's not far off.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.640
 You put the coin in a slit and it gives you a trolley,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.680
 and you take the trolley unshackling

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.000
 from its prison free, it's free the wobbly beast.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.920
 And that's disgusting, can I just say, free the wobbly beast.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.920
 You get kicked out of Tesco if you do that.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.560
 No, down the turn, I've been getting away with that

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.920
 for about four months and now you've rumbled me completely.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.080
 We don't have to find facts now.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.080
 Anyway, sorry.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.840
 This actually is so similar to something

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.360
 I was researching for the Drury Lane fact.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.840
 What's the one thing you associate with Drury Lane?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.840
 The Muffin Man.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.840
 The Muffin Man.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.080
 The Muffin Man.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.440
 And I was looking it up because I just suddenly thought,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.840
 "What the fuck is a Muffin Man?"

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.320
 And in the early 1800s, and he was disappearing by the 1830s

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.360
 because people could afford to make their own muffins,

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.920
 he was someone who walked down the street ringing a bell

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.920
 and everyone knew the Muffin Man's bell

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.600
 and children flocked to the door,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.720
 begged their parents to be let out,

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.200
 just like an ice cream van.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.840
 So you knew the Muffin Man's bell when he came.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.160
 I have to tell you a moment that happened at home the other day.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160
 Oh, God.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.560
 I was at home with my son Ted, he's four,

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.520
 and out of nowhere I was just sitting on the couch

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.360
 and I went, "Do you know the Muffin Man?"

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.840
 And he went, "You know the Muffin Man?"

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.680
 And I was like, "Yeah."

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.880
 And he meant the song.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.040
 He had no idea that I knew the song.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.440
 And I was like, "I do know the Muffin Man."

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.960
 And he went, "The Muffin Man."

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.160
 And it was like a fucking comedy sketch,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.560
 but it was the sweetest thing I've ever experienced.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.200
 You know the Muffin Man?

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200
 Beautiful.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.600
 Dan, you know there's quite annoying podcasts

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.320
 where parents wang on about their kids that no one cares about?

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.760
 You mean the most successful podcast in the UK parenting?

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.360
 Hell, yeah, I do know, yeah.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.400
 Maybe start one of those.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.880
 I'm just trying to bring in that crowd.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.720
 Let's bring things back to edible underwear.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720
 Oh, okay.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.840
 Do you know that?

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.200
 Any underwear is edible if you are determined and patient.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.120
 They were invented by David Sanderson and Lee Brady

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.480
 who were drunk and stoned

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.040
 and discussing the phrase, "Eat my shorts."

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.040
 And they thought, "Let's make some edible underwear,"

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.720
 which they made with licorice.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.680
 And they tried to get a trademark.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.280
 The trademark was candy pants.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.840
 But the US Patents' Office wouldn't give them a trademark

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.800
 with the explanation that the words "candy" and "pants"

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.080
 were mutually exclusive.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.080
 Oh, wow.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.000
 They were saying, "Look, we've proved it wrong."

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.840
 Yeah, but they were saying,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.840
 "There is no way you can have candy pants,

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.920
 so we're not going to let you trademark it."

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920
 That's amazing.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920
 They're not still made of licorice, are they?

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920
 No, they're not.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.800
 Those ones got hot and sweaty and fell apart.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.080
 Which is quite sexy, I suppose.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.080
 But they go in touch with some--

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.920
 No, you want something sensible and durable

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.080
 for those long nights.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.920
 Sensible, durable, and edible.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.240
 Well, I'm made of thick, thick pastry, please.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.520
 That'll be one euro.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:11.200
 If you name your child after a copyrighted character,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.640
 you can get in trouble over it.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.920
 So who's a copyrighted character?

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.400
 Like Dennis the Menace, say.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.400
 Perfect.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.400
 Hamburglar.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.520
 These are names that you wouldn't necessarily

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.040
 give to your children, I guess.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.040
 Exactly.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.040
 And there was a problem recently, very recently,

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.280
 the Home Office in the UK.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.240
 Normally, a benevolent and understanding organisation.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:38.080
 They denied a seven-year-old boy a passport

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.800
 when his family applied for it on his behalf

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.960
 because he was named Loki Skywalker Moebray.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.440
 And they said, "Skywalker is copyrighted."

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.440
 That's interesting.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.960
 I know, and this happened again this year.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.240
 They just gave a fucking passport to Paddington Bear.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.640
 I know, I know.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.840
 Yeah, but he is Paddington Bear.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.840
 He is Paddington Bear.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.520
 He's not named after him.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.520
 This happened again.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.520
 There was a child with the name Khaleesi,

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.520
 who's a Game of Thrones character,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.960
 and they were also turned down.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.960
 They were told, "No, you're going to need a letter

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.960
 from Warner Brothers to get your child a passport."

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960
 Really?

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.760
 Well, in fact, it's the Warner Brothers of Trademark

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.480
 that named Khaleesi for Goods and Services,

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.480
 not for people.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480
 So, yeah.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480
 It is an error.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 It is the worry that they will then turn 18

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.360
 and set up the Khaleesi Edible Underwear Company,

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.960
 and then they say, "Well, it's my name.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.960
 I'm allowed to do it."

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.680
 I don't know if the Home Office thinks

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.960
 in that kind of strategic manner.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960
 I think it was just a flub.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.960
 I think you are allowed to call your child Skywalker.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.960
 James, you mentioned the US Patent Office,

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.960
 and I discovered, in the course of this research,

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.960
 the US Patent Office hadn't trademarked itself

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.960
 until three years ago.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960
 No.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960
 Yeah.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.960
 It's been around since 1802,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.960
 and it was having a serious problem

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.960
 because scammers kept on pretending

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.960
 to be the US Patent Office,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.960
 and they'd call you up and they'd say,

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.960
 "Hey, you need to trademark this.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.960
 Pay us 100 quid, and we'll do it for you."

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.960
 And the US Patent Office was like,

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.960
 "What are we going to do?"

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.960
 And a spokesperson said,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.960
 "We tried all sorts of things to try to protect people,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.960
 and eventually we stumbled upon the good idea

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.960
 of registering ourselves with the US Patent Office."

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960
 It is tricky,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960
 because I think there are cases where it's clearly,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960
 you know, you don't want someone,

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960
 if you're Melania Trump,

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.960
 you don't want someone literally putting your face

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.960
 on a cake that they've made and then flogging it with money.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.960
 Okay, just see what you think of this example.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.960
 This is a guy in 1990.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.960
 He filed a trademark for stealth condoms, okay?

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.960
 Stealth condoms?

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.960
 And the catch line was...

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.960
 Oh, hang on.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.960
 Surprise her.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.960
 No.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.960
 Guys, they'll never see you coming.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.960
 Right?

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960
 That's good.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960
 Okay.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960
 Now...

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.960
 Oh, Jesus.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.960
 Good.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.960
 Now, Northrop, who made the stealth bomber,

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.960
 plain, claimed this is damaging to our trademark,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.960
 and that infringes our rights.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.960
 Now, okay, so whose side are you on at the moment?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.960
 I am on the condom side, I think.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.960
 What if they came in packages shaped like the stealth bomber plain?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.960
 Now I think I'm on the bomber's side.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.960
 Yeah.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960
 And his business voicemail said, "Howdy, this is John.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.960
 Me and the rest of the stealth test pilots are out right now."

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.960
 Yeah.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.960
 There are good people on both sides, I think.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960
 It's tricky.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960
 It's tricky.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.960
 Speaking of good people on both sides,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.960
 CafePress, which makes t-shirts or sells t-shirts,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.960
 they took down a t-shirt that someone had designed

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.960
 that called Donald Trump a Cheeto-faced shit-gibbon.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.960
 And they said that they took it down because it violates

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.960
 Frito Le's trademark of Cheeto.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.960
 And they suggested maybe instead you could call him

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.960
 a cheese puff-faced shit-gibbon.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.960
 Wow.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:51.960
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.960
 Okay, and my fact this week is that Tower Hamlets in London

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.960
 has by far the most 105-year-olds in the country,

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.960
 and by far the fewest 90-year-olds.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.960
 Riddle me that.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.960
 How is that possible?

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.960
 Well, this is from a recent study by Sol Justin Newman

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.960
 at Oxford University, and it's called

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.960
 "Super Centenarian and Remarkable Age Records exhibit patterns

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.960
 indicative of clerical errors and pension fraud."

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960
 Hey.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960
 Killer Tyler.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.960
 And he basically says that while most people say

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.960
 that longevity is due to eating lots of vegetables

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.960
 and your genetics and stuff like that,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.960
 in actual fact, it tends to be people pretending they're old.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960
 It's so good this.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.960
 It's so good.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.960
 It's amazing.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.960
 There's all this stuff about blue zones.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.960
 Has anyone heard of that?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.960
 There's weird bits around the world where, you know,

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960
 there's an island off the coast of Japan.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.960
 There's a bit of Italy.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.960
 There are just various zones where people seem to live to incredible ages.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.960
 For decades, people have been studying the diets of these places

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.960
 and the social customs and everything,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960
 and it turns out what they all have in common

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.960
 is people's birth certificates have gone missing at some point.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.960
 Apparently, the state introduction of birth certificates

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.960
 is associated with a 69% fall in the number of people over 100.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.960
 It's amazing.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.960
 A Japanese government review in 2010 found that 82% of Japanese people

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.960
 over the age of 100 were dead.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.960
 They're just dead.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960
 They're not there.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.960
 And in terms of handlets, is it, presumably, it's...

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.960
 Well, A, I am confused about how it can be not many 90-year-olds,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.960
 but presumably, I think there's a correlation

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.960
 between how wealthy or not an area is and this, right,

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.960
 to the incentive for pension fraud.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.960
 It is that, and it's also...

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.960
 There's lots of different things, basically,

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.960
 but it's the 90-year-olds,

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.960
 a lot of them have taken over the lives of people

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.960
 from the previous generation.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.960
 So maybe your parents die

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.960
 and they're about to get their pension

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.960
 and you decide, well, I'm going to pretend that I'm 65 years old

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.960
 and I'm going to get the pension instead, that kind of thing.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.960
 We should quickly say, for overseas listeners,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.960
 so Tower Hamlets, bit of London,

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.960
 which is kind of a multiple number of names

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.960
 that you might recognise.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.960
 So if you've ever been to the Tower of London,

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.960
 that will be in Tower Hamlets.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.960
 Bo is in Tower Hamlets.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.960
 Beth Norgreen.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.960
 Wow, OK.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.960
 How old are you guys?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.960
 It's so creepy when you ask that to fans, Dan.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.960
 These days, after what's happened in the BBC,

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.960
 you have to ask.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.960
 Yeah, it's like Tower Hamlets, the name comes from.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.960
 It was like the little villages

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.960
 that were around the Tower of London.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.960
 Like Brick Lane is in Tower Hamlets,

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.960
 White Chapel is, all that kind of stuff.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.960
 Can I give you guys a bit of the maths about how this...

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.960
 Yeah.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.960
 In fact, how people who are fibbing or wrong

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.960
 tend to dominate the stats.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.960
 OK, let's say right now, I gave myself 10 years.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.960
 I declared I was in my late 40s rather than in my late 30s.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.960
 I'm likely to have a better lifespan now.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.960
 I feel like they didn't believe you, and that's really insulting.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.960
 Yeah, I'm 37.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.960
 I'm practically in my early 30s.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.960
 But if I did that, I would have a better lifespan, right?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.960
 Literally because I'm younger than my declared age.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.960
 So over time, the people who have aged themselves up, like I have,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.960
 they are a bigger proportion of that population.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.960
 And by the time I'm 90, but I'm claiming I'm 100,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.960
 it's mostly people like me.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.960
 So one in a thousand people who live to 100,

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.960
 then live to 110.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.960
 And if only one in a thousand people are committing fraud,

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.960
 they will be more common than real super centenarians.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.960
 So even if the fraud is very, very unusual,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.960
 it just becomes more obvious because there's less people around.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.960
 So if you meet 110-year-old, it's likely they're a liar.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.960
 I believe so.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.960
 And this guy, this person, saw Justin Newman,

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.960
 he basically said if it turned out that 70% of the galaxies

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.960
 that we thought existed didn't exist,

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.960
 or 70% of the people in the UK that we said existed didn't exist,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.960
 there'd be a massive scandal.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.960
 But the thing is, we all kind of want to believe that people live to an old age

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.960
 and actually, what's the damage, do you know what I mean?

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.960
 Well, the damage is that we all force for ourselves olive oil

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.960
 and nuts for the last 10 years.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.960
 And make friends with each other, yeah.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.960
 That's the thing.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.960
 So my grandmother, my sorry, my great-grandmother,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.960
 she lived to 103.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.960
 Bullshit.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.960
 Yeah, she was 65, my great-grandmother.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.960
 I had a conversation with her before she passed away.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.960
 And after, that's the kind of guy I am.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.960
 Love a séance.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.960
 So I said to her, "What's the secret to your long life?"

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.960
 And she said, "Milk."

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.960
 And that was her answer.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.960
 And then she said, "And happiness."

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.960
 And it was a nice thing.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.960
 I just did a random Google of claims they lived to this age because of,

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.960
 and the things that come up.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.960
 So one person said, "Being single is why they live to their age."

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.960
 Another said, "Regularly drinking the beer Cora's Light,"

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.960
 which is an American drink.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.960
 Someone else said, "Luck and fish and chips."

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.960
 Adding that in.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.960
 One person said, "Giving up cigarettes."

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.960
 That was a 117-year-old who decided to quit at that age

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.960
 and ended up living to 122.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.960
 So there's something in that.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.960
 And then the oldest Briton in history, Henry Allingham,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.960
 said, "A bunch of stuff, but mainly the wild, wild women."

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.960
 That was his thing.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.960
 So there's no consensus.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.960
 It's almost like when you've got a sample size of one,

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.960
 you can't draw a reliable conclusion, isn't it?

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.960
 I think the luck is quite a good one.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.960
 It's quite unlikely on real life.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.960
 Everyone says it's like genetics or this or whatever.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.960
 There's a guy called Professor David Gems at University College London,

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.960
 and he looks after nematode worms.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.960
 And these nematode worms are all genetically identical to each other.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.960
 They all live in exactly the same place.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.960
 They all should be living exactly the same amount of time.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.960
 But some of them die of old age at about 10 days,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.960
 and some of them die at old age about 30 days.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.960
 And it's just like, you can't tell which one it's going to be.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.960
 It's just kind of lucky.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.960
 But they do say making friends.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.960
 Do some of them club together and befriend each other?

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.960
 The worms? Yeah.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.960
 I feel like that's the only variable you can change.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.960
 The friends, they all go outside and smoke together.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.960
 So that's nice, and it's something to do.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.960
 They do say that their friendship thing is true.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.960
 There was a town called Rosetto in Pennsylvania, wasn't there, where everyone there was very...

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.960
 They were kind of closely related.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.960
 There were just a few families.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.960
 They had a lot of social cohesion, and they had a very, very high lifespan.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.960
 But then as soon as basically they let the foreigners in from other towns and other cities,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.960
 suddenly they regressed to the national average.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.960
 So that's a good reason to be xenophobic.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.960
 Yeah, nice. With that kind of podcast.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.960
 You know, Jean Calmont?

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.960
 Oh yeah, so she's the French woman, right?

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.960
 The oldest person ever.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.960
 We spoke about her, right?

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960
 The claim is a bit dodgy.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.960
 She's, I think, the only person who's ever lived to 122, supposedly.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.960
 So there was a piece about her in The New Scientist,

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.960
 or rather it was about human skin, which is an interesting thing.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.960
 And the piece began.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.960
 On her 120th birthday, Jean Calmont, generally regarded as the oldest person ever to have lived,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.960
 proved she still had her wits about her.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.960
 "I've only got one wrinkle," she wisecracked.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.960
 "And I'm sitting on it."

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.960
 "Funny."

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.960
 "Wait, wait, wait."

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.960
 "Funny, but untrue."

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.960
 The French woman was by then extremely wrinkly,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.960
 with deep wrinkles and discolours.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.960
 But they were all butt cracks all over her body.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.960
 This is the theory that wrinkle, it's not aging that makes you wrinkled,

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.960
 it's wrinkles that make you age.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.960
 So does that mean if you have Botox, you can live forever?

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.960
 Potentially.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960
 Wow.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.960
 And our new sponsor, sorry, I should have said this in the break.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.960
 There's a theory that as skin ages, it releases chemicals around your body

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.960
 that could kind of drive and accelerate the aging of other organs.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.960
 So, you know, kind of inflammatory proteins.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.960
 So, you know, that's the theory.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.960
 On Madame Calmont, just very quickly on her,

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.960
 there's a book by Nicolai Zach and Philip Gibbs,

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.960
 which goes through all of the things that her friends and family have said

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.960
 and debunks everything that they've said, according to them.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.960
 The final line says that she's called Madame Calmont.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:29.960
 And in French, the phrase "Madame Calmont" means "Madame, she is lying."

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.960
 So if that's not evidence, I don't know what it is.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.960
 Wow.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960
 That's huge.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.960
 I just want to say, not all of these people are deliberate liars.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.960
 One of the things that Saul Newman pointed out,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.960
 and I think he's won an ignoble prize for his research.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.960
 He is amazing that he's done this.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960
 He's kind of exploding this myth.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.960
 And he pointed out that a lot of people just don't remember their age.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.960
 And I suppose that felt a tiny bit true.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.960
 So in polling, he was saying that in like big polling samples,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.960
 when you ask people their age and then you cross-check it with what you know is their age,

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960
 often it's wrong.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.960
 And I actually ended up on Mum's Net, one of my favorite sources.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.960
 And the woman at the top said, "I regularly have to Google how old am I

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.960
 and put in my date of birth to work it out.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960
 Apparently I'm 50."

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.960
 And then this woman said, "I remember loads of phone numbers, postcodes,

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.960
 national insurance numbers for my entire family, all my car details,

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.960
 my government gateway number, all login codes ever including random number strings,

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.960
 but I can't remember how old my children, husband or myself are."

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.960
 And then loads of people agreed with her.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960
 That's so funny.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.960
 I think it's quite odd.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.960
 Because I think all of those other numbers always stay the same.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.960
 Like your government gateway number is always the same.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.960
 Your N.I. number is always the same.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.960
 But your bloody age keeps going bloody up.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.960
 I lose my bank card every six months.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.960
 So it actually changes more often than my age.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.960
 If you get to be lucky enough to get very old,

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.960
 one of the things that you need to defeat is falling.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.960
 That's the big thing, right?

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.960
 So there's a lot of technology at the moment where it's kind of like an avatar

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.960
 when they get into those machines and they walk around.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.960
 It keeps balancing and so on.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960
 Like an exoskeleton.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.960
 Like an exoskeleton and make sure that you don't fall out.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.960
 We're going this way.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.960
 Someone else is going the other way.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.960
 And there's a system that they're trialling out.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.960
 Destabilizing babies?

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.960
 So there's a guy.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.960
 Those little guys, they don't fall over often enough in my liking.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960
 There's a guy called Clive Pie.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.960
 He brings people in.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.960
 And the idea is to make you understand how tripping can happen quite easily.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.960
 I'm going to just shove you.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.960
 And the idea is that if you can understand how balance works,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.960
 rather than needing a giant exoskeleton,

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.960
 then maybe we could all be living till 150.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.960
 Are they looking for volunteers to do the shoving and pushing?

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.960
 Because I'm so available.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.960
 You want to shove old people?

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.960
 In a controlled environment.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.960
 I'm so proud to be there like that.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.960
 But yeah, I think I do.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.960
 It's a tough job, but someone has to do it, Anna.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.960
 Yes, exactly.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.960
 Someone has to do it.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.960
 Okay.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.960
 The idea is that if they can write themselves,

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.960
 then when they're at home, they're ready for the moment

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.960
 when they trip on a carpet or something.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.960
 What if they write themselves and then Anna pushes them even harder?

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.960
 Did you guys hear of John Taylor?

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960
 John Taylor, no.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.960
 He's buried in Scotland.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.960
 He was born in 1633 and he lived to the age of 137.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.960
 Oh.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.960
 Yeah.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.960
 He was a miner.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.960
 And he started his life.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.960
 He worked in mines, lead mines and gold mines,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.960
 only until the age of 117 when he found he was slowing down a bit

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960
 and retired.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.960
 Anyway, I just found a very good report on him

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.960
 on the gerontology website, which says,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.960
 "It says on his gravestone that he lived until the age of 137.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.960
 "People are now quite sure that he was, in fact, actually, 133."

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:51.960
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960
 and that is my fact.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.960
 My fact this week is that in 1979,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.960
 the not terribly good club of Great Britain,

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.960
 which celebrated failure,

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.960
 had to depose its president for being too successful at the job.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.960
 (Laughter)

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.960
 So it was formed in 1977,

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.960
 and Stephen Pyle was the president.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.960
 He was the founder.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.960
 And basically, it was a collection of people

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.960
 who really were incompetent at things

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.960
 and wanted to celebrate that fact.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.960
 And so after a lot of meetings,

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.960
 they put together this book, "The Book of Heroic Failures."

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.960
 Unfortunately, the book became a bestseller,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.960
 which meant that the president was a success.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.960
 And so he had to leave his role as the company head.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.960
 It got even worse because at the back of the book

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.960
 was an application form that meant you could join the club itself,

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.960
 and over 20,000 people applied,

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.960
 which was far too many, meaning the club was way too successful,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.960
 so they had to shut the club down entirely as well.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.960
 It's so good.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.960
 I have a little exciting thing to say.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.960
 Actually, earlier today, I rang Stephen Pyle,

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.960
 this guy, author of one of the funniest books ever written.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:05.960
 This is huge.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.960
 This is like speaking to God in QI circles.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.960
 He's amazing.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.960
 So initially, I didn't get through

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.960
 because he'd sent me the wrong phone number.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.960
 Yes!

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.960
 (Laughter)

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.960
 And after several hours of trying to get through to him,

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.960
 I eventually got the right phone number and we spoke.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.960
 But, I mean, so good.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.960
 But he said, he never...

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.960
 This was his way of having parties.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.960
 He said, "I never held parties because I was never confident

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.960
 they would be a success of any sort,

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.960
 so this club was a way of legislating for the fact

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.960
 everyone else had parties and I never did."

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.960
 And they had these meetings,

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.960
 and they had a salon des incompetents,

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.960
 where people would turn up and show off their particular area of failure.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.960
 This is who they had at one of their first salons.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.960
 They had a not terribly good parachutist,

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.960
 an extremely petite girl,

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.960
 outlined some of the problems caused by being so light

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.960
 that when she jumps in breezy conditions,

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.960
 she invariably goes up.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.960
 (Laughter)

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.960
 Come on!

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.960
 (Laughter)

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.960
 By the time she lands,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.960
 the pilot has usually finished his tea and gone home.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960
 (Laughter)

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.960
 And that's, like, dozens of those.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.960
 Yeah, so good.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.960
 And Andy's got sitting next to him on the table,

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.960
 the hardback original edition of it.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.960
 It was reprinted in America,

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960
 and when they did that,

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.960
 they forgot to include half of the introduction of the book.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.960
 So the next edition they published in America

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.960
 had a literal physical paper that was an erratum

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.960
 that was longer than the introduction itself

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.960
 sitting inside the book.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.960
 Anything that went wrong was a positive.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.960
 He said that he had these parties.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.960
 When his book came out,

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.960
 I was looking at the newspaper archives of the interviews,

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.960
 and he said he was going to book the Royal Albert Hall

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.960
 for a Festival of Incompetence.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.960
 But as far as I can see, it never happened.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.960
 Apart from anything else,

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.960
 he tried to book it from a pay phone,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.960
 which kept eating his coins and cutting him off.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.960
 But it was supposed to have the UK's only tone deaf rock group

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.960
 and the worst animal trainer in the country

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.960
 with his elephant Shiba.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.960
 (Laughter)

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.960
 I mean, who doesn't want to see that?

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.960
 But yeah, the book is amazing.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.960
 That one...

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.960
 Oh, so good.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.960
 I mean, you could just literally sit here

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.960
 for 50 minutes and read bits.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.960
 My favorite one...

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960
 That's what we're going to do, isn't it?

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.960
 My favorite one is the guy, Roger Moss, in 1993,

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.960
 who was mugged.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.960
 And the mugger took $20 out of his wallet.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.960
 But as the mugger went to go away,

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.960
 Moss yelled, "Give me my wallet back!"

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.960
 And the mugger was so confused,

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960
 he gave him his wallet back,

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.960
 but he accidentally gave him his own wallet,

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.960
 (Laughter)

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.960
 which contained $250.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.960
 That's so good.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.960
 The opening example in the original book

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.960
 is the least successful explorer.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.960
 And it's a guy called Thomas Nuttel,

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.960
 1786 to 1859, a pioneer botanist,

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.960
 who as an explorer, his work was characterized

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.960
 by the fact that he was almost permanently lost.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.960
 (Laughter)

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.960
 During his expedition in 1812,

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.960
 his colleagues frequently had to light beacons in the evening

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.960
 to help him find his way back to Cannes.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.960
 (Laughter)

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.960
 One night, he completely failed to return,

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.960
 and the search party was sent out.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.960
 As it approached him in the darkness,

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.960
 Nuttel assumed that it was aggressive locals

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.960
 and had to escape.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.960
 (Laughter)

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.960
 They pursued him for three days through a bush and river,

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.960
 (Laughter)

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.960
 until he accidentally wandered back into camp.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.960
 (Laughter)

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.960
 That's the kind of stuff.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.960
 It's a real variety, right?

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.960
 It's great historic stories,

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.960
 and the woman who called the fire brigade

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960
 to rescue her cat, which they did,

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.960
 but then immediately ran it over.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960
 (Laughter)

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.960
 One of the things that I got obsessed with,

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.960
 and I have to recommend everyone downloads it,

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.960
 it's a book called "English as She Has Spoke,"

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.960
 and it's by a guy called Pedro Carolino.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.960
 It was published in 1883,

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.960
 and it's an English-to-Portuguese phrase book,

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.960
 but Pedro Carolino did not speak English,

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.960
 nor did he have an English-to-Portuguese dictionary.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.960
 What he had was a French-to-Portuguese dictionary

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.960
 and a French-to-English dictionary.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.960
 (Laughter)

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.960
 So he took Portuguese phrases,

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.960
 sent them through these two filters,

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.960
 and you have to read it.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.960
 Every page is comedy gold.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.960
 So we'll have, you know, common things

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.960
 that you might say in conversation.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.960
 The ears are too length.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.960
 (Laughter)

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.960
 For to visit a sick, you might say,

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.960
 "Live me, see your tongue.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.960
 Have you pain to the heart?"

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.960
 And then, in response, you might say,

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.960
 "I fell some pain everywhere, body."

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960
 "Are you altered?"

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.960
 "Yes, I have thirsty often."

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.960
 And the whole book is like this.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.960
 That's incredible.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.960
 It's such a good book.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.960
 I just take it seriously.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.960
 He said that he thinks that the art of failure

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.960
 is a noble one.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.960
 And it's much more interesting than success.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.960
 Way more interesting.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.960
 And he also updates his own records.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.960
 So he used to keep a record for the smallest live-show audience,

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.960
 which was a pantomime which one person turned up to.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.960
 Oh, no, he didn't.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.960
 (Laughter)

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.960
 The single audience member had to do both halves of that.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.960
 He had to say half halves.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960
 That's so funny.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.960
 But then the record was broken

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.960
 by an Australian folk singer called Jean Mellou,

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.960
 who hired Capital Theatre in Canberra

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.960
 to give a concert of his folk songs,

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.960
 which he did in front of an audience of zero.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.960
 The show overran by 20 minutes

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.960
 due to on-course.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.960
 (Laughter)

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960
 That's so fun.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.960
 So failure in general.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.960
 You might say choking in sport.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.960
 You know, you're doing very well,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.960
 and then suddenly you choke and you end up losing.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.960
 And choking is what happens when you overthink something.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.960
 The best solution, apparently, is wine.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.960
 That is reading the work of Dr Jerry Wine,

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.960
 who came up with distraction theory.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.960
 And in distraction theory, you kind of mutter to yourself

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.960
 or whistle to yourself or just do some kind of music in your head.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.960
 And that will stop you overthinking.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.960
 Just let you get on with it.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.960
 No, but oh, okay.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.960
 It's not like distraction

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.960
 if someone's running the hundred meters and you say,

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.960
 "Oh, what's that over there?"

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.960
 And they run off course.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960
 (Laughter)

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.960
 I think the hundred meters is not classically a place

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.960
 where you run 80 meters and forget how to run.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.960
 (Laughter)

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.960
 Start crawling, run backwards.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.960
 Are there other sports where you get...

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.960
 Is it called the yips?

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.960
 The yips. The golf, the yips, for sure.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.960
 We don't even like to say that word.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.960
 Really?

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.960
 Is it like Macbeth, too?

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.960
 Dan!

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.960
 Wow!

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.960
 Wow.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.960
 Well, we're all doomed.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.960
 Hope you've had a nice life.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.960
 I found a great failure recently,

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.960
 which is there was a TV show in the Netherlands

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.960
 called Netherlands Worst Driver.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.960
 And the winner was decided after

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.960
 one of the drivers ran over the host of the show.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.960
 (Laughter)

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.960
 And I've seen the footage and it's intense.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.960
 They just, it's all jokey.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.960
 You get an inside of the car camera

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.960
 and then he just loses the plot.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.960
 He crashes into the wall

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.960
 and you literally see a person fly.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.960
 And they go over and see him like, "You're okay."

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.960
 And then the rest of the show is the host

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.960
 doing his VTs from a hospital bed.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960
 (Laughter)

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.960
 Going, "My spine's okay, luckily."

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.960
 I think we found a winner.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.960
 We do need to wrap up the show.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.960
 Here's a failure from 2023.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.960
 In Uganda, politicians tried to ban a festival

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.960
 that they described as an orgy of homosexuality, nudity,

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.960
 and drugs akin to devil worship.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.960
 They failed to ban it

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.960
 and the description caused a huge increase in sales,

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.960
 including 5,000 foreigners who traveled to Uganda

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.960
 specifically for the event.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.960
 (Laughter)

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:28.960
 Lovely.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.960
 (Music)

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.960
 That is it.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.960
 That is all of our facts.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.960
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.960
 Drury Lane, you were awesome.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.960
 Thank you for having us.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.960
 Thank you to the ghosts for having us.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.960
 And we will be back again next week with another episode.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.960
 We'll see you then. Goodbye!

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.960
 (Applause)

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.960
 (Music)

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.540
 (upbeat music)

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:06.980
