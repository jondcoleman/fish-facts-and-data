00:00:12,00:00:18,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:24,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Theater Royal Drury Lane.
00:00:24,00:00:32,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:32,00:00:34,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:34,00:00:38,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:38,00:00:42,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:42,00:00:44,facts from the last seven days.
00:00:44,00:00:47,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:47,00:00:51,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:51,00:00:53,">> My fact is that the very theater we're recording this show in,"
00:00:53,00:00:59,the Theater Royal Drury Lane was known in 1794 as the Fireproof Theater.
00:00:59,00:01:01,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:01,00:01:02,>> I think you know what's coming.
00:01:02,00:01:06,">> In 1809, it burned down."
00:01:06,00:01:08,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:08,00:01:11,">> Yeah, so that's, but then they built it again."
00:01:11,00:01:13,"That's the brilliant thing about theaters, yeah, yeah."
00:01:13,00:01:16,">> It really is fireproof this time, almost certainly."
00:01:16,00:01:17,">> Yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah."
00:01:17,00:01:20,"And in fact, I think it's the second, it's burned down twice."
00:01:20,00:01:23,"So there have been four theaters on this, so no, it's not."
00:01:23,00:01:25,>> What was the chances it'll happen a third time?
00:01:25,00:01:27,">> Things don't happen in threes, famously, that's the point."
00:01:27,00:01:31,"So it was built in 1663, no, bad year for"
00:01:31,00:01:35,"people who know a thing or two about big fires in London, 1663."
00:01:35,00:01:37,And then 1666 came along.
00:01:37,00:01:38,>> So it wasn't a bad year.
00:01:38,00:01:40,">> No, that was, yeah."
00:01:40,00:01:41,>> And did they do a warm up?
00:01:41,00:01:42,">> No, okay."
00:01:42,00:01:44,>> They do a rehearsal fire of London three years earlier.
00:01:44,00:01:49,>> My point is that it avoided the great fire of London.
00:01:49,00:01:52,"Then in 1672, it caught up with the curve and it burned down."
00:01:53,00:01:56,"Then it was rebuilt, then it was demolished and rebuilt again,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,"more than a century later, 1794."
00:01:58,00:02:01,"Okay, and that was the one that was supposedly fireproof."
00:02:01,00:02:04,"And it did have amazing systems, like I think they pioneered things like"
00:02:04,00:02:08,"the Iron Curtain, and they had, this is so cool, hydraulics that relied on"
00:02:08,00:02:12,"the river Thames itself, had the water flowed in from the river."
00:02:12,00:02:14,">> That's cool. >> It's awesome, it sounds really cool."
00:02:14,00:02:16,>> And Iron Curtain is where the left-wing people in the audience
00:02:16,00:02:19,"had to go on one side and the right-wing people on the other side, wasn't it?"
00:02:19,00:02:22,">> In fact, sorry, all Iron Curtains until the 1970s were Thames"
00:02:22,00:02:25,"water, so they had- >> Even the ones in Leeds."
00:02:25,00:02:28,">> Oh my God, sorry, I'm being London centric."
00:02:28,00:02:29,">> Wow, that's cool."
00:02:29,00:02:33,">> Anyway, do we know what was, was it like during a production that it burnt down,"
00:02:33,00:02:35,or actually don't know about the 1809 fire?
00:02:35,00:02:39,">> It was usually because they had, the lights were made of actual fire, weren't"
00:02:39,00:02:39,they? >> Yeah.
00:02:39,00:02:41,">> That's the thing, they used lots of candles and things like that."
00:02:41,00:02:42,">> Right, yeah."
00:02:42,00:02:47,">> I think Richard Sheridan was in charge, wasn't he, of Troy Lane at the time."
00:02:47,00:02:50,"And when it was going down, he obviously left the building because it was on fire."
00:02:50,00:02:54,And he sat on the street with a glass of wine in his hand and
00:02:54,00:02:59,"said, a man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fire side."
00:02:59,00:03:02,">> Very droll, very droll."
00:03:02,00:03:05,">> Mm-hm, that's, yeah, you don't believe it, Dan?"
00:03:05,00:03:09,">> No, I believe it, I just, I can't tell if that's awesome or if he's a wanker."
00:03:09,00:03:12,"I can't, quite, your building's burning down."
00:03:12,00:03:15,"You're like, let me warm myself over the fire."
00:03:15,00:03:18,"Do you know, by the way, because there's a bunch of pubs that are around here, but"
00:03:18,00:03:21,"there's also that giant Masonic building that's just outside of here, right?"
00:03:21,00:03:25,"So just speaking of sitting in pubs, if you walk past the pub, maybe not tonight,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,"but usually on a lunchtime around Friday,"
00:03:27,00:03:32,you'll see a lot of men who are in black suits with briefcases sitting on the table.
00:03:32,00:03:34,And they are the Masonic people going inside.
00:03:34,00:03:39,"And inside those briefcases, more often than not, there's a wizard's wand."
00:03:39,00:03:40,>> What?
00:03:40,00:03:43,">> Yeah, they still use wizard wands as part of ritual."
00:03:43,00:03:47,"So if you opened up their briefcase, it would be like Harry Potter."
00:03:47,00:03:48,>> What is it?
00:03:48,00:03:49,>> A stick.
00:03:49,00:03:50,>> It's a wand.
00:03:50,00:03:55,">> Yeah, not like a classic magician with the two white ends on the black stick."
00:03:55,00:03:56,">> Oh, so it is just a stick?"
00:03:56,00:04:01,">> No, it's- >> Is it a wand or a stick?"
00:04:01,00:04:04,"If it works, it does anything, it's a wand."
00:04:04,00:04:05,"And if not, it's a stick."
00:04:05,00:04:06,>> So they're all sticks?
00:04:06,00:04:07,>> I think that's what I'm thinking.
00:04:07,00:04:11,">> Sheridan, by the way, who was the owner who was doing the drinking outside,"
00:04:11,00:04:14,he once fought a duel on Henrietta Street down the road.
00:04:14,00:04:19,He'd eloped with a girl who'd been promised by her family to another man.
00:04:19,00:04:21,And this man came back and they decided to have a duel.
00:04:21,00:04:26,And the duel was so bloody that that was the time that the weapon of choice for
00:04:26,00:04:29,"duelists became the pistol, whereas previously it had been swords."
00:04:29,00:04:32,">> What, cuz they just- >> They just cut each other up so much."
00:04:32,00:04:32,>> Really?
00:04:32,00:04:33,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:04:33,00:04:36,">> Wow, that's so weird that in a duel you'd be like, hey,"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"you've gone too far, we're taking your swords away."
00:04:39,00:04:42,"That's the point, isn't it?"
00:04:42,00:04:44,">> I mean, they often would just deliberately nick each other."
00:04:44,00:04:46,They wouldn't actually try and kill each other.
00:04:46,00:04:47,It'd be whoever drew blood first.
00:04:47,00:04:49,>> And you're not supposed to maul the person.
00:04:49,00:04:52,It wasn't just meant to tear them to shreds like a rabid dog.
00:04:52,00:04:55,"It was meant to be one clean shot, isn't it?"
00:04:55,00:04:56,>> Is it?
00:04:56,00:04:58,">> Yeah, you wouldn't have gone down well in the world of dueling."
00:04:58,00:04:59,>> It's actually- >> And with his magic wand.
00:04:59,00:05:04,">> Come on, fuck's sake, it's not working."
00:05:04,00:05:05,>> Dear.
00:05:05,00:05:09,">> It's a shame that in this fire, they didn't have one of their famous water-based"
00:05:09,00:05:12,"shows, cuz I think we've talked a bit before about how in the olden days,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,stagecraft was so much more impressive.
00:05:14,00:05:17,"So here tonight, for the listener, it's kind of shit."
00:05:17,00:05:22,"We've got two tables, a couple of tablecloths, and a projector screen behind us."
00:05:22,00:05:25,"Back in the day, they would create a flood on stage."
00:05:25,00:05:27,The whole stage would be transformed into a lake.
00:05:27,00:05:32,">> Can I just say thank you to our Sound and Lights team, who have worked very"
00:05:32,00:05:34,hard today to get this working.
00:05:34,00:05:35,">> Yeah, no."
00:05:35,00:05:38,>> Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:40,>> But they did used to do amazing things.
00:05:40,00:05:42,So this stage was flooded quite a few times.
00:05:42,00:05:45,There was an earthquake simulated here where the whole thing vibrated.
00:05:45,00:05:49,But one of the best floods was actually in a show that apparently saved the
00:05:49,00:05:50,Jury Lane Theater.
00:05:50,00:05:54,"So this was in 1803, and it was a show called The Caravan."
00:05:54,00:05:58,"And after it was put on, the manager of this theater said we were about to go"
00:05:58,00:06:02,"under, they were really struggling, thank God for this play."
00:06:02,00:06:05,"And basically, the reason it was so successful was because it was the era of"
00:06:05,00:06:06,famous dogs.
00:06:06,00:06:09,And the star of the show was a dog.
00:06:09,00:06:13,"So at the end of the show, there was a big flood, which simulated a lake."
00:06:13,00:06:17,"Someone's son fell into the lake of a boat, and then this trained live dog"
00:06:17,00:06:21,every night on stage jumped into the lake on stage and rescued this boy.
00:06:21,00:06:25,"This dog, Carlo, became the biggest celebrity of his day."
00:06:25,00:06:27,People thought he was better than any other actor.
00:06:27,00:06:30,He got louder applause than David Garrick.
00:06:30,00:06:34,"He actually had a spin-off biography written about him the year after,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,called The Life of Carlo.
00:06:36,00:06:37,It was great.
00:06:37,00:06:40,He eventually got in trouble because his agent started demanding too much
00:06:40,00:06:40,money.
00:06:40,00:06:43,So there was a bit of a scuffle over whether he was going to perform one
00:06:43,00:06:45,night and a bit of a riot.
00:06:45,00:06:47,"But yeah, the dog's day is a theater."
00:06:47,00:06:49,"It is an amazing-- just for us to, for a second,"
00:06:49,00:06:52,appreciate the history of this place.
00:06:52,00:06:56,"The greatest clown of all time, arguably, Grimaldi,"
00:06:56,00:06:57,used to perform on this stage.
00:06:57,00:07:02,And the first ever production of the West End of My Fair Lady with Julie
00:07:02,00:07:05,"Andrews and Rex Harrison, that happened right here on this stage."
00:07:05,00:07:07,Monty Python recorded albums here.
00:07:07,00:07:09,Dame Edna Everidge did shows here.
00:07:09,00:07:10,"Like, this is a--"
00:07:10,00:07:12,Frozen is on here.
00:07:12,00:07:13,Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:13,Is it?
00:07:13,00:07:14,Yeah.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Wow.
00:07:15,00:07:18,Did you hear about The Horses in 1909?
00:07:18,00:07:19,This was a good show.
00:07:19,00:07:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:19,00:07:21,I actually wrote down the name of the show.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"This stage, if you can picture this now,"
00:07:23,00:07:26,was home to 12 horses galloping at the audience
00:07:26,00:07:31,on a special horse treadmill to do a horse race.
00:07:31,00:07:33,I think they had like 12 treadmills along.
00:07:33,00:07:36,And imagine how terrifying it was.
00:07:36,00:07:38,They were running full bolt at you right now.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Like an OK Go video.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Yeah.
00:07:40,00:07:42,Exactly.
00:07:42,00:07:43,It's the original OK Go.
00:07:43,00:07:44,That's amazing.
00:07:44,00:07:44,It's just mad.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"And that did malfunction, I think."
00:07:46,00:07:49,"I think it was called The Whip, the play."
00:07:49,00:07:51,And it malfunctioned on the first night.
00:07:51,00:07:55,It also featured a train crash live on stage.
00:07:55,00:07:56,That's right.
00:07:56,00:07:58,And they brought on a real train and sort of crashed it.
00:07:58,00:07:59,It was a real train.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"Yeah, not a real train."
00:08:00,00:08:02,It had a bit of a different train every night.
00:08:02,00:08:06,"And in the first night-- so the main horse, the equine hero,"
00:08:06,00:08:07,was supposed to win the race.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"And the first night, the horse lost the race somehow."
00:08:10,00:08:12,Which sounds a bit awkward because it
00:08:12,00:08:13,has to change the whole plot.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"And the person in the horse box behind it,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,"it crashed and flew up into the rafters,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,"disappeared off stage, and ended up"
00:08:19,00:08:21,dangling from the-- what are they called?
00:08:21,00:08:24,The bits that hang down from the theater backstage?
00:08:24,00:08:24,The flies.
00:08:24,00:08:25,"The ropes, flies."
00:08:25,00:08:29,I think it also-- performances in this particular room have done--
00:08:29,00:08:30,it's done weird things to people.
00:08:30,00:08:33,And there's quite a few stories of the royals that used to come.
00:08:33,00:08:37,"So for example, George V saw an actor called Frank Benson,"
00:08:37,00:08:40,"who was so good at Julius Caesar, that right after--"
00:08:40,00:08:42,and this is in 1916--
00:08:42,00:08:45,he had a sword taken out of the props room
00:08:45,00:08:47,to knight him immediately.
00:08:47,00:08:48,No.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"Because he was like, you were so great."
00:08:49,00:08:51,I'm going to make you a sir right here.
00:08:51,00:08:52,Get a pop.
00:08:52,00:08:53,He was in his bloodied toga.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"Yeah, that was pretty upsetting for him."
00:08:55,00:08:59,You see the actual king coming towards you with a sword.
00:08:59,00:09:02,"And then another king, apparently--"
00:09:02,00:09:03,this is the 18th century--
00:09:03,00:09:05,he saw a play called The Mysterious Husband.
00:09:05,00:09:11,"And he got so emotional that he went, it's banned."
00:09:11,00:09:12,"He was like, that's so amazing."
00:09:12,00:09:13,That's incredible.
00:09:13,00:09:14,Never again.
00:09:14,00:09:15,No one can see this.
00:09:15,00:09:17,"That was Sarah Siddons, though, who"
00:09:17,00:09:19,was the greatest actress ever known to man.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"I think it was George III, who was mad."
00:09:21,00:09:24,But Sarah Siddons-- there was a thing called Siddons fever.
00:09:24,00:09:26,Audiences would go into fainting fits
00:09:26,00:09:29,"and shrieking in peroxis, and she was the Beatles of her day."
00:09:29,00:09:31,And they had to be helped out of the theater.
00:09:31,00:09:33,And she was such a compelling actress
00:09:33,00:09:35,that there were various occasions
00:09:35,00:09:36,where the audience had to be reassured.
00:09:36,00:09:40,"So at one point in a scene, her lovers strangled before her,"
00:09:40,00:09:42,and she falls lifeless onto the stage.
00:09:42,00:09:44,And the audience gets so upset and thinks
00:09:44,00:09:45,that she's really dead.
00:09:45,00:09:47,So the manager actually had to come on stage
00:09:47,00:09:51,and explain to the audience that she was just acting.
00:09:51,00:09:53,She was fine.
00:09:53,00:09:54,You mentioned George III of cast.
00:09:54,00:09:57,There was an assassination attempt on him
00:09:57,00:10:00,in this very theater in 1800.
00:10:00,00:10:03,"And it was by a man called James Hadfield, who also"
00:10:03,00:10:05,thought he was George III.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"Oh, so there can only be one."
00:10:07,00:10:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:10:07,00:10:08,What was he doing here?
00:10:08,00:10:09,This is not right.
00:10:09,00:10:09,Exactly.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"And they came over, and he tried to kill him,"
00:10:11,00:10:11,and then he got arrested.
00:10:11,00:10:16,"And I think he was the first person to plead insanity,"
00:10:16,00:10:19,"I think, and to be found not guilty, in fact, for insanity."
00:10:19,00:10:20,That's incredible.
00:10:20,00:10:22,And I think they might have changed the law
00:10:22,00:10:23,"to say that you can detain people,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,even if they're found not guilty after that.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"Because he was, obviously, a very dangerous human being."
00:10:27,00:10:28,Right.
00:10:28,00:10:30,God save the king.
00:10:30,00:10:33,"Apparently, this was the first major performance of that song."
00:10:33,00:10:34,He got a rapturous applause.
00:10:34,00:10:36,"And then subsequently, people were like,"
00:10:36,00:10:37,have you heard this new track?
00:10:37,00:10:38,It's amazing.
00:10:38,00:10:42,And then it became the song of the nation.
00:10:42,00:10:46,"Yeah, it was during the war with Scotland, wasn't it?"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"Essentially, that that happened."
00:10:48,00:10:50,They were singing God Save the King.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"And actually, the Scots were singing God Save the King"
00:10:52,00:10:53,at the same time.
00:10:53,00:10:56,But they were talking about a different king.
00:10:56,00:10:59,"And it was why they added the extra verse, which was,"
00:10:59,00:11:02,"may he sedition hush, and like a torrent rush,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,rebellious Scots to crush.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"God save the king, which is still in there."
00:11:07,00:11:11,"It's still in, but it's not like it's not a fan favourite."
00:11:11,00:11:16,Could we mention the ghost quickly?
00:11:16,00:11:18,"We can't mention the ghost, right?"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"Well, the thing is, is like everyone says"
00:11:20,00:11:25,that this is the most haunted theatre in the world
00:11:25,00:11:27,that apparently has five ghosts in here.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"Now, I don't personally believe in ghosts."
00:11:28,00:11:31,I love hearing the stories.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"And we've spoken to, just with James and I,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,just before we came on stage.
00:11:34,00:11:38,We spoke to a mysterious old lady.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"No, OK, so some of the famous ghosts here"
00:11:40,00:11:43,"are Joseph Grimaldi, supposedly."
00:11:43,00:11:45,"Yeah, you get like, if you look in the corners,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,you might see some floating clown heads.
00:11:47,00:11:50,"Yeah, and also supposedly for acts on stage."
00:11:50,00:11:52,"If Grimaldi feels as if you're not doing well,"
00:11:52,00:11:53,you get kicked up the butt.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"And that has happened to a few people,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"according to a vet fielding, on the most haunted."
00:11:57,00:12:01,"But the most interesting thing is,"
00:12:01,00:12:03,"it's not about the anecdotes that you read in the papers,"
00:12:03,00:12:04,it's the real life story.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"So we were on the side of stage,"
00:12:06,00:12:08,"and we spoke to two of the guys who work here,"
00:12:08,00:12:09,"and they often have to go up,"
00:12:09,00:12:11,"right up into there where the chandeliers are,"
00:12:11,00:12:13,"and there's a big, vacuous space there"
00:12:13,00:12:15,that they can go in and they can alter things.
00:12:15,00:12:19,"And the first guy that we spoke to, who's called Spex,"
00:12:19,00:12:23,"he said he saw some blue legs, just blue legs."
00:12:23,00:12:24,How good is this guy's eyesight?
00:12:24,00:12:26,His nickname is Spex.
00:12:26,00:12:30,Is it possible he saw someone in jeans in a dark top?
00:12:30,00:12:34,And can I just say thank you again
00:12:34,00:12:37,to all the people who've helped make this happen tonight?
00:12:37,00:12:42,"And Ben was the second guy who separately saw it,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,something happened with blue legs.
00:12:44,00:12:45,"He was like, ""I saw blue legs up there."""
00:12:45,00:12:47,"And he was like, ""I saw blue legs."""
00:12:47,00:12:50,The denim jean has been the most popular trouser
00:12:50,00:12:53,in the world for a century.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"Well, what are they doing up there in the ceiling?"
00:12:56,00:12:58,Probably being spooky.
00:12:58,00:12:59,Exactly.
00:12:59,00:13:02,"Panto was pretty well invented here, modern Panto."
00:13:02,00:13:03,Are we leaving ghosts? We're done with ghosts.
00:13:03,00:13:04,"Sorry, sorry."
00:13:04,00:13:06,"No, no, it's fine. It's fine."
00:13:06,00:13:08,But modern Panto was basically invented here.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"Oh, no, it wasn't. Thank you."
00:13:09,00:13:14,"It's just these were you guys,"
00:13:14,00:13:17,because I gave you the feed line twice and there was nothing.
00:13:17,00:13:20,And James had to step in and that's unprofessional.
00:13:20,00:13:21,You should have all said it.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"I had to because he would have done it three, four, five times."
00:13:24,00:13:26,You'll all feel a bit of a bump up your bum now
00:13:26,00:13:28,from Joseph Cromaldi himself.
00:13:28,00:13:30,"Oh, no, they won't."
00:13:30,00:13:32,There was Augustus Harris.
00:13:32,00:13:34,There's a bust of him on the corner of the building.
00:13:34,00:13:35,It's fantastic.
00:13:35,00:13:39,"He was one of the manager's kind of late 19th, early 20th century,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,and he basically invented modern pantomime.
00:13:41,00:13:43,And the shows that went on here were extraordinary.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"There was one production of Alibaba and the 40 Thieves,"
00:13:46,00:13:50,which featured 500 people on this stage.
00:13:50,00:13:51,OK. What?
00:13:51,00:13:54,There is a scene in this play where each of the 40 thieves
00:13:54,00:13:57,"comes out of the cave, like at the back of the stage."
00:13:57,00:13:59,Each of them brings out their own band of followers.
00:13:59,00:14:02,It took 40 minutes for everyone to come out of this bloody cave.
00:14:02,00:14:03,Wow.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"It started at 7.30pm and ended at one in the morning, the show."
00:14:07,00:14:08,Wow.
00:14:08,00:14:12,And that's what we'll be doing in tribute tonight.
00:14:12,00:14:14,I'm going to have to move us on in a sec to our next one.
00:14:14,00:14:17,You mentioned David Garak earlier.
00:14:17,00:14:19,He ran the place before Sheridan.
00:14:19,00:14:23,"And he had a thing where he wanted to ban young, drunk men"
00:14:23,00:14:25,from sitting on the stage.
00:14:25,00:14:26,"He said, no more."
00:14:26,00:14:27,We're not having it.
00:14:27,00:14:31,But it took him 15 years to eventually get the last one off.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"And it used to be that there were lots of riots in theatres and stuff,"
00:14:33,00:14:34,didn't you?
00:14:34,00:14:35,And it always used to happen.
00:14:35,00:14:39,"It would be like the poshos would be in the stalls, like you guys."
00:14:39,00:14:41,And then the scum would be right up there.
00:14:42,00:14:45,[CHEERS]
00:14:45,00:14:48,It's going to change.
00:14:48,00:14:53,"The greasy scumbags, as Washington Irving wrote about them,"
00:14:53,00:14:56,"saying that if they didn't like the show, they would throw stuff."
00:14:56,00:14:58,But it wouldn't be able to reach the stage.
00:14:58,00:15:00,So it just hit the people in the stalls.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"And he said, your advice was just to sit down quietly,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,bend your back to it and let it happen.
00:15:05,00:15:06,Wow.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Right.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"It was even King's writer's here, right?"
00:15:10,00:15:12,"And this is such a cool thing about this theatre,"
00:15:12,00:15:14,"which is that it's the only theatre in the world,"
00:15:14,00:15:18,"according to its website, which has two royal boxes."
00:15:18,00:15:21,Because the King had a punch up here once.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"Again, this was King George III of madness of fame."
00:15:24,00:15:26,And there were two King and the George III.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"No, it was him and his son, Prince Regent."
00:15:29,00:15:30,And they were having a big old feud.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"Because I think the Prince Regent kept saying, you're really mad, dad."
00:15:33,00:15:34,Let me take over.
00:15:34,00:15:35,"And he was like, no, I'm not."
00:15:35,00:15:38,And so they came to Drury Lane one night to see a show.
00:15:38,00:15:40,They had a massive punch up together.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"And so the theatre said, listen, lads, you can't be doing that."
00:15:43,00:15:45,"From now on, we're going to make two royal boxes."
00:15:45,00:15:46,Lads.
00:15:46,00:15:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:48,00:15:50,We're going to have to make two boxes now.
00:15:50,00:15:52,I sat in the Prince of Wales box earlier.
00:15:52,00:15:53,I think it's up here.
00:15:53,00:15:54,It's on the side.
00:15:54,00:15:56,There's people in there.
00:15:56,00:15:56,"Wait, what's that?"
00:15:56,00:15:58,A pair of blue legs.
00:15:58,00:16:00,Oh.
00:16:00,00:16:02,"Hey, do you know, just a very random thing."
00:16:02,00:16:05,But we can't really see any of you with the lights like this.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"And when Barry Humphries did the Dame Edna show here,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,it's got this fascinating document
00:16:10,00:16:13,where it's the entire map of the audience.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"And there's a key, a legend at the bottom,"
00:16:15,00:16:20,"where anyone who Dame Edna had a very specific joke to tell to,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,there would be the word that would say the type of person
00:16:23,00:16:25,that was in the crowd that the joke needed to be made of.
00:16:25,00:16:28,"So before Barry Humphries came on stage every night,"
00:16:28,00:16:30,he memorized the paper.
00:16:30,00:16:32,"And what would he say, like middle-aged man here?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,Exactly.
00:16:33,00:16:34,So he would say that in the legend.
00:16:34,00:16:38,"So he'd be like, oh, you know, middle-aged men, like you, sir."
00:16:38,00:16:40,And he wouldn't know where he-- that was memory.
00:16:40,00:16:42,He had to hope that that person was still sitting there.
00:16:42,00:16:44,That was the same with me saying the scumbags were up there.
00:16:44,00:16:45,Yes.
00:16:45,00:16:54,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:16:54,00:16:58,My fact this week is that the president of Slovenia's previous job
00:16:58,00:17:04,was to stop people naming cakes after Melania Trump.
00:17:04,00:17:05,Right.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"I was this kind of on a one-on-one basis,"
00:17:07,00:17:10,"as in, did she wait until someone had named a cake after Melania"
00:17:10,00:17:14,"Trump and then tell them to stop, or did she just tell people,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,don't do that if you were thinking about it?
00:17:16,00:17:18,"It was sort of the latter, really."
00:17:18,00:17:20,"She said, you know, the population of Slovenia,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,if you are thinking about doing this.
00:17:22,00:17:25,But it was based on the fact that a lot of people already were.
00:17:25,00:17:28,I think it wasn't so much people in the kitchen making a cake
00:17:28,00:17:32,"and going, I shall name the Melania as companies selling cakes"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"and going, this is a Melania cake."
00:17:34,00:17:36,"No, she had spies in every home, James."
00:17:36,00:17:38,Shall I say why she wanted to do this?
00:17:38,00:17:39,"Absolutely, yeah."
00:17:39,00:17:40,"Otherwise, it's very confusing."
00:17:40,00:17:41,But she was a lawyer.
00:17:41,00:17:44,And it's a woman called Natasha Pirce-Moussa.
00:17:44,00:17:48,"And before she became president, she did a PhD in law"
00:17:48,00:17:52,"and immediately founded her own law firm in 2016,"
00:17:52,00:17:53,which was Pirce-Moussa and Partners.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"And Melania Trump immediately hired her,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"because this is roundabout the time, I don't know if you remember,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"when Donald Trump was becoming president of America,"
00:18:01,00:18:02,Melania was getting a lot more attention.
00:18:02,00:18:05,"And the people of Slovenia, the bakers of Slovenia,"
00:18:05,00:18:08,were capitalising on it and naming all sorts of stuff after her.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"And so Melania said to Pirce-Moussa,"
00:18:10,00:18:13,"look, can you send a press release out to all these cake makers"
00:18:13,00:18:14,"saying, stop naming the cake makers?"
00:18:14,00:18:16,There was a lot of stuff.
00:18:16,00:18:18,There was honey from Melania's home garden.
00:18:18,00:18:21,There was the Melania breakfast pudding.
00:18:21,00:18:23,"Sounds amazing, a breakfast pudding."
00:18:23,00:18:27,There was a local salami named First Lady after her.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"Right, my favourite one was a pancake maker"
00:18:30,00:18:33,who created a Melania Trump-themed pancake.
00:18:33,00:18:34,And when he was asked by reporters
00:18:34,00:18:37,"if he was worried about copyright infringement,"
00:18:37,00:18:40,"he said, no, I'm not worried about copyright infringement."
00:18:40,00:18:43,I don't really know what copyright infringement is.
00:18:43,00:18:45,So I shall not worry about it.
00:18:45,00:18:48,That's very funny.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"Yeah, there was an underwear line, some higher-heeled shoes."
00:18:51,00:18:55,But also Ljubljana named a Christmas tree Melania.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"And the jealous asked, are they going to make them change that name?"
00:18:58,00:19:01,"And they said, no, we have nothing against the Christmas tree named Melania,"
00:19:01,00:19:04,because this has nothing to do with commercial purposes.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"So they're just trying to stop people from making money off the back of her,"
00:19:06,00:19:08,which I think is fair enough.
00:19:08,00:19:11,"Yeah, not criticising, absolutely fair enough."
00:19:11,00:19:12,She's a good job.
00:19:12,00:19:16,You'll not find a single thing in Slovenia named after Melania Trump anymore.
00:19:16,00:19:18,"But yeah, it was interesting."
00:19:18,00:19:19,And she's an interesting woman.
00:19:19,00:19:20,She did have lots of jobs.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"She was a TV presenter, Piz Mutsar."
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:23,00:19:24,And came in a lawyer.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"And she was also the lawyer who, when everyone was saying"
00:19:27,00:19:31,"that Melania had been an escort before she met Trump,"
00:19:31,00:19:32,she was the one who shut all those down as well.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"Oh, right."
00:19:33,00:19:34,"OK, right."
00:19:34,00:19:35,I found something just...
00:19:35,00:19:38,"I know we'll come back to Slovenian politics in a moment, but..."
00:19:38,00:19:39,Please.
00:19:39,00:19:40,There is...
00:19:40,00:19:40,This is interesting.
00:19:40,00:19:45,"An orchid named after Melania Trump, made by a guy in America"
00:19:45,00:19:46,"called Arthur Chadwick, OK?"
00:19:46,00:19:47,OK.
00:19:47,00:19:48,I'd never heard of him before.
00:19:48,00:19:51,He's an orchid breeder.
00:19:51,00:19:53,And you can kind of experiment with orchids.
00:19:53,00:19:54,You can make your own new variants.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"And, you know, there's a lot of kind of craft and science behind it."
00:19:57,00:20:02,"And every single election Arthur Chadwick makes two new orchids,"
00:20:02,00:20:06,and he names them after the two potential first ladies.
00:20:06,00:20:07,Wow.
00:20:07,00:20:10,So there is a Michelle Obama orchid.
00:20:10,00:20:12,Is there a Bill Clinton one?
00:20:12,00:20:15,"Yes, because he keeps a reject orchid pile."
00:20:15,00:20:17,"Oh, he doesn't just stomp them down when they lose."
00:20:17,00:20:18,"No, he doesn't. No."
00:20:18,00:20:19,And because some of them are beautiful.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"Yeah, so if Hillary Clinton had won that election,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,then Bill Clinton would have...
00:20:23,00:20:24,That orchid would have been sort of made public.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"But as it is, it's just sort of festering in his greenhouse."
00:20:27,00:20:30,"And he's really sad about that because, you know,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,he says the Anne Romney is a real stunner
00:20:32,00:20:36,in a definitely not creepy tone of voice like that.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"Yeah, so there is just this huge pile of orchids"
00:20:39,00:20:41,"that are either, you know, the winners or the others."
00:20:41,00:20:42,That's interesting. Why does he not just release them all
00:20:42,00:20:45,if he's invented a new plant like that?
00:20:45,00:20:46,I don't know.
00:20:46,00:20:47,That's pretty incredible.
00:20:47,00:20:50,"But yeah, weird things that you can trademark."
00:20:50,00:20:53,"Cakes do get trademarked, I wouldn't say all the time,"
00:20:53,00:20:56,"but relatively often, I would say."
00:20:56,00:20:59,"There was, in 2012, a local baker called Mary's Cakes and Pastries"
00:20:59,00:21:01,in Alabama received a cease and desist letter
00:21:01,00:21:05,from the University of Alabama for using their A.
00:21:05,00:21:07,And turns out the university trademarked the letter A.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"Oh, wow."
00:21:08,00:21:10,Was it a particular style of letter A?
00:21:10,00:21:12,"It was a style of A, yes."
00:21:12,00:21:14,Was it like a font or a...
00:21:14,00:21:16,"It was a font that they'd created, yeah."
00:21:16,00:21:18,"I mean, but I think her argument was,"
00:21:18,00:21:20,they get eaten really quickly if they're good enough cakes.
00:21:20,00:21:23,So that A is not going to be sitting there for ages.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"That doesn't work. If I make a Mars bar and I say,"
00:21:25,00:21:28,"""Well, it's really tasty, so people will eat it straight away."""
00:21:28,00:21:29,So it doesn't matter.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"See, this is why I'm not a lawyer."
00:21:31,00:21:32,You're absolutely right.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"It doesn't work as a defence at all, does it?"
00:21:34,00:21:37,Have you heard about the illegal bakeries of Florence?
00:21:37,00:21:38,"No, no. These are great."
00:21:38,00:21:40,These are sort of underground late-night bakeries in Florence
00:21:40,00:21:44,because it's not allowed to sell pastries directly to the public
00:21:44,00:21:45,if you're a baker.
00:21:45,00:21:46,What? What?
00:21:46,00:21:48,"I know, I know."
00:21:48,00:21:50,But the city has a kind of pastry underworld.
00:21:50,00:21:53,Can you...? I just feel like we need to revisit.
00:21:53,00:21:56,Do we know why? Is this just a Florentine mystery?
00:21:56,00:21:59,It must be that the people who own the shops
00:21:59,00:22:00,"have their own unions and stuff, right?"
00:22:00,00:22:02,There's probably some complicated reason
00:22:02,00:22:04,"which I didn't bother researching, but you're absolutely right."
00:22:04,00:22:05,I'm sorry.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"But just if we take that as red,"
00:22:07,00:22:09,"a quite unlikely sounding thing that if you're a baker,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,"you're not allowed to sell bread to the public, whatever."
00:22:12,00:22:16,"But at night, you knock on a door, you go down an alley,"
00:22:16,00:22:18,you do it in the reverse order.
00:22:18,00:22:19,You...
00:22:19,00:22:22,Come and find me!
00:22:22,00:22:26,"You go down the alley, you knock on the door,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,"you get a coin, you get a euro out,"
00:22:28,00:22:31,and you pass it through the window into the wizened hand
00:22:31,00:22:33,of the night Florentine baker.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"And you take whatever you're given, right?"
00:22:35,00:22:36,"So they'll give you something. Oh, really?"
00:22:36,00:22:39,"Yeah. A mini cake, a piece of bread,"
00:22:39,00:22:40,probably one of those things.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"And if you're loud or drunk, they serve nobody."
00:22:42,00:22:46,"They ban the whole queue, you know?"
00:22:46,00:22:47,"They just say, ""Right, go away, I'm not interested."""
00:22:47,00:22:48,They shell a chop for half an hour.
00:22:48,00:22:51,I was like when one person in class at school was a dick in class
00:22:51,00:22:52,and you all got detention. That's it.
00:22:52,00:22:53,That's not fair.
00:22:53,00:22:55,That's what happens in the late night Florentine bakeries.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"I love Andy. I've got to say, I love this new method"
00:22:57,00:23:00,of you making a fact even more interesting
00:23:00,00:23:04,by entering misters into it.
00:23:04,00:23:06,You put a coin through a door.
00:23:06,00:23:08,"That's just buying something, Andy, isn't it?"
00:23:08,00:23:09,"Yeah, that's Tesco."
00:23:09,00:23:10,No.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"No, no."
00:23:12,00:23:14,It's not far off.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"You put the coin in a slit and it gives you a trolley,"
00:23:17,00:23:20,and you take the trolley unshackling
00:23:20,00:23:26,"from its prison free, it's free the wobbly beast."
00:23:26,00:23:29,"And that's disgusting, can I just say, free the wobbly beast."
00:23:29,00:23:31,You get kicked out of Tesco if you do that.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"No, down the turn, I've been getting away with that"
00:23:33,00:23:35,for about four months and now you've rumbled me completely.
00:23:35,00:23:37,We don't have to find facts now.
00:23:37,00:23:38,"Anyway, sorry."
00:23:38,00:23:39,This actually is so similar to something
00:23:39,00:23:41,I was researching for the Drury Lane fact.
00:23:41,00:23:43,What's the one thing you associate with Drury Lane?
00:23:43,00:23:44,The Muffin Man.
00:23:44,00:23:45,The Muffin Man.
00:23:45,00:23:49,The Muffin Man.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"And I was looking it up because I just suddenly thought,"
00:23:51,00:23:52,"""What the fuck is a Muffin Man?"""
00:23:52,00:23:57,"And in the early 1800s, and he was disappearing by the 1830s"
00:23:57,00:23:59,"because people could afford to make their own muffins,"
00:23:59,00:24:01,he was someone who walked down the street ringing a bell
00:24:01,00:24:03,and everyone knew the Muffin Man's bell
00:24:03,00:24:05,"and children flocked to the door,"
00:24:05,00:24:06,"begged their parents to be let out,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,just like an ice cream van.
00:24:08,00:24:10,So you knew the Muffin Man's bell when he came.
00:24:10,00:24:13,I have to tell you a moment that happened at home the other day.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"Oh, God."
00:24:14,00:24:15,"I was at home with my son Ted, he's four,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,and out of nowhere I was just sitting on the couch
00:24:17,00:24:20,"and I went, ""Do you know the Muffin Man?"""
00:24:20,00:24:23,"And he went, ""You know the Muffin Man?"""
00:24:23,00:24:26,"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
00:24:26,00:24:27,And he meant the song.
00:24:27,00:24:30,He had no idea that I knew the song.
00:24:30,00:24:32,"And I was like, ""I do know the Muffin Man."""
00:24:32,00:24:33,"And he went, ""The Muffin Man."""
00:24:33,00:24:36,"And it was like a fucking comedy sketch,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,but it was the sweetest thing I've ever experienced.
00:24:39,00:24:41,You know the Muffin Man?
00:24:41,00:24:42,Beautiful.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"Dan, you know there's quite annoying podcasts"
00:24:43,00:24:46,where parents wang on about their kids that no one cares about?
00:24:46,00:24:48,You mean the most successful podcast in the UK parenting?
00:24:48,00:24:50,"Hell, yeah, I do know, yeah."
00:24:50,00:24:51,Maybe start one of those.
00:24:51,00:24:52,I'm just trying to bring in that crowd.
00:24:52,00:24:55,Let's bring things back to edible underwear.
00:24:55,00:24:57,"Oh, okay."
00:24:57,00:24:58,Do you know that?
00:24:58,00:25:03,Any underwear is edible if you are determined and patient.
00:25:03,00:25:08,They were invented by David Sanderson and Lee Brady
00:25:08,00:25:09,who were drunk and stoned
00:25:09,00:25:13,"and discussing the phrase, ""Eat my shorts."""
00:25:13,00:25:15,"And they thought, ""Let's make some edible underwear,"""
00:25:15,00:25:16,which they made with licorice.
00:25:16,00:25:19,And they tried to get a trademark.
00:25:19,00:25:22,The trademark was candy pants.
00:25:22,00:25:24,But the US Patents' Office wouldn't give them a trademark
00:25:24,00:25:27,"with the explanation that the words ""candy"" and ""pants"""
00:25:27,00:25:30,were mutually exclusive.
00:25:30,00:25:31,"Oh, wow."
00:25:31,00:25:33,"They were saying, ""Look, we've proved it wrong."""
00:25:33,00:25:33,"Yeah, but they were saying,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,"""There is no way you can have candy pants,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"so we're not going to let you trademark it."""
00:25:37,00:25:38,That's amazing.
00:25:38,00:25:39,"They're not still made of licorice, are they?"
00:25:39,00:25:40,"No, they're not."
00:25:40,00:25:43,Those ones got hot and sweaty and fell apart.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"Which is quite sexy, I suppose."
00:25:47,00:25:48,But they go in touch with some--
00:25:48,00:25:49,"No, you want something sensible and durable"
00:25:49,00:25:52,for those long nights.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"Sensible, durable, and edible."
00:25:54,00:25:58,"Well, I'm made of thick, thick pastry, please."
00:25:58,00:26:00,That'll be one euro.
00:26:00,00:26:11,"If you name your child after a copyrighted character,"
00:26:11,00:26:12,you can get in trouble over it.
00:26:12,00:26:13,So who's a copyrighted character?
00:26:13,00:26:15,"Like Dennis the Menace, say."
00:26:15,00:26:16,Perfect.
00:26:16,00:26:17,Hamburglar.
00:26:17,00:26:19,These are names that you wouldn't necessarily
00:26:19,00:26:21,"give to your children, I guess."
00:26:21,00:26:22,Exactly.
00:26:22,00:26:24,"And there was a problem recently, very recently,"
00:26:24,00:26:25,the Home Office in the UK.
00:26:25,00:26:28,"Normally, a benevolent and understanding organisation."
00:26:28,00:26:38,They denied a seven-year-old boy a passport
00:26:38,00:26:39,when his family applied for it on his behalf
00:26:39,00:26:43,because he was named Loki Skywalker Moebray.
00:26:43,00:26:46,"And they said, ""Skywalker is copyrighted."""
00:26:46,00:26:47,That's interesting.
00:26:47,00:26:48,"I know, and this happened again this year."
00:26:48,00:26:51,They just gave a fucking passport to Paddington Bear.
00:26:51,00:26:53,"I know, I know."
00:26:53,00:26:54,"Yeah, but he is Paddington Bear."
00:26:54,00:26:55,He is Paddington Bear.
00:26:55,00:26:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:56,00:26:58,He's not named after him.
00:26:58,00:26:59,This happened again.
00:26:59,00:27:01,"There was a child with the name Khaleesi,"
00:27:01,00:27:02,"who's a Game of Thrones character,"
00:27:02,00:27:03,and they were also turned down.
00:27:03,00:27:05,"They were told, ""No, you're going to need a letter"
00:27:05,00:27:06,"from Warner Brothers to get your child a passport."""
00:27:06,00:27:07,Really?
00:27:07,00:27:09,"Well, in fact, it's the Warner Brothers of Trademark"
00:27:09,00:27:11,"that named Khaleesi for Goods and Services,"
00:27:11,00:27:12,not for people.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"So, yeah."
00:27:13,00:27:14,It is an error.
00:27:14,00:27:16,It is the worry that they will then turn 18
00:27:16,00:27:19,"and set up the Khaleesi Edible Underwear Company,"
00:27:19,00:27:20,"and then they say, ""Well, it's my name."
00:27:20,00:27:21,"I'm allowed to do it."""
00:27:21,00:27:23,I don't know if the Home Office thinks
00:27:23,00:27:25,in that kind of strategic manner.
00:27:25,00:27:26,I think it was just a flub.
00:27:26,00:27:28,I think you are allowed to call your child Skywalker.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"James, you mentioned the US Patent Office,"
00:27:30,00:27:34,"and I discovered, in the course of this research,"
00:27:34,00:27:37,the US Patent Office hadn't trademarked itself
00:27:37,00:27:39,until three years ago.
00:27:39,00:27:40,No.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Yeah.
00:27:41,00:27:42,"It's been around since 1802,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,and it was having a serious problem
00:27:44,00:27:46,because scammers kept on pretending
00:27:46,00:27:47,"to be the US Patent Office,"
00:27:47,00:27:49,"and they'd call you up and they'd say,"
00:27:49,00:27:51,"""Hey, you need to trademark this."
00:27:51,00:27:53,"Pay us 100 quid, and we'll do it for you."""
00:27:53,00:27:54,"And the US Patent Office was like,"
00:27:54,00:27:55,"""What are we going to do?"""
00:27:55,00:27:57,"And a spokesperson said,"
00:27:57,00:28:00,"""We tried all sorts of things to try to protect people,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,and eventually we stumbled upon the good idea
00:28:02,00:28:05,"of registering ourselves with the US Patent Office."""
00:28:05,00:28:06,"It is tricky,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,"because I think there are cases where it's clearly,"
00:28:08,00:28:09,"you know, you don't want someone,"
00:28:09,00:28:10,"if you're Melania Trump,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,you don't want someone literally putting your face
00:28:12,00:28:14,on a cake that they've made and then flogging it with money.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"Okay, just see what you think of this example."
00:28:16,00:28:18,This is a guy in 1990.
00:28:18,00:28:21,"He filed a trademark for stealth condoms, okay?"
00:28:21,00:28:23,Stealth condoms?
00:28:23,00:28:25,And the catch line was...
00:28:25,00:28:27,"Oh, hang on."
00:28:27,00:28:29,Surprise her.
00:28:29,00:28:31,No.
00:28:31,00:28:34,"Guys, they'll never see you coming."
00:28:34,00:28:35,Right?
00:28:35,00:28:36,That's good.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Okay.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Now...
00:28:38,00:28:39,"Oh, Jesus."
00:28:39,00:28:41,Good.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"Now, Northrop, who made the stealth bomber,"
00:28:44,00:28:48,"plain, claimed this is damaging to our trademark,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,and that infringes our rights.
00:28:50,00:28:53,"Now, okay, so whose side are you on at the moment?"
00:28:53,00:28:57,"I am on the condom side, I think."
00:28:57,00:29:00,What if they came in packages shaped like the stealth bomber plain?
00:29:00,00:29:02,Now I think I'm on the bomber's side.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"And his business voicemail said, ""Howdy, this is John."
00:29:05,00:29:09,"Me and the rest of the stealth test pilots are out right now."""
00:29:09,00:29:10,Yeah.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"There are good people on both sides, I think."
00:29:12,00:29:13,It's tricky.
00:29:13,00:29:14,It's tricky.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"Speaking of good people on both sides,"
00:29:16,00:29:20,"CafePress, which makes t-shirts or sells t-shirts,"
00:29:20,00:29:23,they took down a t-shirt that someone had designed
00:29:23,00:29:28,that called Donald Trump a Cheeto-faced shit-gibbon.
00:29:28,00:29:31,And they said that they took it down because it violates
00:29:31,00:29:34,Frito Le's trademark of Cheeto.
00:29:34,00:29:39,And they suggested maybe instead you could call him
00:29:39,00:29:42,a cheese puff-faced shit-gibbon.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Wow.
00:29:43,00:29:51,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:29:51,00:29:55,"Okay, and my fact this week is that Tower Hamlets in London"
00:29:55,00:30:00,"has by far the most 105-year-olds in the country,"
00:30:00,00:30:03,and by far the fewest 90-year-olds.
00:30:03,00:30:05,Riddle me that.
00:30:05,00:30:06,How is that possible?
00:30:06,00:30:10,"Well, this is from a recent study by Sol Justin Newman"
00:30:10,00:30:12,"at Oxford University, and it's called"
00:30:12,00:30:17,"""Super Centenarian and Remarkable Age Records exhibit patterns"
00:30:17,00:30:21,"indicative of clerical errors and pension fraud."""
00:30:21,00:30:22,Hey.
00:30:22,00:30:23,Killer Tyler.
00:30:23,00:30:26,And he basically says that while most people say
00:30:26,00:30:30,that longevity is due to eating lots of vegetables
00:30:30,00:30:32,"and your genetics and stuff like that,"
00:30:32,00:30:37,"in actual fact, it tends to be people pretending they're old."
00:30:37,00:30:38,It's so good this.
00:30:38,00:30:39,It's so good.
00:30:39,00:30:40,It's amazing.
00:30:40,00:30:42,There's all this stuff about blue zones.
00:30:42,00:30:44,Has anyone heard of that?
00:30:44,00:30:47,"There's weird bits around the world where, you know,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,there's an island off the coast of Japan.
00:30:49,00:30:50,There's a bit of Italy.
00:30:50,00:30:54,There are just various zones where people seem to live to incredible ages.
00:30:54,00:30:57,"For decades, people have been studying the diets of these places"
00:30:57,00:30:59,"and the social customs and everything,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,and it turns out what they all have in common
00:31:01,00:31:05,is people's birth certificates have gone missing at some point.
00:31:05,00:31:09,"Apparently, the state introduction of birth certificates"
00:31:09,00:31:15,is associated with a 69% fall in the number of people over 100.
00:31:15,00:31:16,It's amazing.
00:31:16,00:31:20,A Japanese government review in 2010 found that 82% of Japanese people
00:31:20,00:31:22,over the age of 100 were dead.
00:31:22,00:31:25,They're just dead.
00:31:25,00:31:26,They're not there.
00:31:26,00:31:29,"And in terms of handlets, is it, presumably, it's..."
00:31:29,00:31:32,"Well, A, I am confused about how it can be not many 90-year-olds,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,"but presumably, I think there's a correlation"
00:31:34,00:31:37,"between how wealthy or not an area is and this, right,"
00:31:37,00:31:39,to the incentive for pension fraud.
00:31:39,00:31:40,"It is that, and it's also..."
00:31:40,00:31:42,"There's lots of different things, basically,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,"but it's the 90-year-olds,"
00:31:44,00:31:46,a lot of them have taken over the lives of people
00:31:46,00:31:48,from the previous generation.
00:31:48,00:31:50,So maybe your parents die
00:31:50,00:31:52,and they're about to get their pension
00:31:52,00:31:55,"and you decide, well, I'm going to pretend that I'm 65 years old"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"and I'm going to get the pension instead, that kind of thing."
00:31:57,00:31:59,"We should quickly say, for overseas listeners,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,"so Tower Hamlets, bit of London,"
00:32:01,00:32:04,which is kind of a multiple number of names
00:32:04,00:32:05,that you might recognise.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"So if you've ever been to the Tower of London,"
00:32:07,00:32:08,that will be in Tower Hamlets.
00:32:08,00:32:10,Bo is in Tower Hamlets.
00:32:10,00:32:12,Beth Norgreen.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Wow, OK."
00:32:14,00:32:16,How old are you guys?
00:32:16,00:32:20,"It's so creepy when you ask that to fans, Dan."
00:32:20,00:32:23,"These days, after what's happened in the BBC,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,you have to ask.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"Yeah, it's like Tower Hamlets, the name comes from."
00:32:28,00:32:30,It was like the little villages
00:32:30,00:32:32,that were around the Tower of London.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"Like Brick Lane is in Tower Hamlets,"
00:32:34,00:32:36,"White Chapel is, all that kind of stuff."
00:32:36,00:32:38,Can I give you guys a bit of the maths about how this...
00:32:38,00:32:39,Yeah.
00:32:39,00:32:42,"In fact, how people who are fibbing or wrong"
00:32:42,00:32:44,tend to dominate the stats.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"OK, let's say right now, I gave myself 10 years."
00:32:47,00:32:51,I declared I was in my late 40s rather than in my late 30s.
00:32:51,00:32:54,I'm likely to have a better lifespan now.
00:32:54,00:32:57,"I feel like they didn't believe you, and that's really insulting."
00:32:57,00:32:59,"Yeah, I'm 37."
00:32:59,00:33:02,I'm practically in my early 30s.
00:33:02,00:33:05,"But if I did that, I would have a better lifespan, right?"
00:33:05,00:33:08,Literally because I'm younger than my declared age.
00:33:08,00:33:11,"So over time, the people who have aged themselves up, like I have,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,they are a bigger proportion of that population.
00:33:14,00:33:17,"And by the time I'm 90, but I'm claiming I'm 100,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,it's mostly people like me.
00:33:19,00:33:23,"So one in a thousand people who live to 100,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,then live to 110.
00:33:25,00:33:28,"And if only one in a thousand people are committing fraud,"
00:33:28,00:33:32,they will be more common than real super centenarians.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"So even if the fraud is very, very unusual,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,it just becomes more obvious because there's less people around.
00:33:38,00:33:42,"So if you meet 110-year-old, it's likely they're a liar."
00:33:42,00:33:44,I believe so.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"And this guy, this person, saw Justin Newman,"
00:33:47,00:33:51,he basically said if it turned out that 70% of the galaxies
00:33:51,00:33:53,"that we thought existed didn't exist,"
00:33:53,00:33:57,"or 70% of the people in the UK that we said existed didn't exist,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,there'd be a massive scandal.
00:33:59,00:34:03,"But the thing is, we all kind of want to believe that people live to an old age"
00:34:03,00:34:06,"and actually, what's the damage, do you know what I mean?"
00:34:06,00:34:09,"Well, the damage is that we all force for ourselves olive oil"
00:34:09,00:34:11,and nuts for the last 10 years.
00:34:11,00:34:13,"And make friends with each other, yeah."
00:34:13,00:34:15,That's the thing.
00:34:15,00:34:18,"So my grandmother, my sorry, my great-grandmother,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,she lived to 103.
00:34:20,00:34:22,Bullshit.
00:34:22,00:34:27,"Yeah, she was 65, my great-grandmother."
00:34:27,00:34:30,I had a conversation with her before she passed away.
00:34:30,00:34:33,"And after, that's the kind of guy I am."
00:34:33,00:34:35,Love a séance.
00:34:35,00:34:39,"So I said to her, ""What's the secret to your long life?"""
00:34:39,00:34:42,"And she said, ""Milk."""
00:34:42,00:34:44,And that was her answer.
00:34:44,00:34:46,"And then she said, ""And happiness."""
00:34:46,00:34:48,And it was a nice thing.
00:34:48,00:34:53,"I just did a random Google of claims they lived to this age because of,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,and the things that come up.
00:34:55,00:34:59,"So one person said, ""Being single is why they live to their age."""
00:34:59,00:35:03,"Another said, ""Regularly drinking the beer Cora's Light,"""
00:35:03,00:35:05,which is an American drink.
00:35:05,00:35:09,"Someone else said, ""Luck and fish and chips."""
00:35:09,00:35:11,Adding that in.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"One person said, ""Giving up cigarettes."""
00:35:13,00:35:17,That was a 117-year-old who decided to quit at that age
00:35:17,00:35:19,and ended up living to 122.
00:35:19,00:35:21,So there's something in that.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"And then the oldest Briton in history, Henry Allingham,"
00:35:24,00:35:28,"said, ""A bunch of stuff, but mainly the wild, wild women."""
00:35:28,00:35:30,That was his thing.
00:35:30,00:35:32,So there's no consensus.
00:35:32,00:35:34,"It's almost like when you've got a sample size of one,"
00:35:34,00:35:37,"you can't draw a reliable conclusion, isn't it?"
00:35:37,00:35:39,I think the luck is quite a good one.
00:35:39,00:35:41,It's quite unlikely on real life.
00:35:41,00:35:43,Everyone says it's like genetics or this or whatever.
00:35:43,00:35:47,"There's a guy called Professor David Gems at University College London,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,and he looks after nematode worms.
00:35:49,00:35:54,And these nematode worms are all genetically identical to each other.
00:35:54,00:35:56,They all live in exactly the same place.
00:35:56,00:35:59,They all should be living exactly the same amount of time.
00:35:59,00:36:02,"But some of them die of old age at about 10 days,"
00:36:02,00:36:05,and some of them die at old age about 30 days.
00:36:05,00:36:08,"And it's just like, you can't tell which one it's going to be."
00:36:08,00:36:10,It's just kind of lucky.
00:36:10,00:36:12,But they do say making friends.
00:36:12,00:36:14,Do some of them club together and befriend each other?
00:36:14,00:36:16,The worms? Yeah.
00:36:16,00:36:18,I feel like that's the only variable you can change.
00:36:18,00:36:21,"The friends, they all go outside and smoke together."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"So that's nice, and it's something to do."
00:36:23,00:36:26,They do say that their friendship thing is true.
00:36:26,00:36:32,"There was a town called Rosetto in Pennsylvania, wasn't there, where everyone there was very..."
00:36:32,00:36:34,They were kind of closely related.
00:36:34,00:36:36,There were just a few families.
00:36:36,00:36:40,"They had a lot of social cohesion, and they had a very, very high lifespan."
00:36:40,00:36:45,"But then as soon as basically they let the foreigners in from other towns and other cities,"
00:36:45,00:36:48,suddenly they regressed to the national average.
00:36:48,00:36:50,So that's a good reason to be xenophobic.
00:36:50,00:36:53,"Yeah, nice. With that kind of podcast."
00:36:53,00:36:54,"Yeah, exactly."
00:36:54,00:36:56,"You know, Jean Calmont?"
00:36:56,00:36:59,"Oh yeah, so she's the French woman, right?"
00:36:59,00:37:00,The oldest person ever.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"We spoke about her, right?"
00:37:02,00:37:03,The claim is a bit dodgy.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"She's, I think, the only person who's ever lived to 122, supposedly."
00:37:06,00:37:08,"So there was a piece about her in The New Scientist,"
00:37:08,00:37:12,"or rather it was about human skin, which is an interesting thing."
00:37:12,00:37:13,And the piece began.
00:37:13,00:37:18,"On her 120th birthday, Jean Calmont, generally regarded as the oldest person ever to have lived,"
00:37:18,00:37:20,proved she still had her wits about her.
00:37:20,00:37:22,"""I've only got one wrinkle,"" she wisecracked."
00:37:22,00:37:23,"""And I'm sitting on it."""
00:37:23,00:37:24,"""Funny."""
00:37:24,00:37:26,"""Wait, wait, wait."""
00:37:26,00:37:29,"""Funny, but untrue."""
00:37:29,00:37:33,"The French woman was by then extremely wrinkly,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,with deep wrinkles and discolours.
00:37:35,00:37:39,But they were all butt cracks all over her body.
00:37:39,00:37:43,"This is the theory that wrinkle, it's not aging that makes you wrinkled,"
00:37:43,00:37:45,it's wrinkles that make you age.
00:37:45,00:37:48,"So does that mean if you have Botox, you can live forever?"
00:37:48,00:37:49,Potentially.
00:37:49,00:37:50,Wow.
00:37:50,00:37:53,"And our new sponsor, sorry, I should have said this in the break."
00:37:53,00:37:57,"There's a theory that as skin ages, it releases chemicals around your body"
00:37:57,00:38:01,that could kind of drive and accelerate the aging of other organs.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"So, you know, kind of inflammatory proteins."
00:38:03,00:38:06,"So, you know, that's the theory."
00:38:06,00:38:09,"On Madame Calmont, just very quickly on her,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"there's a book by Nicolai Zach and Philip Gibbs,"
00:38:11,00:38:15,which goes through all of the things that her friends and family have said
00:38:15,00:38:18,"and debunks everything that they've said, according to them."
00:38:18,00:38:22,The final line says that she's called Madame Calmont.
00:38:22,00:38:29,"And in French, the phrase ""Madame Calmont"" means ""Madame, she is lying."""
00:38:29,00:38:32,"So if that's not evidence, I don't know what it is."
00:38:32,00:38:33,Wow.
00:38:33,00:38:34,That's huge.
00:38:34,00:38:39,"I just want to say, not all of these people are deliberate liars."
00:38:39,00:38:42,"One of the things that Saul Newman pointed out,"
00:38:42,00:38:45,and I think he's won an ignoble prize for his research.
00:38:45,00:38:47,He is amazing that he's done this.
00:38:47,00:38:48,He's kind of exploding this myth.
00:38:48,00:38:51,And he pointed out that a lot of people just don't remember their age.
00:38:51,00:38:54,And I suppose that felt a tiny bit true.
00:38:54,00:38:57,"So in polling, he was saying that in like big polling samples,"
00:38:57,00:39:00,"when you ask people their age and then you cross-check it with what you know is their age,"
00:39:00,00:39:01,often it's wrong.
00:39:01,00:39:05,"And I actually ended up on Mum's Net, one of my favorite sources."
00:39:05,00:39:09,"And the woman at the top said, ""I regularly have to Google how old am I"
00:39:09,00:39:11,and put in my date of birth to work it out.
00:39:11,00:39:12,"Apparently I'm 50."""
00:39:12,00:39:16,"And then this woman said, ""I remember loads of phone numbers, postcodes,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,"national insurance numbers for my entire family, all my car details,"
00:39:19,00:39:23,"my government gateway number, all login codes ever including random number strings,"
00:39:23,00:39:27,"but I can't remember how old my children, husband or myself are."""
00:39:27,00:39:29,And then loads of people agreed with her.
00:39:29,00:39:30,That's so funny.
00:39:30,00:39:31,I think it's quite odd.
00:39:31,00:39:34,Because I think all of those other numbers always stay the same.
00:39:34,00:39:36,Like your government gateway number is always the same.
00:39:36,00:39:38,Your N.I. number is always the same.
00:39:38,00:39:40,But your bloody age keeps going bloody up.
00:39:40,00:39:42,I lose my bank card every six months.
00:39:42,00:39:44,So it actually changes more often than my age.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"If you get to be lucky enough to get very old,"
00:39:47,00:39:50,one of the things that you need to defeat is falling.
00:39:50,00:39:52,"That's the big thing, right?"
00:39:52,00:39:56,So there's a lot of technology at the moment where it's kind of like an avatar
00:39:56,00:39:58,when they get into those machines and they walk around.
00:39:58,00:40:00,It keeps balancing and so on.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Like an exoskeleton.
00:40:01,00:40:03,Like an exoskeleton and make sure that you don't fall out.
00:40:03,00:40:04,We're going this way.
00:40:04,00:40:07,Someone else is going the other way.
00:40:07,00:40:09,And there's a system that they're trialling out.
00:40:09,00:40:10,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:40:10,00:40:12,Destabilizing babies?
00:40:12,00:40:15,So there's a guy.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"Those little guys, they don't fall over often enough in my liking."
00:40:18,00:40:19,There's a guy called Clive Pie.
00:40:19,00:40:20,He brings people in.
00:40:20,00:40:25,And the idea is to make you understand how tripping can happen quite easily.
00:40:25,00:40:26,I'm going to just shove you.
00:40:26,00:40:30,"And the idea is that if you can understand how balance works,"
00:40:30,00:40:32,"rather than needing a giant exoskeleton,"
00:40:32,00:40:36,then maybe we could all be living till 150.
00:40:36,00:40:39,Are they looking for volunteers to do the shoving and pushing?
00:40:39,00:40:41,Because I'm so available.
00:40:41,00:40:43,You want to shove old people?
00:40:43,00:40:45,In a controlled environment.
00:40:45,00:40:47,I'm so proud to be there like that.
00:40:47,00:40:48,"But yeah, I think I do."
00:40:48,00:40:51,"It's a tough job, but someone has to do it, Anna."
00:40:51,00:40:52,"Yes, exactly."
00:40:52,00:40:53,Someone has to do it.
00:40:53,00:40:54,Okay.
00:40:54,00:40:56,"The idea is that if they can write themselves,"
00:40:56,00:40:59,"then when they're at home, they're ready for the moment"
00:40:59,00:41:00,when they trip on a carpet or something.
00:41:00,00:41:05,What if they write themselves and then Anna pushes them even harder?
00:41:05,00:41:07,Did you guys hear of John Taylor?
00:41:07,00:41:08,"John Taylor, no."
00:41:08,00:41:10,He's buried in Scotland.
00:41:10,00:41:14,He was born in 1633 and he lived to the age of 137.
00:41:14,00:41:15,Oh.
00:41:15,00:41:16,Yeah.
00:41:16,00:41:17,He was a miner.
00:41:17,00:41:21,And he started his life.
00:41:21,00:41:25,"He worked in mines, lead mines and gold mines,"
00:41:25,00:41:28,only until the age of 117 when he found he was slowing down a bit
00:41:28,00:41:29,and retired.
00:41:29,00:41:31,"Anyway, I just found a very good report on him"
00:41:31,00:41:33,"on the gerontology website, which says,"
00:41:33,00:41:36,"""It says on his gravestone that he lived until the age of 137."
00:41:36,00:41:40,"""People are now quite sure that he was, in fact, actually, 133."""
00:41:40,00:41:51,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:51,00:41:52,and that is my fact.
00:41:52,00:41:56,"My fact this week is that in 1979,"
00:41:56,00:42:00,"the not terribly good club of Great Britain,"
00:42:00,00:42:02,"which celebrated failure,"
00:42:02,00:42:07,had to depose its president for being too successful at the job.
00:42:07,00:42:08,(Laughter)
00:42:08,00:42:11,"So it was formed in 1977,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,and Stephen Pyle was the president.
00:42:13,00:42:14,He was the founder.
00:42:14,00:42:17,"And basically, it was a collection of people"
00:42:17,00:42:20,who really were incompetent at things
00:42:20,00:42:23,and wanted to celebrate that fact.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"And so after a lot of meetings,"
00:42:25,00:42:28,"they put together this book, ""The Book of Heroic Failures."""
00:42:28,00:42:30,"Unfortunately, the book became a bestseller,"
00:42:30,00:42:33,which meant that the president was a success.
00:42:33,00:42:38,And so he had to leave his role as the company head.
00:42:38,00:42:41,It got even worse because at the back of the book
00:42:41,00:42:45,"was an application form that meant you could join the club itself,"
00:42:45,00:42:48,"and over 20,000 people applied,"
00:42:48,00:42:51,"which was far too many, meaning the club was way too successful,"
00:42:51,00:42:54,so they had to shut the club down entirely as well.
00:42:54,00:42:56,It's so good.
00:42:56,00:42:58,I have a little exciting thing to say.
00:42:58,00:43:01,"Actually, earlier today, I rang Stephen Pyle,"
00:43:01,00:43:04,"this guy, author of one of the funniest books ever written."
00:43:04,00:43:05,This is huge.
00:43:05,00:43:07,This is like speaking to God in QI circles.
00:43:07,00:43:09,He's amazing.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"So initially, I didn't get through"
00:43:11,00:43:13,because he'd sent me the wrong phone number.
00:43:13,00:43:14,Yes!
00:43:14,00:43:16,(Laughter)
00:43:16,00:43:18,"And after several hours of trying to get through to him,"
00:43:18,00:43:20,I eventually got the right phone number and we spoke.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"But, I mean, so good."
00:43:22,00:43:24,"But he said, he never..."
00:43:24,00:43:26,This was his way of having parties.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"He said, ""I never held parties because I was never confident"
00:43:28,00:43:30,"they would be a success of any sort,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,so this club was a way of legislating for the fact
00:43:32,00:43:34,"everyone else had parties and I never did."""
00:43:34,00:43:36,"And they had these meetings,"
00:43:36,00:43:39,"and they had a salon des incompetents,"
00:43:39,00:43:43,where people would turn up and show off their particular area of failure.
00:43:43,00:43:45,This is who they had at one of their first salons.
00:43:45,00:43:48,"They had a not terribly good parachutist,"
00:43:48,00:43:50,"an extremely petite girl,"
00:43:50,00:43:52,outlined some of the problems caused by being so light
00:43:52,00:43:54,"that when she jumps in breezy conditions,"
00:43:54,00:43:56,she invariably goes up.
00:43:56,00:43:57,(Laughter)
00:43:57,00:43:58,Come on!
00:43:58,00:44:00,(Laughter)
00:44:00,00:44:02,"By the time she lands,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,the pilot has usually finished his tea and gone home.
00:44:04,00:44:05,(Laughter)
00:44:05,00:44:07,"And that's, like, dozens of those."
00:44:07,00:44:08,"Yeah, so good."
00:44:08,00:44:10,"And Andy's got sitting next to him on the table,"
00:44:10,00:44:13,the hardback original edition of it.
00:44:13,00:44:15,"It was reprinted in America,"
00:44:15,00:44:16,"and when they did that,"
00:44:16,00:44:20,they forgot to include half of the introduction of the book.
00:44:20,00:44:22,So the next edition they published in America
00:44:22,00:44:25,had a literal physical paper that was an erratum
00:44:25,00:44:28,that was longer than the introduction itself
00:44:28,00:44:30,sitting inside the book.
00:44:30,00:44:32,Anything that went wrong was a positive.
00:44:32,00:44:34,He said that he had these parties.
00:44:34,00:44:36,"When his book came out,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,"I was looking at the newspaper archives of the interviews,"
00:44:38,00:44:40,and he said he was going to book the Royal Albert Hall
00:44:40,00:44:43,for a Festival of Incompetence.
00:44:43,00:44:45,"But as far as I can see, it never happened."
00:44:45,00:44:46,"Apart from anything else,"
00:44:46,00:44:47,"he tried to book it from a pay phone,"
00:44:47,00:44:50,which kept eating his coins and cutting him off.
00:44:50,00:44:54,But it was supposed to have the UK's only tone deaf rock group
00:44:54,00:44:57,and the worst animal trainer in the country
00:44:57,00:44:59,with his elephant Shiba.
00:44:59,00:45:00,(Laughter)
00:45:00,00:45:02,"I mean, who doesn't want to see that?"
00:45:02,00:45:03,"But yeah, the book is amazing."
00:45:03,00:45:04,That one...
00:45:04,00:45:05,"Oh, so good."
00:45:05,00:45:06,"I mean, you could just literally sit here"
00:45:06,00:45:07,for 50 minutes and read bits.
00:45:07,00:45:08,My favorite one...
00:45:08,00:45:09,"That's what we're going to do, isn't it?"
00:45:09,00:45:13,"My favorite one is the guy, Roger Moss, in 1993,"
00:45:13,00:45:14,who was mugged.
00:45:14,00:45:16,And the mugger took $20 out of his wallet.
00:45:16,00:45:18,"But as the mugger went to go away,"
00:45:18,00:45:20,"Moss yelled, ""Give me my wallet back!"""
00:45:20,00:45:22,"And the mugger was so confused,"
00:45:22,00:45:23,"he gave him his wallet back,"
00:45:23,00:45:25,"but he accidentally gave him his own wallet,"
00:45:25,00:45:26,(Laughter)
00:45:26,00:45:28,which contained $250.
00:45:28,00:45:30,That's so good.
00:45:30,00:45:33,The opening example in the original book
00:45:33,00:45:36,is the least successful explorer.
00:45:36,00:45:38,"And it's a guy called Thomas Nuttel,"
00:45:38,00:45:42,"1786 to 1859, a pioneer botanist,"
00:45:42,00:45:45,"who as an explorer, his work was characterized"
00:45:45,00:45:48,by the fact that he was almost permanently lost.
00:45:48,00:45:49,(Laughter)
00:45:49,00:45:51,"During his expedition in 1812,"
00:45:51,00:45:54,his colleagues frequently had to light beacons in the evening
00:45:54,00:45:56,to help him find his way back to Cannes.
00:45:56,00:45:57,(Laughter)
00:45:57,00:45:59,"One night, he completely failed to return,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,and the search party was sent out.
00:46:01,00:46:03,"As it approached him in the darkness,"
00:46:03,00:46:05,Nuttel assumed that it was aggressive locals
00:46:05,00:46:07,and had to escape.
00:46:07,00:46:08,(Laughter)
00:46:08,00:46:11,"They pursued him for three days through a bush and river,"
00:46:11,00:46:12,(Laughter)
00:46:12,00:46:15,until he accidentally wandered back into camp.
00:46:15,00:46:16,(Laughter)
00:46:16,00:46:18,That's the kind of stuff.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"It's a real variety, right?"
00:46:20,00:46:22,"It's great historic stories,"
00:46:22,00:46:24,and the woman who called the fire brigade
00:46:24,00:46:26,"to rescue her cat, which they did,"
00:46:26,00:46:28,but then immediately ran it over.
00:46:28,00:46:29,(Laughter)
00:46:29,00:46:31,"One of the things that I got obsessed with,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,"and I have to recommend everyone downloads it,"
00:46:33,00:46:36,"it's a book called ""English as She Has Spoke,"""
00:46:36,00:46:39,and it's by a guy called Pedro Carolino.
00:46:39,00:46:42,"It was published in 1883,"
00:46:42,00:46:44,"and it's an English-to-Portuguese phrase book,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"but Pedro Carolino did not speak English,"
00:46:46,00:46:49,nor did he have an English-to-Portuguese dictionary.
00:46:49,00:46:52,What he had was a French-to-Portuguese dictionary
00:46:52,00:46:54,and a French-to-English dictionary.
00:46:54,00:46:55,(Laughter)
00:46:55,00:46:57,"So he took Portuguese phrases,"
00:46:57,00:46:59,"sent them through these two filters,"
00:46:59,00:47:01,and you have to read it.
00:47:01,00:47:03,Every page is comedy gold.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"So we'll have, you know, common things"
00:47:05,00:47:07,that you might say in conversation.
00:47:07,00:47:09,The ears are too length.
00:47:09,00:47:10,(Laughter)
00:47:10,00:47:13,"For to visit a sick, you might say,"
00:47:13,00:47:15,"""Live me, see your tongue."
00:47:15,00:47:17,"Have you pain to the heart?"""
00:47:17,00:47:19,"And then, in response, you might say,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,"""I fell some pain everywhere, body."""
00:47:21,00:47:22,"""Are you altered?"""
00:47:22,00:47:24,"""Yes, I have thirsty often."""
00:47:24,00:47:26,And the whole book is like this.
00:47:26,00:47:28,That's incredible.
00:47:28,00:47:29,It's such a good book.
00:47:29,00:47:31,I just take it seriously.
00:47:31,00:47:34,He said that he thinks that the art of failure
00:47:34,00:47:36,is a noble one.
00:47:36,00:47:38,And it's much more interesting than success.
00:47:38,00:47:40,Way more interesting.
00:47:40,00:47:42,And he also updates his own records.
00:47:42,00:47:45,"So he used to keep a record for the smallest live-show audience,"
00:47:45,00:47:48,which was a pantomime which one person turned up to.
00:47:48,00:47:50,"Oh, no, he didn't."
00:47:50,00:47:52,(Laughter)
00:47:52,00:47:54,The single audience member had to do both halves of that.
00:47:54,00:47:55,He had to say half halves.
00:47:55,00:47:56,That's so funny.
00:47:56,00:47:58,But then the record was broken
00:47:58,00:48:00,"by an Australian folk singer called Jean Mellou,"
00:48:00,00:48:03,who hired Capital Theatre in Canberra
00:48:03,00:48:05,"to give a concert of his folk songs,"
00:48:05,00:48:07,which he did in front of an audience of zero.
00:48:07,00:48:10,The show overran by 20 minutes
00:48:10,00:48:12,due to on-course.
00:48:12,00:48:14,(Laughter)
00:48:14,00:48:15,That's so fun.
00:48:15,00:48:17,So failure in general.
00:48:17,00:48:20,You might say choking in sport.
00:48:20,00:48:22,"You know, you're doing very well,"
00:48:22,00:48:24,and then suddenly you choke and you end up losing.
00:48:24,00:48:27,And choking is what happens when you overthink something.
00:48:27,00:48:30,"The best solution, apparently, is wine."
00:48:30,00:48:33,"That is reading the work of Dr Jerry Wine,"
00:48:33,00:48:36,who came up with distraction theory.
00:48:36,00:48:39,"And in distraction theory, you kind of mutter to yourself"
00:48:39,00:48:43,or whistle to yourself or just do some kind of music in your head.
00:48:43,00:48:45,And that will stop you overthinking.
00:48:45,00:48:46,Just let you get on with it.
00:48:46,00:48:47,"No, but oh, okay."
00:48:47,00:48:48,It's not like distraction
00:48:48,00:48:50,"if someone's running the hundred meters and you say,"
00:48:50,00:48:51,"""Oh, what's that over there?"""
00:48:51,00:48:52,And they run off course.
00:48:52,00:48:53,(Laughter)
00:48:53,00:48:56,I think the hundred meters is not classically a place
00:48:56,00:48:58,where you run 80 meters and forget how to run.
00:48:58,00:49:00,(Laughter)
00:49:00,00:49:02,"Start crawling, run backwards."
00:49:02,00:49:04,Are there other sports where you get...
00:49:04,00:49:05,Is it called the yips?
00:49:05,00:49:07,"The yips. The golf, the yips, for sure."
00:49:07,00:49:08,We don't even like to say that word.
00:49:08,00:49:09,Really?
00:49:09,00:49:10,"Is it like Macbeth, too?"
00:49:10,00:49:11,Dan!
00:49:11,00:49:12,Wow!
00:49:12,00:49:13,Wow.
00:49:13,00:49:14,"Well, we're all doomed."
00:49:14,00:49:16,Hope you've had a nice life.
00:49:16,00:49:18,"I found a great failure recently,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,which is there was a TV show in the Netherlands
00:49:20,00:49:22,called Netherlands Worst Driver.
00:49:22,00:49:25,And the winner was decided after
00:49:25,00:49:28,one of the drivers ran over the host of the show.
00:49:28,00:49:30,(Laughter)
00:49:30,00:49:33,And I've seen the footage and it's intense.
00:49:33,00:49:35,"They just, it's all jokey."
00:49:35,00:49:37,You get an inside of the car camera
00:49:37,00:49:39,and then he just loses the plot.
00:49:39,00:49:40,He crashes into the wall
00:49:40,00:49:42,and you literally see a person fly.
00:49:42,00:49:45,"And they go over and see him like, ""You're okay."""
00:49:45,00:49:48,And then the rest of the show is the host
00:49:48,00:49:51,doing his VTs from a hospital bed.
00:49:51,00:49:52,(Laughter)
00:49:52,00:49:55,"Going, ""My spine's okay, luckily."""
00:49:55,00:49:58,I think we found a winner.
00:49:58,00:50:00,We do need to wrap up the show.
00:50:00,00:50:03,Here's a failure from 2023.
00:50:03,00:50:06,"In Uganda, politicians tried to ban a festival"
00:50:06,00:50:10,"that they described as an orgy of homosexuality, nudity,"
00:50:10,00:50:13,and drugs akin to devil worship.
00:50:13,00:50:15,They failed to ban it
00:50:15,00:50:18,"and the description caused a huge increase in sales,"
00:50:18,00:50:22,"including 5,000 foreigners who traveled to Uganda"
00:50:22,00:50:24,specifically for the event.
00:50:24,00:50:27,(Laughter)
00:50:27,00:50:28,Lovely.
00:50:28,00:50:32,(Music)
00:50:32,00:50:33,That is it.
00:50:33,00:50:35,That is all of our facts.
00:50:35,00:50:37,Thank you so much for listening.
00:50:37,00:50:39,"Drury Lane, you were awesome."
00:50:39,00:50:41,Thank you for having us.
00:50:41,00:50:44,Thank you to the ghosts for having us.
00:50:44,00:50:47,And we will be back again next week with another episode.
00:50:47,00:50:50,We'll see you then. Goodbye!
00:50:50,00:50:52,(Applause)
00:50:53,00:50:55,(Music)
00:50:55,00:50:58,(upbeat music)
