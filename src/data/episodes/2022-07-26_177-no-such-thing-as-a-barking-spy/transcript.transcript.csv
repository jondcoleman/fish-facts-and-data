00:00:10,00:00:17,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast"""
00:00:20,00:00:23,this week coming to you from the wilderness festival.
00:00:23,00:00:26,(audience cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:30,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:32,00:00:34,James Harkin and Aniches Insky.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:37,00:00:39,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:39,00:00:42,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:44,We're gonna start with my fact this week.
00:00:44,00:00:47,"My fact is that in 1957,"
00:00:47,00:00:50,America developed a shouting bomb
00:00:50,00:00:52,that would lecture the enemy for three minutes
00:00:52,00:00:54,as it dropped from the sky.
00:00:54,00:00:56,(audience laughing)
00:00:56,00:01:00,"When I get down there, you are in celebration, mister."
00:01:00,00:01:04,This was a very rogue one mentioned
00:01:04,00:01:05,"and in new scientists article,"
00:01:05,00:01:07,I haven't been able to approve its existence
00:01:07,00:01:08,outside of this one article.
00:01:08,00:01:11,"Yeah, there's no mention online at all, is there?"
00:01:11,00:01:13,It's almost as if I made it up.
00:01:13,00:01:14,(audience laughing)
00:01:14,00:01:15,But why?
00:01:15,00:01:18,I read also that apparently it would give instructions
00:01:18,00:01:20,to the soldiers on the ground as well.
00:01:20,00:01:22,"As a bomb came down, you'd be able to hear what to do"
00:01:22,00:01:23,if you were soldier.
00:01:23,00:01:24,Really?
00:01:24,00:01:25,Like run.
00:01:25,00:01:27,As it takes three minutes to shout that.
00:01:27,00:01:30,"No, so what I couldn't ascertain is does this bomb go off"
00:01:30,00:01:32,or is it merely a propaganda tool?
00:01:32,00:01:35,So the idea is that it would be dropped from a plane
00:01:35,00:01:37,"from about 60,000 feet high."
00:01:37,00:01:39,And then parachutes would deploy
00:01:39,00:01:41,and then as it was making its ascent
00:01:41,00:01:43,or descent rather to the ground.
00:01:43,00:01:45,(audience laughing)
00:01:45,00:01:47,"Well, that's correct."
00:01:47,00:01:48,"And much of the people in the airplane,"
00:01:48,00:01:49,"oh, it's coming back."
00:01:49,00:01:52,(audience laughing)
00:01:54,00:01:55,This is the worst lecture ever.
00:01:55,00:01:57,(audience laughing)
00:01:57,00:01:59,"Yes, so the idea is that it would parachute down"
00:01:59,00:02:02,"and then it would just, and this is 1957,"
00:02:02,00:02:03,"as it got to a certain height,"
00:02:03,00:02:06,a tape recorder on the inside would switch on
00:02:06,00:02:08,and it would play a tape through the speakers
00:02:08,00:02:10,in the shouting bomb out to the general area
00:02:10,00:02:13,and it could be heard as far as half a mile apparently.
00:02:13,00:02:14,Wow.
00:02:14,00:02:15,And we don't know what it exactly what it said.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"I know, we don't know if it's real."
00:02:17,00:02:17,"I mean, where?"
00:02:17,00:02:19,(audience laughing)
00:02:19,00:02:20,But it's in new scientists
00:02:20,00:02:23,and I have to say the reason I think a lot of great
00:02:23,00:02:26,pop science writers have these incredible careers
00:02:26,00:02:29,like John Ronson and Mary Roach and so on.
00:02:29,00:02:31,They uncover these documents
00:02:31,00:02:34,'cause there's so many of these abandoned plans
00:02:34,00:02:36,"for military weaponry where they thought,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"""Oh, this would be an amazing thing to do."""
00:02:38,00:02:40,And it gets to the stage where it's about to be approved
00:02:40,00:02:40,and then it doesn't.
00:02:40,00:02:42,So I believe this is the same.
00:02:42,00:02:43,They almost got this approved
00:02:43,00:02:45,and then lost it at last.
00:02:45,00:02:47,"They are, I mean, the ideas people were coming out with"
00:02:47,00:02:49,were all completely insane
00:02:49,00:02:51,and there's so many of them.
00:02:51,00:02:52,"Every time we talk about this,"
00:02:52,00:02:55,"like I hadn't read about Acoustic Kitty,"
00:02:55,00:02:57,which I think was a project that got a little bit further
00:02:57,00:03:01,but that was the CIA around the same time in the 1960s
00:03:01,00:03:04,and this was a Cold War project
00:03:04,00:03:06,and the idea was that they wanted to spy on Soviet embassies
00:03:06,00:03:08,and they were gonna do it with cats.
00:03:08,00:03:13,And so that implanted a microphone into a cat's ear canal
00:03:13,00:03:15,and it had a radio transmitter at the base of its skull
00:03:15,00:03:17,and put wire into its fur
00:03:17,00:03:18,and it sounds very gruesome.
00:03:18,00:03:19,They sort of cut the cat open
00:03:19,00:03:21,and then put batteries in its body
00:03:21,00:03:22,and stuff apparently.
00:03:22,00:03:24,"- That does sound a bit gruesome, haven't you?"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"- The cat was fine at the stage, the cat was fine."
00:03:28,00:03:30,And then the idea was that the cat would be sent
00:03:30,00:03:32,to where suspicious enemies were hanging out
00:03:32,00:03:34,so they sent the cat to where they thought
00:03:34,00:03:37,a couple of Soviets were in Washington
00:03:37,00:03:39,and they let the cat out the van
00:03:39,00:03:41,and it got hit by a taxi and killed immediately.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- No.
00:03:42,00:03:47,- But there was a robot dog that they did build and develop.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"So this is, I'm not sure if your bomb was DARPA."
00:03:49,00:03:51,"If you heard of these guys, DARPA,"
00:03:51,00:03:54,so it's a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
00:03:54,00:03:56,Basically they do a lot of the wacky stuff
00:03:56,00:03:57,for the American military.
00:03:57,00:03:59,And one of the things they develop was a robot dog
00:03:59,00:04:02,who would carry weapons around the battlefield
00:04:02,00:04:03,and it's on four legs and it's really good.
00:04:03,00:04:06,You can push it really hard and it won't fall over.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"So it's stable, okay?"
00:04:07,00:04:10,And it trots around and it can go up hills and down hills
00:04:10,00:04:13,but it was recently scrapped because it was so noisy
00:04:13,00:04:16,it would immediately give away anybody's position
00:04:16,00:04:18,on the battlefield just by its presence.
00:04:18,00:04:21,- Is it like a worrying noise or is it barking or what?
00:04:21,00:04:24,"- It's a worrying, they didn't build in a bark"
00:04:24,00:04:26,to give away the position.
00:04:26,00:04:27,(laughing)
00:04:27,00:04:29,- Can't you just take the bark away?
00:04:29,00:04:31,It wouldn't be realistic without that.
00:04:31,00:04:32,(laughing)
00:04:32,00:04:36,- Have you guys heard of Bird's Eye bomb?
00:04:36,00:04:36,- No.
00:04:36,00:04:39,"- No, is that a fish finger related thing?"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"- No, so this is a pigeon guided missile"
00:04:42,00:04:45,and this was developed in World War II
00:04:45,00:04:47,by a psychologist called B.F. Skinner
00:04:47,00:04:50,"and the idea behind this, he was looking at pigeons"
00:04:50,00:04:52,and he was like suddenly I saw them as a device.
00:04:52,00:04:54,Could they not guide a missile?
00:04:54,00:04:56,And this genuinely was put into test.
00:04:56,00:04:59,He had the pigeon looking at specific images
00:04:59,00:05:01,that might be the target during World War II.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"So for example, a huge ship"
00:05:03,00:05:06,"and he would have the pigeon peck, the ship."
00:05:06,00:05:08,"And every time it peck the ship,"
00:05:08,00:05:09,"it was like yes, that's your goal."
00:05:09,00:05:11,It would get a reward or something like that.
00:05:11,00:05:14,The idea behind this missile is that in front of the missile
00:05:14,00:05:16,there was gonna be a little nodule
00:05:16,00:05:18,that contained the pigeon inside.
00:05:18,00:05:20,"And when they launched the rocket,"
00:05:20,00:05:23,the pigeon would see the ship in the distance
00:05:23,00:05:26,and start pecking the front of the missile
00:05:26,00:05:29,and wherever it pecked is where the missile turned towards
00:05:29,00:05:31,and that it would bring it to wherever it needed to go
00:05:31,00:05:34,through the maneuverability of the pigeon neck
00:05:34,00:05:37,and it got past all the physicists and the military people
00:05:37,00:05:39,but it didn't get past the budget.
00:05:39,00:05:41,So it would have worked.
00:05:41,00:05:43,We could have had pigeon dodged the missiles.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- How much does one pigeon cost?
00:05:44,00:05:48,(audience laughing)
00:05:48,00:05:51,- There's a great military website called WarOnTheRox.com
00:05:51,00:05:53,and it's just fascinating articles about military history
00:05:53,00:05:55,and future and development and everything.
00:05:55,00:05:57,And they're saying that in future it's much more effective
00:05:57,00:06:00,than having one hundred million pound missile
00:06:00,00:06:03,to have a swarm of geese which are robots
00:06:03,00:06:06,which each has a small amount of explosive on it.
00:06:06,00:06:07,See what I mean?
00:06:07,00:06:10,"Yeah, I think I haven't explained that as quickly as I could"
00:06:10,00:06:13,and I nor as clearly as I can see it in here.
00:06:13,00:06:17,But why is it that's better than having one huge goose with a...
00:06:17,00:06:18,"- It's much better than having one big, yes."
00:06:18,00:06:19,- It's a giant explosive.
00:06:19,00:06:22,- In this analogy the cruise missile is one massive goose
00:06:22,00:06:23,and you're saying you want a thousand tiny geese.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"- Got it, 'cause it can scatter it further."
00:06:25,00:06:28,- It can scatter even advanced defense
00:06:28,00:06:31,"and interceptor systems can't get all the geese, can they?"
00:06:31,00:06:33,"- No, but what if..."
00:06:33,00:06:34,- Maybe they should be like insects
00:06:34,00:06:37,"and like really, really, really small bombs."
00:06:37,00:06:38,"That'd be good, right?"
00:06:38,00:06:39,- Yes.
00:06:39,00:06:40,- How?
00:06:40,00:06:41,"- Yes, it would."
00:06:41,00:06:44,- How deadly a device can you attach to your average house fly?
00:06:44,00:06:45,"- Yeah, that's a good point."
00:06:45,00:06:46,There was a thing they did with insects
00:06:46,00:06:49,"which was it was called the harassing, annoying"
00:06:49,00:06:52,and bad guy identifying chemical systems.
00:06:52,00:06:53,- Right.
00:06:53,00:06:55,- And what they would do is they put a chemical
00:06:55,00:06:58,on a bad guy and it was attracting insects
00:06:58,00:07:00,and so all the insects would fly near him
00:07:00,00:07:02,and they'd know which one the bad guy was.
00:07:02,00:07:03,- Right.
00:07:03,00:07:05,- Is that like an official government turn?
00:07:05,00:07:06,"- Bad guy, is that used?"
00:07:06,00:07:08,(laughing)
00:07:08,00:07:10,"I think in the American military they do use that, they do."
00:07:10,00:07:13,- But if you put a queen bee on a bad guy.
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Yes.
00:07:14,00:07:15,- All the other bees get attracted to the queen bee.
00:07:15,00:07:17,That is a thing that happens.
00:07:17,00:07:17,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:17,00:07:20,You could slip a bee in his pocket when he's not looking.
00:07:20,00:07:21,- Yeah.
00:07:21,00:07:21,- A queen bee.
00:07:21,00:07:22,- A queen bee.
00:07:22,00:07:24,- And then all the bees are gonna go and attack him.
00:07:24,00:07:26,- Do you guys remember that genuinely happened
00:07:26,00:07:28,in the news last year where someone accidentally trapped
00:07:28,00:07:31,"a queen bee into the back of her car, drove off"
00:07:31,00:07:35,and was chased for hours by this queen hive?
00:07:35,00:07:36,And she had no idea why.
00:07:36,00:07:40,"There's this grandmother going, what the hell is going on?"
00:07:40,00:07:42,- There is one more DARPA thing that DARPA did.
00:07:42,00:07:43,- Yeah.
00:07:43,00:07:46,"- Okay, so after President Kennedy was assassinated,"
00:07:46,00:07:47,"they had a thing which in private,"
00:07:47,00:07:50,they called Operation Barn Door.
00:07:50,00:07:52,"I, we did not manage to save the last president,"
00:07:52,00:07:55,"but we do wanna save the next president, okay?"
00:07:55,00:07:56,That was how they refer to it.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"And privately, that was not the official name of the thing."
00:07:59,00:08:03,"But one of their ideas for saving the president,"
00:08:03,00:08:04,the next president's life in the event
00:08:04,00:08:06,"of an assassination attempt, this is real,"
00:08:06,00:08:10,was to put a fake bulletproof sunshade on his head.
00:08:10,00:08:12,"- Yeah, there's sort of some visor things that you have."
00:08:12,00:08:16,- But they said you would also have to spread fake weather reports
00:08:16,00:08:18,to justify why he was wearing it.
00:08:18,00:08:20,(laughing)
00:08:20,00:08:22,- So he would be out in the raid
00:08:22,00:08:25,and they're going to be beautiful sunny day here.
00:08:25,00:08:27,(laughing)
00:08:27,00:08:28,- Right.
00:08:28,00:08:29,- That's amazing.
00:08:29,00:08:30,That's how they think these guys.
00:08:30,00:08:33,- That visor is only covering a little bit of his body.
00:08:33,00:08:34,- We'll cover about 2% of the body.
00:08:34,00:08:36,- So what they should really do is give him
00:08:36,00:08:38,a bulletproof beekeeping suit.
00:08:38,00:08:39,- Yes.
00:08:39,00:08:42,- And then spread information that there's a queen bee around him.
00:08:42,00:08:44,(laughing)
00:08:44,00:08:45,- Yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"- Did you guys know, just one weapon that the US is developing now?"
00:08:48,00:08:51,"So they're still doing some pretty weird stuff,"
00:08:51,00:08:54,is a sticky foam gun.
00:08:54,00:08:57,So this is the idea is that it's a non-lethal thing
00:08:57,00:08:59,that shoots sticky foam at the enemy
00:08:59,00:09:00,and it lands on the ground.
00:09:00,00:09:01,And if you're driving something over it
00:09:01,00:09:02,"or even if you're running over it,"
00:09:02,00:09:03,then you get stuck to it
00:09:03,00:09:06,and you can't continue to chase the enemy.
00:09:06,00:09:09,And this was actually tried in Somalia in 1995
00:09:09,00:09:11,when they were trying to evacuate people from there.
00:09:11,00:09:14,And so it's this taffy like goo that it shoots out.
00:09:14,00:09:15,It's shot from a hose.
00:09:15,00:09:17,It's designed to fix the person's feet to the ground.
00:09:17,00:09:19,At the moment it's at a stage where people's feet
00:09:19,00:09:22,can move faster than the glue actually works.
00:09:22,00:09:25,So the best that could possibly happen was
00:09:25,00:09:26,"if you hit a person's thighs,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,his legs sometimes stuck together.
00:09:28,00:09:30,(laughing)
00:09:30,00:09:32,"- But even then, if someone manages to wrap"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"so them and go under their legs,"
00:09:34,00:09:35,"they'll be free, I believe."
00:09:35,00:09:36,No.
00:09:36,00:09:38,(laughing)
00:09:38,00:09:40,"- Yeah, that's the truth."
00:09:40,00:09:43,"- All right, it is time for fact number two"
00:09:43,00:09:45,and that is James.
00:09:45,00:09:47,"- Okay, my fact is that earlier this year,"
00:09:47,00:09:50,"a book called ""40 Minutes Late"""
00:09:50,00:09:53,was returned to a library in San Francisco
00:09:53,00:09:55,100 years late.
00:09:55,00:09:55,(laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:57,- It's so cool.
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Is that the latest ever that it books?
00:09:58,00:10:00,"- No, it's not."
00:10:00,00:10:03,Often people say that George Washington is a lake test ever.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"He, well, he didn't return it."
00:10:05,00:10:08,It was returned 200 years after he borrowed a book.
00:10:08,00:10:08,"- Oh, okay."
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- Obviously for obvious reasons,"
00:10:10,00:10:11,he didn't return it himself.
00:10:11,00:10:12,(laughing)
00:10:12,00:10:13,Although what actually happened was
00:10:13,00:10:15,they found out about this book
00:10:15,00:10:16,and they couldn't find the original.
00:10:16,00:10:19,And so they bought another copy of the same book
00:10:19,00:10:21,and returned that to the library.
00:10:21,00:10:22,So it was a bit of a cheat.
00:10:22,00:10:23,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:10:23,00:10:24,- It's a pretty cheat.
00:10:24,00:10:25,- That's what a cheat turned into one.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:26,00:10:27,That's the one that the whole internet says
00:10:27,00:10:29,"is the oldest return book,"
00:10:29,00:10:30,but actually it was a completely different book.
00:10:30,00:10:31,- Yeah.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"Well, do you know how, when he took it out of the library,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,he didn't even bother to sign his name.
00:10:36,00:10:39,"He just got his assistant to write the word ""president."""
00:10:39,00:10:41,And that's how they've assumed that it was him.
00:10:41,00:10:43,- It's just imagine the president being
00:10:43,00:10:45,"that eagletistical these days, isn't it?"
00:10:45,00:10:48,(laughing)
00:10:48,00:10:49,- Just an ordinary man.
00:10:49,00:10:51,- It's hard to imagine the president
00:10:51,00:10:52,visiting a library these days.
00:10:52,00:10:54,(laughing)
00:10:54,00:10:56,(cheering)
00:10:56,00:11:01,- So what's the context of this?
00:11:01,00:11:03,"- Oh, yeah, that's a good point."
00:11:03,00:11:05,"So yeah, this was just a book"
00:11:05,00:11:10,that was borrowed in 1917 by a lady called Phoebe Johnson.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"And they found the book, and they gave it back."
00:11:13,00:11:18,"And there was a fine of $3,650 that she owed or her family owed,"
00:11:18,00:11:22,but they waived that.
00:11:22,00:11:23,- They always waived the fine.
00:11:23,00:11:24,- They always waived it.
00:11:24,00:11:26,- And I always think libraries are in trouble now.
00:11:26,00:11:27,They need that money.
00:11:27,00:11:28,- This is what I think.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"If you have a book, which is like two weeks over,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,"and you need to pay two quid on it,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"keep it for another 100 years, they'll waive the fine."
00:11:34,00:11:37,(laughing)
00:11:37,00:11:39,"- What we need is an example where someone has taken it out,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,"returned it five years late,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,and it's given a lifetime sentence.
00:11:43,00:11:44,That's what we need just in them.
00:11:44,00:11:46,We'll all bring books back.
00:11:46,00:11:47,- That's not what works best.
00:11:47,00:11:50,So they have amnesty's at libraries all the time.
00:11:50,00:11:53,"And those work better for getting people to return the fine,"
00:11:53,00:11:54,"'cause people don't return them,"
00:11:54,00:11:56,'cause they're afraid of the fine.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"And then the fine gets worse and worse,"
00:11:58,00:11:59,"and then you're more afraid,"
00:11:59,00:12:00,so then you never return it.
00:12:00,00:12:02,But lots of libraries.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"So last month, Sydney scrapped library fines"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"from now until 2021, saying they don't work,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"remind us work better, please just bring the books back."
00:12:11,00:12:13,And they've had three times as many returned.
00:12:13,00:12:13,- Is that right?
00:12:13,00:12:14,- Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:16,- Apparently there are 25 million books
00:12:16,00:12:19,that are officially missing from UK libraries.
00:12:19,00:12:19,- Oh yeah.
00:12:19,00:12:22,- And that would take at the current rate of publishing
00:12:22,00:12:24,"in this country, it'd take 135 years"
00:12:24,00:12:26,for that many books to be published.
00:12:26,00:12:27,- Yeah.
00:12:27,00:12:28,"- But this is, they think it might be more actually."
00:12:28,00:12:31,"So they've looked at their records, library records,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,"and 25 million books are missing,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,"as in they've compared it to, I think about 40 years ago,"
00:12:36,00:12:37,and we've lost half the books.
00:12:37,00:12:40,"But they looked at a bunch of Suffolk libraries,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,"and they realized that they had 10,000 books missing"
00:12:42,00:12:44,"that weren't logged as missing,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,so they've just haven't logged it into their history.
00:12:45,00:12:47,- It's just completely empty.
00:12:47,00:12:48,- So that's not a thing.
00:12:48,00:12:49,(laughing)
00:12:49,00:12:50,"- And all libraries have said, yeah,"
00:12:50,00:12:51,we have the same thing.
00:12:51,00:12:53,We forget to log returns and stuff all the time.
00:12:53,00:12:56,So it's thought that we've just got way more
00:12:56,00:12:58,than 25 million books that have disappeared.
00:12:58,00:12:59,- Wow.
00:12:59,00:13:01,It's new paint and it's been followed by Amazon
00:13:01,00:13:03,"for where they're gonna put all of their stuff now,"
00:13:03,00:13:04,including books.
00:13:04,00:13:07,"So they've got their own sort of new warehouse library,"
00:13:07,00:13:08,and it's underwater.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"So the bottom of a lake, though."
00:13:10,00:13:11,"Yeah, they're building this--"
00:13:11,00:13:12,"- Well, the bubble warehouse."
00:13:12,00:13:14,"- The bubble, the books will be soggy, no?"
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- With the, no, they're like those bath books"
00:13:16,00:13:17,that you get.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"- Every book will be like that, every book."
00:13:19,00:13:21,(laughing)
00:13:21,00:13:23,So they're building this bubble warehouse
00:13:23,00:13:26,"underneath a lake right at the bottom,"
00:13:26,00:13:27,"and any time an order comes in,"
00:13:27,00:13:29,"all the stock that's down there, books,"
00:13:29,00:13:32,"or anything like Kindles or TVs, whatever you buy,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,are gonna be in these big canisters.
00:13:34,00:13:38,"And if you've ordered it, they're gonna send the item back up"
00:13:38,00:13:41,to the surface by releasing a balloon
00:13:41,00:13:44,that will carry it to the top of the lake.
00:13:44,00:13:47,"I mean, I think we've all got the same question."
00:13:47,00:13:48,(laughing)
00:13:48,00:13:51,Which is what advantage does this have
00:13:51,00:13:55,over a normal land-based warehouse?
00:13:55,00:13:58,- I would imagine real estate must be cheaper
00:13:58,00:13:59,than the bottom of a lake.
00:13:59,00:14:00,"- Yes, yeah."
00:14:00,00:14:01,"- There's no one wants to live there, do they?"
00:14:01,00:14:04,- And it's so weird that I did not ask myself that question.
00:14:04,00:14:07,(laughing)
00:14:07,00:14:10,My favorite bit of just general book news from the air?
00:14:10,00:14:11,- Right.
00:14:11,00:14:13,"- Tory politician, Gavin Barwell,"
00:14:13,00:14:16,"who wrote a book called How to Win a Marginal Seat,"
00:14:16,00:14:21,lost his marginal seat in the 27th general election.
00:14:21,00:14:23,"- Oh, so good."
00:14:23,00:14:25,He didn't say how to win every marginal seat.
00:14:25,00:14:27,(laughing)
00:14:27,00:14:28,- That's true.
00:14:28,00:14:30,"- You know, you were saying that you get library amnesties."
00:14:30,00:14:33,And one of the ways you can take a book back
00:14:33,00:14:36,and not be fined is by writing the most imaginative excuse
00:14:36,00:14:37,you can think of.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"And this is in San Francisco,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"which is this where this was fact was from, James."
00:14:41,00:14:42,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:14:42,00:14:44,"- So this in San Francisco in 2009,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,they had an amnesty where they said if you turned up
00:14:46,00:14:48,and you wrote down a really imaginative reason
00:14:48,00:14:49,"why you had brought it back late,"
00:14:49,00:14:51,then they didn't charge you.
00:14:51,00:14:52,"- Do you have, do you have examples?"
00:14:52,00:14:53,"- Well, there are some."
00:14:53,00:14:55,"So one of the women said this book was so nice,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"it looked so posh on my shelf, I couldn't bear to give it back."
00:14:58,00:14:59,It made me look really well read.
00:14:59,00:15:01,(laughing)
00:15:01,00:15:03,"One, a group of people said they were too busy"
00:15:03,00:15:05,rescuing marine mammals.
00:15:05,00:15:06,- That's quite good.
00:15:06,00:15:07,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:15:07,00:15:08,- Yeah.
00:15:08,00:15:11,One woman had bought out a book on romantic relationships
00:15:11,00:15:13,'cause she was looking for some insight into
00:15:13,00:15:15,how to solve her relationship problems.
00:15:15,00:15:16,And she decided she'd keep it
00:15:16,00:15:19,'cause she needed more advice than the library allowance
00:15:19,00:15:20,had time to give her.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"But three partners later, she decided it wasn't helping"
00:15:23,00:15:24,and then returned it.
00:15:24,00:15:26,(laughing)
00:15:26,00:15:30,"In 2013, a Belgian professor analyzed a copy"
00:15:30,00:15:33,of 50 Shades of Grey from a library in Antwerp.
00:15:33,00:15:37,It tested positive for both cocaine and herpes.
00:15:37,00:15:37,- Wow.
00:15:37,00:15:43,"- Yeah, but have they analyzed pride and prejudice"
00:15:43,00:15:44,for comparison?
00:15:44,00:15:47,(laughing)
00:15:47,00:15:49,"- The worst thing is, that's the one fact"
00:15:49,00:15:50,you're all gonna remember.
00:15:50,00:15:52,(laughing)
00:15:52,00:15:54,"- I think, can you get, excuse my ignorance,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,can you get herpes from a book?
00:15:56,00:15:57,(laughing)
00:15:57,00:16:00,'Cause it's like a lot of tests to carry out when I get home.
00:16:00,00:16:01,(laughing)
00:16:01,00:16:02,"Do we need to move on, shortly?"
00:16:02,00:16:03,"- Uh, shortly, yeah."
00:16:03,00:16:05,"- Oh, if you got something before we do?"
00:16:05,00:16:06,"- Well, there's a library in Portugal,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,which is partly stuffed by bats.
00:16:08,00:16:10,"So, I thought I'd better."
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- Yeah, no, get that in."
00:16:11,00:16:14,"- So, what, in what way are they partly?"
00:16:14,00:16:15,- Quite.
00:16:15,00:16:17,It's called Mafra Palace Library.
00:16:17,00:16:18,So it's a beautiful ancient library.
00:16:18,00:16:21,"It's about three or four hundred years old, I think."
00:16:21,00:16:23,And it has a colony of bats living there
00:16:23,00:16:25,who live behind the shelves.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"And then when the library closes down at night,"
00:16:27,00:16:28,"they come out, they fly out,"
00:16:28,00:16:30,and they fly all over the library.
00:16:30,00:16:31,- And they put all the books back.
00:16:31,00:16:32,- They put all the books back.
00:16:32,00:16:34,(laughing)
00:16:34,00:16:36,"- No, but they do eat all the insects"
00:16:36,00:16:37,that get into the library.
00:16:37,00:16:39,And the library apparently is full of insects.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"So, the insects would be damaging the books,"
00:16:41,00:16:42,but they can't damage the books
00:16:42,00:16:44,'cause they've been eaten by the bats.
00:16:44,00:16:47,"So, every night, the bats eat,"
00:16:47,00:16:49,each bat eats double its own weight in insects.
00:16:49,00:16:50,- Wow.
00:16:50,00:16:52,- The only problem is that they also leave
00:16:52,00:16:55,a thin layer of droppings over the whole library.
00:16:55,00:16:57,(laughing)
00:16:57,00:16:59,"All right, should we move on to our third photo?"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- Okay, and it's time for fact number three."
00:17:01,00:17:03,And that is Anna.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"- Yeah, my fact is that the person"
00:17:05,00:17:09,who invented crowd control barriers did so
00:17:09,00:17:12,because so many people were flocking to see his giant balloon.
00:17:12,00:17:14,(laughing)
00:17:14,00:17:15,"This is his guy called Nadar,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,"who I just found out about,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"'cause there's a new book about him called The Great Nadar,"
00:17:18,00:17:21,it's by a guy called Adam Begley.
00:17:21,00:17:23,"And he's sort of a multi-talented guy,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,but he was the most famous photographer in France
00:17:25,00:17:26,in the 19th century.
00:17:26,00:17:27,He was a caricaturist.
00:17:27,00:17:30,He was a balloonist.
00:17:30,00:17:33,And he decided to build this giant balloon
00:17:33,00:17:34,and attracted loads of people to come and see it.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"And then so many people came to see it,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,all these crowds flopped and flopped.
00:17:38,00:17:39,He couldn't take off.
00:17:39,00:17:41,"So, he was attracting like 200,000 people"
00:17:41,00:17:42,to one balloon takeoff.
00:17:42,00:17:43,- A thousand people.
00:17:43,00:17:44,- It's a lot of people.
00:17:44,00:17:46,"At one point, he attracted, I think,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,a quarter of the population of Paris
00:17:48,00:17:50,went to see him launch a balloon.
00:17:50,00:17:51,- Wow.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"- And so then he designed crack control barriers,"
00:17:53,00:17:55,which is exactly the same design that we have today.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"- So this one was, was it called The Giant,"
00:17:58,00:17:59,this one that you're talking about?
00:17:59,00:18:00,- La géon.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"- La géon, yeah."
00:18:01,00:18:04,It had enough room for 20 people in the gondola
00:18:04,00:18:06,at the bottom of the balloon.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"It also had a lavatory,"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"bunk beds, a printing press,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,and a wine cellar.
00:18:13,00:18:13,- Oh.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"- Wine cellar in the hot air balloon, yeah."
00:18:16,00:18:17,- And a billiard's table.
00:18:17,00:18:18,- It was incredible.
00:18:18,00:18:20,It had six different rooms in the basket.
00:18:20,00:18:23,"And yeah, you could play billiards in it."
00:18:23,00:18:25,"They had, when he launched it on its second attempt,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"he took, I think, 12 people up,"
00:18:27,00:18:31,and they all had a really posh dinner on the balcony.
00:18:31,00:18:31,- On the balcony?
00:18:31,00:18:32,- Yeah.
00:18:32,00:18:33,(laughing)
00:18:33,00:18:36,- Are you confusing this with the cartoon up?
00:18:36,00:18:37,The movie up?
00:18:37,00:18:38,- Yes.
00:18:38,00:18:39,- Yes.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Is it a cellar?
00:18:40,00:18:42,"Is that one, that's on a different level, isn't it?"
00:18:42,00:18:43,"- Well, it was two levels."
00:18:43,00:18:43,- It was two.
00:18:43,00:18:44,- It was two levels?
00:18:44,00:18:45,- Yeah.
00:18:45,00:18:46,- Two stories.
00:18:46,00:18:48,- It was not like a bungalow in...
00:18:48,00:18:52,(laughing)
00:18:52,00:18:54,- It was like two bungalows on top of each other.
00:18:54,00:18:56,(laughing)
00:18:56,00:18:58,- He invented the double bungalow?
00:18:58,00:18:59,- Wow.
00:18:59,00:19:00,This guy is good.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"- The thing is, the first..."
00:19:02,00:19:03,I think it was the first time he said of it.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"It's very, the maiden void of the giant."
00:19:04,00:19:07,"Everyone came to see it, and how many people did he say it was?"
00:19:07,00:19:08,"- It was 200,000 people."
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- 200,000 people."
00:19:09,00:19:12,"But the inflation took so long,"
00:19:12,00:19:13,'cause it was the largest hot air balloon
00:19:13,00:19:14,"that had ever been built,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"that they were all really, really bored."
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Well, before it was full."
00:19:17,00:19:21,"And as it took off, they just suddenly, silently watched it,"
00:19:21,00:19:22,disappear into the sky.
00:19:22,00:19:24,They didn't cheer at all.
00:19:24,00:19:26,As they were so angry that their time had been wasted.
00:19:26,00:19:27,(laughing)
00:19:27,00:19:28,"- Oh, really?"
00:19:28,00:19:29,- Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"- A similar thing happened in Leicester in 1864,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,where they had a hot air balloon.
00:19:33,00:19:36,"It took so long to go up, everyone got a bit bored."
00:19:36,00:19:40,The police tried to sort out a little bit of a ruckus going on.
00:19:40,00:19:43,"And then someone got hit, and then a massive riot ensued."
00:19:43,00:19:45,And then the guy who was running the hot air balloon
00:19:45,00:19:47,"decided I'm not doing this anymore,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,"made the hot air balloon go down,"
00:19:49,00:19:53,"and everyone run over, burned it, ripped it up,"
00:19:53,00:19:56,and then paraded it through the streets of Leicester.
00:19:56,00:19:57,- Wow.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"- And for a while, people from Leicester were called Ballooner Ticks."
00:20:00,00:20:04,"So, yeah, for most of the end of the 19th century,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,"if you were from Leicester, people would call you a Ballooner Tick."
00:20:07,00:20:08,- Wow.
00:20:08,00:20:11,"- Because if there was a riot happening on the ground,"
00:20:11,00:20:12,"and I had access to a hot air balloon,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"my instinct would be to get out of there,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,- Yeah. - Quickly.
00:20:17,00:20:18,- He just legged at this guy.
00:20:18,00:20:20,He was called Henry Coxwell.
00:20:20,00:20:22,"And he was quite famous, Ballooner's before."
00:20:22,00:20:25,"He'd once gone up into the stratosphere,"
00:20:25,00:20:28,see how high he could go up in his hot air balloon.
00:20:28,00:20:31,And he went up and up and up until he went temporarily blind
00:20:31,00:20:32,and passed out.
00:20:32,00:20:36,"He lost all sensation in his hands,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,but luckily there was one other guy in there
00:20:38,00:20:41,who just before he passed out managed to open a valve
00:20:41,00:20:44,"with his teeth, which made a comeback."
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- Oh, it happened to his hands."
00:20:46,00:20:47,"- Oh, he had no sensation in them, maybe?"
00:20:47,00:20:48,"- Yeah, no sensation."
00:20:48,00:20:49,- I see.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"Okay, unlike your very, you know, nervous teeth."
00:20:52,00:20:53,(laughing)
00:20:53,00:20:54,- Or he liked a challenge.
00:20:54,00:20:55,- Yeah.
00:20:55,00:20:59,- I was reading about more about this in the dark eye.
00:20:59,00:21:00,He is an extraordinary character.
00:21:00,00:21:01,"- Oh, he's the best."
00:21:01,00:21:02,My new favorite guy.
00:21:02,00:21:03,"- Yeah, he's beyond ballooning."
00:21:03,00:21:06,He's a huge pioneer of photography.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"So, one of the things that he used to do in the hot air balloons"
00:21:09,00:21:11,was to effectively invent aerial photography.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"So, facing over Paris, he used to go over fields"
00:21:14,00:21:16,and he did it hundreds of times
00:21:16,00:21:17,because he couldn't manage to get the exposure
00:21:17,00:21:20,on the camera right because the balloon kept moving
00:21:20,00:21:21,and obviously photos took a long time
00:21:21,00:21:23,to capture the motion.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"And also, what he didn't know at the time was"
00:21:25,00:21:27,the gas that was heating the balloon was getting away
00:21:27,00:21:29,and putting soot all over.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"So, he'd come down and there would just be black photos"
00:21:31,00:21:32,completely.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"And he'd be like, I'm pretty sure it was daytime"
00:21:33,00:21:36,"when I did this, and that was the reason for that."
00:21:36,00:21:39,And then he also invented underground photography.
00:21:39,00:21:43,"So, he's like, he's hit every spectrum underground photography."
00:21:43,00:21:44,- Yeah.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"- He actually did it in, we talked a few weeks ago"
00:21:45,00:21:47,on the podcast about the catacombs of Paris
00:21:47,00:21:49,"and he did it in the catacombs, didn't he?"
00:21:49,00:21:52,"And so, lighting with candles the area"
00:21:52,00:21:53,and then taking photos.
00:21:53,00:21:56,- It's a bit much to say he invented underground photography.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"He's just taking photos on the ground, isn't he?"
00:21:58,00:21:58,- Yeah.
00:21:58,00:21:59,(laughing)
00:21:59,00:22:01,- It's like the wind up radio.
00:22:01,00:22:02,It's not really an invention.
00:22:02,00:22:04,It's just two inventions stuck together.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"- And also, I think you usually say he invented something"
00:22:06,00:22:07,when it's something we all recognize.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"It's not like we've all gone, God,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,can you imagine the world without underground photography?
00:22:11,00:22:15,"- Yes, but, okay, he took the invention of the camera"
00:22:15,00:22:17,and he took the person invented underground
00:22:17,00:22:21,"and he smashed them together, and that's what he did."
00:22:21,00:22:23,"But photography wise, it is worth saying that,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,"thanks to him, we have extraordinary portraits"
00:22:25,00:22:28,"of some of the greatest figures of that period, Jules Verne."
00:22:28,00:22:32,"He did this gigantic caricature of all of them,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"where he, again, kind of effectively invented"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"that whole caricature, grotesque, large head, small body thing."
00:22:39,00:22:43,He did a 300-person line of all the most influential people
00:22:43,00:22:46,"in Paris at the time, or France, generally."
00:22:46,00:22:48,"And while he was doing it, it was taking too long"
00:22:48,00:22:50,'cause the most important ones came into sit
00:22:50,00:22:51,for their drawings.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"So when photography was around, he was looking at that going,"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"""I could capture them and start doing them via this."""
00:22:58,00:22:59,So he managed to get Jules Verne.
00:22:59,00:23:02,He managed to get Victor Hugo.
00:23:02,00:23:04,He got Sarah Bernhardt.
00:23:04,00:23:07,He didn't get Balzac because he thought
00:23:07,00:23:11,"that cameras would steal his soul, so he said no to the photo."
00:23:11,00:23:12,"But some of the most important people,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,"and they're beautiful photos, if you look at them online."
00:23:14,00:23:16,"Yeah, they really are."
00:23:16,00:23:18,"He wasn't very successful, actually."
00:23:18,00:23:21,"His balloons were just crashing constantly, and he kept going."
00:23:21,00:23:24,So there were first-hand reports of the giant balloon
00:23:24,00:23:27,"that he sent up, where the aim was that it would travel"
00:23:27,00:23:28,over loads of different countries.
00:23:28,00:23:31,"So the first guests that got on, they brought tour guides"
00:23:31,00:23:34,"to various countries in Europe, and they brought their passports."
00:23:34,00:23:37,But you can't control where you're going.
00:23:37,00:23:38,That's why you have to take tour guides to all of them.
00:23:38,00:23:41,Get a visa for everyone.
00:23:41,00:23:44,"And this was pretty easy, so they would have needed a visa,"
00:23:44,00:23:45,wouldn't they?
00:23:45,00:23:46,For every single border.
00:23:46,00:23:47,But they didn't get very far.
00:23:47,00:23:50,"So the first time they lasted 15 miles,"
00:23:50,00:23:51,"and then the balloon plummeted to earth,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,and the wicker basket was bumped along the earth.
00:23:54,00:23:57,"The second one actually traveled 400 miles,"
00:23:57,00:23:59,"so it flew over the Netherlands and into Germany,"
00:23:59,00:24:03,"but then Nadar Panik, so the balloon was getting too hot"
00:24:03,00:24:04,from the heat of the sun.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"So he started letting the air out, and the winds took it,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,and it crash-landed into the ground.
00:24:08,00:24:11,And there are these descriptions of it bouncing across fields.
00:24:11,00:24:14,"On its side, everyone in it being tossed around,"
00:24:14,00:24:17,"bouncing through a wood, it went towards a railway track."
00:24:17,00:24:19,"The train driver did an emergency stop,"
00:24:19,00:24:22,and Nadar said a couple of feet before he hit them.
00:24:22,00:24:23,And then it just spilled everyone out.
00:24:23,00:24:27,And people were scattered across the ground like fallen apples.
00:24:27,00:24:28,"Being dragged along the floor for it,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"it was like for miles, wasn't it?"
00:24:30,00:24:31,"It was, yeah."
00:24:31,00:24:33,"That's-- I mean, you can't play billiards"
00:24:33,00:24:35,"while that's happening, how do you--"
00:24:35,00:24:38,"It would make it more interesting game, possibly."
00:24:38,00:24:40,So you know how every invention is tested on animals
00:24:40,00:24:43,before it's tested on humans?
00:24:43,00:24:43,Is it?
00:24:43,00:24:44,Yeah.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"So space flight, they send up the dolls."
00:24:46,00:24:46,"Oh, yeah?"
00:24:46,00:24:48,They send up the-- they send up in text first.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Same is true of hot air ballooning.
00:24:49,00:24:52,"They send up together in the first hot air balloon flight,"
00:24:52,00:24:55,"a rooster, a duck, and the sheep."
00:24:55,00:24:57,And it was thought the sheep would be most helpful
00:24:57,00:24:59,"because it's a land animal, so the rooster and the duck"
00:24:59,00:25:02,are obviously used to soaring to great heights above the earth.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"But the sheep is more like the human,"
00:25:04,00:25:07,so we can see if it explodes or whatever
00:25:07,00:25:08,when it gets up there.
00:25:08,00:25:09,And they did?
00:25:09,00:25:10,"No, it didn't explode."
00:25:10,00:25:13,So what's the next phase after animal trials?
00:25:13,00:25:14,Anyone?
00:25:14,00:25:14,Human trials.
00:25:14,00:25:19,"Well, not just any human trials, condemned criminal trials."
00:25:19,00:25:21,So the next step was to send up a condemned criminal
00:25:21,00:25:24,in the basket of the balloon to see if he exploded.
00:25:24,00:25:25,The only problem was that the only people
00:25:25,00:25:27,"who knew how to fly them were real experts,"
00:25:27,00:25:30,because obviously it was a quite a tricky thing to do.
00:25:30,00:25:32,And very few of the qualified experts
00:25:32,00:25:35,wanted to go up with a dangerous criminal
00:25:35,00:25:38,"in a hot air balloon, which is a wicker basket, which is tiny."
00:25:38,00:25:41,"So Holden, when the rooster and the sheep and the duck went up,"
00:25:41,00:25:44,they also had a human expert with them flying the balloon.
00:25:44,00:25:46,I am not sure.
00:25:46,00:25:48,Because I always pictured it as just then.
00:25:48,00:25:49,So did I.
00:25:49,00:25:50,But I don't understand how that happened.
00:25:50,00:25:51,I think it was.
00:25:51,00:25:53,I think it was Tethered.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"It was Tethered, so he was winding it back down."
00:25:56,00:26:01,"Because you nearly just blew this thing wider, didn't it?"
00:26:01,00:26:03,Why didn't the duck fly?
00:26:03,00:26:04,Ducks can fly.
00:26:04,00:26:06,Why wouldn't it just go with this thing a bit of a dodgy way to fly?
00:26:06,00:26:08,"But I'm just going to put it up, OK?"
00:26:08,00:26:09,"I'm out, guys."
00:26:09,00:26:12,Probably the duck was Tethered to the balloon.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Right.
00:26:13,00:26:17,"The most ironic thing you can do is give a bird the power of flight,"
00:26:17,00:26:20,but deny it the ability to actually fly away.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"But the worst thing if you're on the sheep and the other two fly away,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"you're thinking, well, maybe I could do it."
00:26:25,00:26:26,I'm not sure.
00:26:26,00:26:31,I don't know if roosters can really.
00:26:31,00:26:33,I'm trying to remember the plot of Chicken Run
00:26:33,00:26:35,and the extent to which chickens can't or can't fly.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"But it's not called Chicken Fly, is it?"
00:26:37,00:26:40,"It might, indeed."
00:26:40,00:26:43,"I read a really nice balloon story yesterday,"
00:26:43,00:26:47,"which is that in 2007, NASA had funded this project, which"
00:26:47,00:26:48,was called BLAST.
00:26:48,00:26:50,And the idea is that they were going to fly it
00:26:50,00:26:54,above the clouds in Antarctica for 40 kilometers high.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"And for 12 days, they were going to take photos"
00:26:56,00:26:59,by infrared of star formations in the sky.
00:26:59,00:27:01,So it was up there for via the balloon.
00:27:01,00:27:03,"12 days is big, sad light."
00:27:03,00:27:05,"And then when the 12 days was done, they were bringing it back down."
00:27:05,00:27:07,"So they detached it from the balloon,"
00:27:07,00:27:10,"and it fell towards the Earth, and then parachutes deployed."
00:27:10,00:27:13,"So they brought the parachutes, and they landed on Antarctica."
00:27:13,00:27:16,"And it was all fine, except just before it landed,"
00:27:16,00:27:19,there was meant to be an electronic device that snapped away
00:27:19,00:27:21,"the parachutes, but that failed."
00:27:21,00:27:23,"As a result, the parachutes were on the side,"
00:27:23,00:27:27,"and a huge gust of wind came and picked up the parachutes,"
00:27:27,00:27:32,and they parisailed away from the researchers for 24 hours.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Non-stop.
00:27:33,00:27:37,"They eventually found it 2,000 kilometers away."
00:27:37,00:27:39,"But they didn't find it for a year,"
00:27:39,00:27:42,because apparently NASA likes to paint everything white.
00:27:42,00:27:46,"And as a result, it was just camouflaged 2,000 miles away."
00:27:46,00:27:47,That was awesome.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Wow.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"And so they-- kind of like when you drop a crisp packet,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"and it gets taken by the wind, and you're"
00:27:52,00:27:55,"constantly going after it, do they chase it for a while?"
00:27:55,00:27:56,Were they running after this thing?
00:27:56,00:27:58,When does that happen at your life?
00:27:58,00:27:59,"You know, when you drop a--"
00:27:59,00:28:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:01,00:28:03,You drop a bit of rubbish.
00:28:03,00:28:05,"And if you've ever seen American and beauty,"
00:28:05,00:28:08,"the wind sometimes takes rubbish, and you chase after it,"
00:28:08,00:28:11,"and you're always trying to grab it, it always eludes your grasp."
00:28:11,00:28:13,"So was it like that, where the scientist constantly"
00:28:13,00:28:15,"grabbing at it, and it's just dancing away at the last moment?"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"Not at all, no."
00:28:17,00:28:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:19,00:28:19,Have you--
00:28:19,00:28:20,"Oh, it's nice that I cleared that up."
00:28:20,00:28:23,Have you eaten all the crisps in this scenario?
00:28:23,00:28:24,"Are you trying to get the crisp back,"
00:28:24,00:28:26,or are you trying to get the packet back?
00:28:26,00:28:29,I'm not a filthy littler like some people are ending.
00:28:29,00:28:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:30,00:28:31,Why?
00:28:31,00:28:34,[APPLAUSE]
00:28:34,00:28:37,Yeah.
00:28:37,00:28:41,Classic eco-conscious festival crowd.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"Honestly, if I dropped a packet of crisps,"
00:28:43,00:28:46,I'd just open another one immediately.
00:28:46,00:28:50,I'm joking.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Just a full packet.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"You've got a full, closed packet."
00:28:53,00:28:55,"Sometimes I open a multi-pack, drop it."
00:28:55,00:28:58,It's gone.
00:28:58,00:29:00,Do you know the very first ever balloonists
00:29:00,00:29:05,to cross the English Channel landed with no trousers on?
00:29:05,00:29:06,This is true.
00:29:06,00:29:07,It's 100% true.
00:29:07,00:29:08,So excited.
00:29:08,00:29:10,So at what stage did the trousers go?
00:29:10,00:29:11,Right away.
00:29:11,00:29:12,"Almost a minute, no."
00:29:12,00:29:13,On entry.
00:29:13,00:29:13,"No, no, no."
00:29:13,00:29:15,So I think we may have done--
00:29:15,00:29:16,we may have mentioned this on QI.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"I'm not sure, but many years ago."
00:29:17,00:29:21,So they were crossing English Channel.
00:29:21,00:29:22,It was all going great.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"But then, they started to descend."
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Or rapidly, there wasn't enough air in the balloon."
00:29:26,00:29:28,And they started getting really worried.
00:29:28,00:29:31,So they immediately took up their trousers.
00:29:31,00:29:34,They first threw away the anchors
00:29:34,00:29:36,on the side of the balloon.
00:29:36,00:29:36,Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:39,"Basically, they could see the white cliffs of Dover."
00:29:39,00:29:41,"They were going, oh, we're not quite going to get over those."
00:29:41,00:29:42,So they--
00:29:42,00:29:44,And so now I've got rid of all the sandbags and stuff for that.
00:29:44,00:29:45,They throw away the sandbags.
00:29:45,00:29:51,They throw away the oars that they hope to steer with.
00:29:51,00:29:52,I don't know.
00:29:52,00:29:54,Then they throw away a propeller that they had with them.
00:29:54,00:29:55,That's for some reason.
00:29:55,00:29:57,"And then, eventually, they had to throw away pretty much"
00:29:57,00:30:00,"all the clothes they were wearing, including their trousers."
00:30:00,00:30:01,And they made it.
00:30:01,00:30:02,They made it across.
00:30:02,00:30:05,And they landed with no trousers on.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"Did at any point, when the panic was setting in,"
00:30:07,00:30:11,"what'd they go, who braw all this shit?"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"Oh, we didn't win the oars."
00:30:13,00:30:17,"Of course, we're going to crash into a mountain you dick."
00:30:17,00:30:19,"So when they landed with our trousers,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"did they all stay in the balloon,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,or do you use them to get out for the press conference?
00:30:23,00:30:26,They said--
00:30:26,00:30:28,It does sound like an excuse though.
00:30:28,00:30:31,It does sound like an excuse.
00:30:31,00:30:32,"What are you suggesting, James?"
00:30:32,00:30:35,I'm suggesting that they took their trousers off
00:30:35,00:30:36,for another reason.
00:30:36,00:30:37,Right.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"When the press turned up, they said, why have you done that?"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"And they said, well, we took our trousers off"
00:30:42,00:30:43,because of the thing.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"And they said, well, did you throw anything else?"
00:30:45,00:30:50,"And they're like, yeah, we threw out all the oars that we had here."
00:30:50,00:30:53,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:30:53,00:30:54,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:30:54,00:31:01,My factor is that Volkswagen sells more sausages than cars.
00:31:01,00:31:04,This is 100% true.
00:31:04,00:31:04,It's unbelievable.
00:31:04,00:31:05,It's unbelievable.
00:31:05,00:31:07,I can't believe I'd never had this before.
00:31:07,00:31:09,"This was sent in, by the way, by my covenants"
00:31:09,00:31:10,"and Mike, if you're listening."
00:31:10,00:31:12,Thank you so much for sending us in.
00:31:12,00:31:17,"In 2015, Volkswagen sold 5.8 million cars, pretty good."
00:31:17,00:31:21,But there's all 7.2 million sausages.
00:31:21,00:31:23,But sausages are a lot cheaper.
00:31:23,00:31:25,"Yeah, it's easier to make a sausage than a car."
00:31:25,00:31:27,That is true.
00:31:27,00:31:29,So they don't make less money on the sausages.
00:31:29,00:31:30,That's what I'm saying.
00:31:30,00:31:31,"Yeah, but they'll have been fine less"
00:31:31,00:31:34,for cheating on the emissions.
00:31:34,00:31:36,What the sausages do.
00:31:36,00:31:38,"They also make ketchup as well, don't they?"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"They make their own ketchup, and they get sold in supermarkets"
00:31:40,00:31:42,by a pack of Volkswagen's.
00:31:42,00:31:45,"If I read this, apparently, they have their own code."
00:31:45,00:31:48,They are listed these sausages as an official Volkswagen
00:31:48,00:31:53,"component, which is 1-9308-500-A."
00:31:53,00:31:56,And car dealers will often give you a five pack of sausages
00:31:56,00:31:58,if you buy a Volkswagen.
00:31:58,00:32:00,Does that tip some people over the edge
00:32:00,00:32:02,into making that position?
00:32:02,00:32:03,I think so.
00:32:03,00:32:04,They do.
00:32:04,00:32:04,But very tasty.
00:32:04,00:32:07,"It's not that surprising that they sell more sausages than cars,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,and if for every car you're giving away five sausages--
00:32:09,00:32:10,That's true.
00:32:13,00:32:17,"So they invented them to feed their workers, didn't they?"
00:32:17,00:32:20,"In the 1970s, they came up with this new kind of sausage"
00:32:20,00:32:22,that they give their workers.
00:32:22,00:32:23,"And then suddenly, the workers said,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,"this is really good sausage, guys."
00:32:25,00:32:26,You should sell it.
00:32:26,00:32:27,And they started selling it.
00:32:27,00:32:28,Right.
00:32:28,00:32:30,And they still give it to the workers though every day.
00:32:30,00:32:33,So they have it at about nine in the morning.
00:32:33,00:32:34,It's curry sausage as well.
00:32:34,00:32:37,So it's quite an acquired taste for breakfast.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"So curry sausage, big and Germany, basically."
00:32:39,00:32:40,Yeah.
00:32:40,00:32:42,Do you know that Berlin has an entire museum
00:32:42,00:32:43,devoted to curry sausage?
00:32:43,00:32:44,Does it?
00:32:44,00:32:45,It has a curry sausage museum.
00:32:45,00:32:47,And I read some of the reviews of it.
00:32:47,00:32:49,I just wanted to share a review or two with you.
00:32:49,00:32:51,One of the reviews on you.
00:32:51,00:32:54,11 euros seems a steep price to pay for a small exhibit
00:32:54,00:32:56,on the history and glory of curry vest.
00:32:56,00:32:57,Still gave it four stars.
00:32:57,00:33:00,It's a lot of fun.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"Then he added, would I go back?"
00:33:02,00:33:02,No.
00:33:02,00:33:08,"But then he said, in fairness, he said,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,because it's an exhibit that I doubt changes its content.
00:33:11,00:33:14,Why would it?
00:33:14,00:33:17,So it's a roller coaster.
00:33:17,00:33:19,Curry first was brought to Germany
00:33:19,00:33:21,"by the British, really, wasn't it?"
00:33:21,00:33:25,"Well, so it's sort of in the, you know,"
00:33:25,00:33:26,we just try to claim everything.
00:33:26,00:33:29,But so it was just after World War II.
00:33:29,00:33:32,And so some of the allied soldiers there
00:33:32,00:33:34,"introduced curry powder and ketchup,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,because we had a lot of curry powder.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"We were into curry, a lot of trade with India."
00:33:38,00:33:41,"And then a German woman said, oh, that tastes"
00:33:41,00:33:42,to be nice with a sausage.
00:33:42,00:33:44,And so she created curry vest.
00:33:44,00:33:46,"And in the museum, I believe they say,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,"without the good old British, we wouldn't have"
00:33:48,00:33:50,our staple dish today.
00:33:50,00:33:51,Oh.
00:33:51,00:33:54,"James, is inventing the curry sausage?"
00:33:54,00:33:55,"No, it's not an invention."
00:33:55,00:34:00,It's just putting curry and sausage together.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"Is it better than the wind-up radio, as an invention,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,would you say?
00:34:04,00:34:07,"Well, I haven't been to the museum."
00:34:07,00:34:08,You should go.
00:34:08,00:34:09,It sounds amazing.
00:34:09,00:34:09,What's ours?
00:34:09,00:34:13,They've got a spice chamber with sniffing stations.
00:34:13,00:34:18,"They've got audio stations playing curry-worst theme songs,"
00:34:18,00:34:22,a virtual curry-versed-making game called Curry Up
00:34:22,00:34:24,and a sausage-shaped sofa.
00:34:24,00:34:30,So I went onto website lovepark.co.uk.
00:34:30,00:34:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:34,00:34:37,And I was disappointed to find it.
00:34:37,00:34:40,"For starters, won't we be going back?"
00:34:40,00:34:43,"No, it's not what you would, I think."
00:34:43,00:34:45,It's a non-departmental public body
00:34:45,00:34:47,about the park industry.
00:34:47,00:34:51,But they have some fun facts about sausages.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"So for instance, there are more than 500 recipes"
00:34:54,00:34:56,for sausage in Britain.
00:34:56,00:34:59,But you could have a different British sausage every day
00:34:59,00:35:01,for 10 years.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Wait.
00:35:02,00:35:03,You wouldn't live that long in it.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"No, 5,000, don't you mean?"
00:35:05,00:35:06,That's a number of recipes.
00:35:06,00:35:09,But that was two facts mushed together.
00:35:09,00:35:11,Are you invented a new fan?
00:35:11,00:35:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:14,00:35:19,"And did you know that in 320 AD, eating sausages was a sin."
00:35:19,00:35:22,And it was made a sin by the Catholic Church
00:35:22,00:35:25,because it was associated with pagan festivals.
00:35:25,00:35:26,Wow.
00:35:26,00:35:29,And you just know why they were eating sausages at those.
00:35:29,00:35:30,"No, I mean, that is--"
00:35:30,00:35:32,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
00:35:32,00:35:35,"Oh, I was imagine a huge phallic ritual kind of--"
00:35:35,00:35:37,"No, no, I think--"
00:35:37,00:35:40,You are completely on your own.
00:35:40,00:35:41,I'm sorry.
00:35:41,00:35:44,And you're in a room of like 200 people.
00:35:44,00:35:45,I don't know if that is--
00:35:45,00:35:47,Surely one person is here.
00:35:47,00:35:49,There was one person at the door.
00:35:49,00:35:50,Yeah.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"Oh, I'm here."
00:35:51,00:35:53,"I don't need your pity, guys."
00:35:53,00:35:54,I'm a bit of a big alert on this one.
00:35:54,00:35:58,And the other thing about pagans and sausages
00:35:58,00:36:01,is I went on the internet today and Googled pagan sausages.
00:36:01,00:36:03,And I found out there's quite a--
00:36:03,00:36:06,"I was disappointed, in fact."
00:36:06,00:36:08,"Well, there's quite a few people online who"
00:36:08,00:36:10,seem to think that the word Jesus when
00:36:10,00:36:13,said backwards is sausage.
00:36:13,00:36:14,"Oh, it's--"
00:36:14,00:36:15,"It is, sausage."
00:36:15,00:36:19,"It's sausage, sausage, sausage."
00:36:19,00:36:22,So maybe that's the reason that it's an evil pagan thing.
00:36:22,00:36:25,Cessage.
00:36:25,00:36:30,"That's a huge-- that's like a Da Vinci code moment, isn't it?"
00:36:30,00:36:33,Jesus was a sausage.
00:36:33,00:36:37,Can I tell you a little story from the BBC News website?
00:36:37,00:36:41,"All right, it's news from Northern Ireland from last week."
00:36:41,00:36:42,Court reporters were a little taken
00:36:42,00:36:44,back when a self-confessed sausage thief
00:36:44,00:36:47,tried to get on first name terms with a judge at Belfast
00:36:47,00:36:48,magistrate's court.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"Belfast man, Mike and McNally, who has almost 300"
00:36:51,00:36:54,"previous convictions, was jailed after emitting a new spade"
00:36:54,00:36:56,"of shoplifting, including the theft"
00:36:56,00:36:58,of 10 packs of sausages.
00:36:58,00:37:00,His defense lawyer told the district judge Fiona Bagnell
00:37:00,00:37:03,"that McNally had managed to stay out of jail for six weeks,"
00:37:03,00:37:07,which he says is a record for him.
00:37:07,00:37:08,As he was led to the cells McNally
00:37:08,00:37:10,"called out to the judge, that's OK."
00:37:10,00:37:11,"See you later, Fiona."
00:37:11,00:37:21,"Obviously crime is wrong, but on another level, what a guy."
00:37:21,00:37:23,That was how many packs of sausages?
00:37:23,00:37:25,He stole 10 packs of sausages.
00:37:25,00:37:28,Because you couldn't possibly get through those before they
00:37:28,00:37:30,"went off, could you?"
00:37:30,00:37:32,You could freeze them.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Freeze them.
00:37:33,00:37:35,I'm more of a hand-to-mouth.
00:37:35,00:37:38,I never lose the freezer.
00:37:38,00:37:39,"OK, that makes more sense."
00:37:39,00:37:44,"That's why you have such a crisp-based diet, isn't it?"
00:37:44,00:37:46,Do you know how long the longest sausage was?
00:37:46,00:37:48,No.
00:37:48,00:37:51,It was--
00:37:51,00:37:53,"Guys, it was 63 kilometers long."
00:37:54,00:37:57,"It's sausage, Christ."
00:37:57,00:38:07,"That was a huge sausage, that's massive."
00:38:07,00:38:09,Was it like a mistake in the factory
00:38:09,00:38:13,where they meant to put the twist in between each one?
00:38:13,00:38:15,That guy was off sick that day.
00:38:15,00:38:16,"No, the longer it was a deliberate thing,"
00:38:16,00:38:19,it was to celebrate Romania day in Romania.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"And it was, yeah, 63 miles long."
00:38:21,00:38:23,It was actually a bit disappointing.
00:38:23,00:38:25,"They never spread it out all the way, I don't think."
00:38:25,00:38:27,So it was all curled around.
00:38:27,00:38:29,But maybe they just didn't have a space long enough.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Yeah.
00:38:30,00:38:33,How far would you get outside?
00:38:33,00:38:35,60 kilometers from here?
00:38:35,00:38:35,Yeah.
00:38:35,00:38:37,Isn't that space?
00:38:37,00:38:38,Yes.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"No, it would be."
00:38:39,00:38:42,"Yeah, if you stood the sausage up, you would get a space."
00:38:42,00:38:43,"You might hit the International Space Station,"
00:38:43,00:38:44,is that right?
00:38:44,00:38:45,"Yes, it is."
00:38:45,00:38:49,So that could be how they get there in future.
00:38:49,00:38:52,"It's climbing the giant sausage, isn't it?"
00:38:52,00:38:54,But have more as interfaiths.
00:38:54,00:38:58,"Do you give all the more climb the giant sausage, James?"
00:38:58,00:39:03,"OK, there was a story-- right, you're Australian, don't you?"
00:39:03,00:39:04,Yeah.
00:39:04,00:39:05,So there was a story about the--
00:39:05,00:39:08,"So in Australia, when you vote, you get given a democracy"
00:39:08,00:39:09,sausage.
00:39:09,00:39:10,This is what they call it.
00:39:10,00:39:10,But!
00:39:10,00:39:13,"So if you turn up to vote, they have a load--"
00:39:13,00:39:15,"genuinely, they have barbecues at every pollination"
00:39:15,00:39:16,in Australia.
00:39:16,00:39:18,"But during the last election, there"
00:39:18,00:39:20,was a massive faux pas by both leaders.
00:39:20,00:39:22,This was in 2016.
00:39:22,00:39:23,"So Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister,"
00:39:23,00:39:26,"skipped the democracy sausage photo opportunity,"
00:39:26,00:39:29,presumably because he thought it might look silly or something.
00:39:29,00:39:29,But get this.
00:39:29,00:39:31,I cannot get my head around this.
00:39:31,00:39:35,Opposition leader Bill Shorten committed a faux pas
00:39:35,00:39:37,when he tried to eat his sausage and bun combination
00:39:37,00:39:42,"from the side, rather than from the end."
00:39:42,00:39:42,Wow.
00:39:42,00:39:44,That's brilliant.
00:39:44,00:39:47,What a monster!
00:39:47,00:39:50,How would you even eat?
00:39:50,00:39:53,It's an exciting decision.
00:39:53,00:39:54,I'm calling it.
00:39:54,00:39:58,This is an invention.
00:39:58,00:40:00,"Hey, we're going to have to wrap up very shortly."
00:40:00,00:40:02,"Yeah, so if you guys have anything before we go."
00:40:02,00:40:05,"I have one last thing, which is that during the election campaign"
00:40:05,00:40:07,"in America, the presidential campaign,"
00:40:07,00:40:10,a hot dog stand in Chicago sold a hot dog
00:40:10,00:40:13,"that they called the Trump Footlong, which"
00:40:13,00:40:15,was actually a three-inch long hot dog.
00:40:16,00:40:17,OK.
00:40:17,00:40:18,That is it.
00:40:18,00:40:19,That is all of our facts.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"Thank you so much, everyone here for--"

00:41:16,00:41:17,And it's out this November.
00:41:17,00:41:20,And it is a book that contains what
00:41:20,00:41:21,we think are the most interesting things
00:41:21,00:41:23,have happened over the last 12 months.
00:41:23,00:41:25,There's a lot of sausage material in there.
00:41:25,00:41:26,There is so much sausage.
00:41:26,00:41:27,"But that's it, guys."
