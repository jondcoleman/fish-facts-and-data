00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
 (electronic music)

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.760
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.840
 (electronic music)

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.680
 (electronic music)

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast"

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.040
 this week coming to you from the wilderness festival.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.040
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.740
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.660
 James Harkin and Aniches Insky.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.740
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.380
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.940
 We're gonna start with my fact this week.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.620
 My fact is that in 1957,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.060
 America developed a shouting bomb

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.780
 that would lecture the enemy for three minutes

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.500
 as it dropped from the sky.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.860
 (audience laughing)

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.580
 When I get down there, you are in celebration, mister.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.220
 This was a very rogue one mentioned

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.620
 and in new scientists article,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.660
 I haven't been able to approve its existence

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.940
 outside of this one article.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.740
 Yeah, there's no mention online at all, is there?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.340
 It's almost as if I made it up.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 (audience laughing)

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 But why?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.340
 I read also that apparently it would give instructions

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.060
 to the soldiers on the ground as well.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.740
 As a bomb came down, you'd be able to hear what to do

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.580
 if you were soldier.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 Really?

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 Like run.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.340
 As it takes three minutes to shout that.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.580
 No, so what I couldn't ascertain is does this bomb go off

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.620
 or is it merely a propaganda tool?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.500
 So the idea is that it would be dropped from a plane

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.460
 from about 60,000 feet high.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.460
 And then parachutes would deploy

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.620
 and then as it was making its ascent

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.420
 or descent rather to the ground.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.260
 (audience laughing)

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.180
 Well, that's correct.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.580
 And much of the people in the airplane,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.620
 oh, it's coming back.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 (audience laughing)

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.780
 This is the worst lecture ever.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.020
 (audience laughing)

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.420
 Yes, so the idea is that it would parachute down

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.540
 and then it would just, and this is 1957,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.780
 as it got to a certain height,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.540
 a tape recorder on the inside would switch on

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.740
 and it would play a tape through the speakers

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.980
 in the shouting bomb out to the general area

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.580
 and it could be heard as far as half a mile apparently.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.420
 Wow.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.940
 And we don't know what it exactly what it said.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.100
 I know, we don't know if it's real.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.940
 I mean, where?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940
 (audience laughing)

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.900
 But it's in new scientists

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.620
 and I have to say the reason I think a lot of great

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.260
 pop science writers have these incredible careers

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.820
 like John Ronson and Mary Roach and so on.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.180
 They uncover these documents

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.420
 'cause there's so many of these abandoned plans

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.700
 for military weaponry where they thought,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.020
 "Oh, this would be an amazing thing to do."

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.060
 And it gets to the stage where it's about to be approved

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.900
 and then it doesn't.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.460
 So I believe this is the same.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.860
 They almost got this approved

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.860
 and then lost it at last.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.940
 They are, I mean, the ideas people were coming out with

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.220
 were all completely insane

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.140
 and there's so many of them.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.660
 Every time we talk about this,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.180
 like I hadn't read about Acoustic Kitty,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.780
 which I think was a project that got a little bit further

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.660
 but that was the CIA around the same time in the 1960s

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.140
 and this was a Cold War project

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.820
 and the idea was that they wanted to spy on Soviet embassies

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.620
 and they were gonna do it with cats.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.380
 And so that implanted a microphone into a cat's ear canal

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.740
 and it had a radio transmitter at the base of its skull

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.140
 and put wire into its fur

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.380
 and it sounds very gruesome.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.860
 They sort of cut the cat open

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.620
 and then put batteries in its body

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 and stuff apparently.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.220
 - That does sound a bit gruesome, haven't you?

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.060
 - The cat was fine at the stage, the cat was fine.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.380
 And then the idea was that the cat would be sent

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.580
 to where suspicious enemies were hanging out

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.460
 so they sent the cat to where they thought

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.820
 a couple of Soviets were in Washington

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.500
 and they let the cat out the van

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.900
 and it got hit by a taxi and killed immediately.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.900
 - No.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.260
 - But there was a robot dog that they did build and develop.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.900
 So this is, I'm not sure if your bomb was DARPA.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.260
 If you heard of these guys, DARPA,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.420
 so it's a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.060
 Basically they do a lot of the wacky stuff

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.300
 for the American military.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.780
 And one of the things they develop was a robot dog

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.260
 who would carry weapons around the battlefield

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.700
 and it's on four legs and it's really good.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.340
 You can push it really hard and it won't fall over.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.740
 So it's stable, okay?

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.660
 And it trots around and it can go up hills and down hills

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.980
 but it was recently scrapped because it was so noisy

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.540
 it would immediately give away anybody's position

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.700
 on the battlefield just by its presence.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.780
 - Is it like a worrying noise or is it barking or what?

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.980
 - It's a worrying, they didn't build in a bark

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.300
 to give away the position.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.780
 (laughing)

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.140
 - Can't you just take the bark away?

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.100
 It wouldn't be realistic without that.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.580
 (laughing)

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.140
 - Have you guys heard of Bird's Eye bomb?

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.980
 - No.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.180
 - No, is that a fish finger related thing?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.700
 - No, so this is a pigeon guided missile

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.900
 and this was developed in World War II

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.980
 by a psychologist called B.F. Skinner

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.060
 and the idea behind this, he was looking at pigeons

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.660
 and he was like suddenly I saw them as a device.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.660
 Could they not guide a missile?

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.940
 And this genuinely was put into test.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.580
 He had the pigeon looking at specific images

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.860
 that might be the target during World War II.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.980
 So for example, a huge ship

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.780
 and he would have the pigeon peck, the ship.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.060
 And every time it peck the ship,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.540
 it was like yes, that's your goal.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.300
 It would get a reward or something like that.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.780
 The idea behind this missile is that in front of the missile

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.340
 there was gonna be a little nodule

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.740
 that contained the pigeon inside.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.500
 And when they launched the rocket,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.620
 the pigeon would see the ship in the distance

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.140
 and start pecking the front of the missile

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.940
 and wherever it pecked is where the missile turned towards

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.980
 and that it would bring it to wherever it needed to go

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.620
 through the maneuverability of the pigeon neck

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.860
 and it got past all the physicists and the military people

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.660
 but it didn't get past the budget.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.300
 So it would have worked.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.260
 We could have had pigeon dodged the missiles.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.780
 - How much does one pigeon cost?

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.380
 (audience laughing)

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.060
 - There's a great military website called WarOnTheRox.com

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.420
 and it's just fascinating articles about military history

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.020
 and future and development and everything.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.580
 And they're saying that in future it's much more effective

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.340
 than having one hundred million pound missile

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.380
 to have a swarm of geese which are robots

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.140
 which each has a small amount of explosive on it.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.340
 See what I mean?

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.100
 Yeah, I think I haven't explained that as quickly as I could

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.260
 and I nor as clearly as I can see it in here.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.340
 But why is it that's better than having one huge goose with a...

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.500
 - It's much better than having one big, yes.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.540
 - It's a giant explosive.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.060
 - In this analogy the cruise missile is one massive goose

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.780
 and you're saying you want a thousand tiny geese.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.660
 - Got it, 'cause it can scatter it further.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.900
 - It can scatter even advanced defense

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.940
 and interceptor systems can't get all the geese, can they?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.220
 - No, but what if...

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.780
 - Maybe they should be like insects

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.580
 and like really, really, really small bombs.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.500
 That'd be good, right?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.340
 - Yes.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.180
 - How?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.420
 - Yes, it would.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.140
 - How deadly a device can you attach to your average house fly?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.060
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.540
 There was a thing they did with insects

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.660
 which was it was called the harassing, annoying

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.660
 and bad guy identifying chemical systems.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.500
 - Right.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.340
 - And what they would do is they put a chemical

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.700
 on a bad guy and it was attracting insects

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.540
 and so all the insects would fly near him

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.980
 and they'd know which one the bad guy was.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.820
 - Right.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.460
 - Is that like an official government turn?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.940
 - Bad guy, is that used?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.180
 (laughing)

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.700
 I think in the American military they do use that, they do.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.500
 - But if you put a queen bee on a bad guy.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.340
 - Yes.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.820
 - All the other bees get attracted to the queen bee.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.020
 That is a thing that happens.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.180
 You could slip a bee in his pocket when he's not looking.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.020
 - Yeah.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.860
 - A queen bee.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.700
 - A queen bee.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.540
 - And then all the bees are gonna go and attack him.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.140
 - Do you guys remember that genuinely happened

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.900
 in the news last year where someone accidentally trapped

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.980
 a queen bee into the back of her car, drove off

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.180
 and was chased for hours by this queen hive?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.580
 And she had no idea why.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.420
 There's this grandmother going, what the hell is going on?

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.620
 - There is one more DARPA thing that DARPA did.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.460
 - Yeah.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.700
 - Okay, so after President Kennedy was assassinated,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.980
 they had a thing which in private,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.180
 they called Operation Barn Door.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.740
 I, we did not manage to save the last president,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.060
 but we do wanna save the next president, okay?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.860
 That was how they refer to it.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.740
 And privately, that was not the official name of the thing.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.220
 But one of their ideas for saving the president,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.900
 the next president's life in the event

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.540
 of an assassination attempt, this is real,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.380
 was to put a fake bulletproof sunshade on his head.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.780
 - Yeah, there's sort of some visor things that you have.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.740
 - But they said you would also have to spread fake weather reports

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.820
 to justify why he was wearing it.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.980
 (laughing)

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.900
 - So he would be out in the raid

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.620
 and they're going to be beautiful sunny day here.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.660
 (laughing)

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.500
 - Right.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.340
 - That's amazing.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.780
 That's how they think these guys.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.300
 - That visor is only covering a little bit of his body.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.700
 - We'll cover about 2% of the body.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.140
 - So what they should really do is give him

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.740
 a bulletproof beekeeping suit.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.580
 - Yes.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.660
 - And then spread information that there's a queen bee around him.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.340
 (laughing)

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.180
 - Yeah.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.780
 - Did you guys know, just one weapon that the US is developing now?

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.100
 So they're still doing some pretty weird stuff,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.500
 is a sticky foam gun.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.220
 So this is the idea is that it's a non-lethal thing

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.060
 that shoots sticky foam at the enemy

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.180
 and it lands on the ground.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.380
 And if you're driving something over it

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.820
 or even if you're running over it,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.980
 then you get stuck to it

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.420
 and you can't continue to chase the enemy.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.300
 And this was actually tried in Somalia in 1995

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.380
 when they were trying to evacuate people from there.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.540
 And so it's this taffy like goo that it shoots out.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.500
 It's shot from a hose.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.540
 It's designed to fix the person's feet to the ground.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.900
 At the moment it's at a stage where people's feet

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.420
 can move faster than the glue actually works.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.300
 So the best that could possibly happen was

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.900
 if you hit a person's thighs,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.820
 his legs sometimes stuck together.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.980
 (laughing)

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.980
 - But even then, if someone manages to wrap

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.140
 so them and go under their legs,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.380
 they'll be free, I believe.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.220
 No.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.940
 (laughing)

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.020
 - Yeah, that's the truth.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.780
 - All right, it is time for fact number two

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.420
 and that is James.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.980
 - Okay, my fact is that earlier this year,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.540
 a book called "40 Minutes Late"

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.300
 was returned to a library in San Francisco

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.100
 100 years late.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.940
 (laughing)

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.060
 - It's so cool.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.860
 - Is that the latest ever that it books?

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.300
 - No, it's not.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.180
 Often people say that George Washington is a lake test ever.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.220
 He, well, he didn't return it.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.060
 It was returned 200 years after he borrowed a book.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:08.900
 - Oh, okay.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.380
 - Obviously for obvious reasons,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.660
 he didn't return it himself.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.500
 (laughing)

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.900
 Although what actually happened was

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.060
 they found out about this book

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.900
 and they couldn't find the original.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.340
 And so they bought another copy of the same book

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.020
 and returned that to the library.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.340
 So it was a bit of a cheat.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.180
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.020
 - It's a pretty cheat.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.260
 - That's what a cheat turned into one.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.620
 That's the one that the whole internet says

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.380
 is the oldest return book,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.980
 but actually it was a completely different book.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.820
 - Yeah.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.140
 Well, do you know how, when he took it out of the library,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.140
 he didn't even bother to sign his name.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.900
 He just got his assistant to write the word "president."

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.980
 And that's how they've assumed that it was him.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.380
 - It's just imagine the president being

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.260
 that eagletistical these days, isn't it?

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.580
 (laughing)

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.820
 - Just an ordinary man.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.060
 - It's hard to imagine the president

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.500
 visiting a library these days.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.380
 (laughing)

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.980
 (cheering)

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.820
 - So what's the context of this?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.580
 - Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.900
 So yeah, this was just a book

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.260
 that was borrowed in 1917 by a lady called Phoebe Johnson.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.780
 And they found the book, and they gave it back.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.780
 And there was a fine of $3,650 that she owed or her family owed,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.060
 but they waived that.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.380
 - They always waived the fine.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.380
 - They always waived it.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.260
 - And I always think libraries are in trouble now.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.420
 They need that money.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.420
 - This is what I think.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.860
 If you have a book, which is like two weeks over,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.460
 and you need to pay two quid on it,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.980
 keep it for another 100 years, they'll waive the fine.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.380
 (laughing)

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.940
 - What we need is an example where someone has taken it out,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.420
 returned it five years late,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.300
 and it's given a lifetime sentence.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.780
 That's what we need just in them.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.260
 We'll all bring books back.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.340
 - That's not what works best.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.300
 So they have amnesty's at libraries all the time.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.220
 And those work better for getting people to return the fine,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.220
 'cause people don't return them,

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.660
 'cause they're afraid of the fine.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.060
 And then the fine gets worse and worse,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.060
 and then you're more afraid,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.260
 so then you never return it.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.060
 But lots of libraries.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.220
 So last month, Sydney scrapped library fines

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.740
 from now until 2021, saying they don't work,

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.100
 remind us work better, please just bring the books back.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.100
 And they've had three times as many returned.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.940
 - Is that right?

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.780
 - Yeah.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.500
 - Apparently there are 25 million books

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.140
 that are officially missing from UK libraries.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.180
 - And that would take at the current rate of publishing

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.620
 in this country, it'd take 135 years

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.340
 for that many books to be published.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.180
 - Yeah.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.660
 - But this is, they think it might be more actually.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.860
 So they've looked at their records, library records,

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.420
 and 25 million books are missing,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.300
 as in they've compared it to, I think about 40 years ago,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.780
 and we've lost half the books.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.620
 But they looked at a bunch of Suffolk libraries,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.900
 and they realized that they had 10,000 books missing

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.260
 that weren't logged as missing,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.700
 so they've just haven't logged it into their history.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.060
 - It's just completely empty.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.300
 - So that's not a thing.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.140
 (laughing)

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.420
 - And all libraries have said, yeah,

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.460
 we have the same thing.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.940
 We forget to log returns and stuff all the time.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.060
 So it's thought that we've just got way more

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.460
 than 25 million books that have disappeared.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.380
 - Wow.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.140
 It's new paint and it's been followed by Amazon

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.220
 for where they're gonna put all of their stuff now,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.540
 including books.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.500
 So they've got their own sort of new warehouse library,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.900
 and it's underwater.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.660
 So the bottom of a lake, though.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.500
 Yeah, they're building this--

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.660
 - Well, the bubble warehouse.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.580
 - The bubble, the books will be soggy, no?

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.420
 - With the, no, they're like those bath books

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.580
 that you get.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.660
 - Every book will be like that, every book.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.620
 (laughing)

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.580
 So they're building this bubble warehouse

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.100
 underneath a lake right at the bottom,

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.740
 and any time an order comes in,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.660
 all the stock that's down there, books,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.740
 or anything like Kindles or TVs, whatever you buy,

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.620
 are gonna be in these big canisters.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.900
 And if you've ordered it, they're gonna send the item back up

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.380
 to the surface by releasing a balloon

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.620
 that will carry it to the top of the lake.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.340
 I mean, I think we've all got the same question.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.860
 (laughing)

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.900
 Which is what advantage does this have

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.860
 over a normal land-based warehouse?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.060
 - I would imagine real estate must be cheaper

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.100
 than the bottom of a lake.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.620
 - Yes, yeah.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.980
 - There's no one wants to live there, do they?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.980
 - And it's so weird that I did not ask myself that question.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.980
 (laughing)

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.540
 My favorite bit of just general book news from the air?

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.380
 - Right.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.660
 - Tory politician, Gavin Barwell,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.300
 who wrote a book called How to Win a Marginal Seat,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.300
 lost his marginal seat in the 27th general election.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.060
 - Oh, so good.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.300
 He didn't say how to win every marginal seat.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.340
 (laughing)

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.180
 - That's true.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.980
 - You know, you were saying that you get library amnesties.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.580
 And one of the ways you can take a book back

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.780
 and not be fined is by writing the most imaginative excuse

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.860
 you can think of.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.180
 And this is in San Francisco,

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.620
 which is this where this was fact was from, James.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.620
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.620
 - So this in San Francisco in 2009,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.420
 they had an amnesty where they said if you turned up

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.180
 and you wrote down a really imaginative reason

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.940
 why you had brought it back late,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.460
 then they didn't charge you.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.620
 - Do you have, do you have examples?

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.460
 - Well, there are some.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.660
 So one of the women said this book was so nice,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.220
 it looked so posh on my shelf, I couldn't bear to give it back.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.780
 It made me look really well read.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.180
 (laughing)

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.420
 One, a group of people said they were too busy

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.740
 rescuing marine mammals.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.740
 - That's quite good.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.580
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.420
 - Yeah.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.380
 One woman had bought out a book on romantic relationships

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.220
 'cause she was looking for some insight into

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.260
 how to solve her relationship problems.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.740
 And she decided she'd keep it

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.780
 'cause she needed more advice than the library allowance

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780
 had time to give her.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.180
 But three partners later, she decided it wasn't helping

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.180
 and then returned it.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.940
 (laughing)

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.260
 In 2013, a Belgian professor analyzed a copy

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.780
 of 50 Shades of Grey from a library in Antwerp.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.100
 It tested positive for both cocaine and herpes.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.940
 - Wow.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:43.740
 - Yeah, but have they analyzed pride and prejudice

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.740
 for comparison?

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.580
 (laughing)

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.180
 - The worst thing is, that's the one fact

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.260
 you're all gonna remember.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.020
 (laughing)

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.660
 - I think, can you get, excuse my ignorance,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.420
 can you get herpes from a book?

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.540
 (laughing)

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.340
 'Cause it's like a lot of tests to carry out when I get home.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.420
 (laughing)

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.820
 Do we need to move on, shortly?

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.980
 - Uh, shortly, yeah.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.260
 - Oh, if you got something before we do?

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.580
 - Well, there's a library in Portugal,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.620
 which is partly stuffed by bats.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.780
 So, I thought I'd better.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.820
 - Yeah, no, get that in.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.460
 - So, what, in what way are they partly?

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.300
 - Quite.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.220
 It's called Mafra Palace Library.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.660
 So it's a beautiful ancient library.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.020
 It's about three or four hundred years old, I think.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.380
 And it has a colony of bats living there

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.740
 who live behind the shelves.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.620
 And then when the library closes down at night,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.940
 they come out, they fly out,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.100
 and they fly all over the library.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.100
 - And they put all the books back.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.260
 - They put all the books back.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
 (laughing)

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.580
 - No, but they do eat all the insects

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.420
 that get into the library.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.300
 And the library apparently is full of insects.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.700
 So, the insects would be damaging the books,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.660
 but they can't damage the books

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.540
 'cause they've been eaten by the bats.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.140
 So, every night, the bats eat,

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.940
 each bat eats double its own weight in insects.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.780
 - Wow.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.740
 - The only problem is that they also leave

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.380
 a thin layer of droppings over the whole library.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.620
 (laughing)

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.540
 All right, should we move on to our third photo?

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.540
 - Okay, and it's time for fact number three.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.740
 And that is Anna.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.980
 - Yeah, my fact is that the person

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.220
 who invented crowd control barriers did so

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.780
 because so many people were flocking to see his giant balloon.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.060
 (laughing)

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.660
 This is his guy called Nadar,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.860
 who I just found out about,

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.980
 'cause there's a new book about him called The Great Nadar,

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.340
 it's by a guy called Adam Begley.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.820
 And he's sort of a multi-talented guy,

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.660
 but he was the most famous photographer in France

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.500
 in the 19th century.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.860
 He was a caricaturist.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.020
 He was a balloonist.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.140
 And he decided to build this giant balloon

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.900
 and attracted loads of people to come and see it.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.460
 And then so many people came to see it,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.100
 all these crowds flopped and flopped.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.060
 He couldn't take off.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.660
 So, he was attracting like 200,000 people

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.860
 to one balloon takeoff.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.700
 - A thousand people.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.540
 - It's a lot of people.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.020
 At one point, he attracted, I think,

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.420
 a quarter of the population of Paris

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.700
 went to see him launch a balloon.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.540
 - Wow.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.380
 - And so then he designed crack control barriers,

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.660
 which is exactly the same design that we have today.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.220
 - So this one was, was it called The Giant,

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.500
 this one that you're talking about?

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.340
 - La géon.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.700
 - La géon, yeah.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.860
 It had enough room for 20 people in the gondola

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.500
 at the bottom of the balloon.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.340
 It also had a lavatory,

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.620
 bunk beds, a printing press,

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.140
 and a wine cellar.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.980
 - Oh.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.500
 - Wine cellar in the hot air balloon, yeah.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.900
 - And a billiard's table.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.740
 - It was incredible.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.980
 It had six different rooms in the basket.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.220
 And yeah, you could play billiards in it.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.900
 They had, when he launched it on its second attempt,

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.860
 he took, I think, 12 people up,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.140
 and they all had a really posh dinner on the balcony.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.980
 - On the balcony?

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.820
 - Yeah.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.660
 (laughing)

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.420
 - Are you confusing this with the cartoon up?

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.340
 The movie up?

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.180
 - Yes.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.180
 - Yes.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.180
 - Is it a cellar?

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.060
 Is that one, that's on a different level, isn't it?

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.060
 - Well, it was two levels.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.900
 - It was two.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.900
 - It was two levels?

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.740
 - Yeah.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.580
 - Two stories.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.900
 - It was not like a bungalow in...

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.220
 (laughing)

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.260
 - It was like two bungalows on top of each other.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.180
 (laughing)

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.580
 - He invented the double bungalow?

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.660
 - Wow.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.780
 This guy is good.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.020
 - The thing is, the first...

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.060
 I think it was the first time he said of it.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.980
 It's very, the maiden void of the giant.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.540
 Everyone came to see it, and how many people did he say it was?

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.820
 - It was 200,000 people.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.820
 - 200,000 people.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.060
 But the inflation took so long,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.260
 'cause it was the largest hot air balloon

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.380
 that had ever been built,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.460
 that they were all really, really bored.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.860
 Well, before it was full.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.260
 And as it took off, they just suddenly, silently watched it,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.860
 disappear into the sky.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.140
 They didn't cheer at all.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.420
 As they were so angry that their time had been wasted.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.420
 (laughing)

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.260
 - Oh, really?

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.100
 - Yeah.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.900
 - A similar thing happened in Leicester in 1864,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.780
 where they had a hot air balloon.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.140
 It took so long to go up, everyone got a bit bored.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.100
 The police tried to sort out a little bit of a ruckus going on.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.780
 And then someone got hit, and then a massive riot ensued.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.940
 And then the guy who was running the hot air balloon

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.420
 decided I'm not doing this anymore,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.260
 made the hot air balloon go down,

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.620
 and everyone run over, burned it, ripped it up,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.180
 and then paraded it through the streets of Leicester.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.340
 - Wow.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.940
 - And for a while, people from Leicester were called Ballooner Ticks.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.820
 So, yeah, for most of the end of the 19th century,

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.460
 if you were from Leicester, people would call you a Ballooner Tick.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.980
 - Wow.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.380
 - Because if there was a riot happening on the ground,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.820
 and I had access to a hot air balloon,

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.660
 my instinct would be to get out of there,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.220
 - Yeah. - Quickly.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.420
 - He just legged at this guy.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.700
 He was called Henry Coxwell.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.940
 And he was quite famous, Ballooner's before.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.300
 He'd once gone up into the stratosphere,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.380
 see how high he could go up in his hot air balloon.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.980
 And he went up and up and up until he went temporarily blind

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.980
 and passed out.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.620
 He lost all sensation in his hands,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.500
 but luckily there was one other guy in there

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.340
 who just before he passed out managed to open a valve

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.420
 with his teeth, which made a comeback.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.180
 - Oh, it happened to his hands.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.780
 - Oh, he had no sensation in them, maybe?

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.780
 - Yeah, no sensation.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.620
 - I see.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.580
 Okay, unlike your very, you know, nervous teeth.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.620
 (laughing)

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.820
 - Or he liked a challenge.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.660
 - Yeah.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.140
 - I was reading about more about this in the dark eye.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.620
 He is an extraordinary character.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.620
 - Oh, he's the best.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.460
 My new favorite guy.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.820
 - Yeah, he's beyond ballooning.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.260
 He's a huge pioneer of photography.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.020
 So, one of the things that he used to do in the hot air balloons

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.980
 was to effectively invent aerial photography.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.380
 So, facing over Paris, he used to go over fields

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.100
 and he did it hundreds of times

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.620
 because he couldn't manage to get the exposure

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.140
 on the camera right because the balloon kept moving

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.980
 and obviously photos took a long time

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.540
 to capture the motion.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.540
 And also, what he didn't know at the time was

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.540
 the gas that was heating the balloon was getting away

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.020
 and putting soot all over.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.260
 So, he'd come down and there would just be black photos

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.100
 completely.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.900
 And he'd be like, I'm pretty sure it was daytime

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.500
 when I did this, and that was the reason for that.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.740
 And then he also invented underground photography.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.260
 So, he's like, he's hit every spectrum underground photography.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.100
 - Yeah.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.820
 - He actually did it in, we talked a few weeks ago

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.740
 on the podcast about the catacombs of Paris

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.220
 and he did it in the catacombs, didn't he?

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.140
 And so, lighting with candles the area

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.380
 and then taking photos.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.180
 - It's a bit much to say he invented underground photography.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.100
 He's just taking photos on the ground, isn't he?

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:58.940
 - Yeah.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.940
 (laughing)

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.340
 - It's like the wind up radio.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.420
 It's not really an invention.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.500
 It's just two inventions stuck together.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.780
 - And also, I think you usually say he invented something

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.980
 when it's something we all recognize.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.140
 It's not like we've all gone, God,

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.620
 can you imagine the world without underground photography?

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.780
 - Yes, but, okay, he took the invention of the camera

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.940
 and he took the person invented underground

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.100
 and he smashed them together, and that's what he did.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.340
 But photography wise, it is worth saying that,

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.780
 thanks to him, we have extraordinary portraits

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.940
 of some of the greatest figures of that period, Jules Verne.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.020
 He did this gigantic caricature of all of them,

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.860
 where he, again, kind of effectively invented

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.220
 that whole caricature, grotesque, large head, small body thing.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.780
 He did a 300-person line of all the most influential people

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.420
 in Paris at the time, or France, generally.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.100
 And while he was doing it, it was taking too long

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.260
 'cause the most important ones came into sit

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.860
 for their drawings.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.740
 So when photography was around, he was looking at that going,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.140
 "I could capture them and start doing them via this."

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.980
 So he managed to get Jules Verne.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.740
 He managed to get Victor Hugo.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.940
 He got Sarah Bernhardt.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.540
 He didn't get Balzac because he thought

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.420
 that cameras would steal his soul, so he said no to the photo.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.860
 But some of the most important people,

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.900
 and they're beautiful photos, if you look at them online.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.780
 Yeah, they really are.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.660
 He wasn't very successful, actually.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.620
 His balloons were just crashing constantly, and he kept going.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.420
 So there were first-hand reports of the giant balloon

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.580
 that he sent up, where the aim was that it would travel

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.980
 over loads of different countries.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.740
 So the first guests that got on, they brought tour guides

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.980
 to various countries in Europe, and they brought their passports.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.260
 But you can't control where you're going.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.700
 That's why you have to take tour guides to all of them.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.860
 Get a visa for everyone.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.060
 And this was pretty easy, so they would have needed a visa,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.060
 wouldn't they?

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.580
 For every single border.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.460
 But they didn't get very far.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.300
 So the first time they lasted 15 miles,

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.900
 and then the balloon plummeted to earth,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.580
 and the wicker basket was bumped along the earth.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.260
 The second one actually traveled 400 miles,

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.860
 so it flew over the Netherlands and into Germany,

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.060
 but then Nadar Panik, so the balloon was getting too hot

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.180
 from the heat of the sun.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.100
 So he started letting the air out, and the winds took it,

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.860
 and it crash-landed into the ground.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.700
 And there are these descriptions of it bouncing across fields.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.260
 On its side, everyone in it being tossed around,

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.140
 bouncing through a wood, it went towards a railway track.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.460
 The train driver did an emergency stop,

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.260
 and Nadar said a couple of feet before he hit them.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.820
 And then it just spilled everyone out.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.260
 And people were scattered across the ground like fallen apples.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.940
 Being dragged along the floor for it,

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.500
 it was like for miles, wasn't it?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.500
 It was, yeah.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.540
 That's-- I mean, you can't play billiards

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.700
 while that's happening, how do you--

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.420
 It would make it more interesting game, possibly.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.940
 So you know how every invention is tested on animals

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.140
 before it's tested on humans?

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.660
 Is it?

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.340
 Yeah.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.140
 So space flight, they send up the dolls.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.660
 Oh, yeah?

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.140
 They send up the-- they send up in text first.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.700
 Same is true of hot air ballooning.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.660
 They send up together in the first hot air balloon flight,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.460
 a rooster, a duck, and the sheep.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.060
 And it was thought the sheep would be most helpful

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.460
 because it's a land animal, so the rooster and the duck

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.780
 are obviously used to soaring to great heights above the earth.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.860
 But the sheep is more like the human,

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.140
 so we can see if it explodes or whatever

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.380
 when it gets up there.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.220
 And they did?

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.620
 No, it didn't explode.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.300
 So what's the next phase after animal trials?

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.060
 Anyone?

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.820
 Human trials.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.060
 Well, not just any human trials, condemned criminal trials.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.900
 So the next step was to send up a condemned criminal

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.300
 in the basket of the balloon to see if he exploded.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.780
 The only problem was that the only people

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.500
 who knew how to fly them were real experts,

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.740
 because obviously it was a quite a tricky thing to do.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.780
 And very few of the qualified experts

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.620
 wanted to go up with a dangerous criminal

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.780
 in a hot air balloon, which is a wicker basket, which is tiny.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.780
 So Holden, when the rooster and the sheep and the duck went up,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.900
 they also had a human expert with them flying the balloon.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.380
 I am not sure.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.580
 Because I always pictured it as just then.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.500
 So did I.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.980
 But I don't understand how that happened.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.820
 I think it was.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.580
 I think it was Tethered.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.620
 It was Tethered, so he was winding it back down.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.820
 Because you nearly just blew this thing wider, didn't it?

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.580
 Why didn't the duck fly?

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.580
 Ducks can fly.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.940
 Why wouldn't it just go with this thing a bit of a dodgy way to fly?

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.340
 But I'm just going to put it up, OK?

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.580
 I'm out, guys.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.780
 Probably the duck was Tethered to the balloon.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.780
 Right.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.580
 The most ironic thing you can do is give a bird the power of flight,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.780
 but deny it the ability to actually fly away.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.460
 But the worst thing if you're on the sheep and the other two fly away,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.420
 you're thinking, well, maybe I could do it.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.820
 I'm not sure.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.300
 I don't know if roosters can really.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.260
 I'm trying to remember the plot of Chicken Run

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.420
 and the extent to which chickens can't or can't fly.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.180
 But it's not called Chicken Fly, is it?

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.300
 It might, indeed.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.100
 I read a really nice balloon story yesterday,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.460
 which is that in 2007, NASA had funded this project, which

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.820
 was called BLAST.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.580
 And the idea is that they were going to fly it

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.140
 above the clouds in Antarctica for 40 kilometers high.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.420
 And for 12 days, they were going to take photos

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.260
 by infrared of star formations in the sky.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.300
 So it was up there for via the balloon.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.260
 12 days is big, sad light.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.620
 And then when the 12 days was done, they were bringing it back down.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.580
 So they detached it from the balloon,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.380
 and it fell towards the Earth, and then parachutes deployed.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.180
 So they brought the parachutes, and they landed on Antarctica.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.540
 And it was all fine, except just before it landed,

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.340
 there was meant to be an electronic device that snapped away

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.780
 the parachutes, but that failed.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.980
 As a result, the parachutes were on the side,

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.260
 and a huge gust of wind came and picked up the parachutes,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:32.380
 and they parisailed away from the researchers for 24 hours.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.700
 Non-stop.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.180
 They eventually found it 2,000 kilometers away.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.180
 But they didn't find it for a year,

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.140
 because apparently NASA likes to paint everything white.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.780
 And as a result, it was just camouflaged 2,000 miles away.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.700
 That was awesome.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.300
 Wow.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.740
 And so they-- kind of like when you drop a crisp packet,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.140
 and it gets taken by the wind, and you're

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.020
 constantly going after it, do they chase it for a while?

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.980
 Were they running after this thing?

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.380
 When does that happen at your life?

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.780
 You know, when you drop a--

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.420
 You drop a bit of rubbish.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.340
 And if you've ever seen American and beauty,

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.300
 the wind sometimes takes rubbish, and you chase after it,

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.220
 and you're always trying to grab it, it always eludes your grasp.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.420
 So was it like that, where the scientist constantly

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.940
 grabbing at it, and it's just dancing away at the last moment?

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.100
 Not at all, no.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.660
 Have you--

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.820
 Oh, it's nice that I cleared that up.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.620
 Have you eaten all the crisps in this scenario?

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.820
 Are you trying to get the crisp back,

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.260
 or are you trying to get the packet back?

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.380
 I'm not a filthy littler like some people are ending.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.180
 Why?

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.300
 [APPLAUSE]

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.620
 Yeah.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.020
 Classic eco-conscious festival crowd.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.100
 Honestly, if I dropped a packet of crisps,

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.740
 I'd just open another one immediately.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.340
 I'm joking.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.580
 Just a full packet.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.060
 You've got a full, closed packet.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.260
 Sometimes I open a multi-pack, drop it.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.260
 It's gone.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.340
 Do you know the very first ever balloonists

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:05.340
 to cross the English Channel landed with no trousers on?

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.060
 This is true.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.180
 It's 100% true.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.180
 So excited.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.660
 So at what stage did the trousers go?

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.620
 Right away.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.620
 Almost a minute, no.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.220
 On entry.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.700
 No, no, no.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.100
 So I think we may have done--

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.420
 we may have mentioned this on QI.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.900
 I'm not sure, but many years ago.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.180
 So they were crossing English Channel.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.340
 It was all going great.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.460
 But then, they started to descend.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.700
 Or rapidly, there wasn't enough air in the balloon.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.860
 And they started getting really worried.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.980
 So they immediately took up their trousers.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.020
 They first threw away the anchors

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.180
 on the side of the balloon.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:36.700
 Yeah.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.340
 Basically, they could see the white cliffs of Dover.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.620
 They were going, oh, we're not quite going to get over those.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.420
 So they--

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.660
 And so now I've got rid of all the sandbags and stuff for that.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.900
 They throw away the sandbags.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:51.020
 They throw away the oars that they hope to steer with.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.220
 I don't know.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.260
 Then they throw away a propeller that they had with them.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.100
 That's for some reason.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.460
 And then, eventually, they had to throw away pretty much

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.380
 all the clothes they were wearing, including their trousers.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.060
 And they made it.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.020
 They made it across.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.820
 And they landed with no trousers on.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.860
 Did at any point, when the panic was setting in,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.100
 what'd they go, who braw all this shit?

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.620
 Oh, we didn't win the oars.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.820
 Of course, we're going to crash into a mountain you dick.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.340
 So when they landed with our trousers,

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.140
 did they all stay in the balloon,

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.900
 or do you use them to get out for the press conference?

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.900
 They said--

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.340
 It does sound like an excuse though.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.180
 It does sound like an excuse.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.940
 What are you suggesting, James?

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.300
 I'm suggesting that they took their trousers off

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.140
 for another reason.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.900
 Right.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.180
 When the press turned up, they said, why have you done that?

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.220
 And they said, well, we took our trousers off

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.060
 because of the thing.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.340
 And they said, well, did you throw anything else?

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:50.260
 And they're like, yeah, we threw out all the oars that we had here.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.220
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.980
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:01.220
 My factor is that Volkswagen sells more sausages than cars.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.060
 This is 100% true.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.900
 It's unbelievable.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.620
 It's unbelievable.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.380
 I can't believe I'd never had this before.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.460
 This was sent in, by the way, by my covenants

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.580
 and Mike, if you're listening.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.580
 Thank you so much for sending us in.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:17.500
 In 2015, Volkswagen sold 5.8 million cars, pretty good.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.140
 But there's all 7.2 million sausages.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.260
 But sausages are a lot cheaper.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.580
 Yeah, it's easier to make a sausage than a car.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.500
 That is true.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.380
 So they don't make less money on the sausages.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.380
 That's what I'm saying.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.740
 Yeah, but they'll have been fine less

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.100
 for cheating on the emissions.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.820
 What the sausages do.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.540
 They also make ketchup as well, don't they?

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.940
 They make their own ketchup, and they get sold in supermarkets

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.780
 by a pack of Volkswagen's.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.740
 If I read this, apparently, they have their own code.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.700
 They are listed these sausages as an official Volkswagen

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.380
 component, which is 1-9308-500-A.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.420
 And car dealers will often give you a five pack of sausages

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.980
 if you buy a Volkswagen.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.860
 Does that tip some people over the edge

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.780
 into making that position?

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.620
 I think so.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.140
 They do.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.820
 But very tasty.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.580
 It's not that surprising that they sell more sausages than cars,

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.860
 and if for every car you're giving away five sausages--

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:10.620
 That's true.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.460
 So they invented them to feed their workers, didn't they?

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.300
 In the 1970s, they came up with this new kind of sausage

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.340
 that they give their workers.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.620
 And then suddenly, the workers said,

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.620
 this is really good sausage, guys.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.340
 You should sell it.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.300
 And they started selling it.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300
 Right.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.260
 And they still give it to the workers though every day.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.540
 So they have it at about nine in the morning.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.820
 It's curry sausage as well.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.580
 So it's quite an acquired taste for breakfast.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.860
 So curry sausage, big and Germany, basically.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.380
 Yeah.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.300
 Do you know that Berlin has an entire museum

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.940
 devoted to curry sausage?

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.300
 Does it?

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.460
 It has a curry sausage museum.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.460
 And I read some of the reviews of it.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.860
 I just wanted to share a review or two with you.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.100
 One of the reviews on you.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.220
 11 euros seems a steep price to pay for a small exhibit

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.340
 on the history and glory of curry vest.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.660
 Still gave it four stars.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.540
 It's a lot of fun.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.020
 Then he added, would I go back?

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:02.540
 No.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:08.020
 But then he said, in fairness, he said,

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.820
 because it's an exhibit that I doubt changes its content.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.420
 Why would it?

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.540
 So it's a roller coaster.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.300
 Curry first was brought to Germany

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.420
 by the British, really, wasn't it?

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.580
 Well, so it's sort of in the, you know,

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.900
 we just try to claim everything.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.740
 But so it was just after World War II.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.580
 And so some of the allied soldiers there

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.780
 introduced curry powder and ketchup,

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.220
 because we had a lot of curry powder.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.460
 We were into curry, a lot of trade with India.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.220
 And then a German woman said, oh, that tastes

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.420
 to be nice with a sausage.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.860
 And so she created curry vest.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.460
 And in the museum, I believe they say,

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.900
 without the good old British, we wouldn't have

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.780
 our staple dish today.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.780
 Oh.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.380
 James, is inventing the curry sausage?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.620
 No, it's not an invention.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:00.180
 It's just putting curry and sausage together.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.860
 Is it better than the wind-up radio, as an invention,

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.780
 would you say?

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.460
 Well, I haven't been to the museum.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.140
 You should go.

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.180
 It sounds amazing.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:09.860
 What's ours?

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.740
 They've got a spice chamber with sniffing stations.

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:18.660
 They've got audio stations playing curry-worst theme songs,

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.580
 a virtual curry-versed-making game called Curry Up

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.300
 and a sausage-shaped sofa.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:30.980
 So I went onto website lovepark.co.uk.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.300
 And I was disappointed to find it.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.860
 For starters, won't we be going back?

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.180
 No, it's not what you would, I think.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.660
 It's a non-departmental public body

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.900
 about the park industry.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.420
 But they have some fun facts about sausages.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.740
 So for instance, there are more than 500 recipes

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.700
 for sausage in Britain.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.580
 But you could have a different British sausage every day

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.820
 for 10 years.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.420
 Wait.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.900
 You wouldn't live that long in it.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.580
 No, 5,000, don't you mean?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.700
 That's a number of recipes.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.900
 But that was two facts mushed together.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.460
 Are you invented a new fan?

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:19.860
 And did you know that in 320 AD, eating sausages was a sin.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.380
 And it was made a sin by the Catholic Church

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.060
 because it was associated with pagan festivals.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.500
 Wow.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.860
 And you just know why they were eating sausages at those.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.940
 No, I mean, that is--

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.420
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.900
 Oh, I was imagine a huge phallic ritual kind of--

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.140
 No, no, I think--

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.260
 You are completely on your own.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.780
 I'm sorry.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.060
 And you're in a room of like 200 people.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.900
 I don't know if that is--

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.700
 Surely one person is here.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.660
 There was one person at the door.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.340
 Yeah.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.340
 Oh, I'm here.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.100
 I don't need your pity, guys.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.780
 I'm a bit of a big alert on this one.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.060
 And the other thing about pagans and sausages

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.340
 is I went on the internet today and Googled pagan sausages.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.460
 And I found out there's quite a--

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.460
 I was disappointed, in fact.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.340
 Well, there's quite a few people online who

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.300
 seem to think that the word Jesus when

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.860
 said backwards is sausage.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.860
 Oh, it's--

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.860
 It is, sausage.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.060
 It's sausage, sausage, sausage.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.260
 So maybe that's the reason that it's an evil pagan thing.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.660
 Cessage.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:30.260
 That's a huge-- that's like a Da Vinci code moment, isn't it?

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.740
 Jesus was a sausage.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.220
 Can I tell you a little story from the BBC News website?

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:41.180
 All right, it's news from Northern Ireland from last week.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.580
 Court reporters were a little taken

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.540
 back when a self-confessed sausage thief

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.180
 tried to get on first name terms with a judge at Belfast

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.580
 magistrate's court.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.340
 Belfast man, Mike and McNally, who has almost 300

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.820
 previous convictions, was jailed after emitting a new spade

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.380
 of shoplifting, including the theft

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.180
 of 10 packs of sausages.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.740
 His defense lawyer told the district judge Fiona Bagnell

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.780
 that McNally had managed to stay out of jail for six weeks,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.260
 which he says is a record for him.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.780
 As he was led to the cells McNally

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.780
 called out to the judge, that's OK.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.820
 See you later, Fiona.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:21.740
 Obviously crime is wrong, but on another level, what a guy.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.580
 That was how many packs of sausages?

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.580
 He stole 10 packs of sausages.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.900
 Because you couldn't possibly get through those before they

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.860
 went off, could you?

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.060
 You could freeze them.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.860
 Freeze them.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.060
 I'm more of a hand-to-mouth.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.100
 I never lose the freezer.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.660
 OK, that makes more sense.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:44.500
 That's why you have such a crisp-based diet, isn't it?

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.260
 Do you know how long the longest sausage was?

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.100
 No.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.100
 It was--

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.740
 Guys, it was 63 kilometers long.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.300
 It's sausage, Christ.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:07.620
 That was a huge sausage, that's massive.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.620
 Was it like a mistake in the factory

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.020
 where they meant to put the twist in between each one?

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.180
 That guy was off sick that day.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.780
 No, the longer it was a deliberate thing,

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.820
 it was to celebrate Romania day in Romania.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.900
 And it was, yeah, 63 miles long.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.060
 It was actually a bit disappointing.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.300
 They never spread it out all the way, I don't think.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.060
 So it was all curled around.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.900
 But maybe they just didn't have a space long enough.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.580
 Yeah.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.580
 How far would you get outside?

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.420
 60 kilometers from here?

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:35.900
 Yeah.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.540
 Isn't that space?

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.380
 Yes.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.060
 No, it would be.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.100
 Yeah, if you stood the sausage up, you would get a space.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.820
 You might hit the International Space Station,

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:44.500
 is that right?

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.340
 Yes, it is.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.340
 So that could be how they get there in future.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.900
 It's climbing the giant sausage, isn't it?

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.260
 But have more as interfaiths.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.580
 Do you give all the more climb the giant sausage, James?

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.380
 OK, there was a story-- right, you're Australian, don't you?

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.380
 Yeah.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.940
 So there was a story about the--

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.660
 So in Australia, when you vote, you get given a democracy

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.180
 sausage.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.260
 This is what they call it.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:10.780
 But!

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.260
 So if you turn up to vote, they have a load--

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.580
 genuinely, they have barbecues at every pollination

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.340
 in Australia.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.260
 But during the last election, there

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.740
 was a massive faux pas by both leaders.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.020
 This was in 2016.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.940
 So Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister,

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.660
 skipped the democracy sausage photo opportunity,

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.180
 presumably because he thought it might look silly or something.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:29.980
 But get this.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.540
 I cannot get my head around this.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.180
 Opposition leader Bill Shorten committed a faux pas

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.780
 when he tried to eat his sausage and bun combination

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:42.140
 from the side, rather than from the end.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.980
 Wow.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.220
 That's brilliant.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:47.140
 What a monster!

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.220
 How would you even eat?

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.780
 It's an exciting decision.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.420
 I'm calling it.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.180
 This is an invention.

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.380
 Hey, we're going to have to wrap up very shortly.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.060
 Yeah, so if you guys have anything before we go.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.860
 I have one last thing, which is that during the election campaign

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.900
 in America, the presidential campaign,

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.980
 a hot dog stand in Chicago sold a hot dog

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.140
 that they called the Trump Footlong, which

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.140
 was actually a three-inch long hot dog.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.140
 OK.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.100
 That is it.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.580
 That is all of our facts.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.100
 Thank you so much, everyone here for--

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.380
 [CHEERING]

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.940
 --if you would like to get in contact with any of us

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.380
 about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.380
 we can be found on our Twitter account.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:46.300
 I'm on Ant Shriverland, James.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.060
 At XHAT.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.860
 Anna, you can email podcast.qi.com.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:54.380
 Andy, that's sausage Jesus.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.940
 Yeah, or you can go to our group account, which is at QI podcast.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.180
 Guys, in the room, we're going to be going on tour

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.980
 around the UK in October and November.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.500
 If you're free, be awesome to see you there.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.180
 Our website, nosuchthingasoffish.com, has the link.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.660
 But most importantly, we've been going crazy,

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.620
 writing what we hope is the best book that

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.820
 will ever be written in the world called The Book of the Year.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.380
 So we've given it a very ambitious title.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.980
 And it's out this November.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.180
 And it is a book that contains what

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.860
 we think are the most interesting things

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.620
 have happened over the last 12 months.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.100
 There's a lot of sausage material in there.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.660
 There is so much sausage.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.500
 But that's it, guys.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.220
 Thank you so much.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:28.740
 We thank you.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.740
 And I'll see you again.
