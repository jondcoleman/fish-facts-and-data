WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.120
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's bonus compilation episode made exclusively for you the clubfish members

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.840
 This is Dan here. I'm I'm standing a bit rusty today

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.200
 And that's because we had quite late night last night because we just started our run of live shows at the Soho theater

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.920
 We're doing 11 in total last night was amazing so much fun

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.420
 We had Jamie Morton from my dad wrote a porno on stage with us and it's gonna be a new guest every single show

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.240
 We've got two shows tonight and it's a sold-out run at the moment

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.220
 But we have learned that they often keep tickets back just for on the day release

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.700
 So if you happen to be in central London on one of the days that we're doing our shows

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.260
 Why not just check out the Soho theater website because there might be a few tickets available and you can come along

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.200
 And I really recommend that you do it's just such a fun show the guests that we have coming up are amazing and

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.440
 They are all gonna be recorded though. So don't worry. We will be putting them out

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.900
 But if you do want to get a sort of slight live experience and you're not in London

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.580
 We are doing one show in September at Kings Place at the London podcast festival

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.100
 And it's gonna be live streamed so you can get tickets anywhere from your lounge room at any bit of the planet that you're sitting in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 and watch it there and not only do that but go on to the fish cord and go on to the live episode chat and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.940
 Discuss everything that's being said with all the other fish cord members as it's going along

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.680
 It's really fun when when that's being done. So check those out and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.160
 Get ready now for quite a star studded compilation

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.960
 This is the first one where we've started using outtakes of all the guests that have been on since Anna has been away

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 And so as a result of that you're gonna get an absolute multi-pack of comedy stardom with the voices of Sally Phillips

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 There's Lucy Porter Rachel Paris Athena Cablenu Philippa Perry so many in there and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.080
 It's a really fun episode. These are the bits that just didn't quite fit into the main show

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 But are still very very funny and very interesting. So hope you enjoy it and here we go on with the compilation

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.200
 Coleman's you know who loves Coleman's my Jella Lawson. She loves it so much that everywhere she goes

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 She carries a little jar of it in her handbag. There's two two condiments that she carries in her handbag at all times

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 We get the other one. Yeah, it's nothing. It's nothing. What's the sauce Tabasco? No

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.660
 It's a mold and salt so she's always got salt and she's always got some salt. Yeah

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.380
 Yeah, and I'm not saying this of Nadella Lawson

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.420
 But if I did want to carry cocaine with me in my handbag, I would tell people it was mold and salt and go look

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.420
 Here's my mustard

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.540
 Seasoning food. Yeah, the salt must have must have had some sort of accident because it's all become incredibly finely ground

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.900
 Shame I'll have to throw it away

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920
 I'll start it

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.640
 Okay, I'll tell you want just one last thing to do with mustard. It's a mustard

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.300
 I really want to try and it's a novelty mustard, but screw it. I still want to try it

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.480
 There's a American football star called Tex a place for Texas longhorns called Bijan Robinson

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.360
 And Bijan Robinson has his own mustard which is called Bijan Mustardson and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.660
 And you can buy it. It's slogans. It's like a touchdown in your mouth or

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.440
 And

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.600
 It'll break your mouth's ankles great great slogan

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.120
 Yeah, and so it's available Bijan mustardson.com you can go there and

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.780
 Yeah, they're gonna do break your mouth. I know I know it's wonderful

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.780
 Yeah, but it's available now, so I'm gonna be getting some

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.520
 If you don't enjoy the flavor, we'll give you a quarter back. That's brilliant. Yeah, but then they might have to give you a quarter

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.940
 I

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.420
 Was reading about how many questions children ask. Oh, yeah

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.700
 This was a survey done by an online retailer

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.760
 So it was like, you know, it's not scientific

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.980
 But they asked over a thousand mothers how many questions they got or maybe to like press a button every time they got asked a question

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.780
 How many questions per day? Do you think British mothers were asked is it what age?

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.940
 These two to three or two four year olds. No, it was a bit older. It was four to five year olds

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.600
 Okay, so that's my boy at the moment so 60. Sorry, Dan. You're more informed. No, no, no, so 60 from you

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.320
 I'm gonna say yeah a hundred plus so like a hundred to a hundred and fifty is my if I can do a range

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.440
 Well, they reported 300 questions per day, which was on average more questions per hour than PM Q's

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:06.600
 What is the what is an average question? Yeah, because probably the average one if you're talking like that, you know

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.140
 What happens most often it's just why why why?

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:18.620
 Can I have some more? Yeah, why two questions the questions are very rarely. Can you help me with my shoelaces?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.620
 Wouldn't it be a better thing

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.580
 The Prime Minister tell me about the immigration

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.580
 I refuse to answer that question why

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.400
 My daughter's favorite artist is your yoy kusama, but she is only one like it's all the dots like kids love dots

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.760
 Oh, yeah fantastic. She's probably like Bridget Riley as well. Oh, really? Okay. I'll look into that

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.400
 We've got I've got five-year-old wolf and he's really into drawing at the moment

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.560
 So it does these drawings every day and shows them to us and we're like this is amazing

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.160
 We bring them up put them on the fridge and stuff

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.320
 But in our room we have a painting which is framed a print which is by at the time of five-year-old girl called

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.780
 Iris Grace who had autism and aspergers and they are stunning

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.400
 They are like they look like someone in their forties and will fast to come to bed every night and just look at Iris Grace the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.960
 Not thinking you know

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.600
 I'm interested in the learning part of it like

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.720
 How children learn and what you can do to kind of help them to learn quicker Michelle de montaigne. Why are you in such a hurry?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.420
 With what together to learn? Yeah. Well, that was retire. I

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.400
 Was thinking if she's like her chest prodigy by the time she's 12 then I can kind of retire when I'm

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:48.160
 60 they feel six do they feel stadiums chest prodigies then Magnus does Magnus Carlson, but the rest don't yeah

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.920
 It's a nice level of fame. I think to be a chess prodigy if you were the first female world chess champion

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.360
 I think that would that would be enough for me to retire. Okay. Yeah, but

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.440
 She wants to share the spoils with you. She might have better ideas

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.520
 No, you'll have legal control over it till James already made a signed a contract

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:16.200
 Well Michelle de montaigne the the famous slayer

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.480
 So his father wanted him to be really smart and so

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.360
 He when he was a baby

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.000
 He was brought to a small cottage where he lived for three years of his life with a peasant family

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.080
 First of all, but that was quite normal to outsource

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.080
 Babies when they were very young and yeah with peasants because we know how tough it is bringing up a baby

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.400
 Well, yeah, so you want someone else to do it? Yeah, well, that doesn't make sense

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.160
 But his father's idea was that it would teach him, you know

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.760
 How how people live because he came from a rich family and he wants to see how everyone lived

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.000
 And then at three years, he was taken home to his chateau

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.840
 But he was only allowed to hear or speak Latin

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.680
 So no one speak French twin

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.560
 He had a German tutor who didn't speak French and the German tutor was only allowed to speak Latin to him the whole time

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.200
 And so he only spoke Latin until he was a teenager and Latin was his native language

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.840
 Even like when he was much older. He kind of thought in Latin right like that

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.720
 And I wonder how much of like

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.120
 Early the early days, you know, how much you can teach children that young and when you say

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.240
 Montagne, yeah, all I can think of is kidney stones

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.500
 He had the most appalling kidney stones and he suffered terribly with them

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:42.900
 Do you think that affected his writing it's sort of like his temperament gave it some urgency

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.880
 The reason I ask actually is because I read this article about saying that when you will put kids TV on and you got your kid

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.780
 Watching the TV. Yeah, if you put the subtitles on it will help them to read quicker. Oh, okay

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.600
 Well, that is how all why all Scandinavians

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.480
 Are really good at English. I think because they have Scandinavian subtitles on English speaking cartoons

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.640
 James have you been trying to find

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.640
 To

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.880
 Flashcards came about because they used to be an advert on television

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.840
 So so means happy motoring

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.600
 So means happy motoring and the words the word so just flashed on the screen

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.800
 And then kids would point at special stations, you know

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.680
 eight months old

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:47.420
 And they thought flashcards I'm gonna teach our kids to read I did flashcards with my child and she enjoyed the attention

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.720
 What else can I say?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.360
 I don't know if it helped her read or not. We didn't do exams

00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.300
 Did you guys have a much more friends as children? I did not know I did. Yeah, yeah, what was it called?

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.760
 Benny

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.200
 There's imaginary dinosaur. It's pretty cool. It was a dinosaur skeleton. Yeah

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.640
 I thought you might have chased him around dressed as a nurse

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:16.220
 In my dressing gown, did he talk to you? I don't want to talk about it

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.400
 Yeah, I don't know why

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.100
 You guys

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:29.040
 So tell me did you have any terrible

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.040
 Experiences

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:43.840
 As long as the voices are talking to you and not about you

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:52.400
 That's the better way, yeah, well, of course a lot of great writers like did all the brontes had imaginary friends didn't they?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.780
 His burning was inspired by Savanna Roller's bonfire of the vanities

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:05.420
 We reckon so don't know what that is. So he was Italian. He was very much against

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.380
 People, you know doing what they want sins. He was against drinking

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.600
 He was against any kind of frivolity and stuff like that

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:20.040
 And he decided to do a big bonfire in the middle of Italy where he would take everything that was that he didn't like and burn it

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:26.800
 All everything that was fun. Everything was fun. Yeah, he put an end to all the carnivals in Italy in Florence, especially he got like

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.760
 Street urchins as we would call them then possibly not now

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.200
 And they would go around sort of listening in for anyone having fun and they would report back to him

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.360
 And he would tell so who's this guy again Savanna Roller. I think you can still say urchins just to say

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.360
 I don't think there's a movement to reclaim the word

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.800
 Urchins do you so do you just like if you see kids in the street you call them urchins?

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.800
 Do you?

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.000
 I know what's good for me. If they're trying to unlock your bicycle

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:03.560
 But eventually Savanna Roller he was he was executed. I know yeah when public opinion turned against him. Now why?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.600
 And he was burned and at the stake and as he was burned his

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.480
 Something happened like maybe the updraft caused his right hand to lift and his his fans who were called the weepers

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.280
 They thought that he was blessing them on from the pyre. Oh, but it might have just been an updraft

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:28.280
 I think it was an updraft now. Call me an old cynic, but so he was burning everything himself. Yeah

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:36.740
 Yeah, I bet he wished he'd not burned things. No, he put them on a bouncy castle or something

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:45.760
 It's much better for sleeping apparently a cool room. Yeah. Yeah, if you really want because that's why if you stay in a hotel and it's

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.320
 Oh

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.480
 Yeah, we can't turn it off

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.080
 But yeah, my mum and dad their entire marriage was a constant battle of she would like to be cold and he liked to be

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.440
 Yeah, it's like that in our house, but

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.040
 My wife just has a load of blankets on her and I just sleep outside of the

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.320
 It was a mutual decision

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.320
 The garden shed

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.840
 Yeah

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.760
 3000 different types of edible fruit in the Amazon

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.820
 Forrest as opposed to the river this

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:30.320
 This is in the rainforest, yeah

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.680
 You like some breakfast buffet, I certainly do some damage to that that fruits

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.760
 Sorry, I couldn't name more than I'd say 15 fruits. No, you're telling me there are 3000 in the Amazon

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.320
 Yeah, we don't eat all of them, but they are edible

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.560
 I think even the locals only a few hundred of them, right?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.400
 And we probably not that many of them. In fact, you wouldn't have heard of many of them. Although like no, I've heard of 30

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.360
 Have you heard of guarana, you know, yeah

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.520
 I've heard of geek I've heard of the country

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.600
 Well, that's near the Amazon, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I've heard

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:21.440
 Something they put in like energy drinks. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and that's you get that from the Amazon and there's that cartoon

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.440
 Corona's in pajamas, isn't there? Yeah

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.880
 It's when you look at the fruit, it looks like an eyeball

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.720
 So it's like it's like a red fruit

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.880
 But then as it ripens this white stuff sort of

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.800
 Comes out and then there's a little black dot. So it looks exactly like an eyeball

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.400
 And it's eaten by

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:51.040
 In the Maoist region of the Amazon rainforest and the percentage of elderly people in Maoist is absolutely off the charts

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.720
 Very high

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.160
 It's a very poisonous fruit

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:04.280
 When we say edible, we mean if you don't mind dying. Yeah in Brazil they often like the TV crews will go there every now and then and

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.920
 Find all these 90 year olds who are working in the

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:13.160
 Because isn't the goji berry that's another that's another one. Yeah, it's probably sort of derived from there

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.720
 Are these all fruits that are consistently sort of on the market or like I imagine a lot of fruits

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.280
 Are found to be edible there via someone who got lost is a bit desperate had to eat something and go wow

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.640
 Yeah, it's a new thing, but but it's not been harvested into a so the three thousand is

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.000
 An estimate but pretty good estimate by botanists

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.720
 And then the ones that are actually eaten is probably about 500 the ones I regularly eat and maybe about one or two hundred

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.720
 And the ones that I've these heard of 15

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:51.480
 Can I just take you back and the world record holder for Loch Ness Monster hunting

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.800
 Is it longest without having found a Loch Ness monster most seen yet?

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:03.880
 No, he's he's been sitting looking for it for 32 years in one specific spot of what now so it's the longest continuous vigil

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.880
 He almost lost his record by the very fact that he was in a room in London telling them about the record that he had

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.160
 I met him last night. Yeah, I did say to him. What if the lock this was to turns up while you're here

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:22.280
 Is there a Guinness World Record for most depressing Guinness World Record? I think it's incontent. He's awesome

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.740
 His life is incredible. He lives a beautiful hermit life by this most beautiful spot. It's really lovely

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:34.040
 But he said he saw it possibly once in the first year, but it's been quite quiet ever since

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:41.200
 He must have thought it's just gonna be citing after citing for now on Steve. He's such a lovely guy

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.680
 Yeah, another famous pajama wearer is Griffith Pugh

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.440
 And who was he wore pajamas to go up Mount Everest?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.480
 And so this is the first Everest expedition. So it's

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.720
 Hillary and nor gay, right?

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.360
 But there was a team and those two made it to the very top

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.000
 But they had people who went up like various stages of Mount Everest and one of them was Griffith Pugh

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.200
 And he was part of the research team

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.640
 He invented the oxygen equipment that they used and he designed the diet and all kind of stuff

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.760
 But he always wore pajamas when he was climbing

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.240
 And everyone took the piss out of him like everyone thought what an idiot the first time he did it

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.280
 He walks down in the in the lower slopes of Everest

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.280
 He was wearing sky blue pajamas

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.440
 Everyone else was in the hiking shorts and stuff and he's like no, this is right. This is right

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.440
 He always had an umbrella as well

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.520
 And what happened was everyone else got really sunburned

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.280
 But he had these very lightweight trousers that would cover his whole legs and stuff

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.560
 And they'd cover his arms the top of the pyjamas and he was the only one who didn't get sunburned

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.440
 Well, tragically he died of hypothermia

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.600
 I love the fact that it's almost like, you know, like when people run the London Marathon in pyjamas or whatever

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.040
 It's like the you know, Hillary and nor gay right there just

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.600
 Doing it seriously and it's like here he comes with this kind of novelty

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.240
 He's dressed as a rhino

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.240
 Do we know Ian McMillan? Oh, yeah, he does the verb

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.200
 Show on okay. He's a poet, right? Yeah, he's a brilliant poet and a lovely man and he

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.640
 On his desert island discs chose John Cage's

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.720
 Four minutes 33 seconds the one that's just silence. Yes, and obviously they they played it

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.160
 Yeah, and the sort of ambient noise that could be heard included his stomach rumbling

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.680
 And him trying not to laugh at the fact that everyone could hear his dance

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.320
 I would have thought like the bbc emergency thing would kick in, you know, when there's nothing

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:50.240
 Um, I think he'll regret that when he's on the island

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:56.800
 I think he's saying he doesn't like music largely. Oh, no, it's an artistic piece

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.960
 Yeah, and I think the point of it's 33 seconds is that it is the ambient sounds that you're meant to be listening to

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.240
 You can't have complete silence. Not the point. The point is not that it's completely silent

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.040
 So you connect with nature. No, it's not about nature. Well, what you connect with you connect with the environment

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.080
 The environment around you. Yeah, you hear the musicians not playing. Yeah

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.400
 I would argue that any time the song you bring to the desert island is not playing

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.120
 You're listening to four minutes 33. Yeah

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:28.880
 That's true. Well, yeah, I would say of all the times in your life to not need that piece is probably marooned on a desert island

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.520
 Because you've got a lot of time to listen to those ambient sounds. You want to go for really long songs like champagne supernova by oasis

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.320
 That's a great one. Is that long? Oh, it's very long. It's like seven minutes. Was that one by the Beatles that's really long?

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.320
 Hey, Jude? Yeah, yeah

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.840
 Is it because of all the, hey, nanananas?

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.200
 Dan baited some classical musicians a few weeks ago on this podcast. So I feel like he's doing it again now in four minutes 33

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.840
 You're not happy with them when they are. I've had so many letters. You're not happy with them when they are or aren't playing their instruments now. It's terrible

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.720
 There's a story that um, roi plumley got sort of very

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.560
 Dishevelled because of a rude moment on the show he had

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.480
 So it I'm going to start this by saying this is a story that gets told a lot, but it's an urban myth

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:20.240
 Oh, okay, but supposedly Bridget Bardot was on now. We know this didn't happen because Bridget Bardot has never been on

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.440
 Um, but she was asked what her luxury item

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.160
 So we mentioned at the top you get to pick your favorite song your favorite book and a luxury item and

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.920
 She said that what she wanted was happiness

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.200
 And he said, oh, excuse me. You want what?

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:42.160
 She's an happiness and she was obviously saying happiness. Um, but he heard a penis and yeah, but that's this is so weird

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.040
 We've talked about the kendo song. I think happiness. Yeah, the Beatles happiness is a warm gun

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.680
 Happiness happiness the greatest gift that I possess

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.400
 It's like the biggest selling song of the

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.320
 60s wasn't it the kendo one one of them? Yeah. Yeah, wait the Beatles

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.120
 Happiness is a warm gun. Yeah, is that a plant a penis is a warm gun in a way

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.160
 Uh, is it? Yeah, because the second line goes all right. You're just pleased to see me

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.440
 These days being invited on tesla desks is basically in britain

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.920
 It's kind of a minor gong and also the thing about the thing about the show is these days that it's it's sort of

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.960
 uniquely psychological, isn't it and some of the presenters like sue lawley and kirstie young in particular

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.480
 Were famed for getting under the skin of the interviewee and they'd you know, they'd pause and they'd let the interviewee

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:35.200
 Say lots of delicious juicy secrets about themselves because you're in the booth. Yeah, you're being told, you know, you're being treated

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.360
 Lovely, you're listening to your favorite music

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.440
 It's it's evocative, you know, so there's a soundtrack of your life and people give away amazing stuff about themselves

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.600
 Um, john loyde, uh, our boss at qi. He has done it and he said he said things he wouldn't

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.560
 Wouldn't have said to anyone. Well, he was did you remember you must remember the period just after he did it

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.760
 John did this show and he had a meltdown. He he was talking about fleeing the country

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.280
 He said i'm gonna ruin so much of my it for months until it came out. Well, he confessed to three murders on the show

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.680
 My first track is the death rose of my first victim

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.520
 I was reading about the first woman on desert island discs who was um actress pat kirkwood

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.200
 Who i'd never heard of she was the fifth person um to do it at all

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.560
 And she was so famous back in the day. I can't believe i've never heard of her

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.920
 Cole potter said to her once you may sing any song of mine at any time for the rest of your life

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.200
 She was such a good singer so long as you pick it for your desert

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:38.160
 She was the first woman on british tv to have her own series, uh, the pat kirkwood show in 1954

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.840
 And she did a three month sold out show in los vegas, which broke all box office records

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.160
 She was so famous and she sang during world war two in london

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.960
 At the palladium and they they would be bombing of course the blitz was going on

00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:00.000
 And she said that they're basically everyone would bet on who would be on stage when the bombs hit and everyone had to stop and leave

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.520
 And then halfway through her and her mum kind of went onto the top of the roof and watched as the

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.880
 Kind of bombs fell around them at the top of the palladium

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.600
 And she said we looked around the sea of fire. We were marooned no way out

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:19.680
 So like how have i not heard of her? Yeah, like metaphorically maroons as well. Yeah, exactly

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.440
 That's very cool. We have a very good friend mutually all of us uh called matt hyten

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.440
 Makes the most brilliant videos online in which he injects mr. Blobby into it

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.480
 So if you know the jameriquire virtual insanity

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.960
 Video music video where he's on like a travel later blobby's in there

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.400
 Cgi din or whatever greed screened in just smashing into stuff

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:48.640
 I think very recently someone wrote to him saying i had a nightmare that instead of paranormal activity of that ghost lady

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.960
 Mr. Blobby was in paranormal activity

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.920
 That's my favorite one of his videos and matt put it in and so you can see them on twitter, right?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.600
 You can see them on twitter. Yeah, follow his account because he's he's a genius with the comedy videos that he puts out

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.160
 But also i was following him recently because he made a small attempt to win on ebay the original

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:13.600
 Blobby suit that recently went up for auction and i think he's sort of like said

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.800
 Oh, we're gonna have like 600 pounds, you know if we all club in and it went for 62 000 pounds

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.960
 And this wasn't even a suit that was i think used in the actual blobby tv series

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.360
 I think it was made for his big american transfer

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.840
 Never happened

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.440
 suit unused

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:35.520
 Um and yeah, so that went for 62 000, but i went on ebay yesterday and there's another one up there another original

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.880
 And it's currently on 8 000 pounds. I think that it didn't go for 62 000 in the end. So it's gone back on then

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.640
 Yeah, well basically someone bids 62 000, but then they backed out

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:52.160
 And the seller who was a former bbc employee who wished to remain anonymous said that he wasn't surprised they backed out

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.040
 Okay, well it's back on and it's at 8 000. 8 000 still that's a lie, isn't it? I reckon. Yeah, how much you put for it?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.760
 I've got to confirm it with finella, but yeah

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.480
 We're going for a good cold 12

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.800
 I got a dm yesterday about asking for recommendations for yeti and bigfoot books from a man called willy muncher 3000

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.360
 willy muncher, those are the those are the dms i get his parents have a lot to answer for

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.000
 My gut is really lugged in willy muncher and there's already 2999 willy munchers

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.360
 Uh, have you guys heard of tendernay? No, um, tendernay is broccoli infused wine

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:37.520
 Uh, and this was made by the tender stem company. As I said, they're a registered company and in order to make tender stem broccoli more

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:44.480
 Accessible more fun. Uh, they decided to make broccoli infused wine. Uh, does that sound nice broccoli flavored wine?

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.000
 I try it. I'd definitely be keen to give it a go gin. I'd put it in a gin. Oh, yeah

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.600
 And this is japan as well as it. No, this was the uk. Oh, okay. Yeah, what are we like?

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.120
 Let's put it away

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:09.600
 Metro did a taste test on it. Yeah, one person said I think it tastes distinctly like the color green

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:17.440
 Not on varnish praise. Yeah, the features director said it, um, smells like a fart in a glass

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.320
 The executive editor said in the glass it smelled like silage

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.600
 Silage, um, it took all the wilt power

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.200
 I could remove the thought that it wasn't actually nine month old grass juice used to feed cows in winter

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:37.360
 Wow, if you get British people to be like now, I don't want that wine. I mean, you've made it really bad

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:46.160
 Why? It was I think it was British wine. So British white wine, which call me a snob. I actually don't particularly like either

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.120
 So it's already not great. Oh, there's lots of there's lots of lovely

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:56.560
 English made wine. Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure that I'm wrong about that. But I think it's disgusting. What's your back the next time you leave the

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.800
 I know I know I'm not allowed in georgia already because I said that their wine was disgusting

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.680
 What's it retail for because I think the truth is if I was in a corner shop and I had six quid on me

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:12.720
 Broccoli wine is coming home. I feel like it was it was limited edition. So I think I'll be expensive a little bit on the

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.760
 Expensive side, perhaps. Yeah, you can't buy it in the shops anymore

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.400
 Okay, that's a shame

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.400
 Wait for that song. Yeah, why not?

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.040
 That's the British wine police

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.360
 There's a cool pub which is in um in the uk if anyone wants to track it down called

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.160
 Windsor castle and it's not Windsor castle. It is just called Windsor castle

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.480
 Yeah, yeah, is it in Windsor though? No, it's not. I'm sorry. I believe it's in London. Um, there's one in Nightingale called that

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.120
 Yeah, I think it might be that so it's a very posh one and it's got a really cool little thing about it

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.040
 Which is that it has at the bar table if let's say families are coming in and they're growing older and older

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.440
 And let's say one of the kids is in his teens. They'll have a reserve date at the bar

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.880
 For the kid who's going to turn 18 for the day of his birthday. Yeah, so it's like on this day

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.560
 This seat is reserved for this kid. Um, or this now at man or woman, you know, but

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.360
 They you're allowed to sit there before that day

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.720
 No one can sit at that chair until yeah

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:21.760
 No, it's just you know, it's saying, you know on august, you know 2023

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.720
 That's going to be hard when the kid is trying to get in with a dodgy id in 2022 halfway through the year

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.720
 Yeah, they're like, we know your age exactly

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.200
 All of us know your age

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.040
 We mentioned that ages ago about the first people to walk across was it brocklin bridge or san francisco bridge or something

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:43.680
 And they just the first person to walk across got a record and then the first person to skip across and the first person to you know

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.080
 To walk across with their tongue on the ground

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.720
 I think it was just their tongue out

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.720
 That's your memory sexing up making quite a good record. So sexy

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:01.600
 I did think I went to Niagara Falls recently and went to the museum in Niagara Falls and they do

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.720
 Try to give everyone who's walked across Niagara Falls in all gone over it

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.960
 A record

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.240
 So because it's a museum. They want everything to sound a bit impressive. So they're like

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.000
 This was the first single woman over 50

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.880
 To go over the falls in a barrel of her own making

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.880
 So many qualifiers, honey with her tongue out. Yeah

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.080
 I read a completely confected controversy online the other day

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:37.760
 Oh, yeah, it was about pajamas and it was about this lady has caused controversy online by saying she doesn't

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.400
 Wash her pajamas after every use

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:47.440
 Okay, every use every use that seems wasteful as if anyone anyone is like the pillow manufacturers

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.840
 You say oh, you really should wash your pillowcase every two days

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.480
 Get lots swap your pillows. They say don't they with what because it's half of it's made up of bed bugs or something

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.360
 That's what they say, isn't it? Well, I need something to support my neck. You know, I've bought a chimsy the cheap flimsy pillow

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.560
 It's not going to the feathers in that alone. I'm not going to support me. I need the bed bugs. That's amazing

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.120
 I know, but I just I just I thought what what the average amount of time people wash their pajamas is

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.240
 I mean, I think weekly

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.040
 You're not going outside clean free catheter

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.360
 weekly

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:27.920
 I'm going on record as I think weekly because we do are we do a sleep wash every Sunday

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.400
 So anything's they're sleeping beds pillowcases sheets pajamas this wash, okay?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.000
 And I stand by that and he takes his pajamas off and stands up

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.120
 And they run away

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.120
 He's gonna come back here

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.080
 I'll suit it with my dressing going on you will behave

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.880
 I've got one more medical error

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.880
 As this initial fact was about Doncaster sending out a wrong text, you know, just a process like a theme is so yeah

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.120
 So this was in 2021 during

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.400
 peak covid times and it's when the vaccines had just come in

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.880
 So only a certain number of people were eligible for them, right?

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.800
 You know, it was the very oldest people first and then slightly younger. You remember. Yeah, everyone

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.560
 So there was a man from Liverpool a young man called Liam Thorpe

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.920
 Who was told he got a message saying he qualified for a covid jab and he couldn't believe it because he was he was young

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.680
 fit healthy, you know, and he when he inquired further he found out it was due to his bmi that he

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:30.240
 So like it because um, if you were heavier, you were more at risk some people who were obese got it earlier

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.840
 Exactly. If you had a very high bmi due to uh, obesity, you exactly like James. You get that jab earlier

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.600
 But he was he wasn't overweight, you know, he was he was six foot two

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.760
 What it turned out. It happened was he had not been listed as six foot two. He'd been listed

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.640
 As being six point two centimetres tall

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:52.880
 Which for his weight came from a bmi of 28,000

00:31:52.880 --> 00:32:03.920
 And they call him up about his covid jab, you know, like this is the problem

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:12.640
 They must have been waiting for him in the queue

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.640
 So

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.440
 The guy he's gonna be six point two centimetres

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:28.560
 All right, there you have it

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:35.360
 Those are our outtakes if you want to send in anything to us about the things that we said over the course of that compilation

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.800
