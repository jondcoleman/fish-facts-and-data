00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.120
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish or weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.920
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.800
 My name is Dan Shriver and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.480
 James Harkin.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.360
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.360
 Starting with you, Andy."

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.680
 "My fact is that to be a tennis umpire, you have to learn a 230 page book.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.760
 This is a rule book specifically, that's tennis, it's not novel."

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.560
 "And this is specifically the U.S. tennis association, so over in Britain we've got

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.360
 the Lawn Tennis Association which is a slightly different thing."

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.000
 "It's the more off-you-er rules you think for the lawn one."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.640
 "I don't know, I haven't been able to."

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 "It's going to be similar isn't it?"

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 "Probably a similar leg."

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.600
 "Yeah, but I have been reading the rules of Wimbledon, and so is Wimbledon this same

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 guide book?"

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 "Wimbledon is lawn tennis."

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 "Oh yes, of course."

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.320
 "Change Tours is almost immediate."

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.120
 "I think the rules are generally going to be the same, aren't they?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.880
 It's not like in Wimbledon you're allowed to kick the ball over."

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.680
 "In American tennis you have to hit it outside the light."

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.640
 "When they have to learn it, do they get tested on it, do they have to memorize the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 whole thing?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.560
 Keep it as a reference kind of in their pocket."

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.440
 "Well, I used to be a football referee, I was qualified as a football referee and you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.960
 have to do an exam.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.040
 So you really only have to learn what comes up on the exam, really."

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.640
 "It's kind of like a driving test, you have to learn a 500-page book on the rules of

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.120
 driving, but actually you can't recite that from start to finish, can you?"

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.120
 "Can't you?"

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 "Can't you?"

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.720
 "Go on, that's why you're constantly crashing your car over the place."

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.920
 "For a tie, who I'm constantly referring to a 500-page book."

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.440
 "Go on, give us some rules."

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.200
 "All right, so I think it's quite well known that at Wimbledon you can get fine for swearing."

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 "Yes, and you?"

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.240
 "Yeah, I didn't find $20,000 if you swear."

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.720
 "Does it depend on the word?"

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720
 "No."

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.240
 "Oh, so you might as well use the strongest one."

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240
 "You may as well, yeah."

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240
 "But if you go-"

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240
 "That's if you're a player, right?"

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240
 "If you're a player."

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.800
 "I'm just walking around the grounds, "Oh, fuck, it's overcharged me for my beer, and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
 they take you away."

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 "20,000."

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 "Thank you."

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.440
 "That could have bought you one planet of strawberries."

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.960
 "No, if you go out in the first round, though, that is nearly half your winnings you would

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.760
 have spent on swearing once."

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.800
 "Oh, wow, wow."

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.080
 "And the umpires and the staff, they have to learn swear words in other languages in

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.000
 case a Latvian tennis player swears in Latvian."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.720
 "Oh, that makes so much sense."

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.480
 "It's interesting about the people being paid if you lose in the first round because

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.960
 that was in the news last week because people were losing in the first round injured and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.800
 they knew they were injured going into it, but they've turned up and played anyway and then

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.320
 just given up halfway through to get the money.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.560
 And the thing is, they've worked together, you know what, I mean, over the whole year they've

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.160
 got their rankings high enough that they get to where they are, so they kind of is fair

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160
 enough, I think.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160
 "I think it's totally fair enough."

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.520
 "I've been like one of us turning up with no facts.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520
 That's me every week."

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.840
 "Right, yeah, but everywhere we find you, 20,000 pounds."

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.720
 "But Dan, over the last three years, has done enough to earn his place and done enough

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.440
 to just turn up with no facts."

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440
 "Yeah, yeah."

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.280
 "I'll tell you what's bad though, is the fact that tickets to Wimbledon cost a fortune to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.600
 get center court as well.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.400
 You're paying huge amounts of money well in advance.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.720
 So on this particular day we're talking about, in this current Wimbledon competition, Federer

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720
 was playing.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 So you're thinking, I get to see Federer center court of Wimbledon.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.680
 This guy pulls out 25 minutes since of the match or so.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.080
 Next match, Djokovic comes on.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080
 Same thing happens.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080
 Guy pulls out.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.320
 "You've got center court tickets for two of the great tennis players of our time."

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.640
 "You do expect that in the first round.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.360
 Don't get center court tickets in the first round."

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360
 "Oh, what?"

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360
 "Yeah."

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.360
 "I literally get some for the final and semi."

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360
 "That's me."

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.360
 "The box."

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360
 "I don't know.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 Obviously, it's ridiculous, but there just should be rules.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.920
 It's stupid to imagine that an individual should make that decision.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.120
 There just needs to be health check."

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.480
 "So in normal tennis, that's not the Grand Slam.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.480
 They do have the rules.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.360
 So if you're injured, but you've already qualified, you get your money.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.760
 And then a substitute comes in and they play and they only get money if they win.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.440
 So if they lose, they don't get anything, but if they go through to the second round,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440
 they do get money.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.440
 "Oh, but they don't play under your name.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440
 You've been there."

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.480
 "They have to put on a mustache if you've got a mustache."

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.320
 "Learn these swear words in my language."

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.320
 "But I think it might have been the other Andy Murray's idea to do that and they brought

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.080
 it in this year as a trial, and it seems to be working quite well."

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080
 "That's cool."

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 "Okay."

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 "Like that, the other Andy Murray.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080
 Yeah.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.400
 "Someone who's been the other Andy Murray until now, literally now, when you just said

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 that.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.920
 But just on the swearing thing quickly, there is another rule which is about visible obscenity,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.000
 which I had never read before, and so it's this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.200
 For the purposes of this rule, visible obscenity, stop doing that, James, with your hands, is

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.720
 visible obscenity, is defined as the making of signs by a player with his hands and/or racket

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.640
 or balls that commonly happen obscenity.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.880
 And does it define what they mean by balls in that situation?"

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.080
 "There's even a rule on abuse of balls, abuse of balls.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 Yeah.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.400
 Players shall not violently, dangerously, or with anger, hit, kick, or throw, a tennis ball."

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400
 Because that happened.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.600
 Was that Tim Henman did that once?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.240
 Yes, he's the first player ever to be kicked out of Wimbledon for...

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.240
 Was he?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.240
 Yeah.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240
 What?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240
 Yeah, because you...

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.560
 So another thing that swearing does for you is if you don't get a fine, you get a penalty

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.000
 point, and you can be penalized out of a match.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.080
 So there's a famous example of a guy called Bryden Klein.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.760
 He was facing a guy called Sam Groth, and during the match he served, and this was in the

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.040
 final game, but he was losing, served it into the net, and just yelled out, "Stupid, stupid

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.880
 person, talking about himself," he claimed.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.920
 But the umpire said, "I don't know who you directed that at, but that's rude.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.200
 You've been given a penalty point, and because he got one earlier in the match, the match

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200
 was over.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
 They didn't even get to finish the match."

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 "Stupid, stupid person."

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200
 "Stupid, stupid person."

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.880
 It's very rude and Latvian.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.400
 The funniest bit about it, though, is that he looked to the other player to say, "Hey, come

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400
 on.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 Like, bail me out here."

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 Like, that was me.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.320
 The guy said, "I'd like to help you, but it's too tough to call from here," and he pointed

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.120
 to the line's woman, and so the guy, who said, "Stupid, stupid person," said, "She's

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.080
 a 60-year-old lady wearing Leica, and then he stopped himself," because he's like, "Ooh,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.000
 I'm about to get another penalty point."

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.760
 I read some of the rules.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.960
 This is for normal tennis, which is not Wimbledon.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.040
 One of them is quite good.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.520
 The event organizer has to announce how many balls they'll have before the event in play

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 at any time.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.160
 The number of balls to play is either two, three, four, or six.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.160
 "Ooh."

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.400
 "I want to know what happened with five.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400
 Why not five?"

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400
 "Oh, yeah.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400
 Why not five?"

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400
 "I think we understand that, though."

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.400
 "It's to do with how many you're in a can.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.740
 You wouldn't open a new can for just one ball, I guess, but you wouldn't have seven

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.740
 either.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.200
 It feels a bit wrong about it."

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.740
 So you're allowed two or three, but no other prime numbers, is that what you're saying?

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.740
 "Yes, exactly."

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.740
 "Yes, exactly."

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:21.100
 "I think it might be dance explanation, because you do get cans in three or four portions,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.340
 but then you wouldn't be able to get one and two either, that doesn't make any sense."

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.860
 Well, one tennis ball can will be a very sorry sight indeed.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.660
 "It's like a tiny pringles.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:39.900
 Just on balls, I didn't know this, but men and women, tennis, play with different balls."

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.420
 The only reason I read about this was that in March 27th at the Miami Open, Andy Murray,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.460
 mid-game, complained to the umpire that he was playing with women balls.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.100
 The idea is that the female ball is much quicker, much speedier.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.100
 You have so many dominant male servers in the game that it means that they're almost

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.620
 unreturnable, so the male tennis ball is a bit more fluffy, which means a bit more drag

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.660
 in the air, which means that it slows the game down, and with the female balls, it just

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.660
 has way more speed on it.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.660
 "That is amazing."

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.660
 "That's when I learned it as well when Andy Murray complained about that, and I think the

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.340
 whole country went when he did that.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.340
 What the hell?

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.660
 There are women's balls, and I felt like Andy Murray had leaked something that maybe no

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.660
 one was supposed to know."

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.820
 "Yeah, because I have read an article about the behind the scenes of Wimbledon, basically,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:33.140
 and it refers to the guy who's basically the ballmaster, who's a man called Brian, and

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:38.620
 Wimbledon uses two lorries of balls every year, uses 57,000 balls, and they're all kept

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:45.100
 at the same temperature in rooms under Centricort, and apparently they're now divided into

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.500
 men's and ladies' balls, and no one mentions them."

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.300
 "But this is why I think the can argument for them being no five ball games can't be

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.060
 right because they've got a lorry load of them, right? It doesn't really matter about having

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.060
 five or six or seven."

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.060
 "Do you think they're just three balls stuffed into a lorry, and they open the lorry and

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.060
 they all cascade out?"

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.020
 "I think it of it as a world's greatest ball pit."

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.820
 "Yeah, and that is amazing."

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.460
 "The thing is though, the lorry carrying the ladies' balls actually drives a lot faster

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.340
 to get the Wimbledon, because it's got less fluff on the outside of it."

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.620
 "So one thing that they're really strict on at Wimbledon is clothing, and I didn't

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.340
 realise how many players have objected to this in the past. So obviously, at Wimbledon,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.980
 you have to wear all whites, which isn't the same other grandstands. And on Drey Agassie refused

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.940
 to play at Wimbledon until he was 21, which I know doesn't sound real, but you know, he didn't

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.940
 play the juniors around this."

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.660
 "I too refused to play at Wimbledon until it was 21. I'm still refusing, actually. I want

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.740
 to say change that rule. You're in. But yeah, he refused, and then eventually he's

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.660
 succumbed and said, "Oh, I'm obviously going to win this a bunch of times, so I'll

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.380
 be back." But he used to wear denim shorts to play his grandslams, which is an insane thing

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:00.580
 to wear. There was a woman in Yuzumi Bouchard, who I think still plays, but Yuzumi Bouchard

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:06.420
 in 2015 got a dress code violation for, there was a black brass strap showing. So there's

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:12.220
 only one centimetre of any other colour allowed at Wimbledon. And she was wearing a white

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.900
 sports bra underneath, because the rules say, as you will know, if you've read this document,

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:22.740
 any undergarments that either are or can be visible during play, brackets including due to

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.620
 perspiration, closed brackets must be completely white. As in, make sure when you wet your white

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.260
 shirt, you can't say a black brand underneath. What if your perspiration gives you miscoloured

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:39.460
 stains? What if you piss yourself off?

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:45.140
 I don't think you will be able to find £20, £4 pissing yourself on centre court.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.660
 Especially as you go to the umpire, I've pissed myself, and they go, "That's another

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:55.860
 £20." Actually, last year there was controversy. There was a Uruguayan player called Pablo

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:02.380
 Crivas, and he was accused of urinating into a ball can during a match under his towel.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.460
 He was issued with a code violation, although Wimbledon Chiefs did say, and I'm quoting

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.420
 here, "No urination was involved." So he just got his willy out?

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.700
 And put it in a ball can. You might want to cool it down during a match. That's true. Yeah.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.660
 I was playing tennis the other day, and we lost a crucial point because what ended up

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.060
 happening was my doubles partner hit the ball, didn't quite capture it, and hit it again

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.740
 in the same swing. You're allowed to do that. You're allowed to do that. It turns out,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.580
 reading this rule book, it says you were allowed to do that. We lost that crucial point.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.660
 In the same swing. It has to be in the same follow through, the same swing. So if you hit it

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.100
 in the ball bounces, obviously, you can't do that. If you hit it away and you chase after

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.460
 it and you get it, but if it's in literally the same motion and you just almost scoop it slightly.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.900
 Like golf, for instance, where if you do a double hit, that counts as a penalty.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.540
 Because surely once you hit it, it's moving away from you faster than the... Depends

00:11:53.540 --> 00:12:00.580
 how good you are. Because sometimes your first hit is almost a stopping point for it.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.740
 Well, let's say it hits the rim of the racket, and then it kind of slows down,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.380
 and then you kind of hit it with the strings. So I think that's why it's probably

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.140
 existing, because that does often happen. You rim it and then it hits the other bit of your racket,

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.940
 and it's a double hit. So I've seen you play ten or something.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:25.380
 You struggle with single hits. I do. I do. In Wimbledon, not only do they have 230 page rule book

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:32.420
 for the games, they have a rule book for the queue. Well, there's rules anyway. You get given it

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.780
 in the queue as soon as you join. Because it's a main big thing, isn't it, the queue? People stay

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:45.060
 there for days. The rules are no barbecues, no gazeboes, no music after 10pm, and any tent can only hold

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:53.860
 a maximum of two people. Why is that? Or three or four or six, but no, it's to stop having massive

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.940
 tents, because there's only a certain amount of space they want, you know. But couldn't you have a

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.100
 massive tent, but only two of you in it? Well, again, that's the kind of thing that's trying to stop,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.900
 I think. Oh, I see, yeah. Yeah, I've done the queue, and they try to make it fun. It is, you know,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.340
 you start queueing it, I think we start queueing it four in the morning, and we manage to get onto

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.060
 one of the very outer courts. So I don't think I've ever done anything fun that began at four AM.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.220
 Except for if you've been up until four, right? Oh, yeah. There you go. I've never done that.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:26.500
 The thing about the grass at Wimbledon, I found out is that obviously they're very, very,

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.100
 I was about to say precious. They're just very precise about the grasses, and it's treated,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:36.020
 it's shaved by exactly a millimeter each week for 12 weeks. But the guy who does it, the head

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:46.500
 groundsman is called Neil Stubbly. So you would have to kneel down to make it Stubbly. Yeah,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.580
 did you see that that study just came out that says you can predict who's going to win a tennis

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.700
 match based on the noises they make, and they're grunting. If the noise to the making, oh shit.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:04.900
 It's kind of similar. It's so the analysed a bunch of top tennis players and the pitch of the

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.460
 grunts they make and the higher pitch, the grunts go, the more likely it is you'll lose. And in every

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.460
 case, you get higher and higher. You're getting less and less good at tennis. Funny. You don't

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.820
 grunt at all when playing tennis. Neither do I. No, I need the raw viewer elite spots people. I do,

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:25.220
 I mean, I do sometimes say things like that's another game to you. But a lot of people think

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.460
 that even though it's not against the rules, grunting is against the spirit of the rules. Yeah,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.860
 because it basically gives you a non-fair advantage according to some people over the opposition.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.900
 It does. Wasn't there a specific coach who's like known as the grunt coach? Yeah, he's called Nick

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:45.220
 Bollettieri. Right. And he looks after sellers, Agassi and Schrapperver and the William Sisters,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.340
 and they're all big grunters. And he says that actually he doesn't tell them to do that. It just

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.900
 hell happens to be the case that they do. But then other people think that he's telling them to do it

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.060
 because it stops you from being able to hear the sound the ball makes on the racket. And that

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.140
 might be able to give you some clue as to what spin might be on it or whatever. There was a study

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.180
 that did show that grunting makes people respond more slowly in tennis. And so it is number advantage.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.620
 I saw yesterday morning on the BBC, there was a little piece with David Attenborough,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:18.580
 which was really exciting because he's very much involved with Wimbledon in a large way. So

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:24.020
 Attenborough is the one who turned it into color television. And there were interesting things that

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.980
 happened with that. One is that's when they started using yellow tennis balls. Up until then,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.820
 they used white tennis balls. And the reason they started doing that is obviously color television.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.060
 It was much more visual for people to see as it was going on. And there was this other thing. I hadn't

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.740
 been able to find it online. But it was said in this piece, which is that the trophy that they

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.780
 now use is not the original Wimbledon trophy. It's a different trophy because the original one

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.420
 just didn't look that good on camera. It was actually black and white. It was a black and white trophy.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.180
 Yeah, no, they started using this different trophy, which is gold. And so it's more

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.780
 photogenic. It's more photogenic. Yeah, exactly. We'll get rid of that old colon chalk

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:03.940
 trophy that we've been using in a great life. They also used tennis courts used to be hourglass

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.980
 shapes, didn't they? Until Wimbledon came along. I mean, really, really early tennis courts.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.740
 Yeah, until until Wimbledon was established. I think the first Wimbledon was in 1877.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.420
 That was when they decided to make the rectangular. But before that, they used to go in at the net.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.740
 So they were like it is Wimbledon, kind of the originator of all these grand slimes.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.940
 Is it the original grand slam? I think it was first. Yeah, it must be.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.820
 Because before that, it was just croquet. It really beat out croquet. It's a bit sad we could all,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.940
 so the reason croquet disappeared was that they thought, let's start playing tennis on these

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.220
 croquet lawns a bit. And then everyone went, oh, this is a better sport, isn't it?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.500
 Of course. So the fact that croquet is a pretty shit spot. The world war penalty.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.700
 The world war penalty. The world war penalty. The language. One more you're out there.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.380
 I think croquet is a great sport. You can be really devious. Oh, yeah. Not great.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.780
 I think you see the true side of human nature when you play croquet. Where do you guys learn about football?

00:16:53.780 --> 00:17:02.180
 The Uber CEO, as in Uber's CEO. Not the chief of all the CEO.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.140
 It's not the chief of all CEOs. He's been involved in what people are calling a tennis scandal.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.740
 Is he the current one or the one that he's just left? This is Travis Kalinick.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.220
 Oh, yeah. He's the one who just left. His biography on the website amongst many other things

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.540
 of what he's done in the past also claims that he managed to rack up the second highest

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:25.060
 Wii tennis score in the world. People are now claiming that they think that that's not possible.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.660
 Yeah, I think it's not. Yeah, largely because there is no game called Wii tennis.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.260
 You've got Wii Sports in which it's a game within it, but that doesn't have a leaderboard.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:39.140
 So it can't be that. There's another game which is called Wii Grand Slam tennis.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:50.180
 And there's a third one which is called Wii in your tennis ball container.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.420
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is a Chazinski.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.060
 My fact this week is that in Mexico, artists can pay their taxes in artwork.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.660
 It's amazing. It's so weird. It's the only country where you could do this, unsurprisingly.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:11.780
 And yeah, it's this rule that's actually existed since I think it's 1957 that it was first suggested.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.900
 And it's the idea that artists, if they can't pay their taxes or don't want to,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.580
 they instead donate a work of art as a portion of their sales.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.940
 And so it's not even done on monetary value. The way it's done is that for every five pieces of art

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.660
 you sell, you pay an additional one to the government. So if you sell up to five pieces of art,

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.580
 you pay one. And then if you sell more, it becomes like a progressive taxation system.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.020
 And the maximum number you have to give to the government any year is five works of art.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.620
 That's interesting. I wonder, so let's say you sell four incredible massive works of art and then

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.100
 you just do one doodle on an applicant. Does that count? Yeah, that's great question.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.460
 I don't think it does count because apparently there is a committee to make sure that people don't

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.420
 take the piss. So it's basically you have to give them an average one which means you're paying 20%

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.980
 I guess, right? Yeah, well, they're not clear. I think it's a little bit more touchy

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.580
 feeling than that. So yeah, there's this jury, which is ten other artists who judge the quality of

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:13.540
 the painting and decide whether it's for an artist. That's got to be hard. This one's a bit dodgy.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:19.300
 Some of them rejected in the last few years. There were some famous artists who had their paintings

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:25.540
 rejected as taxes, which is pretty hard. But yeah, and then they go, okay, we'll accept this one as

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:32.420
 tax show. So in South Carolina, you can donate a deer carcass and get tax credit for it.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:39.140
 There's a venison for charity tax credit and so you don't pay tax on $50 if you donate a dead deer

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:45.780
 to the government. What's it? Is there a box when you're doing your tax form? Just the number is the

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:51.060
 amount of dead deer you've got in your garage waiting to be submitted? So hang on, so presumably hunting

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:57.700
 is allowed. Is it not that you find a deer that's died of natural causes? I guess they'd have to accept

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.500
 that as well. I don't think they specify cause of death. Okay, they're not going to have a mortician

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.780
 for every single carcass that comes in, are they? That would probably cost more than the $50 you're

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.660
 saving on the tax. But you would hope that they test the quality of the venison because you don't

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.660
 want some old bit of rotting road-killed being sent to the charity. There's a committee of ten

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:26.180
 chefs. The World Bank and Pricewaterhouse Cooper came up with a check for who has the most complicated

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:32.740
 tax code in the world and the way they did that is they imagined a hypothetical ceramic flower pot

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:38.980
 manufacturer and this manufacturer has one building, two plots of land, one truck and 60 employees

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:44.980
 and they work out how difficult it would be for that person to do their taxes, okay? If you were in

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:51.700
 the Maldives, it would take you less than an hour to comply with the Maldives tax code and in Brazil

00:20:51.700 --> 00:21:01.540
 it would take 2,600 hours. What to do it? Which is 108 days of non-stop work? No. Yeah. That is insane.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:08.020
 Yeah. They just got an incredibly complicated tax code. Is there much tax avoidance in Brazil?

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.620
 Cause I imagine that would surely encourage people to avoid tax. Well, that's the argument, isn't it,

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:17.380
 that why you should simplify your tax code in every country? Because in America, in 1913,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:25.940
 their tax code was 400 pages and now it's 70,000 pages, which is about 280 times longer than the

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:33.780
 tennis law book. All right. But in India at the moment, for instance, they've massively

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:41.460
 simplified their tax, a thing called GST where there's just four basic rates now, whereas in the past,

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.940
 all the different areas and villages with all of their different tax codes and they simplified it.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.580
 That's what we have in Australia, GST. Yeah. Good and standard tax. Exactly. And this is the

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.940
 biggest place that has ever done it. So in India, there's two trillion dollar economy with 1.3 billion

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.980
 consumers, but it's so important to them that this has happened only in the last week or so. There

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:09.780
 was a baby named GST. That's great. In Australia, apparently, there's a queen B tax.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:16.900
 If you only queen B's pay. That's right. No, if you sell a queen B for over $20, you have to pay

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:23.540
 10% to the government. Who's selling a queen B for $20? That's over. It feels like a lot for a B.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:31.780
 A queen B? A queen B? An individual B. Yes, that's a lot for a B. No, don't, that's so small.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.300
 They produce a whole hive. I mean, diamond rings are quite small, aren't they?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.780
 Well, how much do you think I spent on my wife's engagement? That's why it's a hula hoop.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.820
 I think that is a lot. Are you joking? They can yield so much, because they're so important. They'll

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.420
 yield so much. Honey, you'd make such a profit out of $20. I think the normal price will be

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.980
 hundreds of dollars for a queen B. That's what I paid for my last queen B, and I just don't want you

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:59.540
 to be insinuating. I was taken for a fool. I don't know. Is a queen B pregnant at the time?

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.100
 I think you might need a drone or something. Yes, so then how much do you pay for that one?

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.540
 I think they're cheap. They're super cheap. Remember, you could rent one? We did that years

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.340
 ago. That was one of our first facts on the show. But that's what I mean, because to rent a B

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.420
 is like one cent per hour per B or something stupid like that. So the queen B is comparatively

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:26.260
 a lot more than that. And at the end of the day, they're all still B's. But if you leave a queen B

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.900
 somewhere, it'll attract a load of other B's. Oh, that's why I just find them. That's why B's keep on,

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.300
 you see a car covered in B's somewhere. That's because there's a queen B under the box. So really,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.660
 what you're doing is you're paying for the queen B, but actually you're getting hundreds of

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:44.020
 thousands of other B's. It's like a sky TV deal, I imagine. Where you pay for sky would actually get loads of

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:51.380
 channels. Right. Except every channel is a B. And sky one is the queen B, is it? Yeah, that's right.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.740
 It seems expensive. You think you just find sky one. But you're actually getting like to sky

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.500
 it. I do understand that now. Glad to put it into terms. You could understand.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.780
 Did you finish your story or did we cut you off at Queen B? I think we extended it far beyond.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:18.740
 Okay. The IRS in America, one of the things that's tax deductible for them is ransom for kidnapped

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:27.780
 loved ones. If you pay to have your loved one returned, yeah, that's tax deductible. It's an

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.940
 expense. So that's not true in Britain, because in Britain, it's counted as a bribe. And

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.180
 the bribes are illegal. And you're not allowed to claim them back anything illegal, but in America,

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:44.140
 you can. And was it John Paul Getty? Yes, the third. Yeah, who's one of his family were kidnapped.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.580
 And they ran to him for X amount. And he said he'd only pay Y amount. And that was the maximum

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.500
 expense that he was allowed to claim or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So John Paul Getty, the third

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:58.860
 was kidnapped. And it was his father who said he would pay the ransom, but only up to 2.2 million.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:04.140
 Because then that's the maximum that was allowed for tax deduction. I'm sure. Did he still

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.980
 understand that he couldn't go above that otherwise? It would be tax. I think he would have,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.820
 because I think he would have been brought up in the way that his dad conducted business,

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.700
 a red that Warren Buffett submitted his first tax return when he was doing newspaper and milk

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.780
 rounds. So like, you know, I think this guy would have been in a similar like, oh, that makes

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:27.740
 sense, dad, yeah. I like the excuse of something my dad told me. So Ken Dodd was accused of not

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.620
 paying taxes for a while. He was accused by the inland revenue. And I feel like you, when you made

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.420
 that face, we're doing an impression of Ken Dodd. I'm really sorry if that's not what you're trying

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:40.380
 to do. I wasn't. I once met Ken Dodd. Yeah, he was a museum, wasn't he? And he said to me, do I know

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.660
 you? And I said, I don't think so. And he said, yeah, yeah, I know you. We were on the same

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:51.820
 police line up together, weren't we? Funny guy. Yeah, he is funny. So apparently he, the inland

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.940
 revenue said, you haven't been paying us for years. And he said, I didn't think it applied to me.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:07.500
 I live by the seaside. Did he? No, no, no, Dodd. Oh, yeah. It's a joke, Andy. I would, I don't know. Sorry.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:13.500
 In 2015, one person living on a street in Hull complained that they were paying more

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:18.620
 council tax than all of their neighbours. They went to the council and the council upto all of their

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:33.100
 neighbours' council tax. Turn on, they made their life a lot worse. Okay, it is time for fact number

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:39.420
 three. And that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the size of a rainbow can tell you how

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:47.420
 polluted the air is. That's so, so is the rainbow more of a prominent feature in a more polluted area?

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.220
 It's, it's not really easy for us to see, but if you're a scientist, you have the right equipment. You

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:58.700
 can see very small changes. So if there are chemicals like acid rain, it would change the size of

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.660
 the droplets, which would change the size of the bow. And so they look at that and they can tell

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:10.300
 exactly what chemicals are in the air. Wow. Do you know like double rainbows? Yeah. Actually,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.380
 this isn't double rainbows, twin rainbows, which is slightly different thing. You can have two

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.900
 rain showers that are kind of near each other, one with small raindrops and one with fat raindrops.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.620
 And they will give you two different rainbows and they'll start in the same bottom left hand corner

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.300
 or bottom right hand corner and they'll come round and one will be higher than the other.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.780
 That's called a twin rainbow. I've seen what it goes before. Have you? Yeah. They're quite rare.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.500
 Yeah, I mean, it was, I saw it once and that's it. Yeah. Great. Where did you sit?

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:43.100
 I think it was in Austria at the time. Really? Yeah. I really like James' turn when he went,

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.540
 they're quite rare. Like, I think you probably just saw a double rainbow down.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.660
 Because yeah, that's unbelievable. So it looks like it's sprouting from the same origin,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:57.900
 but then it sprouts into two different rainbows. No, I wasn't listening. I've seen

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:04.220
 it really big rainbows, what I was saying. I can't tell if you've done what you're joking now.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.980
 So you can get a quadruple rainbow. Wow. Okay. There was a photograph online of a quadruple rainbow.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:15.820
 It wasn't really a quadruple rainbow. It was just four rainbows. You can see why they mistook that.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:20.780
 Yeah, you can see it, but it was, it was a rookie era. A photograph of a quadruple rainbow

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.620
 just looks like two rainbows. And the reason is that you've got two in front of you. Say the sun is

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.340
 behind you. You've got two rainbows in front of you and then they reflect backwards. And so the other

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:36.620
 two are behind you. So it's impossible to take a photo of them, of all four of them at the same time,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:42.540
 unless you do like a panoramic picture. And they're extremely, extremely, extremely rare. So you

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:48.300
 probably only see a few of those. I think six of them. And no more. I think there's only one photograph

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.660
 of them ever. Right. And it's only two of them. It's not of the other two. Okay. Why? Because the camera

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.900
 couldn't get them in. Because two in front of you and two are always behind you. If you've been listening

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:04.940
 to any of them, it's literally just explaining that. Do you know you can get white rainbows? So this

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.340
 This is... - That's a cloud mate, that you saw in clouds.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.380
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.140
 These are the big and fluffy and they float in the sky.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.100
 (laughter)

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.980
 No, these are light rainbows.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.300
 They get called fogbows.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.340
 Okay, so if you've got fog in the air, that's where the water droplets hang in the air.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.620
 They're incredibly microscopic, they're tiny.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.820
 So you do get the rainbow effect, but they're so small that they don't actually show color.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.180
 - Yeah. - They are stunning.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.460
 You can get all red rainbows as well, just a single red.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.780
 - Terrifying. - I know, that's cool.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.820
 And a lot shorter song as well.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.500
 (laughter)

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.260
 - Yeah, there's sort of evening time, aren't they?

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.220
 So it depends where the sun is in the sky or the kind of color of your rainbow.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.940
 They gradually start to lose their colors one by one, don't they?

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.260
 The shorter wavelengths die first.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.220
 - I always ask. - That's a good title for something.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.620
 (laughter)

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.460
 Like a murder set at a radio station at Murder Mystery.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.780
 The shorter wavelengths die first, yeah?

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.380
 In Norway where they've just turned off their FM.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.580
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.620
 - So it's a Scandi Noir drama.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.540
 - But it's kind of also about the progress of technology and leaving behind.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.820
 - It's got lots of layers. - Like a rainbow.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.100
 (laughter)

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:20.660
 - Just on the red rainbow, there's actually a physicist who in his lab has been creating

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.940
 red rainbows as well, using lasers.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.060
 He's a physicist at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.180
 And he shoots a laser into a droplet.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.180
 And so he gets these tiny rainbows that are all red.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:40.140
 And he says that the form of the rainbow, under those kind of controlled conditions, you

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.520
 can precisely determine what shape it's going to be, what size it's going to be, what the

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.660
 composition and temperature of it is, purely by looking at the droplet before it's sprayed

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.660
 out. How cool is that?

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.860
 - I would say that's like a really small version of this thing, which is that the size of

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:59.300
 the droplets and what the composed of depends on what the rainbow looks like on a bigger scale

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.780
 as well. That's how you can tell all the pollution and stuff.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.780
 - Right, okay.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.300
 - So he says just to put it into super cool door key words for this particular small one

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:14.140
 that he doesn't allow. Every single droplet has its own unique rainbow fingerprint already

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.140
 in it.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.140
 - So cool.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.860
 - Do you guys like rainbows?

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.860
 (laughter)

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.860
 - Quick question.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.860
 - Yeah.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.260
 - And I'm more for them than against them, yeah.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.260
 - That's two yeses.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.260
 - I'm a huge yeses.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.780
 - Okay, three. Well, not everyone likes rainbows.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.780
 (laughter)

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:37.940
 So this is something from Amazonian cultures and rainbows there, very bad luck, as in they

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.340
 are associated with skin problems, with having miscarriages, if you're pregnant.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.340
 - How could this, doesn't make any sense there, so clearly such a positive, happy, I don't

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.340
 know.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.780
 - I think it's one of those glass half empty things because it's caused by sunshine and rain.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.460
 Now, if it's always sunny and then you get some rain, then it could be a bad thing.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.980
 But if it's always rainy, like it is in Britain, then the fact that there's a rainbow means

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.300
 at least there's some sun around.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.300
 - Okay.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:09.340
 - This is from Wikipedia, I should say, so, but there is a saying, rainbows are shit.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.340
 - That's right.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.340
 (laughter)

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.340
 - I'm such a translate.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:19.260
 - There are diseases in one Peruvian language called Iona achata, which means the rainbow hurt

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260
 my skin.

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.260
 - What?

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.260
 - What do you might say to the doctor?

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.700
 And it's traditional to close your mouth at a rainbow, otherwise you'll catch a disease.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.700
 - Oh wow.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.700
 - Yeah.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.180
 So I'm just saying, they're not all good.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.540
 - So the Skittles' adverts, over there, was not gone down there at all, were they?

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.940
 - Do not taste the rainbow.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.940
 (laughter)

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:42.340
 - So the rainbow flag for pride has all the rainbow colors and it used to have a

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.540
 shocking pink band.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:51.500
 And the reason they did away with that is because they couldn't mass-produce the pink cloth.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.500
 All the others were easy to make, but this was a cloth that wasn't very easy to make, because

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.700
 the first guy who did it, he kind of made it himself just a one-off.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.220
 He didn't think of it being a mass-produced thing, and then it became really popular, and

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.260
 they needed to make loads of them, but they couldn't get the pink.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.100
 - It was after the Stonewall riots, wasn't it, that suddenly in the late 70s, suddenly

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.900
 there was this massive demand for these flags, and they couldn't get it.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.820
 - Then it had, so how many colors do you think are in the flag now?

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.420
 - I think seven.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.900
 - Um, six.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.340
 - Did you just sing the rainbow song and still come up with six?

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.340
 - I took out one.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.340
 - I took out one.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.340
 - Did you?

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.340
 Why, any reason?

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.980
 - I put white in to, since I've learned about some new rainbow.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.980
 - You should have come up with eight then.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.980
 (laughter)

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.780
 - I didn't sing the full song, I kind of backed out and thought, "I feel like there's only

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.780
 a few left."

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.980
 - I think we need to hang on down, I think we need to test something quickly.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.380
 What are the colors in a rainbow?

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.380
 - Oh no.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.380
 (laughter)

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.900
 - Red, and yellow, and pink.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.900
 - No.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.900
 - Red.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.900
 - Well, actually, all the colors are in the rainbow.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.900
 - All the colors are.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:52.900
 - No, no, hang on, hang on, hang on, who's pink, isn't it?

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.900
 - No, there's no pink.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.900
 - No.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.900
 - Red and yellow.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:56.900
 - Red and yellow.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.900
 Green.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.900
 - Wait, what's the song?

00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.900
 - The song is not the actual colors of the rainbow.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.900
 That's just a fun song you learned.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.900
 - Hang on, what's I singing the right lyrics, sir?

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.900
 - You were singing the right lyrics.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.900
 - Okay, all right.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.900
 - Green.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:09.340
 - That's the full, but the colors in the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.520
 That's the colors that you learn, also, actually, you know, it's just emerging from the

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520
 landscape.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.520
 - I like the jump ship to the end of the track.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.520
 That is correct.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.820
 I too was fooled by the song.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:17.820
 (laughter)

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.820
 - What a lie of a song.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.820
 - Yeah.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.660
 - Just take something of things people need to remember in day-to-day life.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:28.660
 It's like having a song, January, and February, and orange.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.660
 (laughter)

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.660
 - Yeah.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:36.180
 - It is me that I can understand why you thought that it went red, orange, whatever the song

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.180
 goes.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.180
 - So what is it?

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.580
 - So it's seven colors in the rainbow, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.580
 And the pride flag used to have, as we've said, it used to have eight, because it had these

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.900
 and the hot pink.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.580
 And then it went down to seven, but then it only has six colors in it now, which I'd never

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.580
 notice.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.420
 - Do you think that maybe it wasn't that the material was too expensive?

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.220
 It's that the creator of the flag also was basing it off the song, and then someone said,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.220
 "What's pink doing there?"

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.220
 And he thought, "Oh, yeah, we can't stay anyway, it's so expensive."

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.700
 - So no, it wasn't because of that.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.860
 He knew the colors of the rainbow, this guy.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.620
 The reason they lost the next color was because when the flag was round around poles, then

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.220
 one color would get lost, because it would be round around the pole.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.580
 So they needed an even number of colors, basically, because otherwise--

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.900
 - It wasn't a vertical stripe, wasn't it?

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.900
 It wasn't a vertical--

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.100
 - It must be a horizontal polynomial.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:30.140
 - What it said was one hung vertically from the lamppost of San Francisco's market street,

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.140
 the center stripe.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.100
 So if it was hung vertically, the center stripe went around the pole.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:41.580
 And so they decided they needed an even number so that that middle stripe wasn't kind of,

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.580
 I don't know, didn't disappear into the pole.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.580
 - Yeah.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.580
 - That's why I did it.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.900
 - And Philadelphia, this year, has added a couple of extra colors to their flag that they

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.820
 had been using as a not-a-racial diversity.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.820
 - Okay, cool.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.220
 - Yeah, so they've gone up to eight, I think, again.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.220
 - Oh, really?

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.220
 - Yeah.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.220
 - So they've added brown and black.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.220
 - They stand for--

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.020
 - The other colors stand for really fun stuff, don't they?

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.020
 - Yeah.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.820
 - But it's such a shame they lost the pink, because so the person who designed it said that

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.980
 the hot pink stood for sex.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:13.860
 So the other stand for life, healing, sunlight, nature, magic, serenity, and spirit.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.860
 But they've lost the sex now.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.660
 - They should have got rid of the magic one.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.460
 - Why is magic even in there?

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.460
 - I'm glad that stayed.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.460
 - Oh, god.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.780
 - And the other thing is that we were saying about the being seven colors in the rainbow.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.660
 I think that was Newton who decided that, wasn't it?

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.540
 And the reason being, we think probably just because seven was like a magical number, it

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.700
 was like the seven C's, the seven, you know?

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.700
 - It's his favorite number.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.700
 - Yeah, it's his favorite number.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700
 - It's just a good number.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.340
 And so he kind of looked and decided there were seven distinct bands.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.420
 And actually, if you look at a rainbow, you can decide really yourself how many bands

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.420
 there are.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.420
 There's pretty much an infinite number.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.380
 - Although, I always, because I think we've done that on QI, and so I always look at

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.820
 rainbows and think, okay, get beyond the seven thing, Newton just made it up.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.820
 But I still only ever see seven colors.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.140
 I can't see more or less.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.140
 - Really?

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.140
 - Yeah.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.140
 - He passed away this year.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.140
 - Newton.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.140
 - Yeah, started a break at sea.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.140
 - Yeah.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.140
 - He had a good innings.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:09.860
 - Gilbert Baker, who is the creator of the rainbow flag, passed away this year, sadly.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.460
 - Oh, Newton as well, and the savior.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.460
 - That's been a big--

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.460
 - 2017.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:26.060
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:31.980
 My fact this week is that a new study has revealed that the genre of music, with the most references

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.580
 to drugs, is country music.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:43.980
 Country music has, according to the survey, 1.6 mentions per song on average of drug usage,

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:49.880
 and they did a list of genres, which used most drug references, so it started with country

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.620
 music, then jazz, then pop, electronic, rock, folk, and in at last, rap.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.620
 - You missed out other.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.620
 - Yeah, I know.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.620
 I wasn't...

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.460
 Is that my favorite genre?

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.460
 - Other who's...

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.820
 Yeah, other who's just underneath rock, but above folk.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.820
 - Wow.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.820
 - Yeah.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.820
 - I thought country was folk, so I'm on a learning curve today.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.820
 - Yeah.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.100
 That is unbelievable, though.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.580
 I think that's really amazing, that rap has the fewest references.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.580
 - Yeah.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.660
 I think some people have looked at the methodology of this and aren't sure how it's ended up right.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.420
 - We were talking about this, weren't we?

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.740
 It just seems so unbelievable, though, this is the case.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.420
 - Well, what they did, they took-- didn't they?

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.700
 The lyrics of many, many thousands of songs, and they had a list of drug-related words.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.540
 It quite a lot of drug-related words that they plugged in, and then they went through manually,

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.260
 making sure that, you know, if someone says "refer", they're not actually singing a song

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.340
 about the coral reef, the part where the man who works on a coral reef.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.340
 - Yeah.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.340
 Exactly.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.340
 A lot of rap songs are about people who work on coral reefs, so that's probably why.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.340
 So, yeah.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.340
 But...

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.780
 - I wondered if the methodology went wrong in that they're not cool enough to understand

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.220
 some of the more modern drug references, because they came up with this list of 65 names

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.220
 for drugs.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:04.740
 And so the examples that were in this article were things like Adi, Blow, Molly, Roxy,

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:10.860
 and Scissorpe, S-I-D-Z-U-R-P, so if they feature in a song, that's that kind of the drug.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.660
 But maybe Raps just using way more modern cool slang.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.660
 - Oh, boy, why?

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.660
 - That these guys don't know about.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.700
 - As opposed to Scissorpe, the classic 1920 slang for what is Scissorpe?

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.340
 - I've never heard Scissorpe before, and you're saying it like it's a hackneyed old term.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.340
 - No, no, no.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.420
 - Well, it's such a good word to rhyme with, which is why you use something about burping.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.420
 Then you're going to need a Scissorpe.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.420
 It's the only thing that rhymes.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.420
 - Yeah, what is it?

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.420
 I don't know what a Scissorpe is.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.820
 I don't think anyone has ever heard of Scissorpe except the person who wrote whatever song refers to it.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.620
 And then I'm just saying that they've got this list, but maybe they've missed things out that Raps using.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:48.780
 I think they also used a lot of songs, perhaps you wouldn't hear on normal country music stations.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.780
 - Yes.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:54.260
 - And actually the more popular ones probably are about Scissorpe and the other drugs.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:59.100
 - But they weren't counting, because they had a list of the drugs that they were looking for as well.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:05.060
 And they didn't include alcohol, but I reckon if you throw alcohol in, you know, country music has quite a lot of references to that, doesn't it?

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.060
 - Yeah, tons.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.500
 - So I've just Googled Scissorpe.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.500
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:15.940
 - It is a purple drink, a mix of coding based prescription cough syrup, soda and often jolly ranchers candy.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.580
 - Sounds quite nice, doesn't it?

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.580
 - Yeah.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.580
 - But don't do it, kids.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.540
 That sounds so country, though.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.740
 - And jolly ranchers candy and then some prescription drugs, classic country music.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:36.340
 - You can't really imagine Snoop Dogg on the Scissorpe, could you, but weirdly that's a word that's closely, I would associate more with Snoop than anywhere else.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.340
 - Scissorpe on the Scissorpe.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.340
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:45.540
 - It's interesting, I wonder if in other, Reggae's not on this list, blues is not on this list, they've been lumped into other.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.540
 - So blues would be in jazz?

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.540
 - I guess so, yeah.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.540
 - Reggae.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.540
 - Classical.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.540
 - Classical.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.540
 - Classical in that.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.540
 - Symphony Phops is a Pindi minor.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.540
 - You were saying about the words that they use.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:05.540
 Did you see that America's Drug Enforcement Administration have made a dictionary of slang drug terms this year?

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.540
 I wonder if any of these are in it.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.540
 Whiffle dust, Bernie's flakes.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.540
 I wonder if any of these are in Bernie's.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.540
 - Is that named after Bernie?

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.540
 - Bernie's.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.540
 - Well, I don't know, it means cocaine.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.540
 - Yeah, that's Bernie's flakes.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:24.540
 - Is there the people who were going to show up to vote for Bernie Sanders in the American primaries, but they didn't?

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.540
 - They were two off their heads.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.540
 - Ant hazel means heroin.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.540
 - I wonder if that's in any of those songs.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.540
 - Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy means cannabis.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.540
 - Ant hazel.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.540
 - Ant hazel.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.540
 - That explains what my unclean was up to.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.540
 - This has what it's called, Barbara.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.540
 - Every night, you was having a night in without hazel.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.540
 - Smoochy Wootchy.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.540
 Feels like it would be a good name of a song, maybe you're a vision hit.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.540
 - Yeah.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.540
 - But what if you're just really loved up and you're walking down the street with your partner and you say,

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:59.540
 "I'll give us a Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy" and you're immediately arrested by one of these guys.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:05.540
 - You deserve to be immediately arrested if you'll say to your lover in public, give us a Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.540
 - But I would say that that's probably true of lots of slang terms for drugs, right?

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.540
 - Yeah.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.540
 - To a song called "Weed" into a tennis ball can.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:16.540
 - Yes.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.540
 - Yeah, I might think it's about drugs.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.540
 - That's true.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:25.540
 - Okay, that is it.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.540
 That is all of our facts.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.540
