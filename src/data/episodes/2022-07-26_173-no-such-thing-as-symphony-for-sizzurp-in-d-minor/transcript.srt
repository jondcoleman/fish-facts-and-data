00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,120
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish or weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,920
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,800
 My name is Dan Shriver and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,480
 James Harkin.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,360
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
 Starting with you, Andy."

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,680
 "My fact is that to be a tennis umpire, you have to learn a 230 page book.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,760
 This is a rule book specifically, that's tennis, it's not novel."

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,560
 "And this is specifically the U.S. tennis association, so over in Britain we've got

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,360
 the Lawn Tennis Association which is a slightly different thing."

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,000
 "It's the more off-you-er rules you think for the lawn one."

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,640
 "I don't know, I haven't been able to."

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
 "It's going to be similar isn't it?"

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 "Probably a similar leg."

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,600
 "Yeah, but I have been reading the rules of Wimbledon, and so is Wimbledon this same

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
 guide book?"

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
 "Wimbledon is lawn tennis."

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
 "Oh yes, of course."

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
 "Change Tours is almost immediate."

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,120
 "I think the rules are generally going to be the same, aren't they?

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,880
 It's not like in Wimbledon you're allowed to kick the ball over."

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,680
 "In American tennis you have to hit it outside the light."

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,640
 "When they have to learn it, do they get tested on it, do they have to memorize the

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
 whole thing?

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
 Keep it as a reference kind of in their pocket."

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,440
 "Well, I used to be a football referee, I was qualified as a football referee and you

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,960
 have to do an exam.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,040
 So you really only have to learn what comes up on the exam, really."

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,640
 "It's kind of like a driving test, you have to learn a 500-page book on the rules of

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,120
 driving, but actually you can't recite that from start to finish, can you?"

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
 "Can't you?"

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
 "Can't you?"

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,720
 "Go on, that's why you're constantly crashing your car over the place."

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,920
 "For a tie, who I'm constantly referring to a 500-page book."

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,440
 "Go on, give us some rules."

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,200
 "All right, so I think it's quite well known that at Wimbledon you can get fine for swearing."

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
 "Yes, and you?"

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,240
 "Yeah, I didn't find $20,000 if you swear."

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
 "Does it depend on the word?"

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
 "No."

42
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,240
 "Oh, so you might as well use the strongest one."

43
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
 "You may as well, yeah."

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
 "But if you go-"

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
 "That's if you're a player, right?"

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
 "If you're a player."

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,800
 "I'm just walking around the grounds, "Oh, fuck, it's overcharged me for my beer, and

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 they take you away."

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 "20,000."

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
 "Thank you."

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,440
 "That could have bought you one planet of strawberries."

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,960
 "No, if you go out in the first round, though, that is nearly half your winnings you would

53
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,760
 have spent on swearing once."

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,800
 "Oh, wow, wow."

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,080
 "And the umpires and the staff, they have to learn swear words in other languages in

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,000
 case a Latvian tennis player swears in Latvian."

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
 "Oh, that makes so much sense."

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
 "It's interesting about the people being paid if you lose in the first round because

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,960
 that was in the news last week because people were losing in the first round injured and

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,800
 they knew they were injured going into it, but they've turned up and played anyway and then

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,320
 just given up halfway through to get the money.

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,560
 And the thing is, they've worked together, you know what, I mean, over the whole year they've

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,160
 got their rankings high enough that they get to where they are, so they kind of is fair

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
 enough, I think.

65
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
 "I think it's totally fair enough."

66
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,520
 "I've been like one of us turning up with no facts.

67
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
 That's me every week."

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,840
 "Right, yeah, but everywhere we find you, 20,000 pounds."

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,720
 "But Dan, over the last three years, has done enough to earn his place and done enough

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,440
 to just turn up with no facts."

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
 "Yeah, yeah."

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,280
 "I'll tell you what's bad though, is the fact that tickets to Wimbledon cost a fortune to

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,600
 get center court as well.

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
 You're paying huge amounts of money well in advance.

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,720
 So on this particular day we're talking about, in this current Wimbledon competition, Federer

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 was playing.

77
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 So you're thinking, I get to see Federer center court of Wimbledon.

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,680
 This guy pulls out 25 minutes since of the match or so.

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
 Next match, Djokovic comes on.

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
 Same thing happens.

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 Guy pulls out.

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,320
 "You've got center court tickets for two of the great tennis players of our time."

83
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,640
 "You do expect that in the first round.

84
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,360
 Don't get center court tickets in the first round."

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
 "Oh, what?"

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
 "Yeah."

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
 "I literally get some for the final and semi."

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
 "That's me."

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
 "The box."

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
 "I don't know.

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
 Obviously, it's ridiculous, but there just should be rules.

92
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,920
 It's stupid to imagine that an individual should make that decision.

93
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,120
 There just needs to be health check."

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,480
 "So in normal tennis, that's not the Grand Slam.

95
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 They do have the rules.

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,360
 So if you're injured, but you've already qualified, you get your money.

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,760
 And then a substitute comes in and they play and they only get money if they win.

98
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,440
 So if they lose, they don't get anything, but if they go through to the second round,

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
 they do get money.

100
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
 "Oh, but they don't play under your name.

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
 You've been there."

102
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,480
 "They have to put on a mustache if you've got a mustache."

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,320
 "Learn these swear words in my language."

104
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,320
 "But I think it might have been the other Andy Murray's idea to do that and they brought

105
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,080
 it in this year as a trial, and it seems to be working quite well."

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
 "That's cool."

107
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
 "Okay."

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
 "Like that, the other Andy Murray.

109
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
 Yeah.

110
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,400
 "Someone who's been the other Andy Murray until now, literally now, when you just said

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 that.

112
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,920
 But just on the swearing thing quickly, there is another rule which is about visible obscenity,

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,000
 which I had never read before, and so it's this.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,200
 For the purposes of this rule, visible obscenity, stop doing that, James, with your hands, is

115
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,720
 visible obscenity, is defined as the making of signs by a player with his hands and/or racket

116
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,640
 or balls that commonly happen obscenity.

117
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,880
 And does it define what they mean by balls in that situation?"

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,080
 "There's even a rule on abuse of balls, abuse of balls.

119
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
 Yeah.

120
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,400
 Players shall not violently, dangerously, or with anger, hit, kick, or throw, a tennis ball."

121
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
 Because that happened.

122
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
 Was that Tim Henman did that once?

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
 Yes, he's the first player ever to be kicked out of Wimbledon for...

124
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
 Was he?

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
 Yeah.

126
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
 What?

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
 Yeah, because you...

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
 So another thing that swearing does for you is if you don't get a fine, you get a penalty

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,000
 point, and you can be penalized out of a match.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,080
 So there's a famous example of a guy called Bryden Klein.

131
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,760
 He was facing a guy called Sam Groth, and during the match he served, and this was in the

132
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,040
 final game, but he was losing, served it into the net, and just yelled out, "Stupid, stupid

133
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,880
 person, talking about himself," he claimed.

134
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,920
 But the umpire said, "I don't know who you directed that at, but that's rude.

135
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,200
 You've been given a penalty point, and because he got one earlier in the match, the match

136
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
 was over.

137
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
 They didn't even get to finish the match."

138
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
 "Stupid, stupid person."

139
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
 "Stupid, stupid person."

140
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,880
 It's very rude and Latvian.

141
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,400
 The funniest bit about it, though, is that he looked to the other player to say, "Hey, come

142
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
 on.

143
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 Like, bail me out here."

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 Like, that was me.

145
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,320
 The guy said, "I'd like to help you, but it's too tough to call from here," and he pointed

146
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,120
 to the line's woman, and so the guy, who said, "Stupid, stupid person," said, "She's

147
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,080
 a 60-year-old lady wearing Leica, and then he stopped himself," because he's like, "Ooh,

148
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,000
 I'm about to get another penalty point."

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,760
 I read some of the rules.

150
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,960
 This is for normal tennis, which is not Wimbledon.

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,040
 One of them is quite good.

152
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,520
 The event organizer has to announce how many balls they'll have before the event in play

153
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 at any time.

154
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,160
 The number of balls to play is either two, three, four, or six.

155
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
 "Ooh."

156
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,400
 "I want to know what happened with five.

157
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 Why not five?"

158
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
 "Oh, yeah.

159
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
 Why not five?"

160
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 "I think we understand that, though."

161
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
 "It's to do with how many you're in a can.

162
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,740
 You wouldn't open a new can for just one ball, I guess, but you wouldn't have seven

163
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
 either.

164
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,200
 It feels a bit wrong about it."

165
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,740
 So you're allowed two or three, but no other prime numbers, is that what you're saying?

166
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
 "Yes, exactly."

167
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
 "Yes, exactly."

168
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:21,100
 "I think it might be dance explanation, because you do get cans in three or four portions,

169
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,340
 but then you wouldn't be able to get one and two either, that doesn't make any sense."

170
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,860
 Well, one tennis ball can will be a very sorry sight indeed.

171
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,660
 "It's like a tiny pringles.

172
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:39,900
 Just on balls, I didn't know this, but men and women, tennis, play with different balls."

173
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,420
 The only reason I read about this was that in March 27th at the Miami Open, Andy Murray,

174
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,460
 mid-game, complained to the umpire that he was playing with women balls.

175
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,100
 The idea is that the female ball is much quicker, much speedier.

176
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,100
 You have so many dominant male servers in the game that it means that they're almost

177
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,620
 unreturnable, so the male tennis ball is a bit more fluffy, which means a bit more drag

178
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,660
 in the air, which means that it slows the game down, and with the female balls, it just

179
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
 has way more speed on it.

180
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
 "That is amazing."

181
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,660
 "That's when I learned it as well when Andy Murray complained about that, and I think the

182
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,340
 whole country went when he did that.

183
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
 What the hell?

184
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,660
 There are women's balls, and I felt like Andy Murray had leaked something that maybe no

185
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
 one was supposed to know."

186
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,820
 "Yeah, because I have read an article about the behind the scenes of Wimbledon, basically,

187
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,140
 and it refers to the guy who's basically the ballmaster, who's a man called Brian, and

188
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,620
 Wimbledon uses two lorries of balls every year, uses 57,000 balls, and they're all kept

189
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,100
 at the same temperature in rooms under Centricort, and apparently they're now divided into

190
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,500
 men's and ladies' balls, and no one mentions them."

191
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,300
 "But this is why I think the can argument for them being no five ball games can't be

192
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,060
 right because they've got a lorry load of them, right? It doesn't really matter about having

193
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,060
 five or six or seven."

194
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,060
 "Do you think they're just three balls stuffed into a lorry, and they open the lorry and

195
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,060
 they all cascade out?"

196
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,020
 "I think it of it as a world's greatest ball pit."

197
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,820
 "Yeah, and that is amazing."

198
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,460
 "The thing is though, the lorry carrying the ladies' balls actually drives a lot faster

199
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,340
 to get the Wimbledon, because it's got less fluff on the outside of it."

200
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,620
 "So one thing that they're really strict on at Wimbledon is clothing, and I didn't

201
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,340
 realise how many players have objected to this in the past. So obviously, at Wimbledon,

202
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,980
 you have to wear all whites, which isn't the same other grandstands. And on Drey Agassie refused

203
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,940
 to play at Wimbledon until he was 21, which I know doesn't sound real, but you know, he didn't

204
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
 play the juniors around this."

205
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,660
 "I too refused to play at Wimbledon until it was 21. I'm still refusing, actually. I want

206
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,740
 to say change that rule. You're in. But yeah, he refused, and then eventually he's

207
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,660
 succumbed and said, "Oh, I'm obviously going to win this a bunch of times, so I'll

208
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,380
 be back." But he used to wear denim shorts to play his grandslams, which is an insane thing

209
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,580
 to wear. There was a woman in Yuzumi Bouchard, who I think still plays, but Yuzumi Bouchard

210
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,420
 in 2015 got a dress code violation for, there was a black brass strap showing. So there's

211
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:12,220
 only one centimetre of any other colour allowed at Wimbledon. And she was wearing a white

212
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,900
 sports bra underneath, because the rules say, as you will know, if you've read this document,

213
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,740
 any undergarments that either are or can be visible during play, brackets including due to

214
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,620
 perspiration, closed brackets must be completely white. As in, make sure when you wet your white

215
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,260
 shirt, you can't say a black brand underneath. What if your perspiration gives you miscoloured

216
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:39,460
 stains? What if you piss yourself off?

217
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,140
 I don't think you will be able to find £20, £4 pissing yourself on centre court.

218
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,660
 Especially as you go to the umpire, I've pissed myself, and they go, "That's another

219
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,860
 £20." Actually, last year there was controversy. There was a Uruguayan player called Pablo

220
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,380
 Crivas, and he was accused of urinating into a ball can during a match under his towel.

221
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,460
 He was issued with a code violation, although Wimbledon Chiefs did say, and I'm quoting

222
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,420
 here, "No urination was involved." So he just got his willy out?

223
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,700
 And put it in a ball can. You might want to cool it down during a match. That's true. Yeah.

224
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,660
 I was playing tennis the other day, and we lost a crucial point because what ended up

225
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,060
 happening was my doubles partner hit the ball, didn't quite capture it, and hit it again

226
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,740
 in the same swing. You're allowed to do that. You're allowed to do that. It turns out,

227
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,580
 reading this rule book, it says you were allowed to do that. We lost that crucial point.

228
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,660
 In the same swing. It has to be in the same follow through, the same swing. So if you hit it

229
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,100
 in the ball bounces, obviously, you can't do that. If you hit it away and you chase after

230
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,460
 it and you get it, but if it's in literally the same motion and you just almost scoop it slightly.

231
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,900
 Like golf, for instance, where if you do a double hit, that counts as a penalty.

232
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,540
 Because surely once you hit it, it's moving away from you faster than the... Depends

233
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:00,580
 how good you are. Because sometimes your first hit is almost a stopping point for it.

234
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,740
 Well, let's say it hits the rim of the racket, and then it kind of slows down,

235
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,380
 and then you kind of hit it with the strings. So I think that's why it's probably

236
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,140
 existing, because that does often happen. You rim it and then it hits the other bit of your racket,

237
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,940
 and it's a double hit. So I've seen you play ten or something.

238
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:25,380
 You struggle with single hits. I do. I do. In Wimbledon, not only do they have 230 page rule book

239
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,420
 for the games, they have a rule book for the queue. Well, there's rules anyway. You get given it

240
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,780
 in the queue as soon as you join. Because it's a main big thing, isn't it, the queue? People stay

241
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:45,060
 there for days. The rules are no barbecues, no gazeboes, no music after 10pm, and any tent can only hold

242
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:53,860
 a maximum of two people. Why is that? Or three or four or six, but no, it's to stop having massive

243
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,940
 tents, because there's only a certain amount of space they want, you know. But couldn't you have a

244
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,100
 massive tent, but only two of you in it? Well, again, that's the kind of thing that's trying to stop,

245
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,900
 I think. Oh, I see, yeah. Yeah, I've done the queue, and they try to make it fun. It is, you know,

246
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,340
 you start queueing it, I think we start queueing it four in the morning, and we manage to get onto

247
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,060
 one of the very outer courts. So I don't think I've ever done anything fun that began at four AM.

248
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,220
 Except for if you've been up until four, right? Oh, yeah. There you go. I've never done that.

249
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:26,500
 The thing about the grass at Wimbledon, I found out is that obviously they're very, very,

250
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,100
 I was about to say precious. They're just very precise about the grasses, and it's treated,

251
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,020
 it's shaved by exactly a millimeter each week for 12 weeks. But the guy who does it, the head

252
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:46,500
 groundsman is called Neil Stubbly. So you would have to kneel down to make it Stubbly. Yeah,

253
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,580
 did you see that that study just came out that says you can predict who's going to win a tennis

254
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,700
 match based on the noises they make, and they're grunting. If the noise to the making, oh shit.

255
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:04,900
 It's kind of similar. It's so the analysed a bunch of top tennis players and the pitch of the

256
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,460
 grunts they make and the higher pitch, the grunts go, the more likely it is you'll lose. And in every

257
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,460
 case, you get higher and higher. You're getting less and less good at tennis. Funny. You don't

258
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,820
 grunt at all when playing tennis. Neither do I. No, I need the raw viewer elite spots people. I do,

259
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:25,220
 I mean, I do sometimes say things like that's another game to you. But a lot of people think

260
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,460
 that even though it's not against the rules, grunting is against the spirit of the rules. Yeah,

261
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,860
 because it basically gives you a non-fair advantage according to some people over the opposition.

262
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,900
 It does. Wasn't there a specific coach who's like known as the grunt coach? Yeah, he's called Nick

263
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:45,220
 Bollettieri. Right. And he looks after sellers, Agassi and Schrapperver and the William Sisters,

264
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,340
 and they're all big grunters. And he says that actually he doesn't tell them to do that. It just

265
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,900
 hell happens to be the case that they do. But then other people think that he's telling them to do it

266
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,060
 because it stops you from being able to hear the sound the ball makes on the racket. And that

267
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,140
 might be able to give you some clue as to what spin might be on it or whatever. There was a study

268
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,180
 that did show that grunting makes people respond more slowly in tennis. And so it is number advantage.

269
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,620
 I saw yesterday morning on the BBC, there was a little piece with David Attenborough,

270
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,580
 which was really exciting because he's very much involved with Wimbledon in a large way. So

271
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,020
 Attenborough is the one who turned it into color television. And there were interesting things that

272
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,980
 happened with that. One is that's when they started using yellow tennis balls. Up until then,

273
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,820
 they used white tennis balls. And the reason they started doing that is obviously color television.

274
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,060
 It was much more visual for people to see as it was going on. And there was this other thing. I hadn't

275
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,740
 been able to find it online. But it was said in this piece, which is that the trophy that they

276
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,780
 now use is not the original Wimbledon trophy. It's a different trophy because the original one

277
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,420
 just didn't look that good on camera. It was actually black and white. It was a black and white trophy.

278
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,180
 Yeah, no, they started using this different trophy, which is gold. And so it's more

279
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,780
 photogenic. It's more photogenic. Yeah, exactly. We'll get rid of that old colon chalk

280
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,940
 trophy that we've been using in a great life. They also used tennis courts used to be hourglass

281
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,980
 shapes, didn't they? Until Wimbledon came along. I mean, really, really early tennis courts.

282
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,740
 Yeah, until until Wimbledon was established. I think the first Wimbledon was in 1877.

283
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,420
 That was when they decided to make the rectangular. But before that, they used to go in at the net.

284
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,740
 So they were like it is Wimbledon, kind of the originator of all these grand slimes.

285
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,940
 Is it the original grand slam? I think it was first. Yeah, it must be.

286
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,820
 Because before that, it was just croquet. It really beat out croquet. It's a bit sad we could all,

287
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,940
 so the reason croquet disappeared was that they thought, let's start playing tennis on these

288
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,220
 croquet lawns a bit. And then everyone went, oh, this is a better sport, isn't it?

289
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,500
 Of course. So the fact that croquet is a pretty shit spot. The world war penalty.

290
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,700
 The world war penalty. The world war penalty. The language. One more you're out there.

291
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,380
 I think croquet is a great sport. You can be really devious. Oh, yeah. Not great.

292
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,780
 I think you see the true side of human nature when you play croquet. Where do you guys learn about football?

293
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:02,180
 The Uber CEO, as in Uber's CEO. Not the chief of all the CEO.

294
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,140
 It's not the chief of all CEOs. He's been involved in what people are calling a tennis scandal.

295
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,740
 Is he the current one or the one that he's just left? This is Travis Kalinick.

296
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,220
 Oh, yeah. He's the one who just left. His biography on the website amongst many other things

297
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,540
 of what he's done in the past also claims that he managed to rack up the second highest

298
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,060
 Wii tennis score in the world. People are now claiming that they think that that's not possible.

299
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,660
 Yeah, I think it's not. Yeah, largely because there is no game called Wii tennis.

300
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,260
 You've got Wii Sports in which it's a game within it, but that doesn't have a leaderboard.

301
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:39,140
 So it can't be that. There's another game which is called Wii Grand Slam tennis.

302
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:50,180
 And there's a third one which is called Wii in your tennis ball container.

303
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,420
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is a Chazinski.

304
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,060
 My fact this week is that in Mexico, artists can pay their taxes in artwork.

305
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,660
 It's amazing. It's so weird. It's the only country where you could do this, unsurprisingly.

306
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,780
 And yeah, it's this rule that's actually existed since I think it's 1957 that it was first suggested.

307
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,900
 And it's the idea that artists, if they can't pay their taxes or don't want to,

308
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,580
 they instead donate a work of art as a portion of their sales.

309
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,940
 And so it's not even done on monetary value. The way it's done is that for every five pieces of art

310
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,660
 you sell, you pay an additional one to the government. So if you sell up to five pieces of art,

311
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,580
 you pay one. And then if you sell more, it becomes like a progressive taxation system.

312
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,020
 And the maximum number you have to give to the government any year is five works of art.

313
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,620
 That's interesting. I wonder, so let's say you sell four incredible massive works of art and then

314
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,100
 you just do one doodle on an applicant. Does that count? Yeah, that's great question.

315
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,460
 I don't think it does count because apparently there is a committee to make sure that people don't

316
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,420
 take the piss. So it's basically you have to give them an average one which means you're paying 20%

317
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,980
 I guess, right? Yeah, well, they're not clear. I think it's a little bit more touchy

318
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,580
 feeling than that. So yeah, there's this jury, which is ten other artists who judge the quality of

319
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,540
 the painting and decide whether it's for an artist. That's got to be hard. This one's a bit dodgy.

320
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,300
 Some of them rejected in the last few years. There were some famous artists who had their paintings

321
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,540
 rejected as taxes, which is pretty hard. But yeah, and then they go, okay, we'll accept this one as

322
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:32,420
 tax show. So in South Carolina, you can donate a deer carcass and get tax credit for it.

323
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:39,140
 There's a venison for charity tax credit and so you don't pay tax on $50 if you donate a dead deer

324
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,780
 to the government. What's it? Is there a box when you're doing your tax form? Just the number is the

325
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,060
 amount of dead deer you've got in your garage waiting to be submitted? So hang on, so presumably hunting

326
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:57,700
 is allowed. Is it not that you find a deer that's died of natural causes? I guess they'd have to accept

327
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,500
 that as well. I don't think they specify cause of death. Okay, they're not going to have a mortician

328
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,780
 for every single carcass that comes in, are they? That would probably cost more than the $50 you're

329
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,660
 saving on the tax. But you would hope that they test the quality of the venison because you don't

330
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,660
 want some old bit of rotting road-killed being sent to the charity. There's a committee of ten

331
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:26,180
 chefs. The World Bank and Pricewaterhouse Cooper came up with a check for who has the most complicated

332
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:32,740
 tax code in the world and the way they did that is they imagined a hypothetical ceramic flower pot

333
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,980
 manufacturer and this manufacturer has one building, two plots of land, one truck and 60 employees

334
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,980
 and they work out how difficult it would be for that person to do their taxes, okay? If you were in

335
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:51,700
 the Maldives, it would take you less than an hour to comply with the Maldives tax code and in Brazil

336
00:20:51,700 --> 00:21:01,540
 it would take 2,600 hours. What to do it? Which is 108 days of non-stop work? No. Yeah. That is insane.

337
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:08,020
 Yeah. They just got an incredibly complicated tax code. Is there much tax avoidance in Brazil?

338
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,620
 Cause I imagine that would surely encourage people to avoid tax. Well, that's the argument, isn't it,

339
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,380
 that why you should simplify your tax code in every country? Because in America, in 1913,

340
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:25,940
 their tax code was 400 pages and now it's 70,000 pages, which is about 280 times longer than the

341
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:33,780
 tennis law book. All right. But in India at the moment, for instance, they've massively

342
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,460
 simplified their tax, a thing called GST where there's just four basic rates now, whereas in the past,

343
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,940
 all the different areas and villages with all of their different tax codes and they simplified it.

344
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,580
 That's what we have in Australia, GST. Yeah. Good and standard tax. Exactly. And this is the

345
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,940
 biggest place that has ever done it. So in India, there's two trillion dollar economy with 1.3 billion

346
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,980
 consumers, but it's so important to them that this has happened only in the last week or so. There

347
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:09,780
 was a baby named GST. That's great. In Australia, apparently, there's a queen B tax.

348
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,900
 If you only queen B's pay. That's right. No, if you sell a queen B for over $20, you have to pay

349
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,540
 10% to the government. Who's selling a queen B for $20? That's over. It feels like a lot for a B.

350
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:31,780
 A queen B? A queen B? An individual B. Yes, that's a lot for a B. No, don't, that's so small.

351
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,300
 They produce a whole hive. I mean, diamond rings are quite small, aren't they?

352
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,780
 Well, how much do you think I spent on my wife's engagement? That's why it's a hula hoop.

353
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,820
 I think that is a lot. Are you joking? They can yield so much, because they're so important. They'll

354
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,420
 yield so much. Honey, you'd make such a profit out of $20. I think the normal price will be

355
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,980
 hundreds of dollars for a queen B. That's what I paid for my last queen B, and I just don't want you

356
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,540
 to be insinuating. I was taken for a fool. I don't know. Is a queen B pregnant at the time?

357
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,100
 I think you might need a drone or something. Yes, so then how much do you pay for that one?

358
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,540
 I think they're cheap. They're super cheap. Remember, you could rent one? We did that years

359
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,340
 ago. That was one of our first facts on the show. But that's what I mean, because to rent a B

360
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,420
 is like one cent per hour per B or something stupid like that. So the queen B is comparatively

361
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:26,260
 a lot more than that. And at the end of the day, they're all still B's. But if you leave a queen B

362
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,900
 somewhere, it'll attract a load of other B's. Oh, that's why I just find them. That's why B's keep on,

363
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,300
 you see a car covered in B's somewhere. That's because there's a queen B under the box. So really,

364
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,660
 what you're doing is you're paying for the queen B, but actually you're getting hundreds of

365
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,020
 thousands of other B's. It's like a sky TV deal, I imagine. Where you pay for sky would actually get loads of

366
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:51,380
 channels. Right. Except every channel is a B. And sky one is the queen B, is it? Yeah, that's right.

367
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,740
 It seems expensive. You think you just find sky one. But you're actually getting like to sky

368
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,500
 it. I do understand that now. Glad to put it into terms. You could understand.

369
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,780
 Did you finish your story or did we cut you off at Queen B? I think we extended it far beyond.

370
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:18,740
 Okay. The IRS in America, one of the things that's tax deductible for them is ransom for kidnapped

371
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:27,780
 loved ones. If you pay to have your loved one returned, yeah, that's tax deductible. It's an

372
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,940
 expense. So that's not true in Britain, because in Britain, it's counted as a bribe. And

373
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,180
 the bribes are illegal. And you're not allowed to claim them back anything illegal, but in America,

374
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:44,140
 you can. And was it John Paul Getty? Yes, the third. Yeah, who's one of his family were kidnapped.

375
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,580
 And they ran to him for X amount. And he said he'd only pay Y amount. And that was the maximum

376
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,500
 expense that he was allowed to claim or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So John Paul Getty, the third

377
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,860
 was kidnapped. And it was his father who said he would pay the ransom, but only up to 2.2 million.

378
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,140
 Because then that's the maximum that was allowed for tax deduction. I'm sure. Did he still

379
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,980
 understand that he couldn't go above that otherwise? It would be tax. I think he would have,

380
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,820
 because I think he would have been brought up in the way that his dad conducted business,

381
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,700
 a red that Warren Buffett submitted his first tax return when he was doing newspaper and milk

382
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,780
 rounds. So like, you know, I think this guy would have been in a similar like, oh, that makes

383
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:27,740
 sense, dad, yeah. I like the excuse of something my dad told me. So Ken Dodd was accused of not

384
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,620
 paying taxes for a while. He was accused by the inland revenue. And I feel like you, when you made

385
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,420
 that face, we're doing an impression of Ken Dodd. I'm really sorry if that's not what you're trying

386
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,380
 to do. I wasn't. I once met Ken Dodd. Yeah, he was a museum, wasn't he? And he said to me, do I know

387
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,660
 you? And I said, I don't think so. And he said, yeah, yeah, I know you. We were on the same

388
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:51,820
 police line up together, weren't we? Funny guy. Yeah, he is funny. So apparently he, the inland

389
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,940
 revenue said, you haven't been paying us for years. And he said, I didn't think it applied to me.

390
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:07,500
 I live by the seaside. Did he? No, no, no, Dodd. Oh, yeah. It's a joke, Andy. I would, I don't know. Sorry.

391
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,500
 In 2015, one person living on a street in Hull complained that they were paying more

392
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,620
 council tax than all of their neighbours. They went to the council and the council upto all of their

393
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:33,100
 neighbours' council tax. Turn on, they made their life a lot worse. Okay, it is time for fact number

394
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,420
 three. And that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the size of a rainbow can tell you how

395
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:47,420
 polluted the air is. That's so, so is the rainbow more of a prominent feature in a more polluted area?

396
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,220
 It's, it's not really easy for us to see, but if you're a scientist, you have the right equipment. You

397
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,700
 can see very small changes. So if there are chemicals like acid rain, it would change the size of

398
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,660
 the droplets, which would change the size of the bow. And so they look at that and they can tell

399
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,300
 exactly what chemicals are in the air. Wow. Do you know like double rainbows? Yeah. Actually,

400
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,380
 this isn't double rainbows, twin rainbows, which is slightly different thing. You can have two

401
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,900
 rain showers that are kind of near each other, one with small raindrops and one with fat raindrops.

402
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,620
 And they will give you two different rainbows and they'll start in the same bottom left hand corner

403
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,300
 or bottom right hand corner and they'll come round and one will be higher than the other.

404
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,780
 That's called a twin rainbow. I've seen what it goes before. Have you? Yeah. They're quite rare.

405
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,500
 Yeah, I mean, it was, I saw it once and that's it. Yeah. Great. Where did you sit?

406
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,100
 I think it was in Austria at the time. Really? Yeah. I really like James' turn when he went,

407
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,540
 they're quite rare. Like, I think you probably just saw a double rainbow down.

408
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,660
 Because yeah, that's unbelievable. So it looks like it's sprouting from the same origin,

409
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,900
 but then it sprouts into two different rainbows. No, I wasn't listening. I've seen

410
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:04,220
 it really big rainbows, what I was saying. I can't tell if you've done what you're joking now.

411
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,980
 So you can get a quadruple rainbow. Wow. Okay. There was a photograph online of a quadruple rainbow.

412
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,820
 It wasn't really a quadruple rainbow. It was just four rainbows. You can see why they mistook that.

413
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,780
 Yeah, you can see it, but it was, it was a rookie era. A photograph of a quadruple rainbow

414
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,620
 just looks like two rainbows. And the reason is that you've got two in front of you. Say the sun is

415
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,340
 behind you. You've got two rainbows in front of you and then they reflect backwards. And so the other

416
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,620
 two are behind you. So it's impossible to take a photo of them, of all four of them at the same time,

417
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,540
 unless you do like a panoramic picture. And they're extremely, extremely, extremely rare. So you

418
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:48,300
 probably only see a few of those. I think six of them. And no more. I think there's only one photograph

419
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,660
 of them ever. Right. And it's only two of them. It's not of the other two. Okay. Why? Because the camera

420
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,900
 couldn't get them in. Because two in front of you and two are always behind you. If you've been listening

421
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,940
 to any of them, it's literally just explaining that. Do you know you can get white rainbows? So this

422
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,340
 This is... - That's a cloud mate, that you saw in clouds.

423
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,380
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

424
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,140
 These are the big and fluffy and they float in the sky.

425
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,100
 (laughter)

426
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,980
 No, these are light rainbows.

427
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,300
 They get called fogbows.

428
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,340
 Okay, so if you've got fog in the air, that's where the water droplets hang in the air.

429
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,620
 They're incredibly microscopic, they're tiny.

430
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,820
 So you do get the rainbow effect, but they're so small that they don't actually show color.

431
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,180
 - Yeah. - They are stunning.

432
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,460
 You can get all red rainbows as well, just a single red.

433
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,780
 - Terrifying. - I know, that's cool.

434
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,820
 And a lot shorter song as well.

435
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,500
 (laughter)

436
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,260
 - Yeah, there's sort of evening time, aren't they?

437
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,220
 So it depends where the sun is in the sky or the kind of color of your rainbow.

438
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,940
 They gradually start to lose their colors one by one, don't they?

439
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,260
 The shorter wavelengths die first.

440
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,220
 - I always ask. - That's a good title for something.

441
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,620
 (laughter)

442
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,460
 Like a murder set at a radio station at Murder Mystery.

443
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,780
 The shorter wavelengths die first, yeah?

444
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,380
 In Norway where they've just turned off their FM.

445
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,580
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

446
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,620
 - So it's a Scandi Noir drama.

447
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,540
 - But it's kind of also about the progress of technology and leaving behind.

448
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,820
 - It's got lots of layers. - Like a rainbow.

449
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,100
 (laughter)

450
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:20,660
 - Just on the red rainbow, there's actually a physicist who in his lab has been creating

451
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,940
 red rainbows as well, using lasers.

452
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,060
 He's a physicist at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium.

453
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,180
 And he shoots a laser into a droplet.

454
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,180
 And so he gets these tiny rainbows that are all red.

455
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,140
 And he says that the form of the rainbow, under those kind of controlled conditions, you

456
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,520
 can precisely determine what shape it's going to be, what size it's going to be, what the

457
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,660
 composition and temperature of it is, purely by looking at the droplet before it's sprayed

458
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,660
 out. How cool is that?

459
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,860
 - I would say that's like a really small version of this thing, which is that the size of

460
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:59,300
 the droplets and what the composed of depends on what the rainbow looks like on a bigger scale

461
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,780
 as well. That's how you can tell all the pollution and stuff.

462
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
 - Right, okay.

463
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,300
 - So he says just to put it into super cool door key words for this particular small one

464
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:14,140
 that he doesn't allow. Every single droplet has its own unique rainbow fingerprint already

465
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
 in it.

466
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
 - So cool.

467
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,860
 - Do you guys like rainbows?

468
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
 (laughter)

469
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
 - Quick question.

470
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
 - Yeah.

471
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,260
 - And I'm more for them than against them, yeah.

472
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
 - That's two yeses.

473
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
 - I'm a huge yeses.

474
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,780
 - Okay, three. Well, not everyone likes rainbows.

475
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
 (laughter)

476
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:37,940
 So this is something from Amazonian cultures and rainbows there, very bad luck, as in they

477
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,340
 are associated with skin problems, with having miscarriages, if you're pregnant.

478
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,340
 - How could this, doesn't make any sense there, so clearly such a positive, happy, I don't

479
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
 know.

480
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,780
 - I think it's one of those glass half empty things because it's caused by sunshine and rain.

481
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,460
 Now, if it's always sunny and then you get some rain, then it could be a bad thing.

482
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,980
 But if it's always rainy, like it is in Britain, then the fact that there's a rainbow means

483
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,300
 at least there's some sun around.

484
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
 - Okay.

485
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:09,340
 - This is from Wikipedia, I should say, so, but there is a saying, rainbows are shit.

486
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
 - That's right.

487
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,340
 (laughter)

488
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,340
 - I'm such a translate.

489
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:19,260
 - There are diseases in one Peruvian language called Iona achata, which means the rainbow hurt

490
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
 my skin.

491
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
 - What?

492
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
 - What do you might say to the doctor?

493
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,700
 And it's traditional to close your mouth at a rainbow, otherwise you'll catch a disease.

494
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
 - Oh wow.

495
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
 - Yeah.

496
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,180
 So I'm just saying, they're not all good.

497
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,540
 - So the Skittles' adverts, over there, was not gone down there at all, were they?

498
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,940
 - Do not taste the rainbow.

499
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
 (laughter)

500
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:42,340
 - So the rainbow flag for pride has all the rainbow colors and it used to have a

501
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,540
 shocking pink band.

502
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:51,500
 And the reason they did away with that is because they couldn't mass-produce the pink cloth.

503
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 All the others were easy to make, but this was a cloth that wasn't very easy to make, because

504
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,700
 the first guy who did it, he kind of made it himself just a one-off.

505
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,220
 He didn't think of it being a mass-produced thing, and then it became really popular, and

506
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,260
 they needed to make loads of them, but they couldn't get the pink.

507
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,100
 - It was after the Stonewall riots, wasn't it, that suddenly in the late 70s, suddenly

508
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,900
 there was this massive demand for these flags, and they couldn't get it.

509
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,820
 - Then it had, so how many colors do you think are in the flag now?

510
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,420
 - I think seven.

511
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,900
 - Um, six.

512
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,340
 - Did you just sing the rainbow song and still come up with six?

513
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
 - I took out one.

514
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
 - I took out one.

515
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
 - Did you?

516
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
 Why, any reason?

517
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,980
 - I put white in to, since I've learned about some new rainbow.

518
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,980
 - You should have come up with eight then.

519
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
 (laughter)

520
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,780
 - I didn't sing the full song, I kind of backed out and thought, "I feel like there's only

521
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
 a few left."

522
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,980
 - I think we need to hang on down, I think we need to test something quickly.

523
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,380
 What are the colors in a rainbow?

524
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
 - Oh no.

525
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
 (laughter)

526
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,900
 - Red, and yellow, and pink.

527
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
 - No.

528
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
 - Red.

529
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
 - Well, actually, all the colors are in the rainbow.

530
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
 - All the colors are.

531
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,900
 - No, no, hang on, hang on, hang on, who's pink, isn't it?

532
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
 - No, there's no pink.

533
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
 - No.

534
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
 - Red and yellow.

535
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
 - Red and yellow.

536
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
 Green.

537
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
 - Wait, what's the song?

538
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
 - The song is not the actual colors of the rainbow.

539
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,900
 That's just a fun song you learned.

540
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
 - Hang on, what's I singing the right lyrics, sir?

541
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,900
 - You were singing the right lyrics.

542
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
 - Okay, all right.

543
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
 - Green.

544
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,340
 - That's the full, but the colors in the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

545
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,520
 That's the colors that you learn, also, actually, you know, it's just emerging from the

546
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
 landscape.

547
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
 - I like the jump ship to the end of the track.

548
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
 That is correct.

549
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,820
 I too was fooled by the song.

550
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
 (laughter)

551
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,820
 - What a lie of a song.

552
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,820
 - Yeah.

553
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,660
 - Just take something of things people need to remember in day-to-day life.

554
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,660
 It's like having a song, January, and February, and orange.

555
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
 (laughter)

556
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
 - Yeah.

557
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:36,180
 - It is me that I can understand why you thought that it went red, orange, whatever the song

558
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
 goes.

559
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
 - So what is it?

560
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,580
 - So it's seven colors in the rainbow, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

561
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,580
 And the pride flag used to have, as we've said, it used to have eight, because it had these

562
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,900
 and the hot pink.

563
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,580
 And then it went down to seven, but then it only has six colors in it now, which I'd never

564
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,580
 notice.

565
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,420
 - Do you think that maybe it wasn't that the material was too expensive?

566
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,220
 It's that the creator of the flag also was basing it off the song, and then someone said,

567
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
 "What's pink doing there?"

568
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,220
 And he thought, "Oh, yeah, we can't stay anyway, it's so expensive."

569
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,700
 - So no, it wasn't because of that.

570
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,860
 He knew the colors of the rainbow, this guy.

571
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,620
 The reason they lost the next color was because when the flag was round around poles, then

572
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,220
 one color would get lost, because it would be round around the pole.

573
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,580
 So they needed an even number of colors, basically, because otherwise--

574
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,900
 - It wasn't a vertical stripe, wasn't it?

575
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
 It wasn't a vertical--

576
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,100
 - It must be a horizontal polynomial.

577
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,140
 - What it said was one hung vertically from the lamppost of San Francisco's market street,

578
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
 the center stripe.

579
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,100
 So if it was hung vertically, the center stripe went around the pole.

580
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:41,580
 And so they decided they needed an even number so that that middle stripe wasn't kind of,

581
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
 I don't know, didn't disappear into the pole.

582
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
 - Yeah.

583
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
 - That's why I did it.

584
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,900
 - And Philadelphia, this year, has added a couple of extra colors to their flag that they

585
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,820
 had been using as a not-a-racial diversity.

586
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
 - Okay, cool.

587
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,220
 - Yeah, so they've gone up to eight, I think, again.

588
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,220
 - Oh, really?

589
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
 - Yeah.

590
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
 - So they've added brown and black.

591
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
 - They stand for--

592
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,020
 - The other colors stand for really fun stuff, don't they?

593
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
 - Yeah.

594
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,820
 - But it's such a shame they lost the pink, because so the person who designed it said that

595
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,980
 the hot pink stood for sex.

596
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,860
 So the other stand for life, healing, sunlight, nature, magic, serenity, and spirit.

597
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,860
 But they've lost the sex now.

598
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,660
 - They should have got rid of the magic one.

599
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,460
 - Why is magic even in there?

600
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,460
 - I'm glad that stayed.

601
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,460
 - Oh, god.

602
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,780
 - And the other thing is that we were saying about the being seven colors in the rainbow.

603
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,660
 I think that was Newton who decided that, wasn't it?

604
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,540
 And the reason being, we think probably just because seven was like a magical number, it

605
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,700
 was like the seven C's, the seven, you know?

606
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
 - It's his favorite number.

607
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
 - Yeah, it's his favorite number.

608
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,700
 - It's just a good number.

609
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,340
 And so he kind of looked and decided there were seven distinct bands.

610
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,420
 And actually, if you look at a rainbow, you can decide really yourself how many bands

611
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,420
 there are.

612
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,420
 There's pretty much an infinite number.

613
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,380
 - Although, I always, because I think we've done that on QI, and so I always look at

614
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,820
 rainbows and think, okay, get beyond the seven thing, Newton just made it up.

615
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,820
 But I still only ever see seven colors.

616
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,140
 I can't see more or less.

617
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,140
 - Really?

618
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
 - Yeah.

619
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,140
 - He passed away this year.

620
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,140
 - Newton.

621
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
 - Yeah, started a break at sea.

622
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,140
 - Yeah.

623
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
 - He had a good innings.

624
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,860
 - Gilbert Baker, who is the creator of the rainbow flag, passed away this year, sadly.

625
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,460
 - Oh, Newton as well, and the savior.

626
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,460
 - That's been a big--

627
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
 - 2017.

628
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:26,060
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

629
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:31,980
 My fact this week is that a new study has revealed that the genre of music, with the most references

630
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,580
 to drugs, is country music.

631
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:43,980
 Country music has, according to the survey, 1.6 mentions per song on average of drug usage,

632
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,880
 and they did a list of genres, which used most drug references, so it started with country

633
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,620
 music, then jazz, then pop, electronic, rock, folk, and in at last, rap.

634
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
 - You missed out other.

635
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,620
 - Yeah, I know.

636
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,620
 I wasn't...

637
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,460
 Is that my favorite genre?

638
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
 - Other who's...

639
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,820
 Yeah, other who's just underneath rock, but above folk.

640
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
 - Wow.

641
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
 - Yeah.

642
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,820
 - I thought country was folk, so I'm on a learning curve today.

643
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,820
 - Yeah.

644
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,100
 That is unbelievable, though.

645
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,580
 I think that's really amazing, that rap has the fewest references.

646
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
 - Yeah.

647
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,660
 I think some people have looked at the methodology of this and aren't sure how it's ended up right.

648
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,420
 - We were talking about this, weren't we?

649
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,740
 It just seems so unbelievable, though, this is the case.

650
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,420
 - Well, what they did, they took-- didn't they?

651
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,700
 The lyrics of many, many thousands of songs, and they had a list of drug-related words.

652
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,540
 It quite a lot of drug-related words that they plugged in, and then they went through manually,

653
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:37,260
 making sure that, you know, if someone says "refer", they're not actually singing a song

654
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,340
 about the coral reef, the part where the man who works on a coral reef.

655
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
 - Yeah.

656
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,340
 Exactly.

657
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,340
 A lot of rap songs are about people who work on coral reefs, so that's probably why.

658
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
 So, yeah.

659
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,340
 But...

660
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,780
 - I wondered if the methodology went wrong in that they're not cool enough to understand

661
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:58,220
 some of the more modern drug references, because they came up with this list of 65 names

662
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,220
 for drugs.

663
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:04,740
 And so the examples that were in this article were things like Adi, Blow, Molly, Roxy,

664
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:10,860
 and Scissorpe, S-I-D-Z-U-R-P, so if they feature in a song, that's that kind of the drug.

665
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,660
 But maybe Raps just using way more modern cool slang.

666
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,660
 - Oh, boy, why?

667
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
 - That these guys don't know about.

668
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,700
 - As opposed to Scissorpe, the classic 1920 slang for what is Scissorpe?

669
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,340
 - I've never heard Scissorpe before, and you're saying it like it's a hackneyed old term.

670
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
 - No, no, no.

671
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,420
 - Well, it's such a good word to rhyme with, which is why you use something about burping.

672
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
 Then you're going to need a Scissorpe.

673
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
 It's the only thing that rhymes.

674
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
 - Yeah, what is it?

675
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,420
 I don't know what a Scissorpe is.

676
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,820
 I don't think anyone has ever heard of Scissorpe except the person who wrote whatever song refers to it.

677
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:42,620
 And then I'm just saying that they've got this list, but maybe they've missed things out that Raps using.

678
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:48,780
 I think they also used a lot of songs, perhaps you wouldn't hear on normal country music stations.

679
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
 - Yes.

680
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,260
 - And actually the more popular ones probably are about Scissorpe and the other drugs.

681
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,100
 - But they weren't counting, because they had a list of the drugs that they were looking for as well.

682
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:05,060
 And they didn't include alcohol, but I reckon if you throw alcohol in, you know, country music has quite a lot of references to that, doesn't it?

683
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
 - Yeah, tons.

684
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,500
 - So I've just Googled Scissorpe.

685
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
 - Yeah, yeah.

686
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:15,940
 - It is a purple drink, a mix of coding based prescription cough syrup, soda and often jolly ranchers candy.

687
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,580
 - Sounds quite nice, doesn't it?

688
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
 - Yeah.

689
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
 - But don't do it, kids.

690
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,540
 That sounds so country, though.

691
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,740
 - And jolly ranchers candy and then some prescription drugs, classic country music.

692
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:36,340
 - You can't really imagine Snoop Dogg on the Scissorpe, could you, but weirdly that's a word that's closely, I would associate more with Snoop than anywhere else.

693
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
 - Scissorpe on the Scissorpe.

694
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
 - Yeah, exactly.

695
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:45,540
 - It's interesting, I wonder if in other, Reggae's not on this list, blues is not on this list, they've been lumped into other.

696
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
 - So blues would be in jazz?

697
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
 - I guess so, yeah.

698
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
 - Reggae.

699
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,540
 - Classical.

700
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
 - Classical.

701
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
 - Classical in that.

702
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,540
 - Symphony Phops is a Pindi minor.

703
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,540
 - You were saying about the words that they use.

704
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:05,540
 Did you see that America's Drug Enforcement Administration have made a dictionary of slang drug terms this year?

705
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
 I wonder if any of these are in it.

706
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,540
 Whiffle dust, Bernie's flakes.

707
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,540
 I wonder if any of these are in Bernie's.

708
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
 - Is that named after Bernie?

709
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
 - Bernie's.

710
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,540
 - Well, I don't know, it means cocaine.

711
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,540
 - Yeah, that's Bernie's flakes.

712
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,540
 - Is there the people who were going to show up to vote for Bernie Sanders in the American primaries, but they didn't?

713
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,540
 - They were two off their heads.

714
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
 - Ant hazel means heroin.

715
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,540
 - I wonder if that's in any of those songs.

716
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,540
 - Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy means cannabis.

717
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,540
 - Ant hazel.

718
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,540
 - Ant hazel.

719
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,540
 - That explains what my unclean was up to.

720
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,540
 - This has what it's called, Barbara.

721
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,540
 - Every night, you was having a night in without hazel.

722
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
 - Smoochy Wootchy.

723
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,540
 Feels like it would be a good name of a song, maybe you're a vision hit.

724
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,540
 - Yeah.

725
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,540
 - But what if you're just really loved up and you're walking down the street with your partner and you say,

726
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,540
 "I'll give us a Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy" and you're immediately arrested by one of these guys.

727
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:05,540
 - You deserve to be immediately arrested if you'll say to your lover in public, give us a Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy.

728
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,540
 - But I would say that that's probably true of lots of slang terms for drugs, right?

729
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,540
 - Yeah.

730
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,540
 - To a song called "Weed" into a tennis ball can.

731
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:16,540
 - Yes.

732
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
 - Yeah, I might think it's about drugs.

733
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,540
 - That's true.

734
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:25,540
 - Okay, that is it.

735
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,540
 That is all of our facts.

736
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,540
