00:04:08,00:04:11,"""So in normal tennis, that's not the Grand Slam."
00:04:11,00:04:12,They do have the rules.

00:04:16,00:04:20,And then a substitute comes in and they play and they only get money if they win.
00:04:20,00:04:23,"So if they lose, they don't get anything, but if they go through to the second round,"
00:04:23,00:04:24,they do get money.

00:04:47,00:04:48,that.
00:04:48,00:04:52,"But just on the swearing thing quickly, there is another rule which is about visible obscenity,"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"which I had never read before, and so it's this."
00:04:57,00:05:03,"For the purposes of this rule, visible obscenity, stop doing that, James, with your hands, is"
00:05:03,00:05:07,"visible obscenity, is defined as the making of signs by a player with his hands and/or racket"
00:05:07,00:05:10,or balls that commonly happen obscenity.
00:05:10,00:05:14,"And does it define what they mean by balls in that situation?"""
00:05:14,00:05:20,"""There's even a rule on abuse of balls, abuse of balls."
00:05:20,00:05:21,Yeah.
00:05:21,00:05:25,"Players shall not violently, dangerously, or with anger, hit, kick, or throw, a tennis ball."""
00:05:25,00:05:26,Because that happened.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Was that Tim Henman did that once?
00:05:27,00:05:30,"Yes, he's the first player ever to be kicked out of Wimbledon for..."
00:05:30,00:05:31,Was he?
00:05:31,00:05:32,Yeah.
00:05:32,00:05:33,What?
00:05:33,00:05:34,"Yeah, because you..."
00:05:34,00:05:36,"So another thing that swearing does for you is if you don't get a fine, you get a penalty"
00:05:36,00:05:40,"point, and you can be penalized out of a match."
00:05:40,00:05:45,So there's a famous example of a guy called Bryden Klein.
00:05:45,00:05:48,"He was facing a guy called Sam Groth, and during the match he served, and this was in the"
00:05:48,00:05:54,"final game, but he was losing, served it into the net, and just yelled out, ""Stupid, stupid"
00:05:54,00:05:56,"person, talking about himself,"" he claimed."
00:05:56,00:06:00,"But the umpire said, ""I don't know who you directed that at, but that's rude."
00:06:00,00:06:04,"You've been given a penalty point, and because he got one earlier in the match, the match"
00:06:04,00:06:05,was over.
00:06:05,00:06:06,"They didn't even get to finish the match."""
00:06:06,00:06:07,"""Stupid, stupid person."""
00:06:07,00:06:08,"""Stupid, stupid person."""
00:06:08,00:06:10,It's very rude and Latvian.
00:06:10,00:06:14,"The funniest bit about it, though, is that he looked to the other player to say, ""Hey, come"
00:06:14,00:06:15,on.
00:06:15,00:06:16,"Like, bail me out here."""
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Like, that was me."
00:06:17,00:06:21,"The guy said, ""I'd like to help you, but it's too tough to call from here,"" and he pointed"
00:06:21,00:06:25,"to the line's woman, and so the guy, who said, ""Stupid, stupid person,"" said, ""She's"
00:06:25,00:06:29,"a 60-year-old lady wearing Leica, and then he stopped himself,"" because he's like, ""Ooh,"
00:06:29,00:06:32,"I'm about to get another penalty point."""
00:06:32,00:06:33,I read some of the rules.
00:06:33,00:06:36,"This is for normal tennis, which is not Wimbledon."
00:06:36,00:06:38,One of them is quite good.
00:06:38,00:06:43,The event organizer has to announce how many balls they'll have before the event in play
00:06:43,00:06:45,at any time.
00:06:45,00:06:51,"The number of balls to play is either two, three, four, or six."
00:06:51,00:06:52,"""Ooh."""
00:06:52,00:06:54,"""I want to know what happened with five."
00:06:54,00:06:55,"Why not five?"""
00:06:55,00:06:56,"""Oh, yeah."
00:06:56,00:06:57,"Why not five?"""
00:06:57,00:06:58,"""I think we understand that, though."""
00:06:58,00:07:00,"""It's to do with how many you're in a can."
00:07:00,00:07:06,"You wouldn't open a new can for just one ball, I guess, but you wouldn't have seven"
00:07:06,00:07:07,either.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"It feels a bit wrong about it."""
00:07:09,00:07:12,"So you're allowed two or three, but no other prime numbers, is that what you're saying?"
00:07:12,00:07:13,"""Yes, exactly."""
00:07:13,00:07:14,"""Yes, exactly."""
00:07:14,00:07:21,"""I think it might be dance explanation, because you do get cans in three or four portions,"
00:07:21,00:07:26,"but then you wouldn't be able to get one and two either, that doesn't make any sense."""
00:07:26,00:07:28,"Well, one tennis ball can will be a very sorry sight indeed."
00:07:28,00:07:32,"""It's like a tiny pringles."
00:07:32,00:07:39,"Just on balls, I didn't know this, but men and women, tennis, play with different balls."""
00:07:39,00:07:45,"The only reason I read about this was that in March 27th at the Miami Open, Andy Murray,"
00:07:45,00:07:51,"mid-game, complained to the umpire that he was playing with women balls."
00:07:51,00:07:55,"The idea is that the female ball is much quicker, much speedier."
00:07:55,00:07:59,You have so many dominant male servers in the game that it means that they're almost
00:07:59,00:08:04,"unreturnable, so the male tennis ball is a bit more fluffy, which means a bit more drag"
00:08:04,00:08:09,"in the air, which means that it slows the game down, and with the female balls, it just"
00:08:09,00:08:10,has way more speed on it.
00:08:10,00:08:11,"""That is amazing."""
00:08:11,00:08:15,"""That's when I learned it as well when Andy Murray complained about that, and I think the"
00:08:15,00:08:17,whole country went when he did that.
00:08:17,00:08:18,What the hell?
00:08:18,00:08:21,"There are women's balls, and I felt like Andy Murray had leaked something that maybe no"
00:08:21,00:08:22,"one was supposed to know."""
00:08:22,00:08:26,"""Yeah, because I have read an article about the behind the scenes of Wimbledon, basically,"
00:08:26,00:08:33,"and it refers to the guy who's basically the ballmaster, who's a man called Brian, and"
00:08:33,00:08:38,"Wimbledon uses two lorries of balls every year, uses 57,000 balls, and they're all kept"
00:08:38,00:08:45,"at the same temperature in rooms under Centricort, and apparently they're now divided into"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"men's and ladies' balls, and no one mentions them."""
00:08:47,00:08:52,"""But this is why I think the can argument for them being no five ball games can't be"
00:08:52,00:08:57,"right because they've got a lorry load of them, right? It doesn't really matter about having"
00:08:57,00:08:58,"five or six or seven."""
00:08:58,00:09:02,"""Do you think they're just three balls stuffed into a lorry, and they open the lorry and"

00:09:03,00:09:06,"""I think it of it as a world's greatest ball pit."""
00:09:06,00:09:07,"""Yeah, and that is amazing."""
00:09:07,00:09:12,"""The thing is though, the lorry carrying the ladies' balls actually drives a lot faster"
00:09:12,00:09:17,"to get the Wimbledon, because it's got less fluff on the outside of it."""
00:09:17,00:09:21,"""So one thing that they're really strict on at Wimbledon is clothing, and I didn't"
00:09:21,00:09:26,"realise how many players have objected to this in the past. So obviously, at Wimbledon,"
00:09:26,00:09:30,"you have to wear all whites, which isn't the same other grandstands. And on Drey Agassie refused"
00:09:30,00:09:34,"to play at Wimbledon until he was 21, which I know doesn't sound real, but you know, he didn't"
00:09:34,00:09:35,"play the juniors around this."""
00:09:35,00:09:41,"""I too refused to play at Wimbledon until it was 21. I'm still refusing, actually. I want"
00:09:41,00:09:46,"to say change that rule. You're in. But yeah, he refused, and then eventually he's"
00:09:46,00:09:49,"succumbed and said, ""Oh, I'm obviously going to win this a bunch of times, so I'll"
00:09:49,00:09:54,"be back."" But he used to wear denim shorts to play his grandslams, which is an insane thing"
00:09:54,00:10:00,"to wear. There was a woman in Yuzumi Bouchard, who I think still plays, but Yuzumi Bouchard"
00:10:00,00:10:06,"in 2015 got a dress code violation for, there was a black brass strap showing. So there's"
00:10:06,00:10:12,only one centimetre of any other colour allowed at Wimbledon. And she was wearing a white
00:10:12,00:10:16,"sports bra underneath, because the rules say, as you will know, if you've read this document,"
00:10:16,00:10:22,"any undergarments that either are or can be visible during play, brackets including due to"
00:10:22,00:10:27,"perspiration, closed brackets must be completely white. As in, make sure when you wet your white"
00:10:27,00:10:32,"shirt, you can't say a black brand underneath. What if your perspiration gives you miscoloured"
00:10:32,00:10:39,stains? What if you piss yourself off?
00:10:39,00:10:45,"I don't think you will be able to find £20, £4 pissing yourself on centre court."
00:10:45,00:10:48,"Especially as you go to the umpire, I've pissed myself, and they go, ""That's another"
00:10:48,00:10:55,"£20."" Actually, last year there was controversy. There was a Uruguayan player called Pablo"
00:10:55,00:11:02,"Crivas, and he was accused of urinating into a ball can during a match under his towel."
00:11:02,00:11:06,"He was issued with a code violation, although Wimbledon Chiefs did say, and I'm quoting"
00:11:06,00:11:10,"here, ""No urination was involved."" So he just got his willy out?"
00:11:10,00:11:15,And put it in a ball can. You might want to cool it down during a match. That's true. Yeah.
00:11:15,00:11:20,"I was playing tennis the other day, and we lost a crucial point because what ended up"
00:11:20,00:11:25,"happening was my doubles partner hit the ball, didn't quite capture it, and hit it again"
00:11:25,00:11:28,"in the same swing. You're allowed to do that. You're allowed to do that. It turns out,"
00:11:28,00:11:32,"reading this rule book, it says you were allowed to do that. We lost that crucial point."
00:11:32,00:11:36,"In the same swing. It has to be in the same follow through, the same swing. So if you hit it"
00:11:36,00:11:40,"in the ball bounces, obviously, you can't do that. If you hit it away and you chase after"
00:11:40,00:11:45,"it and you get it, but if it's in literally the same motion and you just almost scoop it slightly."
00:11:45,00:11:48,"Like golf, for instance, where if you do a double hit, that counts as a penalty."
00:11:48,00:11:53,"Because surely once you hit it, it's moving away from you faster than the... Depends"
00:11:53,00:12:00,how good you are. Because sometimes your first hit is almost a stopping point for it.
00:12:00,00:12:04,"Well, let's say it hits the rim of the racket, and then it kind of slows down,"
00:12:04,00:12:09,and then you kind of hit it with the strings. So I think that's why it's probably
00:12:09,00:12:13,"existing, because that does often happen. You rim it and then it hits the other bit of your racket,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,and it's a double hit. So I've seen you play ten or something.
00:12:15,00:12:25,"You struggle with single hits. I do. I do. In Wimbledon, not only do they have 230 page rule book"
00:12:25,00:12:32,"for the games, they have a rule book for the queue. Well, there's rules anyway. You get given it"
00:12:32,00:12:37,"in the queue as soon as you join. Because it's a main big thing, isn't it, the queue? People stay"
00:12:37,00:12:45,"there for days. The rules are no barbecues, no gazeboes, no music after 10pm, and any tent can only hold"
00:12:45,00:12:53,"a maximum of two people. Why is that? Or three or four or six, but no, it's to stop having massive"
00:12:53,00:12:57,"tents, because there's only a certain amount of space they want, you know. But couldn't you have a"
00:12:57,00:13:02,"massive tent, but only two of you in it? Well, again, that's the kind of thing that's trying to stop,"
00:13:02,00:13:06,"I think. Oh, I see, yeah. Yeah, I've done the queue, and they try to make it fun. It is, you know,"
00:13:06,00:13:10,"you start queueing it, I think we start queueing it four in the morning, and we manage to get onto"
00:13:10,00:13:15,one of the very outer courts. So I don't think I've ever done anything fun that began at four AM.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"Except for if you've been up until four, right? Oh, yeah. There you go. I've never done that."
00:13:19,00:13:26,"The thing about the grass at Wimbledon, I found out is that obviously they're very, very,"
00:13:26,00:13:30,"I was about to say precious. They're just very precise about the grasses, and it's treated,"
00:13:30,00:13:36,"it's shaved by exactly a millimeter each week for 12 weeks. But the guy who does it, the head"
00:13:36,00:13:46,"groundsman is called Neil Stubbly. So you would have to kneel down to make it Stubbly. Yeah,"
00:13:46,00:13:50,did you see that that study just came out that says you can predict who's going to win a tennis
00:13:50,00:13:55,"match based on the noises they make, and they're grunting. If the noise to the making, oh shit."
00:13:55,00:14:04,It's kind of similar. It's so the analysed a bunch of top tennis players and the pitch of the
00:14:04,00:14:09,"grunts they make and the higher pitch, the grunts go, the more likely it is you'll lose. And in every"
00:14:09,00:14:13,"case, you get higher and higher. You're getting less and less good at tennis. Funny. You don't"
00:14:13,00:14:18,"grunt at all when playing tennis. Neither do I. No, I need the raw viewer elite spots people. I do,"
00:14:18,00:14:25,"I mean, I do sometimes say things like that's another game to you. But a lot of people think"
00:14:25,00:14:29,"that even though it's not against the rules, grunting is against the spirit of the rules. Yeah,"
00:14:29,00:14:33,because it basically gives you a non-fair advantage according to some people over the opposition.
00:14:33,00:14:38,"It does. Wasn't there a specific coach who's like known as the grunt coach? Yeah, he's called Nick"
00:14:38,00:14:45,"Bollettieri. Right. And he looks after sellers, Agassi and Schrapperver and the William Sisters,"
00:14:45,00:14:50,and they're all big grunters. And he says that actually he doesn't tell them to do that. It just
00:14:50,00:14:54,hell happens to be the case that they do. But then other people think that he's telling them to do it
00:14:54,00:14:59,because it stops you from being able to hear the sound the ball makes on the racket. And that
00:14:59,00:15:03,might be able to give you some clue as to what spin might be on it or whatever. There was a study
00:15:03,00:15:08,that did show that grunting makes people respond more slowly in tennis. And so it is number advantage.
00:15:08,00:15:13,"I saw yesterday morning on the BBC, there was a little piece with David Attenborough,"
00:15:13,00:15:18,which was really exciting because he's very much involved with Wimbledon in a large way. So
00:15:18,00:15:24,Attenborough is the one who turned it into color television. And there were interesting things that
00:15:24,00:15:28,"happened with that. One is that's when they started using yellow tennis balls. Up until then,"
00:15:28,00:15:32,they used white tennis balls. And the reason they started doing that is obviously color television.
00:15:32,00:15:37,It was much more visual for people to see as it was going on. And there was this other thing. I hadn't
00:15:37,00:15:40,"been able to find it online. But it was said in this piece, which is that the trophy that they"
00:15:40,00:15:45,now use is not the original Wimbledon trophy. It's a different trophy because the original one
00:15:45,00:15:50,just didn't look that good on camera. It was actually black and white. It was a black and white trophy.
00:15:50,00:15:54,"Yeah, no, they started using this different trophy, which is gold. And so it's more"
00:15:54,00:15:57,"photogenic. It's more photogenic. Yeah, exactly. We'll get rid of that old colon chalk"
00:15:57,00:16:03,trophy that we've been using in a great life. They also used tennis courts used to be hourglass
00:16:03,00:16:08,"shapes, didn't they? Until Wimbledon came along. I mean, really, really early tennis courts."
00:16:08,00:16:14,"Yeah, until until Wimbledon was established. I think the first Wimbledon was in 1877."
00:16:14,00:16:18,"That was when they decided to make the rectangular. But before that, they used to go in at the net."
00:16:18,00:16:22,"So they were like it is Wimbledon, kind of the originator of all these grand slimes."
00:16:22,00:16:25,"Is it the original grand slam? I think it was first. Yeah, it must be."
00:16:25,00:16:30,"Because before that, it was just croquet. It really beat out croquet. It's a bit sad we could all,"
00:16:30,00:16:33,"so the reason croquet disappeared was that they thought, let's start playing tennis on these"
00:16:33,00:16:37,"croquet lawns a bit. And then everyone went, oh, this is a better sport, isn't it?"
00:16:37,00:16:42,Of course. So the fact that croquet is a pretty shit spot. The world war penalty.
00:16:42,00:16:45,The world war penalty. The world war penalty. The language. One more you're out there.
00:16:45,00:16:49,"I think croquet is a great sport. You can be really devious. Oh, yeah. Not great."
00:16:49,00:16:53,I think you see the true side of human nature when you play croquet. Where do you guys learn about football?
00:16:53,00:17:02,"The Uber CEO, as in Uber's CEO. Not the chief of all the CEO."
00:17:02,00:17:07,It's not the chief of all CEOs. He's been involved in what people are calling a tennis scandal.
00:17:07,00:17:10,Is he the current one or the one that he's just left? This is Travis Kalinick.
00:17:10,00:17:15,"Oh, yeah. He's the one who just left. His biography on the website amongst many other things"
00:17:15,00:17:19,of what he's done in the past also claims that he managed to rack up the second highest
00:17:19,00:17:25,Wii tennis score in the world. People are now claiming that they think that that's not possible.
00:17:25,00:17:28,"Yeah, I think it's not. Yeah, largely because there is no game called Wii tennis."
00:17:28,00:17:32,"You've got Wii Sports in which it's a game within it, but that doesn't have a leaderboard."
00:17:32,00:17:39,So it can't be that. There's another game which is called Wii Grand Slam tennis.
00:17:39,00:17:50,And there's a third one which is called Wii in your tennis ball container.
00:17:50,00:17:54,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is a Chazinski."
00:17:54,00:17:59,"My fact this week is that in Mexico, artists can pay their taxes in artwork."
00:17:59,00:18:04,"It's amazing. It's so weird. It's the only country where you could do this, unsurprisingly."
00:18:05,00:18:11,"And yeah, it's this rule that's actually existed since I think it's 1957 that it was first suggested."
00:18:11,00:18:16,"And it's the idea that artists, if they can't pay their taxes or don't want to,"
00:18:16,00:18:20,they instead donate a work of art as a portion of their sales.
00:18:20,00:18:25,And so it's not even done on monetary value. The way it's done is that for every five pieces of art
00:18:25,00:18:30,"you sell, you pay an additional one to the government. So if you sell up to five pieces of art,"
00:18:30,00:18:34,"you pay one. And then if you sell more, it becomes like a progressive taxation system."
00:18:34,00:18:38,And the maximum number you have to give to the government any year is five works of art.
00:18:38,00:18:43,"That's interesting. I wonder, so let's say you sell four incredible massive works of art and then"
00:18:43,00:18:48,"you just do one doodle on an applicant. Does that count? Yeah, that's great question."
00:18:48,00:18:51,I don't think it does count because apparently there is a committee to make sure that people don't
00:18:51,00:18:56,take the piss. So it's basically you have to give them an average one which means you're paying 20%
00:18:56,00:19:00,"I guess, right? Yeah, well, they're not clear. I think it's a little bit more touchy"
00:19:00,00:19:06,"feeling than that. So yeah, there's this jury, which is ten other artists who judge the quality of"
00:19:06,00:19:13,the painting and decide whether it's for an artist. That's got to be hard. This one's a bit dodgy.
00:19:13,00:19:19,Some of them rejected in the last few years. There were some famous artists who had their paintings
00:19:19,00:19:25,"rejected as taxes, which is pretty hard. But yeah, and then they go, okay, we'll accept this one as"
00:19:25,00:19:32,"tax show. So in South Carolina, you can donate a deer carcass and get tax credit for it."
00:19:32,00:19:39,There's a venison for charity tax credit and so you don't pay tax on $50 if you donate a dead deer
00:19:39,00:19:45,to the government. What's it? Is there a box when you're doing your tax form? Just the number is the
00:19:45,00:19:51,"amount of dead deer you've got in your garage waiting to be submitted? So hang on, so presumably hunting"
00:19:51,00:19:57,is allowed. Is it not that you find a deer that's died of natural causes? I guess they'd have to accept
00:19:57,00:20:02,"that as well. I don't think they specify cause of death. Okay, they're not going to have a mortician"
00:20:02,00:20:07,"for every single carcass that comes in, are they? That would probably cost more than the $50 you're"
00:20:07,00:20:12,saving on the tax. But you would hope that they test the quality of the venison because you don't
00:20:12,00:20:16,want some old bit of rotting road-killed being sent to the charity. There's a committee of ten
00:20:16,00:20:26,chefs. The World Bank and Pricewaterhouse Cooper came up with a check for who has the most complicated
00:20:26,00:20:32,tax code in the world and the way they did that is they imagined a hypothetical ceramic flower pot
00:20:32,00:20:38,"manufacturer and this manufacturer has one building, two plots of land, one truck and 60 employees"
00:20:38,00:20:44,"and they work out how difficult it would be for that person to do their taxes, okay? If you were in"
00:20:44,00:20:51,"the Maldives, it would take you less than an hour to comply with the Maldives tax code and in Brazil"
00:20:51,00:21:01,"it would take 2,600 hours. What to do it? Which is 108 days of non-stop work? No. Yeah. That is insane."
00:21:01,00:21:08,Yeah. They just got an incredibly complicated tax code. Is there much tax avoidance in Brazil?
00:21:08,00:21:11,"Cause I imagine that would surely encourage people to avoid tax. Well, that's the argument, isn't it,"
00:21:11,00:21:17,"that why you should simplify your tax code in every country? Because in America, in 1913,"
00:21:17,00:21:25,"their tax code was 400 pages and now it's 70,000 pages, which is about 280 times longer than the"
00:21:25,00:21:33,"tennis law book. All right. But in India at the moment, for instance, they've massively"
00:21:34,00:21:41,"simplified their tax, a thing called GST where there's just four basic rates now, whereas in the past,"
00:21:41,00:21:45,all the different areas and villages with all of their different tax codes and they simplified it.
00:21:45,00:21:50,"That's what we have in Australia, GST. Yeah. Good and standard tax. Exactly. And this is the"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"biggest place that has ever done it. So in India, there's two trillion dollar economy with 1.3 billion"
00:21:55,00:22:00,"consumers, but it's so important to them that this has happened only in the last week or so. There"
00:22:00,00:22:09,"was a baby named GST. That's great. In Australia, apparently, there's a queen B tax."
00:22:09,00:22:16,"If you only queen B's pay. That's right. No, if you sell a queen B for over $20, you have to pay"
00:22:16,00:22:23,10% to the government. Who's selling a queen B for $20? That's over. It feels like a lot for a B.
00:22:23,00:22:31,"A queen B? A queen B? An individual B. Yes, that's a lot for a B. No, don't, that's so small."
00:22:31,00:22:35,"They produce a whole hive. I mean, diamond rings are quite small, aren't they?"
00:22:35,00:22:39,"Well, how much do you think I spent on my wife's engagement? That's why it's a hula hoop."
00:22:39,00:22:44,"I think that is a lot. Are you joking? They can yield so much, because they're so important. They'll"
00:22:44,00:22:48,"yield so much. Honey, you'd make such a profit out of $20. I think the normal price will be"
00:22:48,00:22:52,"hundreds of dollars for a queen B. That's what I paid for my last queen B, and I just don't want you"
00:22:52,00:22:59,to be insinuating. I was taken for a fool. I don't know. Is a queen B pregnant at the time?
00:22:59,00:23:04,"I think you might need a drone or something. Yes, so then how much do you pay for that one?"
00:23:04,00:23:07,"I think they're cheap. They're super cheap. Remember, you could rent one? We did that years"
00:23:07,00:23:12,"ago. That was one of our first facts on the show. But that's what I mean, because to rent a B"
00:23:12,00:23:18,is like one cent per hour per B or something stupid like that. So the queen B is comparatively
00:23:18,00:23:26,"a lot more than that. And at the end of the day, they're all still B's. But if you leave a queen B"
00:23:26,00:23:30,"somewhere, it'll attract a load of other B's. Oh, that's why I just find them. That's why B's keep on,"
00:23:30,00:23:35,"you see a car covered in B's somewhere. That's because there's a queen B under the box. So really,"
00:23:35,00:23:38,"what you're doing is you're paying for the queen B, but actually you're getting hundreds of"
00:23:38,00:23:44,"thousands of other B's. It's like a sky TV deal, I imagine. Where you pay for sky would actually get loads of"
00:23:44,00:23:51,"channels. Right. Except every channel is a B. And sky one is the queen B, is it? Yeah, that's right."
00:23:51,00:23:56,It seems expensive. You think you just find sky one. But you're actually getting like to sky
00:23:56,00:24:00,it. I do understand that now. Glad to put it into terms. You could understand.
00:24:00,00:24:05,Did you finish your story or did we cut you off at Queen B? I think we extended it far beyond.
00:24:05,00:24:18,"Okay. The IRS in America, one of the things that's tax deductible for them is ransom for kidnapped"
00:24:18,00:24:27,"loved ones. If you pay to have your loved one returned, yeah, that's tax deductible. It's an"
00:24:27,00:24:32,"expense. So that's not true in Britain, because in Britain, it's counted as a bribe. And"
00:24:32,00:24:37,"the bribes are illegal. And you're not allowed to claim them back anything illegal, but in America,"
00:24:37,00:24:44,"you can. And was it John Paul Getty? Yes, the third. Yeah, who's one of his family were kidnapped."
00:24:44,00:24:49,And they ran to him for X amount. And he said he'd only pay Y amount. And that was the maximum
00:24:49,00:24:53,"expense that he was allowed to claim or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So John Paul Getty, the third"
00:24:53,00:24:58,"was kidnapped. And it was his father who said he would pay the ransom, but only up to 2.2 million."
00:24:58,00:25:04,Because then that's the maximum that was allowed for tax deduction. I'm sure. Did he still
00:25:04,00:25:07,"understand that he couldn't go above that otherwise? It would be tax. I think he would have,"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"because I think he would have been brought up in the way that his dad conducted business,"
00:25:11,00:25:16,a red that Warren Buffett submitted his first tax return when he was doing newspaper and milk
00:25:16,00:25:20,"rounds. So like, you know, I think this guy would have been in a similar like, oh, that makes"
00:25:20,00:25:27,"sense, dad, yeah. I like the excuse of something my dad told me. So Ken Dodd was accused of not"
00:25:27,00:25:32,"paying taxes for a while. He was accused by the inland revenue. And I feel like you, when you made"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"that face, we're doing an impression of Ken Dodd. I'm really sorry if that's not what you're trying"
00:25:35,00:25:40,"to do. I wasn't. I once met Ken Dodd. Yeah, he was a museum, wasn't he? And he said to me, do I know"
00:25:40,00:25:43,"you? And I said, I don't think so. And he said, yeah, yeah, I know you. We were on the same"
00:25:43,00:25:51,"police line up together, weren't we? Funny guy. Yeah, he is funny. So apparently he, the inland"
00:25:51,00:25:56,"revenue said, you haven't been paying us for years. And he said, I didn't think it applied to me."
00:25:56,00:26:07,"I live by the seaside. Did he? No, no, no, Dodd. Oh, yeah. It's a joke, Andy. I would, I don't know. Sorry."
00:26:07,00:26:13,"In 2015, one person living on a street in Hull complained that they were paying more"
00:26:13,00:26:18,council tax than all of their neighbours. They went to the council and the council upto all of their
00:26:18,00:26:33,"neighbours' council tax. Turn on, they made their life a lot worse. Okay, it is time for fact number"
00:26:33,00:26:39,"three. And that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the size of a rainbow can tell you how"
00:26:39,00:26:47,"polluted the air is. That's so, so is the rainbow more of a prominent feature in a more polluted area?"
00:26:47,00:26:52,"It's, it's not really easy for us to see, but if you're a scientist, you have the right equipment. You"
00:26:52,00:26:58,"can see very small changes. So if there are chemicals like acid rain, it would change the size of"
00:26:58,00:27:03,"the droplets, which would change the size of the bow. And so they look at that and they can tell"
00:27:03,00:27:10,"exactly what chemicals are in the air. Wow. Do you know like double rainbows? Yeah. Actually,"
00:27:10,00:27:14,"this isn't double rainbows, twin rainbows, which is slightly different thing. You can have two"
00:27:14,00:27:19,"rain showers that are kind of near each other, one with small raindrops and one with fat raindrops."
00:27:19,00:27:24,And they will give you two different rainbows and they'll start in the same bottom left hand corner
00:27:24,00:27:28,or bottom right hand corner and they'll come round and one will be higher than the other.
00:27:28,00:27:32,That's called a twin rainbow. I've seen what it goes before. Have you? Yeah. They're quite rare.
00:27:32,00:27:37,"Yeah, I mean, it was, I saw it once and that's it. Yeah. Great. Where did you sit?"
00:27:37,00:27:43,"I think it was in Austria at the time. Really? Yeah. I really like James' turn when he went,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,"they're quite rare. Like, I think you probably just saw a double rainbow down."
00:27:46,00:27:51,"Because yeah, that's unbelievable. So it looks like it's sprouting from the same origin,"
00:27:51,00:27:57,"but then it sprouts into two different rainbows. No, I wasn't listening. I've seen"
00:27:57,00:28:04,"it really big rainbows, what I was saying. I can't tell if you've done what you're joking now."
00:28:04,00:28:09,So you can get a quadruple rainbow. Wow. Okay. There was a photograph online of a quadruple rainbow.
00:28:09,00:28:15,It wasn't really a quadruple rainbow. It was just four rainbows. You can see why they mistook that.
00:28:15,00:28:20,"Yeah, you can see it, but it was, it was a rookie era. A photograph of a quadruple rainbow"
00:28:20,00:28:26,just looks like two rainbows. And the reason is that you've got two in front of you. Say the sun is
00:28:26,00:28:31,behind you. You've got two rainbows in front of you and then they reflect backwards. And so the other
00:28:31,00:28:36,"two are behind you. So it's impossible to take a photo of them, of all four of them at the same time,"
00:28:36,00:28:42,"unless you do like a panoramic picture. And they're extremely, extremely, extremely rare. So you"
00:28:42,00:28:48,probably only see a few of those. I think six of them. And no more. I think there's only one photograph
00:28:48,00:28:53,of them ever. Right. And it's only two of them. It's not of the other two. Okay. Why? Because the camera
00:28:53,00:28:57,couldn't get them in. Because two in front of you and two are always behind you. If you've been listening
00:28:57,00:29:04,"to any of them, it's literally just explaining that. Do you know you can get white rainbows? So this"
00:29:04,00:29:07,"This is... - That's a cloud mate, that you saw in clouds."
00:29:07,00:29:09,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:29:09,00:29:12,These are the big and fluffy and they float in the sky.
00:29:12,00:29:14,(laughter)
00:29:14,00:29:15,"No, these are light rainbows."
00:29:15,00:29:17,They get called fogbows.
00:29:17,00:29:21,"Okay, so if you've got fog in the air, that's where the water droplets hang in the air."
00:29:21,00:29:23,"They're incredibly microscopic, they're tiny."
00:29:23,00:29:28,"So you do get the rainbow effect, but they're so small that they don't actually show color."
00:29:28,00:29:31,- Yeah. - They are stunning.
00:29:31,00:29:35,"You can get all red rainbows as well, just a single red."
00:29:35,00:29:36,"- Terrifying. - I know, that's cool."
00:29:36,00:29:38,And a lot shorter song as well.
00:29:38,00:29:41,(laughter)
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- Yeah, there's sort of evening time, aren't they?"
00:29:43,00:29:46,So it depends where the sun is in the sky or the kind of color of your rainbow.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"They gradually start to lose their colors one by one, don't they?"
00:29:48,00:29:51,The shorter wavelengths die first.
00:29:51,00:29:53,- I always ask. - That's a good title for something.
00:29:53,00:29:54,(laughter)
00:29:54,00:29:57,Like a murder set at a radio station at Murder Mystery.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"The shorter wavelengths die first, yeah?"
00:29:59,00:30:02,In Norway where they've just turned off their FM.
00:30:02,00:30:03,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:30:03,00:30:06,- So it's a Scandi Noir drama.
00:30:06,00:30:09,- But it's kind of also about the progress of technology and leaving behind.
00:30:09,00:30:11,- It's got lots of layers. - Like a rainbow.
00:30:11,00:30:14,(laughter)
00:30:14,00:30:20,"- Just on the red rainbow, there's actually a physicist who in his lab has been creating"
00:30:20,00:30:23,"red rainbows as well, using lasers."
00:30:23,00:30:28,He's a physicist at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium.
00:30:28,00:30:32,And he shoots a laser into a droplet.
00:30:32,00:30:35,And so he gets these tiny rainbows that are all red.
00:30:35,00:30:40,"And he says that the form of the rainbow, under those kind of controlled conditions, you"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"can precisely determine what shape it's going to be, what size it's going to be, what the"
00:30:43,00:30:48,"composition and temperature of it is, purely by looking at the droplet before it's sprayed"
00:30:48,00:30:49,out. How cool is that?
00:30:49,00:30:53,"- I would say that's like a really small version of this thing, which is that the size of"
00:30:53,00:30:59,the droplets and what the composed of depends on what the rainbow looks like on a bigger scale
00:30:59,00:31:01,as well. That's how you can tell all the pollution and stuff.
00:31:01,00:31:02,"- Right, okay."
00:31:02,00:31:08,- So he says just to put it into super cool door key words for this particular small one
00:31:08,00:31:14,that he doesn't allow. Every single droplet has its own unique rainbow fingerprint already
00:31:14,00:31:15,in it.
00:31:15,00:31:17,- So cool.
00:31:17,00:31:18,- Do you guys like rainbows?
00:31:18,00:31:19,(laughter)
00:31:19,00:31:20,- Quick question.
00:31:20,00:31:21,- Yeah.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"- And I'm more for them than against them, yeah."
00:31:24,00:31:25,- That's two yeses.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- I'm a huge yeses.
00:31:26,00:31:29,"- Okay, three. Well, not everyone likes rainbows."
00:31:29,00:31:30,(laughter)
00:31:30,00:31:37,"So this is something from Amazonian cultures and rainbows there, very bad luck, as in they"
00:31:37,00:31:42,"are associated with skin problems, with having miscarriages, if you're pregnant."
00:31:42,00:31:47,"- How could this, doesn't make any sense there, so clearly such a positive, happy, I don't"
00:31:47,00:31:48,know.
00:31:48,00:31:52,- I think it's one of those glass half empty things because it's caused by sunshine and rain.
00:31:52,00:31:57,"Now, if it's always sunny and then you get some rain, then it could be a bad thing."
00:31:57,00:32:00,"But if it's always rainy, like it is in Britain, then the fact that there's a rainbow means"
00:32:00,00:32:02,at least there's some sun around.
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Okay.
00:32:03,00:32:09,"- This is from Wikipedia, I should say, so, but there is a saying, rainbows are shit."
00:32:09,00:32:10,- That's right.
00:32:10,00:32:11,(laughter)
00:32:11,00:32:13,- I'm such a translate.
00:32:13,00:32:19,"- There are diseases in one Peruvian language called Iona achata, which means the rainbow hurt"
00:32:19,00:32:20,my skin.
00:32:20,00:32:21,- What?
00:32:21,00:32:22,- What do you might say to the doctor?
00:32:22,00:32:25,"And it's traditional to close your mouth at a rainbow, otherwise you'll catch a disease."
00:32:25,00:32:26,- Oh wow.
00:32:26,00:32:27,- Yeah.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"So I'm just saying, they're not all good."
00:32:29,00:32:32,"- So the Skittles' adverts, over there, was not gone down there at all, were they?"
00:32:32,00:32:33,- Do not taste the rainbow.
00:32:33,00:32:34,(laughter)
00:32:34,00:32:42,- So the rainbow flag for pride has all the rainbow colors and it used to have a
00:32:42,00:32:45,shocking pink band.
00:32:45,00:32:51,And the reason they did away with that is because they couldn't mass-produce the pink cloth.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"All the others were easy to make, but this was a cloth that wasn't very easy to make, because"
00:32:54,00:32:58,"the first guy who did it, he kind of made it himself just a one-off."
00:32:58,00:33:02,"He didn't think of it being a mass-produced thing, and then it became really popular, and"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"they needed to make loads of them, but they couldn't get the pink."
00:33:04,00:33:08,"- It was after the Stonewall riots, wasn't it, that suddenly in the late 70s, suddenly"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"there was this massive demand for these flags, and they couldn't get it."
00:33:10,00:33:14,"- Then it had, so how many colors do you think are in the flag now?"
00:33:14,00:33:16,- I think seven.
00:33:16,00:33:20,"- Um, six."
00:33:20,00:33:24,- Did you just sing the rainbow song and still come up with six?
00:33:24,00:33:25,- I took out one.
00:33:25,00:33:26,- I took out one.
00:33:26,00:33:27,- Did you?
00:33:27,00:33:28,"Why, any reason?"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"- I put white in to, since I've learned about some new rainbow."
00:33:31,00:33:33,- You should have come up with eight then.
00:33:33,00:33:34,(laughter)
00:33:34,00:33:37,"- I didn't sing the full song, I kind of backed out and thought, ""I feel like there's only"
00:33:37,00:33:38,"a few left."""
00:33:38,00:33:40,"- I think we need to hang on down, I think we need to test something quickly."
00:33:40,00:33:42,What are the colors in a rainbow?
00:33:42,00:33:43,- Oh no.
00:33:43,00:33:44,(laughter)
00:33:44,00:33:46,"- Red, and yellow, and pink."
00:33:46,00:33:47,- No.
00:33:47,00:33:48,- Red.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"- Well, actually, all the colors are in the rainbow."
00:33:50,00:33:51,- All the colors are.
00:33:51,00:33:52,"- No, no, hang on, hang on, hang on, who's pink, isn't it?"
00:33:52,00:33:53,"- No, there's no pink."
00:33:53,00:33:54,- No.
00:33:54,00:33:55,- Red and yellow.
00:33:55,00:33:56,- Red and yellow.
00:33:56,00:33:57,Green.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"- Wait, what's the song?"
00:33:58,00:33:59,- The song is not the actual colors of the rainbow.
00:33:59,00:34:00,That's just a fun song you learned.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"- Hang on, what's I singing the right lyrics, sir?"
00:34:01,00:34:02,- You were singing the right lyrics.
00:34:02,00:34:03,"- Okay, all right."
00:34:03,00:34:04,- Green.
00:34:04,00:34:09,"- That's the full, but the colors in the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet."
00:34:09,00:34:12,"That's the colors that you learn, also, actually, you know, it's just emerging from the"
00:34:12,00:34:13,landscape.
00:34:13,00:34:14,- I like the jump ship to the end of the track.
00:34:14,00:34:15,That is correct.
00:34:15,00:34:16,I too was fooled by the song.
00:34:16,00:34:17,(laughter)
00:34:17,00:34:19,- What a lie of a song.
00:34:19,00:34:20,- Yeah.
00:34:20,00:34:24,- Just take something of things people need to remember in day-to-day life.
00:34:24,00:34:28,"It's like having a song, January, and February, and orange."
00:34:28,00:34:29,(laughter)
00:34:29,00:34:30,- Yeah.
00:34:30,00:34:36,"- It is me that I can understand why you thought that it went red, orange, whatever the song"
00:34:36,00:34:37,goes.
00:34:37,00:34:38,- So what is it?
00:34:38,00:34:41,"- So it's seven colors in the rainbow, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet."
00:34:41,00:34:45,"And the pride flag used to have, as we've said, it used to have eight, because it had these"
00:34:45,00:34:46,and the hot pink.
00:34:46,00:34:50,"And then it went down to seven, but then it only has six colors in it now, which I'd never"
00:34:50,00:34:51,notice.
00:34:51,00:34:54,- Do you think that maybe it wasn't that the material was too expensive?
00:34:54,00:34:59,"It's that the creator of the flag also was basing it off the song, and then someone said,"
00:34:59,00:35:00,"""What's pink doing there?"""
00:35:00,00:35:04,"And he thought, ""Oh, yeah, we can't stay anyway, it's so expensive."""
00:35:04,00:35:05,"- So no, it wasn't because of that."
00:35:05,00:35:08,"He knew the colors of the rainbow, this guy."
00:35:08,00:35:12,"The reason they lost the next color was because when the flag was round around poles, then"
00:35:12,00:35:16,"one color would get lost, because it would be round around the pole."
00:35:16,00:35:19,"So they needed an even number of colors, basically, because otherwise--"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"- It wasn't a vertical stripe, wasn't it?"
00:35:21,00:35:22,It wasn't a vertical--
00:35:22,00:35:25,- It must be a horizontal polynomial.
00:35:25,00:35:30,"- What it said was one hung vertically from the lamppost of San Francisco's market street,"
00:35:30,00:35:31,the center stripe.
00:35:31,00:35:35,"So if it was hung vertically, the center stripe went around the pole."
00:35:35,00:35:41,"And so they decided they needed an even number so that that middle stripe wasn't kind of,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,"I don't know, didn't disappear into the pole."
00:35:43,00:35:44,- Yeah.
00:35:44,00:35:45,- That's why I did it.
00:35:45,00:35:48,"- And Philadelphia, this year, has added a couple of extra colors to their flag that they"
00:35:48,00:35:51,had been using as a not-a-racial diversity.
00:35:51,00:35:52,"- Okay, cool."
00:35:52,00:35:56,"- Yeah, so they've gone up to eight, I think, again."
00:35:56,00:35:57,"- Oh, really?"
00:35:57,00:35:58,- Yeah.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- So they've added brown and black.
00:35:59,00:36:00,- They stand for--
00:36:00,00:36:02,"- The other colors stand for really fun stuff, don't they?"
00:36:02,00:36:03,- Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"- But it's such a shame they lost the pink, because so the person who designed it said that"
00:36:06,00:36:08,the hot pink stood for sex.
00:36:08,00:36:13,"So the other stand for life, healing, sunlight, nature, magic, serenity, and spirit."
00:36:13,00:36:14,But they've lost the sex now.
00:36:14,00:36:16,- They should have got rid of the magic one.
00:36:16,00:36:18,- Why is magic even in there?
00:36:18,00:36:19,- I'm glad that stayed.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"- Oh, god."
00:36:20,00:36:24,- And the other thing is that we were saying about the being seven colors in the rainbow.
00:36:24,00:36:27,"I think that was Newton who decided that, wasn't it?"
00:36:27,00:36:31,"And the reason being, we think probably just because seven was like a magical number, it"
00:36:31,00:36:33,"was like the seven C's, the seven, you know?"
00:36:33,00:36:34,- It's his favorite number.
00:36:34,00:36:35,"- Yeah, it's his favorite number."
00:36:35,00:36:36,- It's just a good number.
00:36:36,00:36:40,And so he kind of looked and decided there were seven distinct bands.
00:36:40,00:36:44,"And actually, if you look at a rainbow, you can decide really yourself how many bands"
00:36:44,00:36:45,there are.
00:36:45,00:36:46,There's pretty much an infinite number.
00:36:46,00:36:49,"- Although, I always, because I think we've done that on QI, and so I always look at"
00:36:49,00:36:52,"rainbows and think, okay, get beyond the seven thing, Newton just made it up."
00:36:52,00:36:54,But I still only ever see seven colors.
00:36:54,00:36:56,I can't see more or less.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- Really?
00:36:57,00:36:58,- Yeah.
00:36:58,00:37:00,- He passed away this year.
00:37:00,00:37:01,- Newton.
00:37:01,00:37:02,"- Yeah, started a break at sea."
00:37:02,00:37:03,- Yeah.
00:37:03,00:37:04,- He had a good innings.
00:37:04,00:37:09,"- Gilbert Baker, who is the creator of the rainbow flag, passed away this year, sadly."
00:37:09,00:37:12,"- Oh, Newton as well, and the savior."
00:37:12,00:37:13,- That's been a big--
00:37:13,00:37:14,- 2017.
00:37:14,00:37:26,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:37:26,00:37:31,"My fact this week is that a new study has revealed that the genre of music, with the most references"
00:37:31,00:37:35,"to drugs, is country music."
00:37:35,00:37:43,"Country music has, according to the survey, 1.6 mentions per song on average of drug usage,"
00:37:43,00:37:49,"and they did a list of genres, which used most drug references, so it started with country"
00:37:49,00:37:54,"music, then jazz, then pop, electronic, rock, folk, and in at last, rap."
00:37:54,00:37:55,- You missed out other.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"- Yeah, I know."
00:37:56,00:37:57,I wasn't...
00:37:57,00:37:59,Is that my favorite genre?
00:37:59,00:38:00,- Other who's...
00:38:00,00:38:03,"Yeah, other who's just underneath rock, but above folk."
00:38:03,00:38:04,- Wow.
00:38:04,00:38:05,- Yeah.
00:38:05,00:38:08,"- I thought country was folk, so I'm on a learning curve today."
00:38:08,00:38:09,- Yeah.
00:38:09,00:38:11,"That is unbelievable, though."
00:38:11,00:38:14,"I think that's really amazing, that rap has the fewest references."
00:38:14,00:38:15,- Yeah.
00:38:15,00:38:19,I think some people have looked at the methodology of this and aren't sure how it's ended up right.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"- We were talking about this, weren't we?"
00:38:21,00:38:23,"It just seems so unbelievable, though, this is the case."
00:38:23,00:38:25,"- Well, what they did, they took-- didn't they?"
00:38:25,00:38:29,"The lyrics of many, many thousands of songs, and they had a list of drug-related words."
00:38:29,00:38:33,"It quite a lot of drug-related words that they plugged in, and then they went through manually,"
00:38:33,00:38:37,"making sure that, you know, if someone says ""refer"", they're not actually singing a song"
00:38:37,00:38:41,"about the coral reef, the part where the man who works on a coral reef."
00:38:41,00:38:42,- Yeah.
00:38:42,00:38:43,Exactly.
00:38:43,00:38:48,"A lot of rap songs are about people who work on coral reefs, so that's probably why."
00:38:48,00:38:49,"So, yeah."
00:38:49,00:38:50,But...
00:38:50,00:38:53,- I wondered if the methodology went wrong in that they're not cool enough to understand
00:38:53,00:38:58,"some of the more modern drug references, because they came up with this list of 65 names"
00:38:58,00:38:59,for drugs.
00:38:59,00:39:04,"And so the examples that were in this article were things like Adi, Blow, Molly, Roxy,"
00:39:04,00:39:10,"and Scissorpe, S-I-D-Z-U-R-P, so if they feature in a song, that's that kind of the drug."
00:39:10,00:39:13,But maybe Raps just using way more modern cool slang.
00:39:13,00:39:14,"- Oh, boy, why?"
00:39:14,00:39:15,- That these guys don't know about.
00:39:15,00:39:19,"- As opposed to Scissorpe, the classic 1920 slang for what is Scissorpe?"
00:39:19,00:39:23,"- I've never heard Scissorpe before, and you're saying it like it's a hackneyed old term."
00:39:23,00:39:24,"- No, no, no."
00:39:24,00:39:28,"- Well, it's such a good word to rhyme with, which is why you use something about burping."
00:39:28,00:39:29,Then you're going to need a Scissorpe.
00:39:29,00:39:31,It's the only thing that rhymes.
00:39:31,00:39:32,"- Yeah, what is it?"
00:39:32,00:39:33,I don't know what a Scissorpe is.
00:39:33,00:39:37,I don't think anyone has ever heard of Scissorpe except the person who wrote whatever song refers to it.
00:39:37,00:39:42,"And then I'm just saying that they've got this list, but maybe they've missed things out that Raps using."
00:39:42,00:39:48,"I think they also used a lot of songs, perhaps you wouldn't hear on normal country music stations."
00:39:48,00:39:49,- Yes.
00:39:49,00:39:54,- And actually the more popular ones probably are about Scissorpe and the other drugs.
00:39:54,00:39:59,"- But they weren't counting, because they had a list of the drugs that they were looking for as well."
00:39:59,00:40:05,"And they didn't include alcohol, but I reckon if you throw alcohol in, you know, country music has quite a lot of references to that, doesn't it?"
00:40:05,00:40:06,"- Yeah, tons."
00:40:06,00:40:07,- So I've just Googled Scissorpe.
00:40:07,00:40:08,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:40:08,00:40:15,"- It is a purple drink, a mix of coding based prescription cough syrup, soda and often jolly ranchers candy."
00:40:15,00:40:17,"- Sounds quite nice, doesn't it?"
00:40:17,00:40:18,- Yeah.
00:40:18,00:40:20,"- But don't do it, kids."
00:40:20,00:40:22,"That sounds so country, though."
00:40:22,00:40:27,"- And jolly ranchers candy and then some prescription drugs, classic country music."
00:40:27,00:40:36,"- You can't really imagine Snoop Dogg on the Scissorpe, could you, but weirdly that's a word that's closely, I would associate more with Snoop than anywhere else."
00:40:36,00:40:37,- Scissorpe on the Scissorpe.
00:40:37,00:40:38,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:40:38,00:40:45,"- It's interesting, I wonder if in other, Reggae's not on this list, blues is not on this list, they've been lumped into other."
00:40:45,00:40:47,- So blues would be in jazz?
00:40:47,00:40:48,"- I guess so, yeah."
00:40:48,00:40:49,- Reggae.
00:40:49,00:40:50,- Classical.
00:40:50,00:40:51,- Classical.
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Classical in that.
00:40:52,00:40:54,- Symphony Phops is a Pindi minor.
00:40:54,00:40:59,- You were saying about the words that they use.
00:40:59,00:41:05,Did you see that America's Drug Enforcement Administration have made a dictionary of slang drug terms this year?
00:41:05,00:41:07,I wonder if any of these are in it.
00:41:07,00:41:10,"Whiffle dust, Bernie's flakes."
00:41:10,00:41:12,I wonder if any of these are in Bernie's.
00:41:12,00:41:14,- Is that named after Bernie?
00:41:14,00:41:15,- Bernie's.
00:41:15,00:41:17,"- Well, I don't know, it means cocaine."
00:41:17,00:41:19,"- Yeah, that's Bernie's flakes."
00:41:19,00:41:24,"- Is there the people who were going to show up to vote for Bernie Sanders in the American primaries, but they didn't?"
00:41:24,00:41:27,- They were two off their heads.
00:41:27,00:41:29,- Ant hazel means heroin.
00:41:29,00:41:31,- I wonder if that's in any of those songs.
00:41:31,00:41:33,- Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy means cannabis.
00:41:33,00:41:34,- Ant hazel.
00:41:34,00:41:35,- Ant hazel.
00:41:35,00:41:38,- That explains what my unclean was up to.
00:41:38,00:41:41,"- This has what it's called, Barbara."
00:41:41,00:41:44,"- Every night, you was having a night in without hazel."
00:41:44,00:41:46,- Smoochy Wootchy.
00:41:46,00:41:50,"Feels like it would be a good name of a song, maybe you're a vision hit."
00:41:50,00:41:51,- Yeah.
00:41:51,00:41:55,"- But what if you're just really loved up and you're walking down the street with your partner and you say,"
00:41:55,00:41:59,"""I'll give us a Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy"" and you're immediately arrested by one of these guys."
00:41:59,00:42:05,"- You deserve to be immediately arrested if you'll say to your lover in public, give us a Smoochy Wootchy Pootchy."
00:42:05,00:42:10,"- But I would say that that's probably true of lots of slang terms for drugs, right?"
00:42:10,00:42:11,- Yeah.
00:42:11,00:42:16,"- To a song called ""Weed"" into a tennis ball can."
00:42:16,00:42:16,- Yes.
00:42:16,00:42:18,"- Yeah, I might think it's about drugs."
00:42:18,00:42:19,- That's true.
00:42:19,00:42:25,"- Okay, that is it."
00:42:25,00:42:26,That is all of our facts.
