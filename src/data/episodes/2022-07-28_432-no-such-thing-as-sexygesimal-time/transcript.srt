1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Hi everyone, just to let you know, we've got a very special guest on our show today.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,480
 It is one of Britain's top nerds.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,440
 Oh, is it me?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,320
 It's even more top than you, James Harkin.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,720
 You're not even supposed to be doing this bit.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,440
 Oh yeah, sorry.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,280
 I know you look, you're very welcome.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,120
 It is Bobby Seagull.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,800
 He's not only a math teacher, you might know him from University Challenge,

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,920
 where he came to prominence.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,160
 He's a TV presenter.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,280
 He's written a book called The Life Changing Magic of Numbers,

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,400
 which will change your life.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,440
 You should definitely get it.

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,520
 And he's also written The Monkman and Seagull Quiz Book.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,240
 He's a brilliant guy, full of interesting nerdy facts.

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,200
 He now co-hosts the Mass Appeal podcast, but today he's on ours.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
 Yes, and I'm not on ours.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,880
 So I'm not even sure why I'm here to be.

20
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,840
 Oh, I know I am here.

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,520
 I'm here to remind you that we are going on tour in the autumn

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,280
 and in the last day of summer, if this is how you count your seasons.

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,040
 Basically the 31st of August, we're going to be in Inverness.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,360
 Then we're going to be in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Cardiff.

25
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,920
 If you're in any of those places, come and watch our show.

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,600
 It's going to be so much fun, loads of facts, loads of silliness.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,320
 We just can't wait to be back on tour again.

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,800
 That's right.

29
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,040
 And even if you don't think that the 1st of September is the first day of autumn,

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,520
 which I don't happen to, if you disagree with James' delineation of the seasons,

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,800
 just come anyway.

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,600
 That's right.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,000
 It's from the 31st of August to the 13th of September.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,040

37
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,720
 I'm with the podcast.

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:41,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,000
 A weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,880
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and our very special guest.

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,280
 It's Bobby Seagull.

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,680
 Starting with fact number one and that is Bobby.

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,480
 My fact this week is that the UK pop charts were originally compiled by phoning around 20 record shops

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,720
 and asking what their best selling songs were that particular week.

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,960
 So we're talking 50s, are we?

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,120
 This was November 52.

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,840
 So the Queens jubilee year 52.

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,240
 So that means for the first few months of her reign,

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,280
 there was a different way of assessing the music charts as it were.

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,640
 So in the US, they had the billboards.

54
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,840
 So for the billboards, it was a I think since the 1940s, it was like weekly sales.

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,080
 But in the UK, they didn't have a charts based on music sales.

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,440
 So it was an organization called the PRS, the Performing Right Society.

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,720
 And they would look at the best selling sheet music.

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,080
 The word sheet always annoys me.

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,680
 In school, if I say the word sheet, it's just like, sir?

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,960
 Is that what? Do you have two sheets on you, sir?

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,760
 I mean, they're very juvenile, sorry.

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,480
 We've got the sense of humour of your students.

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,600
 Bobby's a teacher, by the way, yeah, we should say.

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
 So it was the sheet music.

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,600
 So a man called Percy Dickens.

66
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,360
 So Hale Percy Dickens.

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,280
 So he was a magazine advertising salesman.

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,800
 And he was actually a founding member of the New Musical Express magazine,

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,040
 which is now enemy or there's an enemy shut nowadays.

70
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,400
 It's still online. It's still functions online.

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
 RIP print copy.

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,560
 But yeah, Hale to the digital copies.

73
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,920
 So he thought, actually, what's the best way of getting advertising revenue

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
 for a magazine?

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,800
 And he said, actually, we can attract commercial advertising revenue

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,520
 if we tie up something with the record industry.

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,800
 So they thought, oh, actually, how about we do some sort of record based music chart?

78
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,560
 And that's how the initial brainwave spark.

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
 OK, so records were sort of like an obscure,

80
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
 you know, why are you buying a record?

81
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,760
 You could just buy the sheet music and your own piano.

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,960
 You can sing it on yourself, yeah.

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,960
 OK, and then they decided calling around 20 shops

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,320
 would be the most reliable ways to do that.

85
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,040
 Yes, so but why his system was like that.

86
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,280
 But so what the management of NME decided was they I think they agreed

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,600
 with 50 shops that they would be willing to exchange data.

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,640
 So but with those 50 ish shops, I think it's 53, but it's 50 ish.

89
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,280
 It's always safe as a mathematician.

90
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,240
 You know, you don't like giving exact numbers.

91
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,480
 So every Monday morning, Percy Dickens would pick up the dog and bone phone

92
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,680
 and call up about 15 to 25 shops on average, 20 shops.

93
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,960
 And each store would give their top 10.

94
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,480
 But this is where things get a bit murky,

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,400
 because he would then have a points based system that allocate to this.

96
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,320
 And this is a bit we don't know.

97
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,960
 It's like a Eurovision type system.

98
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,360
 We don't know the exact system.

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,680
 But because of that, it meant his first ever top.

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,200
 I think he was trying to do like a top 12, but there were 15 entries.

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,040
 Because three entries, number seven, eight and 11 tied.

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,040
 And we all know in reality, it's unlikely that three songs would have

103
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
 exactly the same number of sales.

104
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
 But because he went to 20 shops.

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,280
 Yeah, just yeah, you probably have like two songs with 17 sales each.

106
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
 And then how are they?

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
 Because I sort of read that they're not the great at monitoring anyway,

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
 are they, the shops?

109
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,000
 And also they might just say the song that they like best.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,640
 Well, if they were told, we're going to be ringing you up and asking if you're sales.

111
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,600
 They probably would keep the sales.

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,760
 Yeah, I like that.

113
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,760
 I would just I do find myself wondering if anyone ever tried to game

114
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,160
 the system by picking a particular shop and saying, well, I'm going to send

115
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,440
 15 different friends in here all to buy this one single.

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,560
 Hope they get phoned up this week by Percy Dickens.

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
 That did used to happen, though.

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,840
 I don't know specifically to do to British charts.

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,760
 But certainly overseas in America, you would have, you know,

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,080
 the really rich people just buying huge units of an album

121
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,520
 from one specific store just to get those numbers up to get them into the charts.

122
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,200
 There was that was a thing to get in the charts.

123
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,680
 I mean, that's happened forever.

124
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,480
 You know, Taylor Swift's doing a gig and she's bundled it with the new album

125
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,480
 or she's released a new t-shirt and she bundles it with the album.

126
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,840
 And so you cheat the sale because you're attaching it.

127
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,520
 It counters us in.

128
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,120
 It used to and not anymore because they noticed that the bands were just,

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,200
 you know, cheating the system.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,280
 They were gaming the system.

131
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,080
 And so they actually not popular at all.

132
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
 Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift.

133
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,040
 Does it turn out no, no, no, no, exactly.

134
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,160
 But May 2020, Dua Lipa, she had future nostalgia,

135
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,880
 which was the lowest selling number one album ever.

136
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,440
 Imagine getting to number one and finding out you were the worst asset.

137
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,040
 That's a good record. Yeah.

138
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,880
 Why did they tell her that? That's mean.

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
 Yeah. 7,317 copies. Wow.

140
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,320
 That was the that was the sixth week that she was at number one. Oh, OK.

141
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,680
 Yeah, yeah. But it's going to be some tiling off.

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,800
 Yeah. But what was that was still number one in that week?

143
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,960
 Yes, it was still number one in that week.

144
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,840
 Yeah. And so what's amazing about this

145
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,640
 is that it's basically since streaming music has come along,

146
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,880
 that the charts have been altered in such a weird way.

147
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,840
 So a thousand album streams equates to one record sale is what they say.

148
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,360
 One physical product. Yeah, I think that's in the UK, isn't it?

149
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,240
 Yeah, that's in the UK.

150
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,560
 That's how that's how you do that.

151
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,600
 But also what they found is so interesting.

152
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,000
 Such an interesting time where gigantic musicians

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,720
 who are global names are fighting it in the charts with bands

154
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,960
 that are independent local British ones with a big fan base

155
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,640
 who can get them to that number.

156
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,720
 So they're in the charts.

157
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,120
 But because everyone's streaming the biggies, they're not buying the album.

158
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,800
 But then the little ones, they've got such hardcore fans

159
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,080
 who might buy five or six copies to give to their friends and family.

160
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,600
 They're making a dent in the charts. Oh, I see.

161
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,360
 So you mean the bands that only only their friends or family buying it,

162
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,400
 they buy physical albums, but because that's so rare to do.

163
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,960
 And they come they come more in the equation as well.

164
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,040
 So I think for singles charts, a hundred paid streams is one sale

165
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,160
 and six hundred free streams.

166
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,360
 So the freemium versions is one sale.

167
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
 So if you pay for your Spotify iTunes and you're streaming it,

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,440
 it's six times more valuable than someone on an ad based.

169
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,360
 Wow. Oh, that's good.

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,200
 Because if I find a song I like, I will often listen to it six hundred times.

171
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,520
 Despite what if you buy it once, it's the same.

172
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
 Oh, you don't have to subject yourself to the six hundred.

173
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,040
 You can just buy it.

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,880
 I don't want to know.

175
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,200
 I want to say the money and be I do really like the songs I like.

176
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,120
 So I'm just back to Percy Dickens and the first listen, fifty two.

177
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,280
 I was reading about the first ever number one single,

178
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,160
 which was called Here in My Heart, and it was by Al Martino.

179
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,240
 Do you guys read about him? No, he was crazy.

180
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,320
 So I never heard of him before.

181
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,360
 He was an Italian-American singer and former bricklayer.

182
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
 And he went on to great fame because he was in The Godfather.

183
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,040
 Hmm. Playing a singer called Johnny Fontaine.

184
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,640
 Oh, yeah. Johnny Fontaine is the one who leads to someone

185
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,120
 getting a horse's head in the bed. Yes. Yes. That's right.

186
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
 Confession. I've not watched The Godfather.

187
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
 Well, I was told off at a party recently about this.

188
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,720
 I do know the fact, but I was not I have not seen The Godfather.

189
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,800
 Well, it's a very worth watching.

190
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
 It's it's only average.

191
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,240
 It's no grownups without a sound.

192
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
 But then this is OK.

193
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
 This is the really weird thing about Al Martino.

194
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,240
 So he was he played a singer connected to the mafia in the film The Godfather.

195
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,760
 But then eventually he was forced to leave the UK by the mafia

196
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,880
 because they tried to buy him out of his American marital contract.

197
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,080
 And there was some controversy and there was some disagreement.

198
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
 And then so really? Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,200
 So he was involved in a mafia-ish circles.

200
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
 It sounds like a bit.

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,120
 It sounds like you may have met them sometimes.

202
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,960
 I don't know.

203
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
 The Godfather filming, maybe.

204
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,760
 Method acting. Good.

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,760
 Oh, my God. I love that. I went two methods.

206
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,560
 I'm on Percy Dickens. Yeah.

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,000
 So do you know his second claim to fame?

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
 So obviously the charts is his first claim to fame.

209
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,320
 But the second one is so do you know we have modern sort of like award ceremonies

210
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
 and stadium rock concerts?

211
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,240
 So he actually in the early 60s,

212
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,640
 he pioneered the something called the enemy poll winners concert.

213
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,280
 And he managed to get I think the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

214
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,000
 And again, this is like a tenuous claim to fame.

215
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
 But some people in the music industry say that was responsible

216
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,920
 for the sort of award ceremonies we have nowadays.

217
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,640
 So he was the first person in the UK.

218
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,000
 So let's say all the winners of the awards, music awards,

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,280
 let's get them all together in a big concert at Wembley.

220
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,920
 So I think it was Wembley Arena, which is the Empire Pool at the time.

221
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,800
 So that's his second. His fault.

222
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 We have these awards ceremonies.

223
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
 I love that. What a big character.

224
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,360
 So he's from I didn't realize he's from my hometown of East Ham.

225
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,480
 East Ham from the London Borough of Newham,

226
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
 which is why I'm a Master of West Ham fan.

227
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
 But I never knew he was from East Ham.

228
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,560
 And I was trying to find out where in East Ham and I can't.

229
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,280
 But if there's people, listeners out there,

230
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,840
 we need to get a blue plaque for this man in East Ham.

231
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,920
 He sounded the chart and possibly pioneered the music award ceremony.

232
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,040
 Yeah, that's incredible. I agree.

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,880
 I was reading about.

234
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,320
 Did you guys happen to read about the first ever top 100 billboard single?

235
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,440
 So this was in 1958.

236
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,680
 And it was a song that was called Poor Little Fool by Ricky Nelson.

237
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,000
 And yeah, so it came out was a massive hit.

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,840
 And it was actually written by a woman called Sharon Shealy.

239
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,880
 And she wrote the song because she'd met Elvis Presley when she was 15.

240
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,880
 And he basically encouraged her to get into writing.

241
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,760
 So she thought, OK, I'll do that.

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,120
 She based it, the song on a very short fling that she had

243
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,640
 with a guy called Don Everly of the Everly Brothers.

244
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,760
 So the song that's the first number one is actually based on a musician,

245
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,720
 which is quite cool in its own right.

246
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 And effectively, she might have dabbled with some other songs.

247
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,240
 But from what I read, this was the first song that she wrote.

248
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,400
 And so she she thought I need to get someone to record it.

249
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,680
 So she thought Ricky Nelson could be perfect for this.

250
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,840
 So she drove to his house and she faked breaking down outside of it.

251
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 The car, not emotionally.

252
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,760
 So she broke down her car, supposedly was broken down.

253
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,600
 And she was like, please, can you help me?

254
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
 And he was like, yeah, OK.

255
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,800
 And he came out and he tried to help her with the car.

256
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,640
 And then she went, I've got a song. You got to hear it.

257
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,720
 I want you to sing it.

258
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,560
 And he heard it and he went, OK, I'll do it.

259
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,960
 And that's the first number one.

260
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,120
 Her first song at 18, handing it by faking a breakdown.

261
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720
 Yeah. Did he fix her car that wasn't broken?

262
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,440
 Yeah, it fooled him because he didn't know he could do that.

263
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,120
 He subsequently left the music industry and became a mechanic.

264
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,360
 He's the worst mechanic.

265
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,240
 There is someone who collected every single track

266
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,720
 that entered the top 40 from 1952 onwards.

267
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,760
 A guy called Keith Sevier and he died in 2015.

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,400
 So the collecting stopped then.

269
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,680
 But he bought every single track, every one that entered the top 40.

270
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,720
 How many is that? Do you know?

271
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,800
 Well, his lounge alone contained 35,000 vinyls.

272
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,200
 He had and 10,000 CD singles as well.

273
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 I mean, it was a lot.

274
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
 We think that's cool.

275
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,240
 But for his kids, every time they went home,

276
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,840
 you'd have that conversation with your dad.

277
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,440
 Like, dad, have you thought about clearing these out?

278
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,680
 I mean, he lived in a normal house in Twickenham.

279
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,840
 It was not a big place, but it was entirely full of stacked records, just insane.

280
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,320
 If I was his kids or children or nephews and nieces,

281
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,960
 I'd feel like a responsibility to continue that from 2015.

282
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,440
 You can't just like from 52 to 2015.

283
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,320
 You can't just leave it like, oh, family tradition.

284
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,160
 Exactly. I don't think I read a piece about it.

285
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
 And I don't think anyone in the family was saying, oh, yeah, we'll keep going.

286
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
 I know, you can be the foster child.

287
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,440
 Can I just tell you something fun about sheet music charts?

288
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
 Yeah, what type of music?

289
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,640
 Sheet music.

290
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,400
 How many sheets?

291
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,080
 This music is sheet.

292
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
 So, Bobby, you mentioned earlier about sheet music,

293
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,160
 being how the charts were compiled before the fifties.

294
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,640
 And so, yeah, that was how people took in music.

295
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,840
 Basically, they went and bought sheet music,

296
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,120
 and then I guess they'd have to play it at home or look at it

297
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
 and imagine it being played.

298
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,160
 And so sheet music, publishing and promotion was a huge industry.

299
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,000
 And you got people who were hired as song pluggers

300
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,800
 who would be like demonstrators who would sit in shops

301
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,400
 that were selling sheet music and they'd have to play the music.

302
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,280
 So someone would say, I want to buy this by so and so.

303
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,440
 And then people.

304
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,480
 So certain people got their starts in life.

305
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,160
 Doing that Lil Hardin, who was Louis Armstrong's wife,

306
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
 started as a songplugger Irving Berlin.

307
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,200
 George Gershwin started as songpluggers.

308
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,880
 Did they slip their own songs in?

309
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,360
 Is that how they got big?

310
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,720
 This is a cracking hit.

311
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,720
 Yeah, people come up to you in the shop and do they say,

312
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
 I want to buy a song that goes like this.

313
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,920
 But then they play it.

314
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,640
 No, they could do that.

315
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,160
 I guess you'd adapt to your customer.

316
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,040
 So if you came in and, you know, sang the, I don't know, that they'd say,

317
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,360
 oh, well, you might like this song.

318
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
 I think, yeah, exactly.

319
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,600
 Like a Spotify algorithm.

320
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,040
 They're radio. They're just a back.

321
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,120
 They're live radio.

322
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520
 They're just playing the hits, presumably from the week.

323
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,640
 People say, oh, I like that song you're playing.

324
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,360
 Yeah. Yeah. They're like a jukebox, like a shazami type of.

325
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,080
 Yes. Yeah. The original shazami. Yes.

326
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,800
 But they did. It wasn't just playing.

327
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,240
 They'd also be paid by the song publishers to do things like they go into theaters

328
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,040
 and in the intervals, they'd be paid to start singing a tune really loudly.

329
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,840
 And you'd have to get the whole audience to sing along with you.

330
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
 Cool.

331
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,720
 Which you have to be quite confident to do that.

332
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,760
 Because you risk looking like a psychopath.

333
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,320
 But yeah. And then people are like, God, I heard that tune at the theater

334
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,560
 in the interval recently. I'm going to buy it.

335
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,720
 Yeah, that's really cool.

336
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
 Yeah. What a clever way. I mean, we should do that.

337
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,520
 We should go in the intervals at theater and go, my fact this week.

338
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:15,360
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

339
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,520
 And that is my fact.

340
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,800
 My fact this week is that there are two members of the National Trust's food

341
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,680
 and beverage team who both have the surname Kit Kat.

342
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,600
 So I got to tell you how I got this fact.

343
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,040
 I was at an event recently and someone came up.

344
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,000
 It was a podcast event and someone came up saying, hey, I really like your podcast.

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,360
 I said, oh, thanks. And we had a bit of a chat.

346
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,440
 Turns out he worked for the National Trust and then I went off.

347
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,880
 And then about an hour later, then you went.

348
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,360
 He said I work for the National Trust and you just turned around.

349
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,080
 Yeah, I actually slapped him before I went as well.

350
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,840
 And then so I had to go to an event and then I finished.

351
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,640
 And as I came out, he clocked me from across the room

352
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,720
 and and he kind of ran towards me and said, I forgot to tell you my favorite fact.

353
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,880
 And this was the fact.

354
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,040
 So his name is Jack Glover.

355
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,080
 He's a podcast producer for the National Trust.

356
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
 They have their own podcast.

357
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,800
 And yeah, and he was saying that basically it's he doesn't know either of these Kit Kat.

358
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,560
 But someone mentioned that there was a Kit Kat who worked for the National Trust.

359
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,080
 And as they were googling it, they found not one another Kit Kat.

360
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,800
 So related. They're not related because they're spelt differently.

361
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,360
 So Louise. Yeah.

362
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,000
 Louisa Kit Kat, who spells it K-I-T-C-A-Double-T.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,960
 And then you've got Sam Kit Kat, who's just got one T.

364
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,560
 We don't know if they know each other.

365
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,880
 I've tried to find them online.

366
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,840
 They're on LinkedIn.

367
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,440
 I didn't have time to get through to them.

368
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
 I think Louise is on Instagram, but it's a private account.

369
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,440
 So I couldn't get through to her.

370
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,800
 Oh, these poor Kit Kat.

371
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,680
 Some weirdo trying to contact them all week.

372
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,720
 I've just never heard the surname Kit Kat before.

373
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,240
 No, me neither. I've never heard of that.

374
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,560
 Well, it's a brilliant fact.

375
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,200
 Amazing. Food and beverage. Love it.

376
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,880
 Should we say what I don't know if overseas every country has its own

377
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,360
 national trust in the same kind of way.

378
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,520
 But in Britain, there's basically an organisation.

379
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,880
 They're an independent charity and they buy up places of national importance.

380
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,520
 And they make it public.

381
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,040
 So they make places that might otherwise have been private,

382
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,080
 like Winston Churchill's Old House Chartwell that was that was bought by them.

383
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,640
 And it was transformed into a public place.

384
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,680
 And so it means that the public can go and visit all of these extraordinary places.

385
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,760
 Yeah. And yeah.

386
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,400
 The National Trust has some amazingly weird stuff.

387
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,080
 Yeah. Oh, my goodness.

388
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,880
 So I was just reading about like the odd things they have.

389
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,760
 Did you know they've got the National Rhubarb Collection?

390
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,160
 Cool.

391
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,920
 Is that just lots of people mustering away in the back?

392
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,080
 - Altenburg actors. - Rhubarb.

393
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 Yeah, yeah.

394
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,400
 They've got the largest fern in the UK at Colby Woodland Garden.

395
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,440
 It's 400 years old, 19 feet around.

396
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,760
 - Wow. Impressive. - Big fern.

397
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,240
 - Big fern. - Big fern.

398
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,200
 And they've got one nudist beach, which I've been to, actually.

399
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
 - Have you? - Oh, Studland.

400
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,760
 I may have mentioned that before.

401
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
 - It's in Dawson. - Studland.

402
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,160
 - Studland. - Studland.

403
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,360
 I went down there with my friends and we didn't know it was a nudist beach.

404
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,640
 - Did you get naked? - Yeah, yeah.

405
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,680
 No, we didn't. Well, I didn't. I don't know if they did, but no, we didn't.

406
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,280
 But you happen to be naked at the time.

407
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,720
 Fortunately, I was able to seamlessly blend in.

408
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,760
 No, um, yeah, there were the, it was because it's quite sand duny.

409
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,520
 So it's quite, the landscape is quite undulating.

410
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,080
 So it's not immediately apparent that it's a nudist beach.

411
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,280
 But every so often, someone will just hove into view who is naked

412
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,960
 and you sort of pop up like a little meerkat.

413
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,120
 You think, oh, that's funny. And then pop back down.

414
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,680
 Anyway, yeah.

415
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,640
 Do you think the undulations are a nod to the human form?

416
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,400
 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

417
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,360
 Yeah. Well, because this actually doesn't link to another National Trust property.

418
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,920
 Oh, really?

419
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,080
 West Wiccan Park, West Wiccan Park gardens,

420
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,280
 were designed in the shape of a woman's anatomy, apparently.

421
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,920
 Which anatomy?

422
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,240
 Like the whole thing.

423
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,680
 I think the whole thing doesn't.

424
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,800
 No, I don't.

425
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,040
 It's just the ear, the left earlobe.

426
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,400
 No, it's mostly centered on a mound of Venus,

427
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
 which has a passageway underneath it.

428
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,120
 So I think that's a vagina.

429
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
 But this is so cool.

430
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,440
 This was the home of Sofrancis Dashwood,

431
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,680
 who was who founded something called the Hellfire Club.

432
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,640
 Oh, yeah.

433
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,720
 Which is the, I mean, it's an awful club.

434
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
 It's basically a worse version of the Bullington Club,

435
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,840
 but also really fun.

436
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,400
 Which is basically--

437
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,120
 And it's gone on.

438
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,480
 The Hellfire Club or--

439
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
 Oh, maybe it is.

440
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,520
 Sounds, it's a club for posh people to meet up

441
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,000
 and do really sordid stuff that probably is still around.

442
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,040
 But yeah, he designed this house and gardens,

443
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,480
 and then this hillside nearby,

444
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,560
 which you can also visit, which is National Trust.

445
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,040
 And it's full of tunnels and caves that were covered

446
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,520
 in like fallacies and pre-apic statues.

447
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,320
 And they'd like act out religious rituals there,

448
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,000
 but in a porny way.

449
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,840
 And so they'd have nuns, but they'd be sex workers.

450
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,600
 And they'd be asked to lie down,

451
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,680
 and then the members of the club would lick holy wine

452
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,760
 from their navels and stuff like that.

453
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
 But lots of people got involved.

454
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,040
 And Ben Franklin paid a visit.

455
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,240
 Oh, thank you.

456
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,400
 Ben, a bit of naval licking, I'm afraid.

457
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,200
 Ben?

458
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,560
 Wow, Ben.

459
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
 Ben, first name terms.

460
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,640
 My name is Ben.

461
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,760
 I believe in first name terms.

462
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,480
 I'd abbreviated first name terms.

463
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,920
 Abbreviated, that's what I can't believe.

464
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,000
 Ben E.F.

465
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,520
 Ben E.F., yeah.

466
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,280
 Well, in the club, we refer to each other.

467
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,760
 Oh, sure, yeah.

468
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,160
 Anyway, after he died, Francis Dashwood,

469
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
 then his heirs called in Capability Brown,

470
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,040
 the famous garden designer to remove quite a lot

471
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,280
 of the more sordid elements of the garden.

472
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,920
 Wow.

473
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,040
 But you could still visit.

474
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,080
 Do you know what the membership,

475
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,400
 anyone know the membership price for National Trust

476
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,440
 or a single person?

477
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,400
 I don't.

478
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,680
 I have been a member, so.

479
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,120
 But actually, you know, Benjamin,

480
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,640
 how much is that in the States?

481
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
 Benjamin, is that a $100 bill?

482
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,040
 I think it is.

483
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,680
 Yes, it is.

484
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,040
 We call it a Ben, but yeah.

485
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,760
 So actually, I think maybe based on try,

486
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,680
 it might actually be the price of a Ben.

487
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,560
 I think it's about £76.80, which might be a Ben.

488
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,440
 Yeah, yeah.

489
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,920
 It's close, yeah.

490
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,800
 That's a Franklin.

491
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,960
 Yeah.

492
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,080
 Does that get you into all of them for fun?

493
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,960
 Yes.

494
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,080
 $76.80?

495
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,720
 $76.80 for one year.

496
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,240
 That has gone up a lot.

497
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,280
 Yeah, I was a member.

498
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,640
 Cost of living crisis, hello.

499
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,880
 Yeah.

500
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,280
 People can't even afford to visit state-of-the-homes anymore.

501
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,640
 I've had to buy cheap-wide to look out

502
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,840
 at this sex worker's navel.

503
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,040
 So I was looking at the National Trust website

504
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,560
 and they very proudly declare,

505
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,640
 "We have 5.37 million members,

506
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,560
 which is more than Costa Rica.

507
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,840
 Are they planning like an invasion?

508
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,880
 Like, we shall arm, get your shovels and picks

509
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,920
 and your membership cards.

510
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,120
 We shall go to Costa Rica."

511
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,640
 They're quite proud of that.

512
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,840
 I mean, that is huge.

513
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,040
 That is really huge.

514
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,840
 That's in their website.

515
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,800
 I didn't see further digging.

516
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,040
 Actually, it's apparently 5.9 million

517
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,000
 rather than 5.37.

518
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,360
 So their website's out of date.

519
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,280
 So in theory, they could be more ambitious,

520
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,000
 forget Costa Rica, Denmark or Singapore.

521
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,040
 They could invade them.

522
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,240
 National Trust.

523
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,120
 Which would you go for?

524
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,280
 Denmark, I think, probably has more historic features

525
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,600
 that they could get.

526
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,880
 Easier to get to from Britain as well.

527
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,360
 That's true.

528
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,320
 The Vikings.

529
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,800
 Yeah.

530
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,440
 Take back.

531
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,080
 Take back.

532
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,640
 Yeah, Denmark.

533
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,760
 Let's take a Denmark.

534
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:42,920
 Yeah.

535
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,600
 There's one place that Jack was telling me about

536
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,920
 who sent me this fact called Orford Ness.

537
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,280
 And it's a nature reserve.

538
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,680
 And they have lots of amazing animals there.

539
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,280
 They have the white-faced woodland sheep.

540
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,920
 But they've also got a nuclear bomb.

541
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,560
 Yeah.

542
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,120
 So really?

543
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,400
 Is that why the sheep look so pale?

544
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,480
 It's still there.

545
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,160
 So basically, Britain detonated an atomic bomb

546
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,000
 in the '50s, 1952.

547
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,880
 A few tests and things like that.

548
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,520
 Yeah, exactly.

549
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,480
 We had some tests.

550
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,320
 And the pre-test was done at this place, Orford Ness.

551
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,960
 And the reason that it was done there

552
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,000
 is what they did was they built these big kind of buildings

553
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,520
 that would go into the ground.

554
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,920
 And the bombs were effectively being tested

555
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,960
 for their stress levels.

556
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,880
 So what they did was they put them in the buildings

557
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,440
 and then they just shaped them and just kept shaking them.

558
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,040
 Just shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

559
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,960
 And the idea was if you were transporting

560
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,800
 a nuclear bomb by plane,

561
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,280
 they wanted to make sure that it didn't detonate

562
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,720
 as it was being flown to the place.

563
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,640
 And it didn't detonate purely because of the stress levels

564
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,280
 that it would have.

565
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,800
 So this is where they did it.

566
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,520
 And they still have one of the bombs sitting there.

567
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,400
 It's deactivated.

568
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,360
 OK, I was going to ask that.

569
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
 I was going to take care of you.

570
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,480
 They always use deactivate.

571
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,000
 I mean, yeah, they didn't test it with an armed bomb anyway.

572
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 But it's sitting there next to the sheep.

573
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,360
 I'm going to Orford Ness in a couple of weeks.

574
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,840
 Get out.

575
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,360
 Go shake the bomb.

576
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,760
 I will.

577
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,840
 That's so cool.

578
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,240
 Yeah, the founding story of the National Trust

579
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,840
 is it's got a lot of great characters at its beginning,

580
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,320
 hasn't it?

581
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,640
 So there were three founders.

582
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,080
 It was a lawyer, clergyman, and social reformer.

583
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,440
 Sounds like a savage joke, doesn't it?

584
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,080
 A lawyer, a priest, and a social reformer walking down.

585
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,720
 What happens?

586
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,880
 They make a socially responsible organization.

587
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,040
 But yeah, this woman called Octavia Hill,

588
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,800
 who was the eighth daughter of her father,

589
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,840
 which I always like if you're called Octavia or Tertius

590
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,200
 or whatever, be the eighth.

591
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,400
 Yes.

592
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,640
 And so maybe that's why he had eight daughters,

593
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,840
 so he could call on Octavia.

594
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,520
 And she was amazing.

595
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,240
 She, her parents had sort of set up a school

596
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
 for the poor and stuff and would do good as anyway.

597
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,320
 So she had good examples set for her.

598
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,960
 But then her dad went bankrupt

599
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
 and left the family in the 19th century.

600
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,440
 Maybe.

601
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,120
 Because he had eight children.

602
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,160
 Yeah, he does.

603
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,760
 I've read a story where age 14,

604
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,960
 she was left home alone.

605
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,240
 Her family had gone to church.

606
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,440
 Oh, I know this story, isn't it?

607
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,560
 And two burglars.

608
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,360
 The iron on the face.

609
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,840
 Yes.

610
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:06,840
 Yes.

611
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,080
 And she mutilated them horribly.

612
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,120
 Yes.

613
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,760
 But they came back.

614
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,200
 They came back.

615
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,720
 Now you've said that I think this might have been

616
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,080
 the home alone origin story.

617
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

618
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,720
 Because it was, it was one burglar.

619
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,360
 Oh, seriously?

620
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,960
 Yeah, yeah, one burglar came in,

621
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
 came out, fell out of a cupboard actually.

622
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,320
 She was on the surface of their house.

623
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,720
 He fell out of a cupboard where he'd been hiding.

624
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,080
 And apparently she said,

625
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
 "How did you get in here?"

626
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,960
 And he said, "I walked up the stairs."

627
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,920
 And she just said,

628
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,760
 "Then will you please to walk down them again?"

629
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,920
 And then she led him down the stairs

630
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,880
 and out of the house.

631
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,360
 Wow.

632
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,720
 So that's a much shorter whole load.

633
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,840
 Didn't need a punch up, didn't it,

634
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,680
 for the Macaulay Culkin version.

635
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,200
 But what a compliant burglar,

636
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,560
 like how responsible.

637
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,040
 Yeah.

638
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,240
 To ethical burgling.

639
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,880
 Ethical burgling.

640
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,160
 Like if you ask me nicely.

641
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,520
 I won't do it.

642
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,920
 Yeah.

643
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,560
 And didn't she,

644
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,680
 I think I'm right in saying that

645
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,360
 she later went to New York

646
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,320
 and she got lost.

647
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,880
 Didn't she?

648
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,920
 Yeah, that's right.

649
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,120
 She boarded the wrong plane.

650
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,160
 Yeah, that's right.

651
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,680
 Yeah, Octavia Hill was amazing.

652
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,360
 But I kind of got sidetracked reading about

653
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,760
 the clergyman of the three founders,

654
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,320
 Kenan Hardwick, Drummond Raunsley.

655
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,120
 Which is such an incredible...

656
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,840
 A medieval name.

657
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,800
 Yeah, it is formidable.

658
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,440
 So he was a bishop from Lincolnshire.

659
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,240
 He was described as the most active volcano in Europe

660
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,040
 by one of his parishioners,

661
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,080
 because he was so energetic, involved, always,

662
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,960
 coming up with new schemes and committees and plans

663
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,280
 and projects and papers and all of this,

664
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,200
 constantly writing and thinking and meeting.

665
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,440
 But his main interest, as far as I can tell,

666
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,040
 seems to be building bonfires.

667
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,920
 He had this huge passion about bonfires.

668
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,080
 So there was a diamond jubilee for Queen Victoria in 1897,

669
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,720
 I guess it would have been.

670
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,360
 Six of them.

671
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,040
 Yeah, and he was the head of something

672
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,720
 called the National Bonfire Committee.

673
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,640
 He basically spent his whole time

674
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,720
 suggesting huge bonfires at any opportunity,

675
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,000
 any national opportunity.

676
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,840
 So when the First World War ended, 1919,

677
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,600
 they had huge bonfires everywhere.

678
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,920
 Coronation in 1911, huge bonfires.

679
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,480
 So how many national trust properties

680
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,680
 did he burn down, of course,

681
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,640
 when he found the organization?

682
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,960
 It's just amazing, these huge towers of work.

683
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,880
 The coronation ones in 1911 are so impressively massive,

684
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,160
 and he organized 2,200 of them across the entire country.

685
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,680
 It was a mega theme of his life.

686
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,160
 Really?

687
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,320
 Yeah.

688
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,840
 We should have like a bonfire czar,

689
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,880
 a national bonfire czar.

690
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,920
 Oh, that's such a good idea.

691
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,880
 That's an awesome idea.

692
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,760
 Because we just had the jubilee

693
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,800
 and there were lots of beacons.

694
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,360
 But they were tiny compared with these things.

695
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,920
 I mean...

696
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,320
 I didn't know.

697
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,920
 We're making cuts to the civil service.

698
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,320
 I'm not sure we're talking about the bonfire czar

699
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,600
 and Boris's vision.

700
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,480
 Just back to Octavia for one second,

701
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,760
 because I think it's worth mentioning

702
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,480
 there's quite a lot of descriptions about her character

703
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,640
 and who she was by her friends,

704
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,240
 and I find them such bizarre representations.

705
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,400
 So she had a friend called Henrietta Barnett,

706
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,560
 and Henrietta described her saying

707
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,520
 she was small in stature with a long body and short legs.

708
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,040
 She did not dress.

709
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,400
 She only wore clothes,

710
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,800
 which were often unnecessarily unbecoming.

711
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,640
 Her mouth was large and mobile,

712
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,240
 but not improved by laughter.

713
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,280
 Really quite cutting stuff.

714
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,720
 And one of her friends writing this thing.

715
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,120
 Yeah, it was her friend.

716
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,640
 Gertrude Bell had a comment about her

717
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,560
 saying she was despotic.

718
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,640
 So not a great review.

719
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,240
 And the Bishop of London,

720
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,520
 who was called Frederick Temple,

721
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,680
 he had a meeting with her,

722
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,800
 and afterwards he wrote,

723
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,320
 she spoke for half an hour,

724
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,640
 "I never had such a beating in my life."

725
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,120
 Really?

726
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,520
 Yeah.

727
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,280
 So, you know, it sounds like she was really,

728
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,880
 you know, sort of confident.

729
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,480
 She was formidable, definitely.

730
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,440
 But then I was reading a lot of--

731
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,800
 Just quick nominative determinism.

732
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,320
 Sorry, Bishop called Frederick Temple.

733
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,880
 Yes, yes.

734
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,760
 That's nice.

735
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,400
 Good pause.

736
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,640
 Thank you.

737
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,360
 The pause for that.

738
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,560
 Octavia Hill as well.

739
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,600
 Hill National Trust.

740
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,720
 Because the first thing that was donated

742
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,560
 to the National Trust was a hillside.

743
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,040
 Really?

744
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,760
 Yeah.

745
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,360
 By someone called Fanny Tolbert.

746
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,200
 But you know that one of the,

747
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,040
 the lawyer that was one of the trio

748
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,080
 was Robert Hunter.

749
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,600
 He's a lawyer.

750
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,400
 Lawyers are like hunters.

751
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,200
 They're like, "Find it."

752
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
 And you stretched it too far, Bobby.

753
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:53,880
 I'm sorry.

754
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,480
 Yeah, that's one too.

755
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:55,880
 It's okay.

756
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,680
 You're new to the show.

757
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,080
 It's fine.

758
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,360
 You'll find your seat.

759
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,240
 You've lost everyone.

760
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,520
 Beatrix Potter too.

761
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,800
 I'm sure you guys came across this.

762
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,600
 Yeah.

763
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,640
 What did you just say?

764
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,920
 Beatrix Potter.

765
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,400
 Well, what's her--

766
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,200
 I'm sure you guys came across--

767
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,680
 Beatrix.

768
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,360
 He pronouncing her name in a really odd way.

769
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,480
 Oh, God, oh, God.

770
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,920
 I've said all my life is Beatrix Potter.

771
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,200
 Beatrix, I think Beatrix Potter.

772
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,840
 Beatrix.

773
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,480
 Yes, Beatrix.

774
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,360
 What did you say?

775
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,160
 Beatrix.

776
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,840
 Oh, like, you know, beetroot.

777
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,880
 Yeah, I guess.

778
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,440
 People are going to have an absolute field day with that.

779
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,040
 Yeah, well, get over it, guys.

780
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,480
 I say Beatrix.

781
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,480
 I'm sorry, come on.

782
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,280
 Christ.

783
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,240
 She donated so much to the National Trust.

784
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,520
 She'd made 4,000 acres after the success of Jemima Puddleduck

785
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,120
 and Mr. Jeremy Fisher and all of that.

786
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,600
 She just devoted her time to breeding sheep.

787
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,480
 Sorry, Puddleduck?

788
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,400
 Oh, God, how do I--

789
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,120
 How are you meant to pronounce it?

790
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,160
 Well, that's just another--

791
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,360
 Jemima Puddleduck, yeah?

792
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,040
 Do you not know Jemima Puddleduck?

793
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,760
 No.

794
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,440
 Oh, that's a character.

795
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,320
 That's a character.

796
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,200
 We've been in the--

797
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,240
 19th century reform.

798
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,800
 Prison reforms, particularly.

799
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,040
 Founder of the National Trust, I thought we were saying.

800
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,160
 She advocated, I think, for free bread for everybody.

801
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,880
 Yeah.

802
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,200
 Yeah.

803
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,680
 Near, like, watering holes.

804
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,040
 Oh, come on.

805
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,480
 Who gives a duck a surname?

806
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,400
 That's unfair.

807
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,120
 Oh, my God.

808
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:17,880
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

809
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,040
 My fact is that the French-speaking clock

810
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,760
 was created by an astronomer who was annoyed

811
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,080
 that members of the public kept phoning his office

812
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,680
 to ask for the time, which would be annoying.

813
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,680
 So this was from an article in The Times,

814
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,240
 which was about the fact that the French-speaking clock,

815
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,960
 l'horloge parallelante, is winding down, and winding up,

816
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,680
 and closing down.

817
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,960
 Clock related things, yeah.

818
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,800
 It's the oldest speaking clock in the world, I think,

819
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,640
 or it was the first one founded,

820
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,160
 and it was pioneered by a man called Ernest Esquelongan

821
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,400
 in 1933, who was a French astronomer,

822
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,120
 and I think was at the sort of official,

823
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,160
 you know, the government.

824
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,880
 He was the director of the Paris Observatory.

825
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,440
 Oh, there we go.

826
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,000
 OK, yeah.

827
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,240
 And people kept ringing up to ask the time,

828
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,400
 because that was one of the ways, before speaking

829
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,800
 clocks existed, you verified the absolute nailed-on time,

830
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,480
 was you phoned an astronomer, and his phone line

831
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,080
 was constantly busy with people phoning up,

832
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,680
 and his office staff were always being distracted

833
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,160
 by people saying, yeah, it's 1033 and a bit.

834
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,400
 So that was the inspiration.

835
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,520
 I love the idea that maybe he spotted an oncoming comet,

836
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,040
 you know, crashing into Earth,

837
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,280
 and he just wasn't able to notify anyone.

838
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,960
 Did he have, then, a reliable clock in front of him

839
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,960
 that he set, or would he, how was he telling the time?

840
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,040
 I don't know, I think it would have been,

841
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,440
 that's where the official time-keeping device

842
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,560
 for the country was kept.

843
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,120
 That's where it started.

844
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,960
 I think the Paris Observatory was where it was.

845
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,360
 Yeah.

846
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,200
 More like the way that Greenwich were the official stewards

847
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,960
 of, you know, official time.

848
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,560
 Because there was huge rivalry, time-wise,

849
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,520
 between Britain and France.

850
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,320
 It's the main beef between us, almost, to this day.

851
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,680
 I would say it wasn't there.

852
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,640
 It was like, where's official time gonna rest?

853
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,880
 And it ended up being Greenwich for the world.

854
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,280
 But I think Paris Observatory was the other big contender.

855
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,560
 I think they defined Greenwich time

856
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,720
 as Paris time minus two and a half minutes,

857
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,240
 or whatever number of minutes it was.

858
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,800
 And they did it so, until about the 1990s,

859
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,240
 like they really dug their heels in on Greenwich time, yeah.

860
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,600
 So this clock, the first speaking clock in France,

861
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,480
 it was the 14th of February, 1933, when it debuted.

862
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,920
 And on its very first day.

863
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,200
 Oh, it's romantic.

864
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,400
 That's true, yeah.

865
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,120
 That's lovely.

866
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,560
 So 140,000 people called up,

867
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,360
 or rather recalled up, trying to hear it,

868
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,320
 because they could only get 20,000 answers

869
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,440
 during the course of the day,

870
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,840
 because they had 20 lines that were doing it.

871
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,400
 So that might have been one person just recalling,

872
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,600
 just desperate to hear it.

873
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,720
 But yeah, incredible.

874
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,840
 Very lonely people on Valentine's Day that year.

875
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,560
 When you were children,

876
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,480
 did you ever call up the one, two, three number?

877
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
 In the UK, we've got like a one, two, three number.

878
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,440
 I used to annoy my parents.

879
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,040
 I used to call them up on the number.

880
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,360
 And you'd hear like, at the third stroke, the time would be,

881
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
 and then 10 seconds later, I'd call again,

882
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,960
 and then my parents would get like an enormous bill.

883
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,640
 It was so expensive.

884
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,840
 So expensive.

885
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,640
 But in the UK, I think is the BT speaking clock.

886
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,000
 And at some stage, they called it,

887
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,680
 I think they called it timeline,

888
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,120
 or they called it Tim for short,

889
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,280
 because for the major cities,

890
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,960
 if you're trying to get the time,

891
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,040
 you dial 846, which T-I-M would be on that.

892
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,600
 Oh, so good.

893
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,240
 Although, ironically, even though the name was Tim,

894
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,040
 the first two clock speakers in Britain

895
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
 for the last 50 years were females.

896
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,080
 Ethel, Jane Kane, and Miss Pat Simmons.

897
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,200
 But the first one,

898
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,760
 there was an incredible competition to select them.

899
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,640
 So there was a pool of 15,000 telephone operators

900
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,480
 who worked for the general post office.

901
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,640
 And they organized a nationwide competition

902
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,080
 to find the golden voice.

903
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,840
 And a bit like X Factor, or Britain's Got Talent,

904
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,120
 they got like the judges.

905
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,280
 We got the poet laureate, John Mayfield.

906
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,080
 Yay!

907
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,400
 We got the actress, Dame Sybil Thorndike.

908
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,800
 Yay!

909
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,280
 And we got the chief BBC announcer, Stuart Hibbert.

910
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,000
 Yay!

911
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,120
 For this week's edition of The Speaking Clock.

912
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,760
 Yeah.

913
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
 Who will win this week?

914
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,360
 Awesome.

915
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,160
 Proper competition.

916
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,240
 It was so eminent, the panel.

917
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,560
 Yeah.

918
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,600
 You're a poet laureate.

919
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,160
 I know.

920
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,320
 And Sybil Thorndike, who's a famous name even today.

921
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,880
 Who's that?

922
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,680
 I actually don't know, Sybil.

923
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
 Just an incredibly famous actress from the time

924
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,160
 of, you know, a great heroine of stage, basically.

925
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,480
 Right.

926
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,160
 Because I think she was a bit pre-screen, almost.

927
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,960
 Yeah.

928
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,120
 But then you've got the crap one on the end.

929
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,960
 Is there one of those in X Factor, the one who's like

930
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
 the expert but no one cares about them?

931
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,600
 Someone called Mrs. Atkinson and Lord Eiley

932
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,120
 rounded out the committee in 1936.

933
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,320
 But so they always have a kind of fancy panel of judges,

934
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,040
 which I love.

935
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
 So I think we're only on the fifth voice

936
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,120
 of The Speaking Clock now, the official Speaking Clock.

937
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,920
 They always have a fancy panel who choose.

938
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,240
 And I think the panel these days always includes

939
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,800
 the previous Speaking Clock voice, if you see what I mean.

940
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,600
 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

941
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,120
 They sign up too.

942
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,880
 So it was a guy called Brian Cobby, who was on the committee

943
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 in 2006 when they were picking the new voice.

944
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,120
 But he had been the voice for the previous 20 years.

945
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,320
 So they had him, the current voice, Natasha Kaplinsky.

946
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,000
 Newsreader.

947
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,560
 Newsreader.

948
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,320
 And strictly come dancing.

949
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,160
 Yeah, did she win the first, or was she in the first season?

950
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,520
 She was in the first season, certainly.

951
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,360
 I don't know if she, this was pre or post her strictly triumph.

952
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,560
 So she knows how to read stuff.

953
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,240
 I guess she knows what a good voice sounds like.

954
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,480
 I know.

955
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,960
 And the other voices, the other members of the panel included

956
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,640
 the guy who voiced the National Lottery.

957
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,840
 Oh, okay.

958
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,600
 47.

959
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,680
 Yeah, exactly, reading numbers.

960
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,160
 Exactly, reading numbers is basically that's the gig.

961
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,880
 My dream job.

962
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,240
 Who can read numbers best?

963
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,760
 You're going to get the Lottery guy.

964
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,560
 And then a couple of others.

965
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,160
 But it wasn't the Poet Laureate.

966
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,440
 You know, you mentioned Brian Cobby because I found

967
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,240
 unsubstantiated claims that at one stage,

968
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,080
 he may have been the person that did

969
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,920
 the voiceover to the Thunderbirds 5.

970
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,400
 I read that, yeah.

971
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,680
 But I think the Thunderbirds, the main creator says it wasn't him,

972
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
 but Brian Cobby claims it was him.

973
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,440
 Interesting.

974
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,400
 Okay, controls it.

975
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,360
 What's happened there?

976
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,480
 It's quite a strange thing to claim if it wasn't you, isn't it?

977
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,720
 Well, you might think it like, you know,

978
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,680
 Brian Blessed claims that he was the voice of Tarzan's

979
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,800
 "oh, oh, oh" when Johnny Weismiller couldn't do it anymore.

980
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
 But is that true?

981
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,120
 I don't know.

982
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,400
 Is it a Brian thing?

983
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,960
 Brian's just makeup random shit themselves.

984
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,320
 When Cobby recorded his script.

985
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,760
 So he started in 1985.

986
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,640
 I really like this.

987
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,520
 So you don't have to do 24 hours, obviously.

988
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,560
 You just, there's a limited number of numbers

989
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,480
 that you have to record.

990
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,800
 And that's something like 86 different prompts.

991
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,840
 But you have to record, you know, for about an hour, I think.

992
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,560
 Oh, okay.

993
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,960
 But the script that Cobby recorded was about 33 pages

994
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,120
 with various different things on it, you know, that you have to.

995
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,080
 But amazingly, they spent a while in the recording studio.

996
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,840
 They sent him home and then they had to summon him back

997
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,760
 because they forgot to record the o'clock.

998
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,240
 You only need that once.

999
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,640
 Oh, okay.

1000
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,160
 But it is important.

1001
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,360
 It is important, yeah.

1002
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,920
 You need it for the beats because when it's on the hour,

1003
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,760
 because usually it'll be, you know, it's one and 24 minutes.

1004
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,960
 Oh, yeah.

1005
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,680
 Do they say precisely at that when it's like a round time?

1006
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,320
 Yeah, exactly.

1007
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,960
 They do, yeah, yeah.

1008
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,400
 Two o'clock precisely.

1009
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,600
 Yes, precisely.

1010
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,040
 That's what everyone loved about the first reader was her precisely.

1011
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,920
 Oh, really?

1012
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,560
 Yeah, that was the famous, yeah, the famous word.

1013
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,240
 The most, her most famous word.

1014
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,160
 Can I ask, did they like it because it sounded quite sexy?

1015
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,840
 Is that, is that what you were trying to?

1016
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,200
 Get your brain out of the gutter.

1017
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,720
 Just curious, like, you know, sometimes people with sexy accents,

1018
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
 you know, can make any word sound sexy.

1019
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,440
 I'm sure there were people on Valentine's Day who did ring up,

1020
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,920
 you know, you know, I don't know, cock in hands.

1021
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,120
 I do like the use of the word sexy.

1022
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,480
 I do like the use of the word sexy for time because time is based on base 60.

1023
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,040
 And sex, sex, sex, yeah.

1024
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,680
 Sex adjustable is the, is the word.

1025
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,480
 That is very sexy.

1026
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,520
 You need a sexy voice.

1027
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,240
 Sexy time.

1028
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,800
 Yeah, yeah.

1029
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,480
 And that's the joke you were making, wasn't it?

1030
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,440
 Exactly.

1031
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,880
 I knew that we had the mathematician in.

1032
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,560
 I thought, I'm just going to leave that.

1033
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,400
 She, Ethel Cain, she had a speech impediment,

1034
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,160
 which they didn't notice when they were recording it.

1035
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,720
 She had a slight speech impediment.

1036
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,160
 She whistled a bit at the end of each word.

1037
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,000
 It's two o'clock.

1038
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,080
 And that's where the cuckoo clock comes from.

1039
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,200
 Yeah, but they didn't notice in the recording.

1040
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,560
 So it must have been quite slight.

1041
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,400
 And then they spent, they decided,

1042
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,280
 because the clock ran on these beautiful glass discs.

1043
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,240
 I have read about it.

1044
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,160
 I don't understand fully the mechanism they used,

1045
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,560
 but they had to take the glass discs out of the machine

1046
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,040
 and edit them.

1047
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
 And it took about a year to fix this.

1048
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,840
 How to get through the water.

1049
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,800
 Very minor thing.

1050
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,440
 No way.

1051
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,240
 Yeah, way.

1052
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,760
 She can say the word precisely.

1053
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,360
 Is that the word precisely?

1054
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,560
 Precisely, yeah.

1055
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,240
 Down at the other end of the line.

1056
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,480
 So in the 1970s, I think 1971,

1057
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,080
 the UK experienced decimalization.

1058
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,920
 So we lost the imperial system.

1059
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,120
 Not lost, we had imperial with the decimals as well.

1060
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,200
 But in 1975.

1061
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,240
 Much longer though.

1062
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,360
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,400
 Oh, I missed my ounces and my miles and...

1064
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,320
 Farthings.

1065
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,040
 Farthings, hogs, heads.

1066
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,920
 Kenny Farthings.

1067
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,680
 So in 1975, in a Northern Ireland BBC programme

1068
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,480
 called Scene Around Six, they had a newscast.

1069
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
 And it started off saying,

1070
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,000
 "It looks a lot more frightening than it actually is,

1071
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,600
 but the government's preparing people

1072
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,880
 for the phased introduction of the decimalization of time.

1073
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,080
 You need to get dual standard timepieces.

1074
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,840
 There'll be 100 seconds to a minute,

1075
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,320
 100 minutes to the hour, 20 hours per day."

1076
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,800
 But it was the first of April, 1970.

1077
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,240
 Oh, so good.

1078
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,760
 Meanies, those meanies at the BBC.

1079
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,600
 They said, "You'll take 10 years for this to come through,

1080
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,720
 so don't panic right now."

1081
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,520
 Yes.

1082
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:34,760
 Wow.

1083
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,640
 I mean, that's brilliant.

1084
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,920
 Do we know if people believed it?

1085
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,600
 It was a BBC broadcast, the Scene Around Six,

1086
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,120
 so people wouldn't...

1087
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,240
 I thought the French government

1088
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,520
 actually did something similar with the calendar, didn't they?

1089
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,200
 The French Revolutionary Calendar.

1090
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,960
 They wanted to, yeah.

1091
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,080
 And I think they might have even tried...

1092
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,360
 But they did an April first.

1093
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,800
 No, it wasn't an April first.

1094
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
 It was just do this or you get your head chopped off thing.

1095
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,120
 Napoleon loved a joke.

1096
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,160
 What if the French Revolution

1097
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,640
 was just an April Fool's that got badly out of hand?

1098
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,320
 Guys, we were joking.

1099
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,280
 What if it was No King?

1100
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,080
 Say No King.

1101
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,040
 I said joking.

1102
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,760
 Oh, God.

1103
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,240
 The people who do the speaking clock just quickly on that,

1104
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,240
 sorry, back to my obsession, Brian Cobby, who I love.

1105
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,640
 Bizarrely, two out of the five of them have been from Hove.

1106
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,360
 Okay.

1107
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,080
 I don't...

1108
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,000
 I'm not suggesting any conspiracy or anything like that,

1109
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,280
 but I just find that quite weird.

1110
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,040
 They always have loads of finalists, by the way.

1111
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,280
 The last time they did it, there were 15 finalists,

1112
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,920
 which is so many for the judges to listen to.

1113
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,360
 But when Brian Cobby got the job,

1114
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,520
 the runner-up was Lady from Lowestoft,

1115
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,120
 and she got the consolation prize.

1116
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,560
 Can you guess what the consolation prize

1117
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,840
 for this specific job would be?

1118
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,960
 Doing the London Underground announcement.

1119
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,000
 Not bad, very close.

1120
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,480
 That's good.

1121
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,520
 Oh, doing like a Sainsbury's announcement,

1122
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,160
 you know, sort of aisle six needs.

1123
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,520
 That's very close.

1124
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,880
 Okay, I'll tell you.

1125
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,600
 She got...

1126
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,960
 You will all have heard this.

1127
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,880
 The runner-up became the voice of,

1128
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,040
 "The number you have called has not been recognised."

1129
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,920
 No!

1130
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,240
 Yeah!

1131
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,400
 That is...

1132
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,120
 Oh, my God, and the most terrifying words

1133
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,120
 you can ever hear as a child.

1134
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,640
 Was she the person who did the...

1135
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,920
 When he did 1471 as well?

1136
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,880
 Oh, I don't know.

1137
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,360
 Because I think...

1138
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,480
 You were called today at 1722.

1139
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,200
 Oh, I think you might...

1140
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,080
 It is a similar voice.

1141
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,560
 I think it might be.

1142
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,360
 I think it might be,

1143
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,680
 because I always found that the most terrifying thing was...

1144
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,800
 Really? I found it quite sexy.

1145
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,680
 What? Do I have to have found it?

1146
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,440
 Gosh! Oh, God, damn!

1147
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,400
 So, do you have this in Australia?

1148
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,560
 When you did 1471, if someone called,

1149
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,320
 you're alone in the house, you're 12.

1150
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,160
 And usually it would be,

1151
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
 "You were called today by this number."

1152
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,000
 And then, one in ten times it would go,

1153
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,800
 "You were called today at 1700 hours.

1154
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,400
 The caller withheld their number."

1155
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,040
 Do you have to...?

1156
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,320
 Do you have to...?

1157
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,760
 Why would they do such a terrifying...

1158
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,680
 Look in the cupboard on the third floor.

1159
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,400
 Yeah, yeah.

1160
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,360
 The ethical burglars would be fine.

1161
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,600
 I was just generally looking into interesting clocks,

1162
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,880
 not just speaking clocks.

1163
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,440
 Okay.

1164
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,240
 Can I give you a couple of interesting normal clocks?

1165
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,440
 Are they sexy clocks to go with this new facet

1166
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,080
 of your personality?

1167
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,280
 I'll let you be the judge, yeah.

1168
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,320
 I'll let you be the judge.

1169
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,240
 Now, I was reading that Windsor Castle,

1170
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,320
 so on the Queen's staff,

1171
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,440
 is an actual clock man who goes around every single day

1172
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,400
 checking out all of the clocks within the Windsor Estate,

1173
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,520
 which is up to 400.

1174
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,560
 There's 250 clocks within the castle itself.

1175
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,720
 If he looks at his, you know, pedometer,

1176
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,320
 he gets 16,000 steps in every single day.

1177
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,800
 Yeah, and the clocks there are absolutely amazing.

1178
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,040
 So there's your normal clocks,

1179
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,720
 but you've got historical clocks, right?

1180
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,120
 So my favorite one is that there was a clock

1181
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,480
 that was made by Charles Clay in 1740,

1182
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,600
 and it plays melodies by the composer Handel.

1183
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,000
 And four of the songs that it plays

1184
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,800
 were composed specifically by Handel for this clock.

1185
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,040
 So they're original pieces.

1186
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,320
 They worked in collaboration,

1187
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,760
 and I think they made a few of these

1188
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,280
 that went out to different royal families

1189
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,400
 all through Europe.

1190
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,800
 And it's just an extraordinary thing

1191
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,640
 that has pipes underneath it and so on

1192
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,560
 that plays out the tunes.

1193
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,000
 And they have all sorts of clocks like this

1194
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,680
 that have historical relevance within the castle itself.

1195
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,160
 Yeah.

1196
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,800
 Can I tell you one more weird time?

1197
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,920
 It's actually not a time thing.

1198
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,320
 It's just a weird, disappointed speaking voice thing,

1199
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,240
 which is an innovation in Tokyo.

1200
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,200
 It's a toilet that has just been launched in Tokyo

1201
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,600
 where you don't need to touch anything.

1202
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,120
 How do you wipe your bum?

1203
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,240
 Okay, you might need to do one thing.

1204
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,760
 You just stand and just water it.

1205
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,640
 Fully the pumps come.

1206
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,160
 Because there are lots of studies

1207
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,840
 that show that when people use public toilets,

1208
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,600
 they kind of avoid using their hands.

1209
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,320
 They'll step on the lever,

1210
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,280
 which is actually a reason why you would need to step on the lever

1211
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
 if the previous 50 people have all stepped on it.

1212
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,240
 No, anyway.

1213
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,120
 So you walk in and you just say, "Hi, toilet."

1214
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,040
 And it kind of responds.

1215
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,480
 So if it gives you a menu of actions,

1216
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,760
 you can flush the toilet.

1217
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,720
 Hello, Andy.

1218
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,160
 Back again.

1219
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,560
 Sexy toilet.

1220
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,800
 I don't know what you could say.

1221
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,040
 I don't know if you could say, "Get my knob out."

1222
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
 I don't know how to do that, but it's...

1223
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,640
 So how's it work?

1224
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,200
 You say, "Turn on the tap or flush the toilet."

1225
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,440
 So that's the hands-free element of the system.

1226
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,920
 Okay.

1227
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,680
 I think it may even be able to raise and lower the seat.

1228
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,400
 I'm not sure.

1229
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,840
 But you've still got to sit on the seat,

1230
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,960
 which is, I would argue,

1231
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,680
 largely the biggest bit of touching that happens in the...

1232
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,600
 You can hover slightly above it.

1233
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,080
 Can you?

1234
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,000
 I don't have the thym muscles to achieve that, I'm afraid.

1235
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,360
 You lay the lube all down on the seat.

1236
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,640
 I cover the whole thing.

1237
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,360
 But you can do well.

1238
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,720
 You can lay it and hover.

1239
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
 Feel like doubly pretend.

1240
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,280
 Double say.

1241
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,760
 Well, I mean, we have those anyway.

1242
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,040
 We have toilets where...

1243
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,320
 Which is so irritating.

1244
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,360
 Voice-activated ones.

1245
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,760
 No, no, but as in we have the non-touch version,

1246
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,040
 which I hate, which is the ones

1247
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,120
 where when you stand up, they flush off their own accord.

1248
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,120
 So, you know, sometimes it'll just stand up to turn around

1249
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,560
 a bit to wipe your bum, whatever,

1250
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,960
 or to hang up your coat halfway through a wee,

1251
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,880
 and then it flushes itself.

1252
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,600
 Mid-wee.

1253
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,160
 Mid-wee, I'm just going to hold this in,

1254
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,360
 take my coat off, hang it up.

1255
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,480
 It's going to practice.

1256
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,640
 It's like clench those muscles.

1257
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,000
 Is this at home where you're hanging out?

1258
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,920
 Are you going out the toilet to the hangar in the hall?

1259
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:25,800
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1260
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,560
 and that is Anna.

1261
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,040
 My fact this week is that Spain's gold reserves

1262
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,200
 can only be accessed via drawbridge.

1263
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,520
 It's very cool.

1264
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,840
 And they have a dragon as well, don't they?

1265
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,480
 Yeah, they do.

1266
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,520
 The other end of the drawbridge, yeah.

1267
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,720
 And a trumpeter, like, doodly-doodly.

1268
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,200
 This is most of Spain's gold,

1269
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,760
 which is in a bank of Spain vault in Madrid,

1270
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,160
 and it's very well protected,

1271
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,320
 as a lot of gold reserves are,

1272
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,080
 but it's such a cool setup.

1273
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,760
 So, to get to the gold reserves,

1274
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,280
 you have to penetrate three massive steel doors,

1275
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,840
 and they waste, like, the first door weighs 16 tons,

1276
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,360
 which is about eight hippos' worth.

1277
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,720
 And also, they fit so well,

1278
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,240
 so when the door closes,

1279
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,880
 it fits so tightly that, according to the bank,

1280
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,440
 even if, like, a tiny bit of fluff got in there,

1281
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,280
 it would sense it and would not be able to close.

1282
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,760
 It would say, you know, you've got to get rid of that fluff.

1283
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,600
 Anyway, once you've got through these doors,

1284
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,360
 then you go down a 35-meter elevator shaft underground,

1285
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,000
 and you're let out, I think you walk through a tunnel,

1286
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,600
 and then you've got to cross a drawbridge.

1287
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,400
 So, a drawbridge has to be let down over a moat.

1288
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,560
 It's not a moat, it's just a ditch.

1289
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,080
 And I think it's about three or four meters drop.

1290
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,200
 Yeah, OK.

1291
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,760
 But I struggled to find, like, obviously, pictures

1292
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,280
 are quite limited with this kind of thing,

1293
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,800
 they're quite signature about it.

1294
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,760
 And once you've got through the retractable drawbridge,

1295
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,880
 you've got the gold.

1296
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,240
 No, there's another door, isn't there?

1297
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,000
 Oh, then there is another door, one of the last doors.

1298
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,080
 Yeah, and there's two people standing outside,

1299
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,840
 telling you a riddle, and you have two.

1300
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,240
 But I love the way they, because they have,

1301
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,120
 it's not just a ditch,

1302
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,800
 they have a mechanism for filling that ditch with water.

1303
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,600
 So, the entire vault is under,

1304
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,280
 obviously, under the city surface,

1305
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,840
 but it's under, there's a subterranean canal

1306
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,680
 which flows along beneath the city,

1307
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,440
 and then the vault is beneath that.

1308
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,760
 And so, if they need to flood it at any point,

1309
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,920
 they just divert a bit of the subterranean canal,

1310
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,360
 which will then slosh down into the drawbridge area,

1311
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,880
 and then completely flood that,

1312
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,560
 so there's no way of getting in or out.

1313
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,280
 Unless you're a fish.

1314
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,480
 Unless you're a fish.

1315
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,160
 A trained fish.

1316
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,040
 A goldfish.

1317
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,240
 Yeah, oh, wow.

1318
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,200
 Very nice.

1319
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,880
 Got to watch out for them.

1320
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,440
 Is it possible that this is just all made up?

1321
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,440
 It's just in someone's back garden, isn't it?

1322
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,040
 Yeah, it's just a tiny, like a hotel safe,

1323
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,200
 you know, with just four punched numbers in.

1324
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,000
 Have they just created a myth so that we think,

1325
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,440
 "Whoa, it's like Area 51."

1326
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,920
 Those are impossible, the hotel safe I find to get into.

1327
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,480
 I have a curious knack of like locking myself out

1328
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,040
 before I've put any of my stuff in the safe.

1329
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,640
 I have to call someone at reception,

1330
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,680
 and this is the whole thing.

1331
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,960
 What do you, what kind of,

1332
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,480
 do you put your stuff in the hotel safe?

1333
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,240
 Your paranoid Android?

1334
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,040
 Yeah, of course I do.

1335
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,600
 Do you?

1336
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,960
 Passport, money belt.

1337
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,960
 Travelers checks.

1338
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,840
 And pack.

1339
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,640
 Penny pack.

1340
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,920
 She's already talking about those locks.

1341
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,280
 Can I just, as a mathematician,

1342
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,960
 raise a bugbear about terminology.

1343
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,040
 So you know these locks, bicycle locks?

1344
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,080
 What do you call them?

1345
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,040
 A combination lock.

1346
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,400
 Yeah, combination.

1347
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,480
 So if, imagine the combination was one, nine, eight, four,

1348
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,360
 like Orwell book.

1349
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,240
 My birth year.

1350
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,680
 Oh, or yes, Orwell's book.

1351
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,640
 But a dystopian year in many ways.

1352
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,600
 Imagine you put one, nine, four, eight.

1353
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,480
 Would it unlock it?

1354
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,680
 Oh, Terry Pratchett's birth year.

1355
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,560
 Oh my God.

1356
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,440
 Why would it not unlock it?

1357
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,640
 I just like a maths lesson here.

1358
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,360
 Why would it not?

1359
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,880
 Because it's in the wrong order.

1360
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,840
 Yeah, correct.

1361
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,240
 Mathematically, one, nine, eight, four,

1362
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,800
 and one, nine, four, eight are the same combination,

1363
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,480
 because combination is just

1364
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,800
 a set of numbers or letters in any order.

1365
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,880
 The word, when they're in the precise order,

1366
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,360
 in the precise numbers, it's a permutation.

1367
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,800
 So actually, you should be called a bloody permutation lock.

1368
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,080
 It's bugged me for years.

1369
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,560
 Wow.

1370
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,880
 Well, I'm so glad you've had a chance to air it.

1371
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,800
 And now we'll all call them permutation locks.

1372
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,480
 That is because James calls a single panini opinion no,

1373
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,280
 and he is going to be absolutely thrilled to hear that it's

1374
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,080
 a permutation lock.

1375
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,120
 This is great.

1376
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,600
 I really want to set James up in some way,

1377
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,120
 like expose him to a combination lock,

1378
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,720
 get him to refer to it as a combination lock.

1379
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,120
 OK, one of us next week picks a combination lock.

1380
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,480
 That, yes.

1381
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,120
 Ah, I don't see that one.

1382
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,400
 Take him down right at the top.

1383
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,120
 Sorry, Polly.

1384
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,600
 Sorry.

1385
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,280
 That's so good.

1386
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,240
 That's great.

1387
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,160
 This bank vault door, the armoured door,

1388
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,520
 in the Madrid vault.

1389
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:30,680
 Yes.

1390
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,960
 There's one extra thing about it,

1391
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,400
 which is that it's constantly covered

1392
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,160
 with a thin layer of Vaseline.

1393
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,960
 Oh, yeah.

1394
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,120
 Just in case you got a bit excited.

1395
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,880
 Just in case--

1396
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,840
 Wait, is that a talking vault?

1397
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,080
 Sexy talking vault.

1398
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,760
 Dan turns up with his robbery tools in one hand.

1399
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,240
 Did you get the gold?

1400
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,680
 Actually, I got a bit distracted.

1401
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,520
 But it stops it rusting because it's made of steel,

1402
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,200
 but not stainless steel.

1403
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,080
 And so it constantly has to be very slightly protected

1404
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,360
 from rusting.

1405
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,680
 And someone's job is to apply Vaseline.

1406
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,320
 There must be.

1407
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,240
 Like basically a vault goblin.

1408
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,480
 A huge tub of Vaseline.

1409
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,000
 Every day.

1410
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,320
 Smooth as hands on earth.

1411
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,000
 Welcome.

1412
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,600
 Remove the fluff, then apply the Vaseline.

1413
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,080
 Yes.

1414
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,360
 Fluff on the door.

1415
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,000
 Very bad.

1416
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:31,160
 I could find out why they're not stainless steel.

1417
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,160
 It says everywhere they've got steel,

1418
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,120
 but it's not stainless.

1419
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,760
 So you need Vaseline.

1420
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,120
 Did they just cock it up at first?

1421
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,760
 Maybe it's old.

1422
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,560
 It's an old door pre stainless steel process.

1423
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,360
 I mean, lots of bank vault doors are very elderly

1424
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,560
 because, you know, you make them once.

1425
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,200
 Yeah.

1426
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,520
 Or--

1427
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,160
 I don't know.

1428
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,520
 Is it all bullshit with the draw bridges?

1429
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,360
 Fucking ditches.

1430
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,800
 Yeah, yeah.

1431
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,680
 Didn't know this before.

1432
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,600
 Gold bars get ultrasound done on them.

1433
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,800
 Like pregnant women.

1434
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,360
 That's right.

1435
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,600
 Yeah.

1436
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,040
 They probe it.

1437
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,720
 And they measure the reflections from the bottom

1438
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,600
 or from within it.

1439
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,920
 And that's because in the early 2000s,

1440
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,400
 there was a panic that gold bars

1441
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,040
 might have been adulterated with tungsten.

1442
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,920
 Because tungsten has very similar density.

1443
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,960
 Really similar density.

1444
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,760
 Oh, really?

1445
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,240
 Yeah.

1446
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,920
 But sound travels at different speeds

1447
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,320
 between through tungsten or through gold.

1448
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,440
 So if you had gold bars which had been adulterated.

1449
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:24,760
 Right.

1450
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,080
 You'd know.

1451
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,720
 Yeah.

1452
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,240
 So when you think of gold vaults,

1453
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,040
 what was it?

1454
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,680
 Bank of England.

1455
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,120
 Any other famous places you can think of?

1456
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,000
 Fort Knox.

1457
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,720
 That's the one.

1458
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,600
 Fort Knox.

1459
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,160
 So I think, yeah, Goldfinger 1964

1460
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,360
 is probably what gave it its prominence.

1461
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,360
 People think it has up to half of the American gold reserves.

1462
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,760
 Wait, sorry.

1463
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,320
 Was that the--

1464
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
 That was the bond plot line for that movie?

1465
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:43,640
 Yes.

1466
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:43,640
 Yes.

1467
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,360
 Fort Knox.

1468
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:44,600
 Right.

1469
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:44,840
 Yes.

1470
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,400
 Yeah.

1471
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,520
 So in--

1472
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,120
 So it was a conspiracy theorist again,

1473
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,400
 like, oh, there's no Fort Knox.

1474
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,200
 There's nothing inside there.

1475
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,560
 There's just like Vaseline and Fluff.

1476
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,360
 But so presidents actually denied access to Fort Knox.

1477
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,920
 Apart from one president, do you know which one?

1478
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,240
 First half of the 20th century.

1479
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,800
 Often known by three initials.

1480
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,920
 OK.

1481
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,400
 FDR.

1482
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,280
 LBJ. FDR, yeah, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

1483
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,040
 So in 1943, he's the only US president to have visited Fort Knox.

1484
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,760
 Really?

1485
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,280
 Because he was concerned that it wasn't secure enough

1486
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,880
 to be protected from foreign invasion

1487
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,120
 if the worst happened in World War II.

1488
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,760
 So he's the only president that we know has visited it.

1489
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,000
 Are they allowed to keep presidents out?

1490
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 I thought the president could basically go where--

1491
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,720
 Yeah.

1492
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,360
 Wherever he liked.

1493
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,320
 They're not giving access to it.

1494
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,280
 But yeah, he's like, wow.

1495
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,680
 I think maybe if they, like, said back to Amateur--

1496
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,840
 I want to see Fort Knox, probably.

1497
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,280
 But he's the only one that we know.

1498
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,160
 That's amazing.

1499
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,640
 But what's even more fascinating is in World War II,

1500
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,600
 they were worried about bombs falling and washing in DC.

1501
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,760
 So actually, they moved things like the originals

1502
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,840
 of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,

1503
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,520
 and the Declaration of Independence to Fort Knox.

1504
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,440
 But even like Winston Churchill got on the act.

1505
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,080
 So our Magna Carta was moved in 19--

1506
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,200
 so the International Magna Carta is like the UK version

1507
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,880
 of the Bill of Rights, 1215.

1508
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,800
 They moved that to Fort Knox.

1509
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,240
 Did they?

1510
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,000
 Because I know we moved our gold to Canada,

1511
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,720
 which I hadn't realized.

1512
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,200
 But it seems like a huge undertaking in the Second World War.

1513
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,320
 But it was sent to Canada,

1514
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,720
 and so the Bank of England vault became a canteen

1515
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,840
 in the Second World War.

1516
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,360
 I've been to the Bank of England canteen.

1517
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:16,920
 Have you?

1518
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,480
 I do.

1519
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,120
 Cool.

1520
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:18,520
 Hang on.

1521
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,160
 So is that--

1522
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,800
 It's not still.

1523
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,360
 The vault hasn't--

1524
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,960
 the vault has been turned back into a vault.

1525
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,000
 Is that back into a vault now?

1526
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,400
 So have you been to the vault that Walter canteen has?

1527
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,800
 I've just been to the actual canteen.

1528
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,080
 Twice.

1529
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,360
 You've had a sandwich at your local branch in Lloyds.

1530
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,880
 They're like, why have you brought all this Vaseline?

1531
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,680
 What's going on?

1532
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,920
 The Bank of England vault key is three feet long.

1533
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,600
 Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1534
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:42,760
 That is--

1535
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,640
 It's gray, isn't it?

1536
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:43,800
 Yeah.

1537
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,680
 It's a real old school.

1538
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,440
 That's wagon and moat style stuff.

1539
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,640
 But is it mainly like--

1540
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,280
 Is it like a--

1541
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:48,840
 It's mainly shaft.

1542
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,520
 Like a javelin stick with one thing at the end?

1543
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,560
 Or is it all the way down?

1544
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,120
 It's not.

1545
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,320
 It's not notched all the way along.

1546
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,520
 Yeah, it's not notched all the way along.

1547
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,480
 That would be amazing.

1548
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,440
 Yeah, that would be really good.

1549
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,240
 That's really funny.

1550
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:57,880
 Yeah.

1551
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,880
 I think it's pretty remarkable, by the way,

1552
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,920
 that the Bank of England, which is in central London,

1553
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,560
 Bank Station is right next to it,

1554
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,760
 if you get on the underground line.

1555
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,760
 In fact, the actual tunnel itself has to take a bend.

1556
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,600
 Next time you're on the underground,

1557
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,960
 you'll notice that there's a turn,

1558
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,040
 and that's because they're going around the vault.

1559
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,920
 It's because they're literally going around the vault.

1560
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,400
 And inside this vault is 400,000 bars of gold.

1561
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,280
 So that's worth over 200 billion,

1562
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,920
 just sitting something like a half-hour's walk

1563
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,200
 from where we are right now.

1564
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,480
 200 billion dollars.

1565
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,520
 Why are you doing in half an hour, guys?

1566
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,680
 I got some Vasili.

1567
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,360
 It is amazing.

1568
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,160
 Yeah.

1569
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,520
 And there are really strict rules

1570
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,240
 about how many layers of gold

1571
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,080
 you can keep in the Bank of England vaults.

1572
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,800
 And this is a big difference between London and New York.

1573
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,960
 So London is mostly on clay.

1574
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,640
 So you're not allowed on most levels

1575
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,320
 to stack the gold higher than four or six pallets.

1576
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,120
 Because it will just start sinking into the ground,

1577
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,160
 and that is a problem.

1578
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,080
 So whereas New York is on granite,

1579
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,160
 and you can store gold as high as you like in there,

1580
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,840
 it will not collapse.

1581
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,320
 Yeah.

1582
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,600
 And I think north of the river in London,

1583
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,440
 generally the surface is stronger.

1584
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,120
 So if Bank of England were south of the river,

1585
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,720
 it would sink even further.

1586
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,680
 Yeah, you're so right,

1587
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,120
 because that's why we could build the underground at a certain level.

1588
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,440
 Is that where there are no underground stops south of the river?

1589
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,640
 That's one of the reasons.

1590
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:23,960
 Really?

1591
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,480
 Yeah, the ground's too soft.

1592
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,760
 Yeah.

1593
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,080
 Just outside of gold, but still with vaults,

1594
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,240
 I was looking into sort of precious items

1595
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,880
 that have been kept in the vaults of our world.

1596
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,480
 And it's stuff that is kind of seen

1597
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,320
 as the precious secrets of our world.

1598
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,960
 So for example, the formula for Coca-Cola,

1599
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,120
 supposedly kept in a bank vault.

1600
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,720
 Equals MC Square.

1601
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,840
 Well, not Equals MC Square,

1602
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:50,040
 but because Einstein's eyeballs are in a safe deposit box in New York.

1603
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,080
 Do you remember after he died,

1604
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,000
 there was a surgeon who took his brain away

1605
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,120
 and took his eyes and took it.

1606
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,560
 And so the eyeballs are still not been...

1607
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,360
 I thought it was just his brain.

1608
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,040
 No, his eyeballs are sitting in a vault

1609
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,600
 or a safe deposit in a bank vault.

1610
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,640
 They must be preserved.

1611
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,000
 Like, they can't just be loose in a box.

1612
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 I think they're probably in from Aldehyde,

1613
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,040
 sitting in a little beaker, I imagine.

1614
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,600
 I didn't know.

1615
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,840
 Was that because they had to get the brain out the eye sockets?

1616
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,320
 Do you think?

1617
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:11,400
 I think...

1618
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,840
 They had to remove the doors first.

1619
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,360
 I think once you're just collecting bits of them,

1620
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,960
 you might as well grab them while you're there, right?

1621
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,320
 It's, you know...

1622
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,600
 That's so creepy.

1623
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,560
 Yeah, it is creepy.

1624
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,120
 Dr. Pepper, the formula for Dr. Pepper,

1625
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,720
 that's sitting in a vault somewhere.

1626
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,320
 The secret ingredients of how you make WD-40

1627
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,680
 are sitting in a vault.

1628
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,200
 And they were moved once,

1629
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,280
 which was on the product's 50th birthday.

1630
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,320
 The guy who took it was the CEO, Gary Ridge,

1631
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,400
 who rode on a horse through Times Square

1632
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,160
 while wearing a suit of armour

1633
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,280
 and holding the secret ingredients to WD-40.

1634
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,920
 No.

1635
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,280
 Before he reached the drawbridge, yeah.

1636
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,320
 He's here.

1637
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,680
 That's incredible.

1638
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,200
 But it wouldn't have been possible

1639
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,400
 to rob him, actually, on that occasion,

1640
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,480
 because he'd been so thoroughly lubricated.

1641
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,000
 In the armour.

1642
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,440
 The robbers would just slide off.

1643
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:03,960
 Okay, that's it.

1644
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,160
 That is all of our facts.

1645
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,760
