00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi everyone, just to let you know, we've got a very special guest on our show today.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.480
 It is one of Britain's top nerds.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.440
 Oh, is it me?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.320
 It's even more top than you, James Harkin.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.720
 You're not even supposed to be doing this bit.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.440
 Oh yeah, sorry.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.280
 I know you look, you're very welcome.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.120
 It is Bobby Seagull.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.800
 He's not only a math teacher, you might know him from University Challenge,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.920
 where he came to prominence.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.160
 He's a TV presenter.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.280
 He's written a book called The Life Changing Magic of Numbers,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.400
 which will change your life.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.440
 You should definitely get it.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.520
 And he's also written The Monkman and Seagull Quiz Book.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.240
 He's a brilliant guy, full of interesting nerdy facts.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.200
 He now co-hosts the Mass Appeal podcast, but today he's on ours.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 Yes, and I'm not on ours.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.880
 So I'm not even sure why I'm here to be.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.840
 Oh, I know I am here.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 I'm here to remind you that we are going on tour in the autumn

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.280
 and in the last day of summer, if this is how you count your seasons.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.040
 Basically the 31st of August, we're going to be in Inverness.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.360
 Then we're going to be in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Cardiff.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.920
 If you're in any of those places, come and watch our show.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.600
 It's going to be so much fun, loads of facts, loads of silliness.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.320
 We just can't wait to be back on tour again.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.800
 That's right.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.040
 And even if you don't think that the 1st of September is the first day of autumn,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.520
 which I don't happen to, if you disagree with James' delineation of the seasons,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.800
 just come anyway.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.600
 That's right.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.000
 It's from the 31st of August to the 13th of September.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.040
 Go to no such thing as a fish dot com slash live.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440
 Get your tickets now.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.520
 On with the show.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.720
 I'm with the podcast.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:41.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.000
 A weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.440
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.880
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and our very special guest.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.280
 It's Bobby Seagull.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.240
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.680
 Starting with fact number one and that is Bobby.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.480
 My fact this week is that the UK pop charts were originally compiled by phoning around 20 record shops

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.720
 and asking what their best selling songs were that particular week.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.960
 So we're talking 50s, are we?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.120
 This was November 52.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.840
 So the Queens jubilee year 52.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.240
 So that means for the first few months of her reign,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.280
 there was a different way of assessing the music charts as it were.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.640
 So in the US, they had the billboards.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.840
 So for the billboards, it was a I think since the 1940s, it was like weekly sales.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.080
 But in the UK, they didn't have a charts based on music sales.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.440
 So it was an organization called the PRS, the Performing Right Society.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.720
 And they would look at the best selling sheet music.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.080
 The word sheet always annoys me.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.680
 In school, if I say the word sheet, it's just like, sir?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.960
 Is that what? Do you have two sheets on you, sir?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.760
 I mean, they're very juvenile, sorry.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.480
 We've got the sense of humour of your students.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.600
 Bobby's a teacher, by the way, yeah, we should say.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.400
 So it was the sheet music.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.600
 So a man called Percy Dickens.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.360
 So Hale Percy Dickens.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.280
 So he was a magazine advertising salesman.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.800
 And he was actually a founding member of the New Musical Express magazine,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.040
 which is now enemy or there's an enemy shut nowadays.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.400
 It's still online. It's still functions online.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.920
 RIP print copy.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.560
 But yeah, Hale to the digital copies.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.920
 So he thought, actually, what's the best way of getting advertising revenue

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.760
 for a magazine?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.800
 And he said, actually, we can attract commercial advertising revenue

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.520
 if we tie up something with the record industry.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.800
 So they thought, oh, actually, how about we do some sort of record based music chart?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.560
 And that's how the initial brainwave spark.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.280
 OK, so records were sort of like an obscure,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280
 you know, why are you buying a record?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.760
 You could just buy the sheet music and your own piano.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.960
 You can sing it on yourself, yeah.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.960
 OK, and then they decided calling around 20 shops

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.320
 would be the most reliable ways to do that.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.040
 Yes, so but why his system was like that.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.280
 But so what the management of NME decided was they I think they agreed

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.600
 with 50 shops that they would be willing to exchange data.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.640
 So but with those 50 ish shops, I think it's 53, but it's 50 ish.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.280
 It's always safe as a mathematician.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.240
 You know, you don't like giving exact numbers.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.480
 So every Monday morning, Percy Dickens would pick up the dog and bone phone

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.680
 and call up about 15 to 25 shops on average, 20 shops.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.960
 And each store would give their top 10.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.480
 But this is where things get a bit murky,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.400
 because he would then have a points based system that allocate to this.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.320
 And this is a bit we don't know.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.960
 It's like a Eurovision type system.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.360
 We don't know the exact system.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.680
 But because of that, it meant his first ever top.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.200
 I think he was trying to do like a top 12, but there were 15 entries.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.040
 Because three entries, number seven, eight and 11 tied.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.040
 And we all know in reality, it's unlikely that three songs would have

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.160
 exactly the same number of sales.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.800
 But because he went to 20 shops.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.280
 Yeah, just yeah, you probably have like two songs with 17 sales each.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.840
 And then how are they?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.080
 Because I sort of read that they're not the great at monitoring anyway,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080
 are they, the shops?

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.000
 And also they might just say the song that they like best.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.640
 Well, if they were told, we're going to be ringing you up and asking if you're sales.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.600
 They probably would keep the sales.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.760
 Yeah, I like that.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.760
 I would just I do find myself wondering if anyone ever tried to game

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.160
 the system by picking a particular shop and saying, well, I'm going to send

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.440
 15 different friends in here all to buy this one single.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.560
 Hope they get phoned up this week by Percy Dickens.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.680
 That did used to happen, though.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.840
 I don't know specifically to do to British charts.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.760
 But certainly overseas in America, you would have, you know,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.080
 the really rich people just buying huge units of an album

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.520
 from one specific store just to get those numbers up to get them into the charts.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.200
 There was that was a thing to get in the charts.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.680
 I mean, that's happened forever.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.480
 You know, Taylor Swift's doing a gig and she's bundled it with the new album

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.480
 or she's released a new t-shirt and she bundles it with the album.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.840
 And so you cheat the sale because you're attaching it.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.520
 It counters us in.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.120
 It used to and not anymore because they noticed that the bands were just,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.200
 you know, cheating the system.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.280
 They were gaming the system.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.080
 And so they actually not popular at all.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.200
 Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.040
 Does it turn out no, no, no, no, exactly.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.160
 But May 2020, Dua Lipa, she had future nostalgia,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.880
 which was the lowest selling number one album ever.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.440
 Imagine getting to number one and finding out you were the worst asset.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.040
 That's a good record. Yeah.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.880
 Why did they tell her that? That's mean.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.160
 Yeah. 7,317 copies. Wow.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.320
 That was the that was the sixth week that she was at number one. Oh, OK.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.680
 Yeah, yeah. But it's going to be some tiling off.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.800
 Yeah. But what was that was still number one in that week?

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.960
 Yes, it was still number one in that week.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.840
 Yeah. And so what's amazing about this

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.640
 is that it's basically since streaming music has come along,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.880
 that the charts have been altered in such a weird way.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.840
 So a thousand album streams equates to one record sale is what they say.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.360
 One physical product. Yeah, I think that's in the UK, isn't it?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.240
 Yeah, that's in the UK.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.560
 That's how that's how you do that.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.600
 But also what they found is so interesting.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.000
 Such an interesting time where gigantic musicians

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.720
 who are global names are fighting it in the charts with bands

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.960
 that are independent local British ones with a big fan base

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.640
 who can get them to that number.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.720
 So they're in the charts.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.120
 But because everyone's streaming the biggies, they're not buying the album.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.800
 But then the little ones, they've got such hardcore fans

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.080
 who might buy five or six copies to give to their friends and family.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.600
 They're making a dent in the charts. Oh, I see.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.360
 So you mean the bands that only only their friends or family buying it,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.400
 they buy physical albums, but because that's so rare to do.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.960
 And they come they come more in the equation as well.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.040
 So I think for singles charts, a hundred paid streams is one sale

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.160
 and six hundred free streams.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.360
 So the freemium versions is one sale.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.280
 So if you pay for your Spotify iTunes and you're streaming it,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.440
 it's six times more valuable than someone on an ad based.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.360
 Wow. Oh, that's good.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.200
 Because if I find a song I like, I will often listen to it six hundred times.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.520
 Despite what if you buy it once, it's the same.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.720
 Oh, you don't have to subject yourself to the six hundred.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.040
 You can just buy it.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.880
 I don't want to know.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.200
 I want to say the money and be I do really like the songs I like.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.120
 So I'm just back to Percy Dickens and the first listen, fifty two.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.280
 I was reading about the first ever number one single,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.160
 which was called Here in My Heart, and it was by Al Martino.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.240
 Do you guys read about him? No, he was crazy.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.320
 So I never heard of him before.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.360
 He was an Italian-American singer and former bricklayer.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.400
 And he went on to great fame because he was in The Godfather.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.040
 Hmm. Playing a singer called Johnny Fontaine.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.640
 Oh, yeah. Johnny Fontaine is the one who leads to someone

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.120
 getting a horse's head in the bed. Yes. Yes. That's right.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.880
 Confession. I've not watched The Godfather.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.120
 Well, I was told off at a party recently about this.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.720
 I do know the fact, but I was not I have not seen The Godfather.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.800
 Well, it's a very worth watching.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.800
 It's it's only average.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.240
 It's no grownups without a sound.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240
 But then this is OK.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.160
 This is the really weird thing about Al Martino.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.240
 So he was he played a singer connected to the mafia in the film The Godfather.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.760
 But then eventually he was forced to leave the UK by the mafia

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.880
 because they tried to buy him out of his American marital contract.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.080
 And there was some controversy and there was some disagreement.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.320
 And then so really? Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.200
 So he was involved in a mafia-ish circles.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.480
 It sounds like a bit.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.120
 It sounds like you may have met them sometimes.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.960
 I don't know.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.960
 The Godfather filming, maybe.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.760
 Method acting. Good.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.760
 Oh, my God. I love that. I went two methods.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.560
 I'm on Percy Dickens. Yeah.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.000
 So do you know his second claim to fame?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.800
 So obviously the charts is his first claim to fame.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.320
 But the second one is so do you know we have modern sort of like award ceremonies

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.960
 and stadium rock concerts?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.240
 So he actually in the early 60s,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.640
 he pioneered the something called the enemy poll winners concert.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.280
 And he managed to get I think the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.000
 And again, this is like a tenuous claim to fame.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.600
 But some people in the music industry say that was responsible

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.920
 for the sort of award ceremonies we have nowadays.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.640
 So he was the first person in the UK.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.000
 So let's say all the winners of the awards, music awards,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.280
 let's get them all together in a big concert at Wembley.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.920
 So I think it was Wembley Arena, which is the Empire Pool at the time.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.800
 So that's his second. His fault.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.800
 We have these awards ceremonies.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.400
 I love that. What a big character.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.360
 So he's from I didn't realize he's from my hometown of East Ham.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.480
 East Ham from the London Borough of Newham,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.200
 which is why I'm a Master of West Ham fan.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.200
 But I never knew he was from East Ham.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.560
 And I was trying to find out where in East Ham and I can't.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.280
 But if there's people, listeners out there,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.840
 we need to get a blue plaque for this man in East Ham.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.920
 He sounded the chart and possibly pioneered the music award ceremony.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.040
 Yeah, that's incredible. I agree.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.880
 I was reading about.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.320
 Did you guys happen to read about the first ever top 100 billboard single?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.440
 So this was in 1958.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.680
 And it was a song that was called Poor Little Fool by Ricky Nelson.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.000
 And yeah, so it came out was a massive hit.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.840
 And it was actually written by a woman called Sharon Shealy.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.880
 And she wrote the song because she'd met Elvis Presley when she was 15.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.880
 And he basically encouraged her to get into writing.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.760
 So she thought, OK, I'll do that.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.120
 She based it, the song on a very short fling that she had

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.640
 with a guy called Don Everly of the Everly Brothers.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.760
 So the song that's the first number one is actually based on a musician,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.720
 which is quite cool in its own right.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.720
 And effectively, she might have dabbled with some other songs.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.240
 But from what I read, this was the first song that she wrote.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.400
 And so she she thought I need to get someone to record it.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.680
 So she thought Ricky Nelson could be perfect for this.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.840
 So she drove to his house and she faked breaking down outside of it.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.840
 The car, not emotionally.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.760
 So she broke down her car, supposedly was broken down.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.600
 And she was like, please, can you help me?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600
 And he was like, yeah, OK.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.800
 And he came out and he tried to help her with the car.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.640
 And then she went, I've got a song. You got to hear it.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.720
 I want you to sing it.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.560
 And he heard it and he went, OK, I'll do it.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.960
 And that's the first number one.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.120
 Her first song at 18, handing it by faking a breakdown.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.720
 Yeah. Did he fix her car that wasn't broken?

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.440
 Yeah, it fooled him because he didn't know he could do that.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.120
 He subsequently left the music industry and became a mechanic.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.360
 He's the worst mechanic.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.240
 There is someone who collected every single track

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.720
 that entered the top 40 from 1952 onwards.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.760
 A guy called Keith Sevier and he died in 2015.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.400
 So the collecting stopped then.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.680
 But he bought every single track, every one that entered the top 40.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.720
 How many is that? Do you know?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.800
 Well, his lounge alone contained 35,000 vinyls.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.200
 He had and 10,000 CD singles as well.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.200
 I mean, it was a lot.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.200
 We think that's cool.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.240
 But for his kids, every time they went home,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.840
 you'd have that conversation with your dad.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.440
 Like, dad, have you thought about clearing these out?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.680
 I mean, he lived in a normal house in Twickenham.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.840
 It was not a big place, but it was entirely full of stacked records, just insane.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.320
 If I was his kids or children or nephews and nieces,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.960
 I'd feel like a responsibility to continue that from 2015.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.440
 You can't just like from 52 to 2015.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.320
 You can't just leave it like, oh, family tradition.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.160
 Exactly. I don't think I read a piece about it.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.800
 And I don't think anyone in the family was saying, oh, yeah, we'll keep going.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.360
 I know, you can be the foster child.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.440
 Can I just tell you something fun about sheet music charts?

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.440
 Yeah, what type of music?

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.640
 Sheet music.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.400
 How many sheets?

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.080
 This music is sheet.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.080
 So, Bobby, you mentioned earlier about sheet music,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.160
 being how the charts were compiled before the fifties.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.640
 And so, yeah, that was how people took in music.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.840
 Basically, they went and bought sheet music,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.120
 and then I guess they'd have to play it at home or look at it

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.440
 and imagine it being played.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.160
 And so sheet music, publishing and promotion was a huge industry.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.000
 And you got people who were hired as song pluggers

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.800
 who would be like demonstrators who would sit in shops

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.400
 that were selling sheet music and they'd have to play the music.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.280
 So someone would say, I want to buy this by so and so.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.440
 And then people.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.480
 So certain people got their starts in life.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.160
 Doing that Lil Hardin, who was Louis Armstrong's wife,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.720
 started as a songplugger Irving Berlin.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.200
 George Gershwin started as songpluggers.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.880
 Did they slip their own songs in?

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.360
 Is that how they got big?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.720
 This is a cracking hit.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.720
 Yeah, people come up to you in the shop and do they say,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.560
 I want to buy a song that goes like this.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.920
 But then they play it.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.640
 No, they could do that.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.160
 I guess you'd adapt to your customer.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.040
 So if you came in and, you know, sang the, I don't know, that they'd say,

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.360
 oh, well, you might like this song.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.360
 I think, yeah, exactly.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.600
 Like a Spotify algorithm.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.040
 They're radio. They're just a back.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.120
 They're live radio.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.520
 They're just playing the hits, presumably from the week.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.640
 People say, oh, I like that song you're playing.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.360
 Yeah. Yeah. They're like a jukebox, like a shazami type of.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.080
 Yes. Yeah. The original shazami. Yes.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.800
 But they did. It wasn't just playing.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.240
 They'd also be paid by the song publishers to do things like they go into theaters

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.040
 and in the intervals, they'd be paid to start singing a tune really loudly.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.840
 And you'd have to get the whole audience to sing along with you.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.840
 Cool.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.720
 Which you have to be quite confident to do that.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.760
 Because you risk looking like a psychopath.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.320
 But yeah. And then people are like, God, I heard that tune at the theater

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.560
 in the interval recently. I'm going to buy it.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.720
 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720
 Yeah. What a clever way. I mean, we should do that.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.520
 We should go in the intervals at theater and go, my fact this week.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:15.360
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.520
 And that is my fact.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.800
 My fact this week is that there are two members of the National Trust's food

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.680
 and beverage team who both have the surname Kit Kat.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:31.600
 So I got to tell you how I got this fact.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.040
 I was at an event recently and someone came up.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.000
 It was a podcast event and someone came up saying, hey, I really like your podcast.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.360
 I said, oh, thanks. And we had a bit of a chat.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.440
 Turns out he worked for the National Trust and then I went off.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.880
 And then about an hour later, then you went.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.360
 He said I work for the National Trust and you just turned around.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.080
 Yeah, I actually slapped him before I went as well.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.840
 And then so I had to go to an event and then I finished.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.640
 And as I came out, he clocked me from across the room

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.720
 and and he kind of ran towards me and said, I forgot to tell you my favorite fact.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.880
 And this was the fact.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.040
 So his name is Jack Glover.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.080
 He's a podcast producer for the National Trust.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.440
 They have their own podcast.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.800
 And yeah, and he was saying that basically it's he doesn't know either of these Kit Kat.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.560
 But someone mentioned that there was a Kit Kat who worked for the National Trust.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.080
 And as they were googling it, they found not one another Kit Kat.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.800
 So related. They're not related because they're spelt differently.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.360
 So Louise. Yeah.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.000
 Louisa Kit Kat, who spells it K-I-T-C-A-Double-T.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.960
 And then you've got Sam Kit Kat, who's just got one T.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.560
 We don't know if they know each other.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.880
 I've tried to find them online.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.840
 They're on LinkedIn.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.440
 I didn't have time to get through to them.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.920
 I think Louise is on Instagram, but it's a private account.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.440
 So I couldn't get through to her.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.800
 Oh, these poor Kit Kat.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.680
 Some weirdo trying to contact them all week.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.720
 I've just never heard the surname Kit Kat before.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.240
 No, me neither. I've never heard of that.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.560
 Well, it's a brilliant fact.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.200
 Amazing. Food and beverage. Love it.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.880
 Should we say what I don't know if overseas every country has its own

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.360
 national trust in the same kind of way.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.520
 But in Britain, there's basically an organisation.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.880
 They're an independent charity and they buy up places of national importance.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.520
 And they make it public.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.040
 So they make places that might otherwise have been private,

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.080
 like Winston Churchill's Old House Chartwell that was that was bought by them.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.640
 And it was transformed into a public place.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.680
 And so it means that the public can go and visit all of these extraordinary places.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.760
 Yeah. And yeah.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.400
 The National Trust has some amazingly weird stuff.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.080
 Yeah. Oh, my goodness.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.880
 So I was just reading about like the odd things they have.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.760
 Did you know they've got the National Rhubarb Collection?

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.160
 Cool.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.920
 Is that just lots of people mustering away in the back?

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.080
 - Altenburg actors. - Rhubarb.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.400
 They've got the largest fern in the UK at Colby Woodland Garden.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.440
 It's 400 years old, 19 feet around.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.760
 - Wow. Impressive. - Big fern.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.240
 - Big fern. - Big fern.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.200
 And they've got one nudist beach, which I've been to, actually.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.800
 - Have you? - Oh, Studland.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.760
 I may have mentioned that before.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.800
 - It's in Dawson. - Studland.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.160
 - Studland. - Studland.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.360
 I went down there with my friends and we didn't know it was a nudist beach.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.640
 - Did you get naked? - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.680
 No, we didn't. Well, I didn't. I don't know if they did, but no, we didn't.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.280
 But you happen to be naked at the time.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.720
 Fortunately, I was able to seamlessly blend in.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.760
 No, um, yeah, there were the, it was because it's quite sand duny.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.520
 So it's quite, the landscape is quite undulating.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.080
 So it's not immediately apparent that it's a nudist beach.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.280
 But every so often, someone will just hove into view who is naked

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.960
 and you sort of pop up like a little meerkat.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.120
 You think, oh, that's funny. And then pop back down.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.680
 Anyway, yeah.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.640
 Do you think the undulations are a nod to the human form?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.400
 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.360
 Yeah. Well, because this actually doesn't link to another National Trust property.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:36.920
 Oh, really?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.080
 West Wiccan Park, West Wiccan Park gardens,

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.280
 were designed in the shape of a woman's anatomy, apparently.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:42.920
 Which anatomy?

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.240
 Like the whole thing.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.680
 I think the whole thing doesn't.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.800
 No, I don't.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.040
 It's just the ear, the left earlobe.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.400
 No, it's mostly centered on a mound of Venus,

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400
 which has a passageway underneath it.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.120
 So I think that's a vagina.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.120
 But this is so cool.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.440
 This was the home of Sofrancis Dashwood,

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.680
 who was who founded something called the Hellfire Club.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.720
 Which is the, I mean, it's an awful club.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.720
 It's basically a worse version of the Bullington Club,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.840
 but also really fun.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.400
 Which is basically--

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.120
 And it's gone on.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.480
 The Hellfire Club or--

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.680
 Oh, maybe it is.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.520
 Sounds, it's a club for posh people to meet up

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.000
 and do really sordid stuff that probably is still around.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.040
 But yeah, he designed this house and gardens,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.480
 and then this hillside nearby,

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.560
 which you can also visit, which is National Trust.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.040
 And it's full of tunnels and caves that were covered

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.520
 in like fallacies and pre-apic statues.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.320
 And they'd like act out religious rituals there,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.000
 but in a porny way.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.840
 And so they'd have nuns, but they'd be sex workers.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.600
 And they'd be asked to lie down,

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.680
 and then the members of the club would lick holy wine

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.760
 from their navels and stuff like that.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.280
 But lots of people got involved.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.040
 And Ben Franklin paid a visit.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.240
 Oh, thank you.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.400
 Ben, a bit of naval licking, I'm afraid.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.200
 Ben?

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.560
 Wow, Ben.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.840
 Ben, first name terms.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.640
 My name is Ben.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.760
 I believe in first name terms.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.480
 I'd abbreviated first name terms.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.920
 Abbreviated, that's what I can't believe.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.000
 Ben E.F.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.520
 Ben E.F., yeah.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.280
 Well, in the club, we refer to each other.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:06.760
 Oh, sure, yeah.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.160
 Anyway, after he died, Francis Dashwood,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160
 then his heirs called in Capability Brown,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.040
 the famous garden designer to remove quite a lot

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.280
 of the more sordid elements of the garden.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:18.920
 Wow.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.040
 But you could still visit.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.080
 Do you know what the membership,

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.400
 anyone know the membership price for National Trust

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.440
 or a single person?

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.400
 I don't.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.680
 I have been a member, so.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.120
 But actually, you know, Benjamin,

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.640
 how much is that in the States?

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.640
 Benjamin, is that a $100 bill?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.040
 I think it is.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.680
 Yes, it is.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.040
 We call it a Ben, but yeah.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.760
 So actually, I think maybe based on try,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.680
 it might actually be the price of a Ben.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.560
 I think it's about £76.80, which might be a Ben.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:42.920
 It's close, yeah.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.800
 That's a Franklin.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:43.960
 Yeah.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.080
 Does that get you into all of them for fun?

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.960
 Yes.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.080
 $76.80?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.720
 $76.80 for one year.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.240
 That has gone up a lot.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.280
 Yeah, I was a member.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.640
 Cost of living crisis, hello.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:51.880
 Yeah.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.280
 People can't even afford to visit state-of-the-homes anymore.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.640
 I've had to buy cheap-wide to look out

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.840
 at this sex worker's navel.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.040
 So I was looking at the National Trust website

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.560
 and they very proudly declare,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.640
 "We have 5.37 million members,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.560
 which is more than Costa Rica.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.840
 Are they planning like an invasion?

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.880
 Like, we shall arm, get your shovels and picks

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.920
 and your membership cards.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.120
 We shall go to Costa Rica."

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.640
 They're quite proud of that.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.840
 I mean, that is huge.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.040
 That is really huge.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.840
 That's in their website.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.800
 I didn't see further digging.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.040
 Actually, it's apparently 5.9 million

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.000
 rather than 5.37.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.360
 So their website's out of date.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.280
 So in theory, they could be more ambitious,

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.000
 forget Costa Rica, Denmark or Singapore.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.040
 They could invade them.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.240
 National Trust.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.120
 Which would you go for?

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.280
 Denmark, I think, probably has more historic features

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.600
 that they could get.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.880
 Easier to get to from Britain as well.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.360
 That's true.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.320
 The Vikings.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:39.800
 Yeah.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.440
 Take back.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.080
 Take back.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.640
 Yeah, Denmark.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.760
 Let's take a Denmark.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:42.920
 Yeah.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.600
 There's one place that Jack was telling me about

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.920
 who sent me this fact called Orford Ness.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.280
 And it's a nature reserve.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.680
 And they have lots of amazing animals there.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.280
 They have the white-faced woodland sheep.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.920
 But they've also got a nuclear bomb.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.560
 Yeah.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.120
 So really?

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.400
 Is that why the sheep look so pale?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.480
 It's still there.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.160
 So basically, Britain detonated an atomic bomb

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.000
 in the '50s, 1952.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.880
 A few tests and things like that.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.480
 We had some tests.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.320
 And the pre-test was done at this place, Orford Ness.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.960
 And the reason that it was done there

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.000
 is what they did was they built these big kind of buildings

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.520
 that would go into the ground.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.920
 And the bombs were effectively being tested

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.960
 for their stress levels.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.880
 So what they did was they put them in the buildings

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.440
 and then they just shaped them and just kept shaking them.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.040
 Just shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.960
 And the idea was if you were transporting

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.800
 a nuclear bomb by plane,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.280
 they wanted to make sure that it didn't detonate

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.720
 as it was being flown to the place.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.640
 And it didn't detonate purely because of the stress levels

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.280
 that it would have.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.800
 So this is where they did it.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.520
 And they still have one of the bombs sitting there.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.400
 It's deactivated.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.360
 OK, I was going to ask that.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.360
 I was going to take care of you.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.480
 They always use deactivate.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.000
 I mean, yeah, they didn't test it with an armed bomb anyway.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 But it's sitting there next to the sheep.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.360
 I'm going to Orford Ness in a couple of weeks.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:56.840
 Get out.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.360
 Go shake the bomb.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:58.760
 I will.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.840
 That's so cool.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.240
 Yeah, the founding story of the National Trust

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.840
 is it's got a lot of great characters at its beginning,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.320
 hasn't it?

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.640
 So there were three founders.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.080
 It was a lawyer, clergyman, and social reformer.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.440
 Sounds like a savage joke, doesn't it?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.080
 A lawyer, a priest, and a social reformer walking down.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.720
 What happens?

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.880
 They make a socially responsible organization.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.040
 But yeah, this woman called Octavia Hill,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.800
 who was the eighth daughter of her father,

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.840
 which I always like if you're called Octavia or Tertius

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.200
 or whatever, be the eighth.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.400
 Yes.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.640
 And so maybe that's why he had eight daughters,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.840
 so he could call on Octavia.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.520
 And she was amazing.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.240
 She, her parents had sort of set up a school

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.240
 for the poor and stuff and would do good as anyway.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.320
 So she had good examples set for her.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.960
 But then her dad went bankrupt

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.960
 and left the family in the 19th century.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.440
 Maybe.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.120
 Because he had eight children.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.160
 Yeah, he does.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.760
 I've read a story where age 14,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.960
 she was left home alone.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.240
 Her family had gone to church.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.440
 Oh, I know this story, isn't it?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.560
 And two burglars.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.360
 The iron on the face.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:06.840
 Yes.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:06.840
 Yes.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.080
 And she mutilated them horribly.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.120
 Yes.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.760
 But they came back.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.200
 They came back.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.720
 Now you've said that I think this might have been

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.080
 the home alone origin story.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.720
 Because it was, it was one burglar.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.360
 Oh, seriously?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.960
 Yeah, yeah, one burglar came in,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.960
 came out, fell out of a cupboard actually.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.320
 She was on the surface of their house.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.720
 He fell out of a cupboard where he'd been hiding.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.080
 And apparently she said,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.040
 "How did you get in here?"

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.960
 And he said, "I walked up the stairs."

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.920
 And she just said,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.760
 "Then will you please to walk down them again?"

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.920
 And then she led him down the stairs

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.880
 and out of the house.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.360
 Wow.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.720
 So that's a much shorter whole load.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.840
 Didn't need a punch up, didn't it,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.680
 for the Macaulay Culkin version.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.200
 But what a compliant burglar,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.560
 like how responsible.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.040
 Yeah.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.240
 To ethical burgling.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:47.880
 Ethical burgling.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.160
 Like if you ask me nicely.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.520
 I won't do it.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:50.920
 Yeah.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.560
 And didn't she,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.680
 I think I'm right in saying that

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.360
 she later went to New York

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.320
 and she got lost.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:55.880
 Didn't she?

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.920
 Yeah, that's right.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.120
 She boarded the wrong plane.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.160
 Yeah, that's right.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.680
 Yeah, Octavia Hill was amazing.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.360
 But I kind of got sidetracked reading about

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.760
 the clergyman of the three founders,

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.320
 Kenan Hardwick, Drummond Raunsley.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.120
 Which is such an incredible...

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.840
 A medieval name.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.800
 Yeah, it is formidable.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.440
 So he was a bishop from Lincolnshire.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.240
 He was described as the most active volcano in Europe

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.040
 by one of his parishioners,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.080
 because he was so energetic, involved, always,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.960
 coming up with new schemes and committees and plans

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.280
 and projects and papers and all of this,

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.200
 constantly writing and thinking and meeting.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.440
 But his main interest, as far as I can tell,

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.040
 seems to be building bonfires.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.920
 He had this huge passion about bonfires.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.080
 So there was a diamond jubilee for Queen Victoria in 1897,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.720
 I guess it would have been.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.360
 Six of them.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.040
 Yeah, and he was the head of something

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.720
 called the National Bonfire Committee.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.640
 He basically spent his whole time

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.720
 suggesting huge bonfires at any opportunity,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.000
 any national opportunity.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.840
 So when the First World War ended, 1919,

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.600
 they had huge bonfires everywhere.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.920
 Coronation in 1911, huge bonfires.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.480
 So how many national trust properties

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.680
 did he burn down, of course,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.640
 when he found the organization?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.960
 It's just amazing, these huge towers of work.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.880
 The coronation ones in 1911 are so impressively massive,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.160
 and he organized 2,200 of them across the entire country.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.680
 It was a mega theme of his life.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.160
 Really?

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:15.320
 Yeah.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.840
 We should have like a bonfire czar,

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.880
 a national bonfire czar.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.920
 Oh, that's such a good idea.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.880
 That's an awesome idea.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.760
 Because we just had the jubilee

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.800
 and there were lots of beacons.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.360
 But they were tiny compared with these things.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:24.920
 I mean...

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.320
 I didn't know.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.920
 We're making cuts to the civil service.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.320
 I'm not sure we're talking about the bonfire czar

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.600
 and Boris's vision.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.480
 Just back to Octavia for one second,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.760
 because I think it's worth mentioning

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.480
 there's quite a lot of descriptions about her character

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.640
 and who she was by her friends,

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.240
 and I find them such bizarre representations.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.400
 So she had a friend called Henrietta Barnett,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.560
 and Henrietta described her saying

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.520
 she was small in stature with a long body and short legs.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.040
 She did not dress.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.400
 She only wore clothes,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.800
 which were often unnecessarily unbecoming.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.640
 Her mouth was large and mobile,

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.240
 but not improved by laughter.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.280
 Really quite cutting stuff.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.720
 And one of her friends writing this thing.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.120
 Yeah, it was her friend.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.640
 Gertrude Bell had a comment about her

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.560
 saying she was despotic.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.640
 So not a great review.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.240
 And the Bishop of London,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.520
 who was called Frederick Temple,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.680
 he had a meeting with her,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.800
 and afterwards he wrote,

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.320
 she spoke for half an hour,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.640
 "I never had such a beating in my life."

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.120
 Really?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.520
 Yeah.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.280
 So, you know, it sounds like she was really,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.880
 you know, sort of confident.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.480
 She was formidable, definitely.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.440
 But then I was reading a lot of--

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.800
 Just quick nominative determinism.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.320
 Sorry, Bishop called Frederick Temple.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:31.880
 Yes, yes.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.760
 That's nice.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.400
 Good pause.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:33.640
 Thank you.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.360
 The pause for that.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.560
 Octavia Hill as well.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.600
 Hill National Trust.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.720
 Because the first thing that was donated

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.560
 to the National Trust was a hillside.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.040
 Really?

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:42.760
 Yeah.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.360
 By someone called Fanny Tolbert.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.200
 But you know that one of the,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.040
 the lawyer that was one of the trio

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.080
 was Robert Hunter.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.600
 He's a lawyer.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.400
 Lawyers are like hunters.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.200
 They're like, "Find it."

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.400
 And you stretched it too far, Bobby.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:53.880
 I'm sorry.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.480
 Yeah, that's one too.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:55.880
 It's okay.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.680
 You're new to the show.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.080
 It's fine.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.360
 You'll find your seat.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.240
 You've lost everyone.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.520
 Beatrix Potter too.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.800
 I'm sure you guys came across this.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.600
 Yeah.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.640
 What did you just say?

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.920
 Beatrix Potter.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.400
 Well, what's her--

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.200
 I'm sure you guys came across--

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.680
 Beatrix.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.360
 He pronouncing her name in a really odd way.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.480
 Oh, God, oh, God.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.920
 I've said all my life is Beatrix Potter.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.200
 Beatrix, I think Beatrix Potter.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:14.840
 Beatrix.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.480
 Yes, Beatrix.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.360
 What did you say?

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.160
 Beatrix.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.840
 Oh, like, you know, beetroot.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.880
 Yeah, I guess.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.440
 People are going to have an absolute field day with that.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.040
 Yeah, well, get over it, guys.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.480
 I say Beatrix.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.480
 I'm sorry, come on.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.280
 Christ.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.240
 She donated so much to the National Trust.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.520
 She'd made 4,000 acres after the success of Jemima Puddleduck

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.120
 and Mr. Jeremy Fisher and all of that.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.600
 She just devoted her time to breeding sheep.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.480
 Sorry, Puddleduck?

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.400
 Oh, God, how do I--

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.120
 How are you meant to pronounce it?

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.160
 Well, that's just another--

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.360
 Jemima Puddleduck, yeah?

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.040
 Do you not know Jemima Puddleduck?

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:46.760
 No.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.440
 Oh, that's a character.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.320
 That's a character.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.200
 We've been in the--

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.240
 19th century reform.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.800
 Prison reforms, particularly.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.040
 Founder of the National Trust, I thought we were saying.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.160
 She advocated, I think, for free bread for everybody.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.880
 Yeah.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.200
 Yeah.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.680
 Near, like, watering holes.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.040
 Oh, come on.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.480
 Who gives a duck a surname?

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.400
 That's unfair.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.120
 Oh, my God.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:17.880
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.040
 My fact is that the French-speaking clock

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.760
 was created by an astronomer who was annoyed

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.080
 that members of the public kept phoning his office

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.680
 to ask for the time, which would be annoying.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.680
 So this was from an article in The Times,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.240
 which was about the fact that the French-speaking clock,

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.960
 l'horloge parallelante, is winding down, and winding up,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.680
 and closing down.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.960
 Clock related things, yeah.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.800
 It's the oldest speaking clock in the world, I think,

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.640
 or it was the first one founded,

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.160
 and it was pioneered by a man called Ernest Esquelongan

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.400
 in 1933, who was a French astronomer,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.120
 and I think was at the sort of official,

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.160
 you know, the government.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.880
 He was the director of the Paris Observatory.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.440
 Oh, there we go.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.000
 OK, yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.240
 And people kept ringing up to ask the time,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.400
 because that was one of the ways, before speaking

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.800
 clocks existed, you verified the absolute nailed-on time,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.480
 was you phoned an astronomer, and his phone line

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.080
 was constantly busy with people phoning up,

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.680
 and his office staff were always being distracted

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.160
 by people saying, yeah, it's 1033 and a bit.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.400
 So that was the inspiration.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.520
 I love the idea that maybe he spotted an oncoming comet,

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.040
 you know, crashing into Earth,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.280
 and he just wasn't able to notify anyone.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.960
 Did he have, then, a reliable clock in front of him

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.960
 that he set, or would he, how was he telling the time?

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.040
 I don't know, I think it would have been,

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.440
 that's where the official time-keeping device

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.560
 for the country was kept.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.120
 That's where it started.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.960
 I think the Paris Observatory was where it was.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.360
 Yeah.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.200
 More like the way that Greenwich were the official stewards

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.960
 of, you know, official time.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.560
 Because there was huge rivalry, time-wise,

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.520
 between Britain and France.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.320
 It's the main beef between us, almost, to this day.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.680
 I would say it wasn't there.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.640
 It was like, where's official time gonna rest?

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.880
 And it ended up being Greenwich for the world.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.280
 But I think Paris Observatory was the other big contender.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.560
 I think they defined Greenwich time

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.720
 as Paris time minus two and a half minutes,

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.240
 or whatever number of minutes it was.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.800
 And they did it so, until about the 1990s,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.240
 like they really dug their heels in on Greenwich time, yeah.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.600
 So this clock, the first speaking clock in France,

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.480
 it was the 14th of February, 1933, when it debuted.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.920
 And on its very first day.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.200
 Oh, it's romantic.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.400
 That's true, yeah.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.120
 That's lovely.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.560
 So 140,000 people called up,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.360
 or rather recalled up, trying to hear it,

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.320
 because they could only get 20,000 answers

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.440
 during the course of the day,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.840
 because they had 20 lines that were doing it.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.400
 So that might have been one person just recalling,

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.600
 just desperate to hear it.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.720
 But yeah, incredible.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.840
 Very lonely people on Valentine's Day that year.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.560
 When you were children,

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.480
 did you ever call up the one, two, three number?

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.480
 In the UK, we've got like a one, two, three number.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.440
 I used to annoy my parents.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.040
 I used to call them up on the number.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.360
 And you'd hear like, at the third stroke, the time would be,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.360
 and then 10 seconds later, I'd call again,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.960
 and then my parents would get like an enormous bill.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.640
 It was so expensive.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.840
 So expensive.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.640
 But in the UK, I think is the BT speaking clock.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.000
 And at some stage, they called it,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.680
 I think they called it timeline,

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.120
 or they called it Tim for short,

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.280
 because for the major cities,

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.960
 if you're trying to get the time,

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.040
 you dial 846, which T-I-M would be on that.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.600
 Oh, so good.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.240
 Although, ironically, even though the name was Tim,

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.040
 the first two clock speakers in Britain

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.040
 for the last 50 years were females.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.080
 Ethel, Jane Kane, and Miss Pat Simmons.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.200
 But the first one,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.760
 there was an incredible competition to select them.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.640
 So there was a pool of 15,000 telephone operators

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.480
 who worked for the general post office.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.640
 And they organized a nationwide competition

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.080
 to find the golden voice.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.840
 And a bit like X Factor, or Britain's Got Talent,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.120
 they got like the judges.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.280
 We got the poet laureate, John Mayfield.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.080
 Yay!

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.400
 We got the actress, Dame Sybil Thorndike.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:51.800
 Yay!

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.280
 And we got the chief BBC announcer, Stuart Hibbert.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.000
 Yay!

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.120
 For this week's edition of The Speaking Clock.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.760
 Yeah.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.720
 Who will win this week?

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.360
 Awesome.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.160
 Proper competition.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.240
 It was so eminent, the panel.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:03.560
 Yeah.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.600
 You're a poet laureate.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.160
 I know.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.320
 And Sybil Thorndike, who's a famous name even today.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:07.880
 Who's that?

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.680
 I actually don't know, Sybil.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.680
 Just an incredibly famous actress from the time

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.160
 of, you know, a great heroine of stage, basically.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:13.480
 Right.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.160
 Because I think she was a bit pre-screen, almost.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:15.960
 Yeah.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.120
 But then you've got the crap one on the end.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.960
 Is there one of those in X Factor, the one who's like

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.960
 the expert but no one cares about them?

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.600
 Someone called Mrs. Atkinson and Lord Eiley

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.120
 rounded out the committee in 1936.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.320
 But so they always have a kind of fancy panel of judges,

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.040
 which I love.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.040
 So I think we're only on the fifth voice

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.120
 of The Speaking Clock now, the official Speaking Clock.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.920
 They always have a fancy panel who choose.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.240
 And I think the panel these days always includes

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.800
 the previous Speaking Clock voice, if you see what I mean.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.600
 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.120
 They sign up too.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.880
 So it was a guy called Brian Cobby, who was on the committee

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.880
 in 2006 when they were picking the new voice.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.120
 But he had been the voice for the previous 20 years.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.320
 So they had him, the current voice, Natasha Kaplinsky.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.000
 Newsreader.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.560
 Newsreader.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.320
 And strictly come dancing.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.160
 Yeah, did she win the first, or was she in the first season?

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.520
 She was in the first season, certainly.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.360
 I don't know if she, this was pre or post her strictly triumph.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.560
 So she knows how to read stuff.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.240
 I guess she knows what a good voice sounds like.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:13.480
 I know.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.960
 And the other voices, the other members of the panel included

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.640
 the guy who voiced the National Lottery.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.840
 Oh, okay.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.600
 47.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.680
 Yeah, exactly, reading numbers.

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.160
 Exactly, reading numbers is basically that's the gig.

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:25.880
 My dream job.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.240
 Who can read numbers best?

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.760
 You're going to get the Lottery guy.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.560
 And then a couple of others.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.160
 But it wasn't the Poet Laureate.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.440
 You know, you mentioned Brian Cobby because I found

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.240
 unsubstantiated claims that at one stage,

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.080
 he may have been the person that did

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.920
 the voiceover to the Thunderbirds 5.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.400
 I read that, yeah.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.680
 But I think the Thunderbirds, the main creator says it wasn't him,

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.680
 but Brian Cobby claims it was him.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.440
 Interesting.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.400
 Okay, controls it.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.360
 What's happened there?

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.480
 It's quite a strange thing to claim if it wasn't you, isn't it?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.720
 Well, you might think it like, you know,

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.680
 Brian Blessed claims that he was the voice of Tarzan's

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.800
 "oh, oh, oh" when Johnny Weismiller couldn't do it anymore.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.400
 But is that true?

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.120
 I don't know.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.400
 Is it a Brian thing?

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.960
 Brian's just makeup random shit themselves.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.320
 When Cobby recorded his script.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.760
 So he started in 1985.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.640
 I really like this.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.520
 So you don't have to do 24 hours, obviously.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.560
 You just, there's a limited number of numbers

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.480
 that you have to record.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.800
 And that's something like 86 different prompts.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.840
 But you have to record, you know, for about an hour, I think.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.560
 Oh, okay.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.960
 But the script that Cobby recorded was about 33 pages

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.120
 with various different things on it, you know, that you have to.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.080
 But amazingly, they spent a while in the recording studio.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.840
 They sent him home and then they had to summon him back

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.760
 because they forgot to record the o'clock.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.240
 You only need that once.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.640
 Oh, okay.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.160
 But it is important.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.360
 It is important, yeah.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.920
 You need it for the beats because when it's on the hour,

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.760
 because usually it'll be, you know, it's one and 24 minutes.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.680
 Do they say precisely at that when it's like a round time?

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.320
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:05.960
 They do, yeah, yeah.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.400
 Two o'clock precisely.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.600
 Yes, precisely.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.040
 That's what everyone loved about the first reader was her precisely.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.920
 Oh, really?

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.560
 Yeah, that was the famous, yeah, the famous word.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.240
 The most, her most famous word.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.160
 Can I ask, did they like it because it sounded quite sexy?

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.840
 Is that, is that what you were trying to?

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.200
 Get your brain out of the gutter.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.720
 Just curious, like, you know, sometimes people with sexy accents,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.720
 you know, can make any word sound sexy.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.440
 I'm sure there were people on Valentine's Day who did ring up,

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.920
 you know, you know, I don't know, cock in hands.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.120
 I do like the use of the word sexy.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:45.480
 I do like the use of the word sexy for time because time is based on base 60.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.040
 And sex, sex, sex, yeah.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.680
 Sex adjustable is the, is the word.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.480
 That is very sexy.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.520
 You need a sexy voice.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.240
 Sexy time.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:53.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.480
 And that's the joke you were making, wasn't it?

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.440
 Exactly.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.880
 I knew that we had the mathematician in.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.560
 I thought, I'm just going to leave that.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.400
 She, Ethel Cain, she had a speech impediment,

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.160
 which they didn't notice when they were recording it.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.720
 She had a slight speech impediment.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.160
 She whistled a bit at the end of each word.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.000
 It's two o'clock.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.080
 And that's where the cuckoo clock comes from.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.200
 Yeah, but they didn't notice in the recording.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.560
 So it must have been quite slight.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.400
 And then they spent, they decided,

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.280
 because the clock ran on these beautiful glass discs.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.240
 I have read about it.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.160
 I don't understand fully the mechanism they used,

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.560
 but they had to take the glass discs out of the machine

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.040
 and edit them.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.040
 And it took about a year to fix this.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.840
 How to get through the water.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.800
 Very minor thing.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.440
 No way.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.240
 Yeah, way.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.760
 She can say the word precisely.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.360
 Is that the word precisely?

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.560
 Precisely, yeah.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.240
 Down at the other end of the line.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.480
 So in the 1970s, I think 1971,

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.080
 the UK experienced decimalization.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.920
 So we lost the imperial system.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.120
 Not lost, we had imperial with the decimals as well.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.200
 But in 1975.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.240
 Much longer though.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.360
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.400
 Oh, I missed my ounces and my miles and...

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.320
 Farthings.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.040
 Farthings, hogs, heads.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.920
 Kenny Farthings.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.680
 So in 1975, in a Northern Ireland BBC programme

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.480
 called Scene Around Six, they had a newscast.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.760
 And it started off saying,

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.000
 "It looks a lot more frightening than it actually is,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.600
 but the government's preparing people

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.880
 for the phased introduction of the decimalization of time.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.080
 You need to get dual standard timepieces.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.840
 There'll be 100 seconds to a minute,

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.320
 100 minutes to the hour, 20 hours per day."

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.800
 But it was the first of April, 1970.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.240
 Oh, so good.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.760
 Meanies, those meanies at the BBC.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.600
 They said, "You'll take 10 years for this to come through,

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.720
 so don't panic right now."

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.520
 Yes.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.760
 Wow.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.640
 I mean, that's brilliant.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.920
 Do we know if people believed it?

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.600
 It was a BBC broadcast, the Scene Around Six,

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.120
 so people wouldn't...

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.240
 I thought the French government

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.520
 actually did something similar with the calendar, didn't they?

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.200
 The French Revolutionary Calendar.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.960
 They wanted to, yeah.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.080
 And I think they might have even tried...

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.360
 But they did an April first.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.800
 No, it wasn't an April first.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800
 It was just do this or you get your head chopped off thing.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.120
 Napoleon loved a joke.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.160
 What if the French Revolution

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.640
 was just an April Fool's that got badly out of hand?

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.320
 Guys, we were joking.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.280
 What if it was No King?

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.080
 Say No King.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.040
 I said joking.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.760
 Oh, God.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.240
 The people who do the speaking clock just quickly on that,

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.240
 sorry, back to my obsession, Brian Cobby, who I love.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.640
 Bizarrely, two out of the five of them have been from Hove.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.360
 Okay.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.080
 I don't...

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.000
 I'm not suggesting any conspiracy or anything like that,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.280
 but I just find that quite weird.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.040
 They always have loads of finalists, by the way.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.280
 The last time they did it, there were 15 finalists,

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.920
 which is so many for the judges to listen to.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.360
 But when Brian Cobby got the job,

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.520
 the runner-up was Lady from Lowestoft,

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.120
 and she got the consolation prize.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.560
 Can you guess what the consolation prize

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.840
 for this specific job would be?

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.960
 Doing the London Underground announcement.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.000
 Not bad, very close.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.480
 That's good.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.520
 Oh, doing like a Sainsbury's announcement,

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.160
 you know, sort of aisle six needs.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.520
 That's very close.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.880
 Okay, I'll tell you.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.600
 She got...

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.960
 You will all have heard this.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.880
 The runner-up became the voice of,

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.040
 "The number you have called has not been recognised."

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:58.920
 No!

00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.240
 Yeah!

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.400
 That is...

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.120
 Oh, my God, and the most terrifying words

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.120
 you can ever hear as a child.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.640
 Was she the person who did the...

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.920
 When he did 1471 as well?

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.880
 Oh, I don't know.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.360
 Because I think...

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.480
 You were called today at 1722.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.200
 Oh, I think you might...

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.080
 It is a similar voice.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:15.560
 I think it might be.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.360
 I think it might be,

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.680
 because I always found that the most terrifying thing was...

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.800
 Really? I found it quite sexy.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.680
 What? Do I have to have found it?

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.440
 Gosh! Oh, God, damn!

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.400
 So, do you have this in Australia?

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.560
 When you did 1471, if someone called,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.320
 you're alone in the house, you're 12.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.160
 And usually it would be,

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.160
 "You were called today by this number."

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.000
 And then, one in ten times it would go,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.800
 "You were called today at 1700 hours.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.400
 The caller withheld their number."

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.040
 Do you have to...?

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.320
 Do you have to...?

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.760
 Why would they do such a terrifying...

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.680
 Look in the cupboard on the third floor.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.360
 The ethical burglars would be fine.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:54.600
 I was just generally looking into interesting clocks,

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.880
 not just speaking clocks.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.440
 Okay.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.240
 Can I give you a couple of interesting normal clocks?

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.440
 Are they sexy clocks to go with this new facet

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.080
 of your personality?

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.280
 I'll let you be the judge, yeah.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.320
 I'll let you be the judge.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.240
 Now, I was reading that Windsor Castle,

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.320
 so on the Queen's staff,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.440
 is an actual clock man who goes around every single day

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.400
 checking out all of the clocks within the Windsor Estate,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.520
 which is up to 400.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.560
 There's 250 clocks within the castle itself.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.720
 If he looks at his, you know, pedometer,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.320
 he gets 16,000 steps in every single day.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.800
 Yeah, and the clocks there are absolutely amazing.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.040
 So there's your normal clocks,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.720
 but you've got historical clocks, right?

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.120
 So my favorite one is that there was a clock

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.480
 that was made by Charles Clay in 1740,

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.600
 and it plays melodies by the composer Handel.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.000
 And four of the songs that it plays

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.800
 were composed specifically by Handel for this clock.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.040
 So they're original pieces.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.320
 They worked in collaboration,

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.760
 and I think they made a few of these

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.280
 that went out to different royal families

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.400
 all through Europe.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.800
 And it's just an extraordinary thing

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.640
 that has pipes underneath it and so on

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.560
 that plays out the tunes.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.000
 And they have all sorts of clocks like this

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.680
 that have historical relevance within the castle itself.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.160
 Yeah.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.800
 Can I tell you one more weird time?

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.920
 It's actually not a time thing.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.320
 It's just a weird, disappointed speaking voice thing,

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.240
 which is an innovation in Tokyo.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.200
 It's a toilet that has just been launched in Tokyo

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.600
 where you don't need to touch anything.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.120
 How do you wipe your bum?

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:29.240
 Okay, you might need to do one thing.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.760
 You just stand and just water it.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.640
 Fully the pumps come.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.160
 Because there are lots of studies

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.840
 that show that when people use public toilets,

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.600
 they kind of avoid using their hands.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.320
 They'll step on the lever,

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.280
 which is actually a reason why you would need to step on the lever

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.280
 if the previous 50 people have all stepped on it.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.240
 No, anyway.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.120
 So you walk in and you just say, "Hi, toilet."

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.040
 And it kind of responds.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.480
 So if it gives you a menu of actions,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.760
 you can flush the toilet.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.720
 Hello, Andy.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.160
 Back again.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.560
 Sexy toilet.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:07.800
 I don't know what you could say.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.040
 I don't know if you could say, "Get my knob out."

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.040
 I don't know how to do that, but it's...

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.640
 So how's it work?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.200
 You say, "Turn on the tap or flush the toilet."

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.440
 So that's the hands-free element of the system.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:20.920
 Okay.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.680
 I think it may even be able to raise and lower the seat.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.400
 I'm not sure.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.840
 But you've still got to sit on the seat,

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.960
 which is, I would argue,

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.680
 largely the biggest bit of touching that happens in the...

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.600
 You can hover slightly above it.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.080
 Can you?

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.000
 I don't have the thym muscles to achieve that, I'm afraid.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.360
 You lay the lube all down on the seat.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.640
 I cover the whole thing.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.360
 But you can do well.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.720
 You can lay it and hover.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.720
 Feel like doubly pretend.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.280
 Double say.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.760
 Well, I mean, we have those anyway.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.040
 We have toilets where...

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.320
 Which is so irritating.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.360
 Voice-activated ones.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.760
 No, no, but as in we have the non-touch version,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.040
 which I hate, which is the ones

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.120
 where when you stand up, they flush off their own accord.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.120
 So, you know, sometimes it'll just stand up to turn around

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.560
 a bit to wipe your bum, whatever,

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.960
 or to hang up your coat halfway through a wee,

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.880
 and then it flushes itself.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.600
 Mid-wee.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.160
 Mid-wee, I'm just going to hold this in,

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.360
 take my coat off, hang it up.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.480
 It's going to practice.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.640
 It's like clench those muscles.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.000
 Is this at home where you're hanging out?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.920
 Are you going out the toilet to the hangar in the hall?

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:25.800
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.560
 and that is Anna.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.040
 My fact this week is that Spain's gold reserves

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.200
 can only be accessed via drawbridge.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.520
 It's very cool.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.840
 And they have a dragon as well, don't they?

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.480
 Yeah, they do.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.520
 The other end of the drawbridge, yeah.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.720
 And a trumpeter, like, doodly-doodly.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.200
 This is most of Spain's gold,

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.760
 which is in a bank of Spain vault in Madrid,

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.160
 and it's very well protected,

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.320
 as a lot of gold reserves are,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.080
 but it's such a cool setup.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.760
 So, to get to the gold reserves,

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.280
 you have to penetrate three massive steel doors,

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.840
 and they waste, like, the first door weighs 16 tons,

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.360
 which is about eight hippos' worth.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.720
 And also, they fit so well,

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.240
 so when the door closes,

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.880
 it fits so tightly that, according to the bank,

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.440
 even if, like, a tiny bit of fluff got in there,

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.280
 it would sense it and would not be able to close.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.760
 It would say, you know, you've got to get rid of that fluff.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.600
 Anyway, once you've got through these doors,

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.360
 then you go down a 35-meter elevator shaft underground,

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.000
 and you're let out, I think you walk through a tunnel,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.600
 and then you've got to cross a drawbridge.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.400
 So, a drawbridge has to be let down over a moat.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.560
 It's not a moat, it's just a ditch.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.080
 And I think it's about three or four meters drop.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.200
 Yeah, OK.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.760
 But I struggled to find, like, obviously, pictures

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.280
 are quite limited with this kind of thing,

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.800
 they're quite signature about it.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.760
 And once you've got through the retractable drawbridge,

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.880
 you've got the gold.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.240
 No, there's another door, isn't there?

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.000
 Oh, then there is another door, one of the last doors.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.080
 Yeah, and there's two people standing outside,

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.840
 telling you a riddle, and you have two.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.240
 But I love the way they, because they have,

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.120
 it's not just a ditch,

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.800
 they have a mechanism for filling that ditch with water.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.600
 So, the entire vault is under,

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.280
 obviously, under the city surface,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.840
 but it's under, there's a subterranean canal

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.680
 which flows along beneath the city,

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.440
 and then the vault is beneath that.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.760
 And so, if they need to flood it at any point,

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.920
 they just divert a bit of the subterranean canal,

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.360
 which will then slosh down into the drawbridge area,

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.880
 and then completely flood that,

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.560
 so there's no way of getting in or out.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.280
 Unless you're a fish.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.480
 Unless you're a fish.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.160
 A trained fish.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.040
 A goldfish.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.240
 Yeah, oh, wow.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.200
 Very nice.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.880
 Got to watch out for them.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.440
 Is it possible that this is just all made up?

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.440
 It's just in someone's back garden, isn't it?

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.040
 Yeah, it's just a tiny, like a hotel safe,

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.200
 you know, with just four punched numbers in.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.000
 Have they just created a myth so that we think,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.440
 "Whoa, it's like Area 51."

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.920
 Those are impossible, the hotel safe I find to get into.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.480
 I have a curious knack of like locking myself out

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.040
 before I've put any of my stuff in the safe.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.640
 I have to call someone at reception,

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.680
 and this is the whole thing.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.960
 What do you, what kind of,

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.480
 do you put your stuff in the hotel safe?

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.240
 Your paranoid Android?

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.040
 Yeah, of course I do.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:00.600
 Do you?

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.960
 Passport, money belt.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.960
 Travelers checks.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.840
 And pack.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.640
 Penny pack.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.920
 She's already talking about those locks.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.280
 Can I just, as a mathematician,

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.960
 raise a bugbear about terminology.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.040
 So you know these locks, bicycle locks?

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.080
 What do you call them?

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.040
 A combination lock.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.400
 Yeah, combination.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.480
 So if, imagine the combination was one, nine, eight, four,

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.360
 like Orwell book.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.240
 My birth year.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.680
 Oh, or yes, Orwell's book.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.640
 But a dystopian year in many ways.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.600
 Imagine you put one, nine, four, eight.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.480
 Would it unlock it?

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.680
 Oh, Terry Pratchett's birth year.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.560
 Oh my God.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.440
 Why would it not unlock it?

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.640
 I just like a maths lesson here.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.360
 Why would it not?

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.880
 Because it's in the wrong order.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.840
 Yeah, correct.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.240
 Mathematically, one, nine, eight, four,

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.800
 and one, nine, four, eight are the same combination,

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.480
 because combination is just

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.800
 a set of numbers or letters in any order.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.880
 The word, when they're in the precise order,

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.360
 in the precise numbers, it's a permutation.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.800
 So actually, you should be called a bloody permutation lock.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.080
 It's bugged me for years.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.560
 Wow.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.880
 Well, I'm so glad you've had a chance to air it.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.800
 And now we'll all call them permutation locks.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:05.480
 That is because James calls a single panini opinion no,

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.280
 and he is going to be absolutely thrilled to hear that it's

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.080
 a permutation lock.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.120
 This is great.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.600
 I really want to set James up in some way,

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.120
 like expose him to a combination lock,

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.720
 get him to refer to it as a combination lock.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.120
 OK, one of us next week picks a combination lock.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.480
 That, yes.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.120
 Ah, I don't see that one.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.400
 Take him down right at the top.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.120
 Sorry, Polly.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.600
 Sorry.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.280
 That's so good.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.240
 That's great.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.160
 This bank vault door, the armoured door,

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.520
 in the Madrid vault.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:30.680
 Yes.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.960
 There's one extra thing about it,

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.400
 which is that it's constantly covered

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.160
 with a thin layer of Vaseline.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:35.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.120
 Just in case you got a bit excited.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.880
 Just in case--

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.840
 Wait, is that a talking vault?

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.080
 Sexy talking vault.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.760
 Dan turns up with his robbery tools in one hand.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.240
 Did you get the gold?

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.680
 Actually, I got a bit distracted.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:56.520
 But it stops it rusting because it's made of steel,

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.200
 but not stainless steel.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.080
 And so it constantly has to be very slightly protected

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.360
 from rusting.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.680
 And someone's job is to apply Vaseline.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.320
 There must be.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.240
 Like basically a vault goblin.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.480
 A huge tub of Vaseline.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.000
 Every day.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.320
 Smooth as hands on earth.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.000
 Welcome.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.600
 Remove the fluff, then apply the Vaseline.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.080
 Yes.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.360
 Fluff on the door.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.000
 Very bad.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:31.160
 I could find out why they're not stainless steel.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.160
 It says everywhere they've got steel,

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.120
 but it's not stainless.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:34.760
 So you need Vaseline.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.120
 Did they just cock it up at first?

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.760
 Maybe it's old.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.560
 It's an old door pre stainless steel process.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.360
 I mean, lots of bank vault doors are very elderly

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.560
 because, you know, you make them once.

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.200
 Yeah.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:44.520
 Or--

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.160
 I don't know.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.520
 Is it all bullshit with the draw bridges?

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.360
 Fucking ditches.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.680
 Didn't know this before.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.600
 Gold bars get ultrasound done on them.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.800
 Like pregnant women.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.360
 That's right.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:58.600
 Yeah.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.040
 They probe it.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.720
 And they measure the reflections from the bottom

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.600
 or from within it.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.920
 And that's because in the early 2000s,

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.400
 there was a panic that gold bars

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.040
 might have been adulterated with tungsten.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.920
 Because tungsten has very similar density.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.960
 Really similar density.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.760
 Oh, really?

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.240
 Yeah.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.920
 But sound travels at different speeds

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.320
 between through tungsten or through gold.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.440
 So if you had gold bars which had been adulterated.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:24.760
 Right.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.080
 You'd know.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:25.720
 Yeah.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.240
 So when you think of gold vaults,

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.040
 what was it?

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.680
 Bank of England.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.120
 Any other famous places you can think of?

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.000
 Fort Knox.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:31.720
 That's the one.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.600
 Fort Knox.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.160
 So I think, yeah, Goldfinger 1964

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.360
 is probably what gave it its prominence.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.360
 People think it has up to half of the American gold reserves.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:40.760
 Wait, sorry.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.320
 Was that the--

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.320
 That was the bond plot line for that movie?

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:43.640
 Yes.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:43.640
 Yes.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.360
 Fort Knox.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:44.600
 Right.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:44.840
 Yes.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.400
 Yeah.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.520
 So in--

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.120
 So it was a conspiracy theorist again,

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.400
 like, oh, there's no Fort Knox.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.200
 There's nothing inside there.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.560
 There's just like Vaseline and Fluff.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.360
 But so presidents actually denied access to Fort Knox.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.920
 Apart from one president, do you know which one?

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.240
 First half of the 20th century.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.800
 Often known by three initials.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.920
 OK.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.400
 FDR.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.280
 LBJ. FDR, yeah, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.040
 So in 1943, he's the only US president to have visited Fort Knox.

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.760
 Really?

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.280
 Because he was concerned that it wasn't secure enough

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.880
 to be protected from foreign invasion

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.120
 if the worst happened in World War II.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.760
 So he's the only president that we know has visited it.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.000
 Are they allowed to keep presidents out?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 I thought the president could basically go where--

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.720
 Yeah.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.360
 Wherever he liked.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.320
 They're not giving access to it.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.280
 But yeah, he's like, wow.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.680
 I think maybe if they, like, said back to Amateur--

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.840
 I want to see Fort Knox, probably.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.280
 But he's the only one that we know.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.160
 That's amazing.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.640
 But what's even more fascinating is in World War II,

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.600
 they were worried about bombs falling and washing in DC.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.760
 So actually, they moved things like the originals

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.840
 of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.520
 and the Declaration of Independence to Fort Knox.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.440
 But even like Winston Churchill got on the act.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.080
 So our Magna Carta was moved in 19--

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.200
 so the International Magna Carta is like the UK version

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.880
 of the Bill of Rights, 1215.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.800
 They moved that to Fort Knox.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.240
 Did they?

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.000
 Because I know we moved our gold to Canada,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.720
 which I hadn't realized.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.200
 But it seems like a huge undertaking in the Second World War.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.320
 But it was sent to Canada,

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.720
 and so the Bank of England vault became a canteen

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.840
 in the Second World War.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.360
 I've been to the Bank of England canteen.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:16.920
 Have you?

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.480
 I do.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.120
 Cool.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:18.520
 Hang on.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.160
 So is that--

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:19.800
 It's not still.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.360
 The vault hasn't--

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.960
 the vault has been turned back into a vault.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.000
 Is that back into a vault now?

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.400
 So have you been to the vault that Walter canteen has?

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.800
 I've just been to the actual canteen.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.080
 Twice.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.360
 You've had a sandwich at your local branch in Lloyds.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.880
 They're like, why have you brought all this Vaseline?

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.680
 What's going on?

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.920
 The Bank of England vault key is three feet long.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.600
 Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:42.760
 That is--

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.640
 It's gray, isn't it?

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:43.800
 Yeah.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.680
 It's a real old school.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.440
 That's wagon and moat style stuff.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.640
 But is it mainly like--

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.280
 Is it like a--

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:48.840
 It's mainly shaft.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.520
 Like a javelin stick with one thing at the end?

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.560
 Or is it all the way down?

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.120
 It's not.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.320
 It's not notched all the way along.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.520
 Yeah, it's not notched all the way along.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.480
 That would be amazing.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.440
 Yeah, that would be really good.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.240
 That's really funny.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:57.880
 Yeah.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.880
 I think it's pretty remarkable, by the way,

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.920
 that the Bank of England, which is in central London,

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.560
 Bank Station is right next to it,

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.760
 if you get on the underground line.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.760
 In fact, the actual tunnel itself has to take a bend.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.600
 Next time you're on the underground,

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.960
 you'll notice that there's a turn,

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.040
 and that's because they're going around the vault.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.920
 It's because they're literally going around the vault.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.400
 And inside this vault is 400,000 bars of gold.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.280
 So that's worth over 200 billion,

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.920
 just sitting something like a half-hour's walk

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.200
 from where we are right now.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.480
 200 billion dollars.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.520
 Why are you doing in half an hour, guys?

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.680
 I got some Vasili.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.360
 It is amazing.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.160
 Yeah.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.520
 And there are really strict rules

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.240
 about how many layers of gold

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.080
 you can keep in the Bank of England vaults.

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.800
 And this is a big difference between London and New York.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.960
 So London is mostly on clay.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.640
 So you're not allowed on most levels

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.320
 to stack the gold higher than four or six pallets.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.120
 Because it will just start sinking into the ground,

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.160
 and that is a problem.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.080
 So whereas New York is on granite,

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.160
 and you can store gold as high as you like in there,

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.840
 it will not collapse.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.320
 Yeah.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.600
 And I think north of the river in London,

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.440
 generally the surface is stronger.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.120
 So if Bank of England were south of the river,

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.720
 it would sink even further.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.680
 Yeah, you're so right,

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.120
 because that's why we could build the underground at a certain level.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.440
 Is that where there are no underground stops south of the river?

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.640
 That's one of the reasons.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:23.960
 Really?

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.480
 Yeah, the ground's too soft.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.760
 Yeah.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.080
 Just outside of gold, but still with vaults,

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.240
 I was looking into sort of precious items

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.880
 that have been kept in the vaults of our world.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.480
 And it's stuff that is kind of seen

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.320
 as the precious secrets of our world.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.960
 So for example, the formula for Coca-Cola,

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.120
 supposedly kept in a bank vault.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.720
 Equals MC Square.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.840
 Well, not Equals MC Square,

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:50.040
 but because Einstein's eyeballs are in a safe deposit box in New York.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.080
 Do you remember after he died,

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.000
 there was a surgeon who took his brain away

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.120
 and took his eyes and took it.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.560
 And so the eyeballs are still not been...

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.360
 I thought it was just his brain.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.040
 No, his eyeballs are sitting in a vault

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.600
 or a safe deposit in a bank vault.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.640
 They must be preserved.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.000
 Like, they can't just be loose in a box.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 I think they're probably in from Aldehyde,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.040
 sitting in a little beaker, I imagine.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:08.600
 I didn't know.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.840
 Was that because they had to get the brain out the eye sockets?

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.320
 Do you think?

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:11.400
 I think...

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.840
 They had to remove the doors first.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.360
 I think once you're just collecting bits of them,

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.960
 you might as well grab them while you're there, right?

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.320
 It's, you know...

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.600
 That's so creepy.

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.560
 Yeah, it is creepy.

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.120
 Dr. Pepper, the formula for Dr. Pepper,

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.720
 that's sitting in a vault somewhere.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.320
 The secret ingredients of how you make WD-40

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.680
 are sitting in a vault.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.200
 And they were moved once,

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.280
 which was on the product's 50th birthday.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.320
 The guy who took it was the CEO, Gary Ridge,

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.400
 who rode on a horse through Times Square

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.160
 while wearing a suit of armour

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.280
 and holding the secret ingredients to WD-40.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:42.920
 No.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.280
 Before he reached the drawbridge, yeah.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.320
 He's here.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.680
 That's incredible.

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.200
 But it wouldn't have been possible

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.400
 to rob him, actually, on that occasion,

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.480
 because he'd been so thoroughly lubricated.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.000
 In the armour.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.440
 The robbers would just slide off.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:03.960
 Okay, that's it.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.160
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.760

 We're going to be doing them in September.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.360
 Come and see us live.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.080

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.680
 with another episode next week.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.720
 And we'll see you then.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.360
 Goodbye.
