00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, just to let you know, we've got a very special guest on our show today."
00:00:04,00:00:06,It is one of Britain's top nerds.
00:00:06,00:00:07,"Oh, is it me?"
00:00:07,00:00:10,"It's even more top than you, James Harkin."
00:00:10,00:00:11,You're not even supposed to be doing this bit.
00:00:11,00:00:13,"Oh yeah, sorry."
00:00:13,00:00:16,"I know you look, you're very welcome."
00:00:16,00:00:18,It is Bobby Seagull.
00:00:18,00:00:20,"He's not only a math teacher, you might know him from University Challenge,"
00:00:20,00:00:21,where he came to prominence.
00:00:21,00:00:23,He's a TV presenter.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"He's written a book called The Life Changing Magic of Numbers,"
00:00:26,00:00:27,which will change your life.
00:00:27,00:00:28,You should definitely get it.
00:00:28,00:00:31,And he's also written The Monkman and Seagull Quiz Book.
00:00:31,00:00:34,"He's a brilliant guy, full of interesting nerdy facts."
00:00:34,00:00:38,"He now co-hosts the Mass Appeal podcast, but today he's on ours."
00:00:38,00:00:40,"Yes, and I'm not on ours."
00:00:40,00:00:41,So I'm not even sure why I'm here to be.
00:00:41,00:00:42,"Oh, I know I am here."
00:00:42,00:00:47,I'm here to remind you that we are going on tour in the autumn
00:00:47,00:00:52,"and in the last day of summer, if this is how you count your seasons."
00:00:52,00:00:55,"Basically the 31st of August, we're going to be in Inverness."
00:00:55,00:00:58,"Then we're going to be in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Cardiff."
00:00:58,00:01:00,"If you're in any of those places, come and watch our show."
00:01:00,00:01:03,"It's going to be so much fun, loads of facts, loads of silliness."
00:01:03,00:01:05,We just can't wait to be back on tour again.
00:01:05,00:01:05,That's right.
00:01:05,00:01:09,"And even if you don't think that the 1st of September is the first day of autumn,"
00:01:09,00:01:12,"which I don't happen to, if you disagree with James' delineation of the seasons,"
00:01:12,00:01:13,just come anyway.
00:01:13,00:01:14,That's right.
00:01:14,00:01:17,It's from the 31st of August to the 13th of September.
00:01:17,00:01:20,Go to no such thing as a fish dot com slash live.
00:01:20,00:01:21,Get your tickets now.
00:01:21,00:01:22,On with the show.
00:01:22,00:01:23,I'm with the podcast.
00:01:24,00:01:41,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.
00:01:41,00:01:45,A weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:01:45,00:01:46,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:46,00:01:50,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and our very special guest."
00:01:50,00:01:52,It's Bobby Seagull.
00:01:52,00:01:55,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts"
00:01:55,00:02:00,from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:02:00,00:02:03,Starting with fact number one and that is Bobby.
00:02:03,00:02:11,My fact this week is that the UK pop charts were originally compiled by phoning around 20 record shops
00:02:11,00:02:17,and asking what their best selling songs were that particular week.
00:02:17,00:02:18,"So we're talking 50s, are we?"
00:02:18,00:02:21,This was November 52.
00:02:21,00:02:24,So the Queens jubilee year 52.
00:02:24,00:02:27,"So that means for the first few months of her reign,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,there was a different way of assessing the music charts as it were.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"So in the US, they had the billboards."
00:02:32,00:02:36,"So for the billboards, it was a I think since the 1940s, it was like weekly sales."
00:02:36,00:02:41,"But in the UK, they didn't have a charts based on music sales."
00:02:41,00:02:45,"So it was an organization called the PRS, the Performing Right Society."
00:02:45,00:02:48,And they would look at the best selling sheet music.
00:02:48,00:02:51,The word sheet always annoys me.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"In school, if I say the word sheet, it's just like, sir?"
00:02:53,00:02:56,"Is that what? Do you have two sheets on you, sir?"
00:02:56,00:02:58,"I mean, they're very juvenile, sorry."
00:02:58,00:03:01,We've got the sense of humour of your students.
00:03:01,00:03:04,"Bobby's a teacher, by the way, yeah, we should say."
00:03:04,00:03:06,So it was the sheet music.
00:03:06,00:03:08,So a man called Percy Dickens.
00:03:08,00:03:10,So Hale Percy Dickens.
00:03:10,00:03:13,So he was a magazine advertising salesman.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"And he was actually a founding member of the New Musical Express magazine,"
00:03:17,00:03:20,which is now enemy or there's an enemy shut nowadays.
00:03:20,00:03:22,It's still online. It's still functions online.
00:03:22,00:03:23,RIP print copy.
00:03:23,00:03:27,"But yeah, Hale to the digital copies."
00:03:27,00:03:30,"So he thought, actually, what's the best way of getting advertising revenue"
00:03:30,00:03:31,for a magazine?
00:03:31,00:03:34,"And he said, actually, we can attract commercial advertising revenue"
00:03:34,00:03:37,if we tie up something with the record industry.
00:03:37,00:03:41,"So they thought, oh, actually, how about we do some sort of record based music chart?"
00:03:41,00:03:44,And that's how the initial brainwave spark.
00:03:44,00:03:47,"OK, so records were sort of like an obscure,"
00:03:47,00:03:48,"you know, why are you buying a record?"
00:03:48,00:03:50,You could just buy the sheet music and your own piano.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"You can sing it on yourself, yeah."
00:03:53,00:03:56,"OK, and then they decided calling around 20 shops"
00:03:56,00:03:59,would be the most reliable ways to do that.
00:03:59,00:04:02,"Yes, so but why his system was like that."
00:04:02,00:04:05,But so what the management of NME decided was they I think they agreed
00:04:05,00:04:09,with 50 shops that they would be willing to exchange data.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"So but with those 50 ish shops, I think it's 53, but it's 50 ish."
00:04:12,00:04:14,It's always safe as a mathematician.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"You know, you don't like giving exact numbers."
00:04:17,00:04:21,"So every Monday morning, Percy Dickens would pick up the dog and bone phone"
00:04:21,00:04:24,"and call up about 15 to 25 shops on average, 20 shops."
00:04:24,00:04:27,And each store would give their top 10.
00:04:27,00:04:29,"But this is where things get a bit murky,"
00:04:29,00:04:33,because he would then have a points based system that allocate to this.
00:04:33,00:04:34,And this is a bit we don't know.
00:04:34,00:04:35,It's like a Eurovision type system.
00:04:35,00:04:37,We don't know the exact system.
00:04:37,00:04:40,"But because of that, it meant his first ever top."
00:04:40,00:04:44,"I think he was trying to do like a top 12, but there were 15 entries."
00:04:44,00:04:47,"Because three entries, number seven, eight and 11 tied."
00:04:47,00:04:50,"And we all know in reality, it's unlikely that three songs would have"
00:04:50,00:04:52,exactly the same number of sales.
00:04:52,00:04:54,But because he went to 20 shops.
00:04:54,00:04:58,"Yeah, just yeah, you probably have like two songs with 17 sales each."
00:04:58,00:04:59,And then how are they?
00:04:59,00:05:02,"Because I sort of read that they're not the great at monitoring anyway,"
00:05:02,00:05:03,"are they, the shops?"
00:05:03,00:05:06,And also they might just say the song that they like best.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"Well, if they were told, we're going to be ringing you up and asking if you're sales."
00:05:09,00:05:11,They probably would keep the sales.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Yeah, I like that."
00:05:12,00:05:15,I would just I do find myself wondering if anyone ever tried to game
00:05:15,00:05:19,"the system by picking a particular shop and saying, well, I'm going to send"
00:05:19,00:05:21,15 different friends in here all to buy this one single.
00:05:21,00:05:23,Hope they get phoned up this week by Percy Dickens.
00:05:23,00:05:24,"That did used to happen, though."
00:05:24,00:05:27,I don't know specifically to do to British charts.
00:05:27,00:05:30,"But certainly overseas in America, you would have, you know,"
00:05:30,00:05:35,the really rich people just buying huge units of an album
00:05:35,00:05:38,from one specific store just to get those numbers up to get them into the charts.
00:05:38,00:05:41,There was that was a thing to get in the charts.
00:05:41,00:05:42,"I mean, that's happened forever."
00:05:42,00:05:47,"You know, Taylor Swift's doing a gig and she's bundled it with the new album"
00:05:47,00:05:50,or she's released a new t-shirt and she bundles it with the album.
00:05:50,00:05:53,And so you cheat the sale because you're attaching it.
00:05:53,00:05:54,It counters us in.
00:05:54,00:05:59,"It used to and not anymore because they noticed that the bands were just,"
00:05:59,00:06:00,"you know, cheating the system."
00:06:00,00:06:01,They were gaming the system.
00:06:01,00:06:03,And so they actually not popular at all.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift."
00:06:04,00:06:10,"Does it turn out no, no, no, no, exactly."
00:06:10,00:06:13,"But May 2020, Dua Lipa, she had future nostalgia,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,which was the lowest selling number one album ever.
00:06:15,00:06:19,Imagine getting to number one and finding out you were the worst asset.
00:06:19,00:06:21,That's a good record. Yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Why did they tell her that? That's mean.
00:06:22,00:06:26,"Yeah. 7,317 copies. Wow."
00:06:26,00:06:29,"That was the that was the sixth week that she was at number one. Oh, OK."
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Yeah, yeah. But it's going to be some tiling off."
00:06:30,00:06:32,Yeah. But what was that was still number one in that week?
00:06:33,00:06:34,"Yes, it was still number one in that week."
00:06:34,00:06:36,Yeah. And so what's amazing about this
00:06:36,00:06:39,"is that it's basically since streaming music has come along,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,that the charts have been altered in such a weird way.
00:06:41,00:06:46,So a thousand album streams equates to one record sale is what they say.
00:06:46,00:06:50,"One physical product. Yeah, I think that's in the UK, isn't it?"
00:06:50,00:06:51,"Yeah, that's in the UK."
00:06:51,00:06:52,That's how that's how you do that.
00:06:52,00:06:54,But also what they found is so interesting.
00:06:54,00:06:58,Such an interesting time where gigantic musicians
00:06:58,00:07:01,who are global names are fighting it in the charts with bands
00:07:01,00:07:04,that are independent local British ones with a big fan base
00:07:04,00:07:06,who can get them to that number.
00:07:06,00:07:07,So they're in the charts.
00:07:07,00:07:11,"But because everyone's streaming the biggies, they're not buying the album."
00:07:11,00:07:13,"But then the little ones, they've got such hardcore fans"
00:07:13,00:07:17,who might buy five or six copies to give to their friends and family.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"They're making a dent in the charts. Oh, I see."
00:07:19,00:07:22,"So you mean the bands that only only their friends or family buying it,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,"they buy physical albums, but because that's so rare to do."
00:07:25,00:07:27,And they come they come more in the equation as well.
00:07:27,00:07:33,"So I think for singles charts, a hundred paid streams is one sale"
00:07:33,00:07:35,and six hundred free streams.
00:07:35,00:07:37,So the freemium versions is one sale.
00:07:37,00:07:41,"So if you pay for your Spotify iTunes and you're streaming it,"
00:07:41,00:07:44,it's six times more valuable than someone on an ad based.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"Wow. Oh, that's good."
00:07:46,00:07:50,"Because if I find a song I like, I will often listen to it six hundred times."
00:07:50,00:07:53,"Despite what if you buy it once, it's the same."
00:07:53,00:07:56,"Oh, you don't have to subject yourself to the six hundred."
00:07:57,00:07:58,You can just buy it.
00:07:58,00:07:58,I don't want to know.
00:07:58,00:08:03,I want to say the money and be I do really like the songs I like.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"So I'm just back to Percy Dickens and the first listen, fifty two."
00:08:07,00:08:10,"I was reading about the first ever number one single,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"which was called Here in My Heart, and it was by Al Martino."
00:08:13,00:08:16,"Do you guys read about him? No, he was crazy."
00:08:16,00:08:18,So I never heard of him before.
00:08:18,00:08:21,He was an Italian-American singer and former bricklayer.
00:08:21,00:08:26,And he went on to great fame because he was in The Godfather.
00:08:26,00:08:30,Hmm. Playing a singer called Johnny Fontaine.
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Oh, yeah. Johnny Fontaine is the one who leads to someone"
00:08:32,00:08:35,getting a horse's head in the bed. Yes. Yes. That's right.
00:08:35,00:08:36,Confession. I've not watched The Godfather.
00:08:36,00:08:39,"Well, I was told off at a party recently about this."
00:08:39,00:08:42,"I do know the fact, but I was not I have not seen The Godfather."
00:08:42,00:08:45,"Well, it's a very worth watching."
00:08:45,00:08:47,It's it's only average.
00:08:47,00:08:50,It's no grownups without a sound.
00:08:50,00:08:51,But then this is OK.
00:08:51,00:08:53,This is the really weird thing about Al Martino.
00:08:53,00:08:57,So he was he played a singer connected to the mafia in the film The Godfather.
00:08:57,00:09:00,But then eventually he was forced to leave the UK by the mafia
00:09:00,00:09:03,because they tried to buy him out of his American marital contract.
00:09:03,00:09:06,And there was some controversy and there was some disagreement.
00:09:06,00:09:08,And then so really? Yeah. Yeah.
00:09:08,00:09:11,So he was involved in a mafia-ish circles.
00:09:11,00:09:12,It sounds like a bit.
00:09:12,00:09:14,It sounds like you may have met them sometimes.
00:09:14,00:09:14,I don't know.
00:09:14,00:09:16,"The Godfather filming, maybe."
00:09:16,00:09:19,Method acting. Good.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"Oh, my God. I love that. I went two methods."
00:09:22,00:09:24,I'm on Percy Dickens. Yeah.
00:09:24,00:09:26,So do you know his second claim to fame?
00:09:26,00:09:27,So obviously the charts is his first claim to fame.
00:09:27,00:09:31,But the second one is so do you know we have modern sort of like award ceremonies
00:09:31,00:09:32,and stadium rock concerts?
00:09:32,00:09:35,"So he actually in the early 60s,"
00:09:35,00:09:38,he pioneered the something called the enemy poll winners concert.
00:09:38,00:09:42,And he managed to get I think the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
00:09:42,00:09:45,"And again, this is like a tenuous claim to fame."
00:09:45,00:09:47,But some people in the music industry say that was responsible
00:09:47,00:09:49,for the sort of award ceremonies we have nowadays.
00:09:49,00:09:51,So he was the first person in the UK.
00:09:51,00:09:55,"So let's say all the winners of the awards, music awards,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,let's get them all together in a big concert at Wembley.
00:09:57,00:09:59,"So I think it was Wembley Arena, which is the Empire Pool at the time."
00:09:59,00:10:01,So that's his second. His fault.
00:10:01,00:10:03,We have these awards ceremonies.
00:10:03,00:10:05,I love that. What a big character.
00:10:05,00:10:08,So he's from I didn't realize he's from my hometown of East Ham.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"East Ham from the London Borough of Newham,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,which is why I'm a Master of West Ham fan.
00:10:12,00:10:14,But I never knew he was from East Ham.
00:10:14,00:10:17,And I was trying to find out where in East Ham and I can't.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"But if there's people, listeners out there,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,we need to get a blue plaque for this man in East Ham.
00:10:21,00:10:26,He sounded the chart and possibly pioneered the music award ceremony.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"Yeah, that's incredible. I agree."
00:10:29,00:10:29,I was reading about.
00:10:29,00:10:34,Did you guys happen to read about the first ever top 100 billboard single?
00:10:34,00:10:36,So this was in 1958.
00:10:36,00:10:40,And it was a song that was called Poor Little Fool by Ricky Nelson.
00:10:40,00:10:44,"And yeah, so it came out was a massive hit."
00:10:44,00:10:47,And it was actually written by a woman called Sharon Shealy.
00:10:48,00:10:51,And she wrote the song because she'd met Elvis Presley when she was 15.
00:10:51,00:10:54,And he basically encouraged her to get into writing.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"So she thought, OK, I'll do that."
00:10:56,00:11:01,"She based it, the song on a very short fling that she had"
00:11:01,00:11:03,with a guy called Don Everly of the Everly Brothers.
00:11:03,00:11:07,"So the song that's the first number one is actually based on a musician,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,which is quite cool in its own right.
00:11:09,00:11:13,"And effectively, she might have dabbled with some other songs."
00:11:13,00:11:16,"But from what I read, this was the first song that she wrote."
00:11:16,00:11:19,And so she she thought I need to get someone to record it.
00:11:19,00:11:21,So she thought Ricky Nelson could be perfect for this.
00:11:21,00:11:25,So she drove to his house and she faked breaking down outside of it.
00:11:25,00:11:28,"The car, not emotionally."
00:11:28,00:11:31,"So she broke down her car, supposedly was broken down."
00:11:31,00:11:33,"And she was like, please, can you help me?"
00:11:33,00:11:34,"And he was like, yeah, OK."
00:11:34,00:11:36,And he came out and he tried to help her with the car.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"And then she went, I've got a song. You got to hear it."
00:11:38,00:11:39,I want you to sing it.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"And he heard it and he went, OK, I'll do it."
00:11:41,00:11:42,And that's the first number one.
00:11:42,00:11:47,"Her first song at 18, handing it by faking a breakdown."
00:11:47,00:11:50,Yeah. Did he fix her car that wasn't broken?
00:11:50,00:11:54,"Yeah, it fooled him because he didn't know he could do that."
00:11:54,00:11:57,He subsequently left the music industry and became a mechanic.
00:11:57,00:12:01,He's the worst mechanic.
00:12:01,00:12:06,There is someone who collected every single track
00:12:06,00:12:09,that entered the top 40 from 1952 onwards.
00:12:09,00:12:12,A guy called Keith Sevier and he died in 2015.
00:12:12,00:12:14,So the collecting stopped then.
00:12:14,00:12:17,"But he bought every single track, every one that entered the top 40."
00:12:17,00:12:19,How many is that? Do you know?
00:12:19,00:12:23,"Well, his lounge alone contained 35,000 vinyls."
00:12:23,00:12:27,"He had and 10,000 CD singles as well."
00:12:27,00:12:29,"I mean, it was a lot."
00:12:29,00:12:30,We think that's cool.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"But for his kids, every time they went home,"
00:12:32,00:12:33,you'd have that conversation with your dad.
00:12:33,00:12:36,"Like, dad, have you thought about clearing these out?"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"I mean, he lived in a normal house in Twickenham."
00:12:38,00:12:43,"It was not a big place, but it was entirely full of stacked records, just insane."
00:12:43,00:12:48,"If I was his kids or children or nephews and nieces,"
00:12:48,00:12:50,I'd feel like a responsibility to continue that from 2015.
00:12:50,00:12:54,You can't just like from 52 to 2015.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"You can't just leave it like, oh, family tradition."
00:12:57,00:13:00,Exactly. I don't think I read a piece about it.
00:13:00,00:13:02,"And I don't think anyone in the family was saying, oh, yeah, we'll keep going."
00:13:02,00:13:05,"I know, you can be the foster child."
00:13:07,00:13:10,Can I just tell you something fun about sheet music charts?
00:13:10,00:13:12,"Yeah, what type of music?"
00:13:12,00:13:14,Sheet music.
00:13:14,00:13:15,How many sheets?
00:13:15,00:13:17,This music is sheet.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"So, Bobby, you mentioned earlier about sheet music,"
00:13:19,00:13:21,being how the charts were compiled before the fifties.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"And so, yeah, that was how people took in music."
00:13:24,00:13:25,"Basically, they went and bought sheet music,"
00:13:25,00:13:28,and then I guess they'd have to play it at home or look at it
00:13:28,00:13:29,and imagine it being played.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"And so sheet music, publishing and promotion was a huge industry."
00:13:33,00:13:37,And you got people who were hired as song pluggers
00:13:37,00:13:39,who would be like demonstrators who would sit in shops
00:13:39,00:13:42,that were selling sheet music and they'd have to play the music.
00:13:42,00:13:46,"So someone would say, I want to buy this by so and so."
00:13:46,00:13:47,And then people.
00:13:47,00:13:49,So certain people got their starts in life.
00:13:49,00:13:52,"Doing that Lil Hardin, who was Louis Armstrong's wife,"
00:13:52,00:13:54,started as a songplugger Irving Berlin.
00:13:54,00:13:57,George Gershwin started as songpluggers.
00:13:57,00:13:58,Did they slip their own songs in?
00:13:58,00:14:00,Is that how they got big?
00:14:00,00:14:01,This is a cracking hit.
00:14:01,00:14:04,"Yeah, people come up to you in the shop and do they say,"
00:14:04,00:14:06,I want to buy a song that goes like this.
00:14:06,00:14:08,But then they play it.
00:14:08,00:14:10,"No, they could do that."
00:14:10,00:14:12,I guess you'd adapt to your customer.
00:14:12,00:14:18,"So if you came in and, you know, sang the, I don't know, that they'd say,"
00:14:18,00:14:19,"oh, well, you might like this song."
00:14:19,00:14:20,"I think, yeah, exactly."
00:14:20,00:14:21,Like a Spotify algorithm.
00:14:21,00:14:24,They're radio. They're just a back.
00:14:24,00:14:25,They're live radio.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"They're just playing the hits, presumably from the week."
00:14:27,00:14:29,"People say, oh, I like that song you're playing."
00:14:29,00:14:32,"Yeah. Yeah. They're like a jukebox, like a shazami type of."
00:14:32,00:14:35,Yes. Yeah. The original shazami. Yes.
00:14:35,00:14:36,But they did. It wasn't just playing.
00:14:36,00:14:41,They'd also be paid by the song publishers to do things like they go into theaters
00:14:41,00:14:46,"and in the intervals, they'd be paid to start singing a tune really loudly."
00:14:46,00:14:48,And you'd have to get the whole audience to sing along with you.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Cool.
00:14:49,00:14:51,Which you have to be quite confident to do that.
00:14:51,00:14:54,Because you risk looking like a psychopath.
00:14:54,00:14:57,"But yeah. And then people are like, God, I heard that tune at the theater"
00:14:57,00:14:59,in the interval recently. I'm going to buy it.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"Yeah, that's really cool."
00:15:00,00:15:02,"Yeah. What a clever way. I mean, we should do that."
00:15:02,00:15:05,"We should go in the intervals at theater and go, my fact this week."
00:15:05,00:15:15,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:15:15,00:15:16,And that is my fact.
00:15:16,00:15:20,My fact this week is that there are two members of the National Trust's food
00:15:20,00:15:24,and beverage team who both have the surname Kit Kat.
00:15:24,00:15:31,So I got to tell you how I got this fact.
00:15:31,00:15:34,I was at an event recently and someone came up.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"It was a podcast event and someone came up saying, hey, I really like your podcast."
00:15:38,00:15:40,"I said, oh, thanks. And we had a bit of a chat."
00:15:40,00:15:43,Turns out he worked for the National Trust and then I went off.
00:15:43,00:15:45,"And then about an hour later, then you went."
00:15:45,00:15:48,He said I work for the National Trust and you just turned around.
00:15:48,00:15:51,"Yeah, I actually slapped him before I went as well."
00:15:51,00:15:54,And then so I had to go to an event and then I finished.
00:15:54,00:15:57,"And as I came out, he clocked me from across the room"
00:15:57,00:16:00,"and and he kind of ran towards me and said, I forgot to tell you my favorite fact."
00:16:00,00:16:01,And this was the fact.
00:16:01,00:16:04,So his name is Jack Glover.
00:16:04,00:16:07,He's a podcast producer for the National Trust.
00:16:07,00:16:08,They have their own podcast.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"And yeah, and he was saying that basically it's he doesn't know either of these Kit Kat."
00:16:12,00:16:17,But someone mentioned that there was a Kit Kat who worked for the National Trust.
00:16:17,00:16:22,"And as they were googling it, they found not one another Kit Kat."
00:16:22,00:16:24,So related. They're not related because they're spelt differently.
00:16:24,00:16:26,So Louise. Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"Louisa Kit Kat, who spells it K-I-T-C-A-Double-T."
00:16:30,00:16:33,"And then you've got Sam Kit Kat, who's just got one T."
00:16:33,00:16:35,We don't know if they know each other.
00:16:35,00:16:36,I've tried to find them online.
00:16:36,00:16:37,They're on LinkedIn.
00:16:37,00:16:39,I didn't have time to get through to them.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"I think Louise is on Instagram, but it's a private account."
00:16:41,00:16:43,So I couldn't get through to her.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Oh, these poor Kit Kat."
00:16:45,00:16:47,Some weirdo trying to contact them all week.
00:16:47,00:16:49,I've just never heard the surname Kit Kat before.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"No, me neither. I've never heard of that."
00:16:51,00:16:52,"Well, it's a brilliant fact."
00:16:52,00:16:54,Amazing. Food and beverage. Love it.
00:16:54,00:16:57,Should we say what I don't know if overseas every country has its own
00:16:57,00:16:59,national trust in the same kind of way.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"But in Britain, there's basically an organisation."
00:17:01,00:17:05,They're an independent charity and they buy up places of national importance.
00:17:05,00:17:07,And they make it public.
00:17:07,00:17:10,"So they make places that might otherwise have been private,"
00:17:10,00:17:15,like Winston Churchill's Old House Chartwell that was that was bought by them.
00:17:15,00:17:16,And it was transformed into a public place.
00:17:16,00:17:20,And so it means that the public can go and visit all of these extraordinary places.
00:17:20,00:17:22,Yeah. And yeah.
00:17:22,00:17:25,The National Trust has some amazingly weird stuff.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"Yeah. Oh, my goodness."
00:17:27,00:17:29,So I was just reading about like the odd things they have.
00:17:29,00:17:32,Did you know they've got the National Rhubarb Collection?
00:17:32,00:17:34,Cool.
00:17:34,00:17:36,Is that just lots of people mustering away in the back?
00:17:36,00:17:38,- Altenburg actors. - Rhubarb.
00:17:38,00:17:39,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:39,00:17:43,They've got the largest fern in the UK at Colby Woodland Garden.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"It's 400 years old, 19 feet around."
00:17:46,00:17:47,- Wow. Impressive. - Big fern.
00:17:47,00:17:49,- Big fern. - Big fern.
00:17:49,00:17:52,"And they've got one nudist beach, which I've been to, actually."
00:17:52,00:17:53,"- Have you? - Oh, Studland."
00:17:53,00:17:54,I may have mentioned that before.
00:17:54,00:17:55,- It's in Dawson. - Studland.
00:17:55,00:17:57,- Studland. - Studland.
00:17:57,00:18:02,I went down there with my friends and we didn't know it was a nudist beach.
00:18:02,00:18:03,"- Did you get naked? - Yeah, yeah."
00:18:03,00:18:06,"No, we didn't. Well, I didn't. I don't know if they did, but no, we didn't."
00:18:06,00:18:08,But you happen to be naked at the time.
00:18:08,00:18:11,"Fortunately, I was able to seamlessly blend in."
00:18:11,00:18:14,"No, um, yeah, there were the, it was because it's quite sand duny."
00:18:14,00:18:16,"So it's quite, the landscape is quite undulating."
00:18:16,00:18:19,So it's not immediately apparent that it's a nudist beach.
00:18:19,00:18:22,"But every so often, someone will just hove into view who is naked"
00:18:22,00:18:23,and you sort of pop up like a little meerkat.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"You think, oh, that's funny. And then pop back down."
00:18:26,00:18:26,"Anyway, yeah."
00:18:26,00:18:29,Do you think the undulations are a nod to the human form?
00:18:29,00:18:31,"Yeah, absolutely. Yeah."
00:18:31,00:18:36,"Yeah. Well, because this actually doesn't link to another National Trust property."
00:18:36,00:18:36,"Oh, really?"
00:18:36,00:18:39,"West Wiccan Park, West Wiccan Park gardens,"
00:18:39,00:18:42,"were designed in the shape of a woman's anatomy, apparently."
00:18:42,00:18:42,Which anatomy?
00:18:42,00:18:45,Like the whole thing.
00:18:45,00:18:46,I think the whole thing doesn't.
00:18:46,00:18:47,"No, I don't."
00:18:47,00:18:50,"It's just the ear, the left earlobe."
00:18:50,00:18:53,"No, it's mostly centered on a mound of Venus,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,which has a passageway underneath it.
00:18:55,00:18:58,So I think that's a vagina.
00:18:58,00:19:00,But this is so cool.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"This was the home of Sofrancis Dashwood,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,who was who founded something called the Hellfire Club.
00:19:04,00:19:05,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:05,00:19:07,"Which is the, I mean, it's an awful club."
00:19:07,00:19:09,"It's basically a worse version of the Bullington Club,"
00:19:09,00:19:10,but also really fun.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Which is basically--
00:19:11,00:19:12,And it's gone on.
00:19:12,00:19:13,The Hellfire Club or--
00:19:13,00:19:14,"Oh, maybe it is."
00:19:14,00:19:16,"Sounds, it's a club for posh people to meet up"
00:19:16,00:19:19,and do really sordid stuff that probably is still around.
00:19:19,00:19:24,"But yeah, he designed this house and gardens,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,"and then this hillside nearby,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,"which you can also visit, which is National Trust."
00:19:27,00:19:30,And it's full of tunnels and caves that were covered
00:19:30,00:19:32,in like fallacies and pre-apic statues.
00:19:32,00:19:35,"And they'd like act out religious rituals there,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,but in a porny way.
00:19:37,00:19:40,"And so they'd have nuns, but they'd be sex workers."
00:19:40,00:19:42,"And they'd be asked to lie down,"
00:19:42,00:19:44,and then the members of the club would lick holy wine
00:19:44,00:19:46,from their navels and stuff like that.
00:19:46,00:19:48,But lots of people got involved.
00:19:48,00:19:50,And Ben Franklin paid a visit.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Oh, thank you."
00:19:51,00:19:53,"Ben, a bit of naval licking, I'm afraid."
00:19:53,00:19:54,Ben?
00:19:54,00:19:55,"Wow, Ben."
00:19:55,00:19:56,"Ben, first name terms."
00:19:56,00:19:57,My name is Ben.
00:19:57,00:19:58,I believe in first name terms.
00:19:58,00:19:59,I'd abbreviated first name terms.
00:19:59,00:20:00,"Abbreviated, that's what I can't believe."
00:20:00,00:20:03,Ben E.F.
00:20:03,00:20:04,"Ben E.F., yeah."
00:20:04,00:20:06,"Well, in the club, we refer to each other."
00:20:06,00:20:06,"Oh, sure, yeah."
00:20:06,00:20:11,"Anyway, after he died, Francis Dashwood,"
00:20:11,00:20:13,"then his heirs called in Capability Brown,"
00:20:13,00:20:16,the famous garden designer to remove quite a lot
00:20:16,00:20:18,of the more sordid elements of the garden.
00:20:18,00:20:18,Wow.
00:20:18,00:20:20,But you could still visit.
00:20:20,00:20:21,"Do you know what the membership,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,anyone know the membership price for National Trust
00:20:23,00:20:24,or a single person?
00:20:24,00:20:25,I don't.
00:20:25,00:20:26,"I have been a member, so."
00:20:26,00:20:28,"But actually, you know, Benjamin,"
00:20:28,00:20:29,how much is that in the States?
00:20:29,00:20:31,"Benjamin, is that a $100 bill?"
00:20:31,00:20:32,I think it is.
00:20:32,00:20:32,"Yes, it is."
00:20:32,00:20:34,"We call it a Ben, but yeah."
00:20:34,00:20:36,"So actually, I think maybe based on try,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,it might actually be the price of a Ben.
00:20:38,00:20:41,"I think it's about £76.80, which might be a Ben."
00:20:41,00:20:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:42,00:20:42,"It's close, yeah."
00:20:42,00:20:43,That's a Franklin.
00:20:43,00:20:43,Yeah.
00:20:43,00:20:45,Does that get you into all of them for fun?
00:20:45,00:20:45,Yes.
00:20:45,00:20:47,$76.80?
00:20:47,00:20:47,$76.80 for one year.
00:20:47,00:20:49,That has gone up a lot.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"Yeah, I was a member."
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Cost of living crisis, hello."
00:20:51,00:20:51,Yeah.
00:20:51,00:20:56,People can't even afford to visit state-of-the-homes anymore.
00:20:56,00:20:57,I've had to buy cheap-wide to look out
00:20:57,00:20:58,at this sex worker's navel.
00:20:58,00:21:02,So I was looking at the National Trust website
00:21:02,00:21:03,"and they very proudly declare,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"""We have 5.37 million members,"
00:21:05,00:21:07,which is more than Costa Rica.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Are they planning like an invasion?
00:21:08,00:21:11,"Like, we shall arm, get your shovels and picks"
00:21:11,00:21:12,and your membership cards.
00:21:12,00:21:14,"We shall go to Costa Rica."""
00:21:14,00:21:17,They're quite proud of that.
00:21:17,00:21:18,"I mean, that is huge."
00:21:18,00:21:20,That is really huge.
00:21:20,00:21:20,That's in their website.
00:21:20,00:21:21,I didn't see further digging.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"Actually, it's apparently 5.9 million"
00:21:24,00:21:25,rather than 5.37.
00:21:25,00:21:26,So their website's out of date.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"So in theory, they could be more ambitious,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"forget Costa Rica, Denmark or Singapore."
00:21:31,00:21:32,They could invade them.
00:21:32,00:21:33,National Trust.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Which would you go for?
00:21:34,00:21:36,"Denmark, I think, probably has more historic features"
00:21:36,00:21:36,that they could get.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Easier to get to from Britain as well.
00:21:37,00:21:38,That's true.
00:21:38,00:21:39,The Vikings.
00:21:39,00:21:39,Yeah.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Take back.
00:21:40,00:21:41,Take back.
00:21:41,00:21:41,"Yeah, Denmark."
00:21:41,00:21:42,Let's take a Denmark.
00:21:42,00:21:42,Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:46,There's one place that Jack was telling me about
00:21:46,00:21:48,who sent me this fact called Orford Ness.
00:21:48,00:21:50,And it's a nature reserve.
00:21:50,00:21:52,And they have lots of amazing animals there.
00:21:52,00:21:54,They have the white-faced woodland sheep.
00:21:54,00:21:56,But they've also got a nuclear bomb.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Yeah.
00:21:57,00:21:58,So really?
00:21:58,00:21:59,Is that why the sheep look so pale?
00:21:59,00:22:01,It's still there.
00:22:01,00:22:05,"So basically, Britain detonated an atomic bomb"
00:22:05,00:22:07,"in the '50s, 1952."
00:22:07,00:22:07,A few tests and things like that.
00:22:07,00:22:08,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:08,00:22:09,We had some tests.
00:22:09,00:22:13,"And the pre-test was done at this place, Orford Ness."
00:22:13,00:22:15,And the reason that it was done there
00:22:15,00:22:19,is what they did was they built these big kind of buildings
00:22:19,00:22:20,that would go into the ground.
00:22:20,00:22:22,And the bombs were effectively being tested
00:22:22,00:22:23,for their stress levels.
00:22:23,00:22:25,So what they did was they put them in the buildings
00:22:25,00:22:28,and then they just shaped them and just kept shaking them.
00:22:28,00:22:30,"Just shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake."
00:22:30,00:22:31,And the idea was if you were transporting
00:22:31,00:22:33,"a nuclear bomb by plane,"
00:22:33,00:22:36,they wanted to make sure that it didn't detonate
00:22:36,00:22:37,as it was being flown to the place.
00:22:37,00:22:39,And it didn't detonate purely because of the stress levels
00:22:39,00:22:40,that it would have.
00:22:40,00:22:41,So this is where they did it.
00:22:41,00:22:44,And they still have one of the bombs sitting there.
00:22:44,00:22:45,It's deactivated.
00:22:45,00:22:46,"OK, I was going to ask that."
00:22:46,00:22:48,I was going to take care of you.
00:22:48,00:22:49,They always use deactivate.
00:22:49,00:22:53,"I mean, yeah, they didn't test it with an armed bomb anyway."
00:22:53,00:22:55,But it's sitting there next to the sheep.
00:22:55,00:22:56,I'm going to Orford Ness in a couple of weeks.
00:22:56,00:22:56,Get out.
00:22:56,00:22:58,Go shake the bomb.
00:22:58,00:22:58,I will.
00:22:58,00:23:00,That's so cool.
00:23:00,00:23:03,"Yeah, the founding story of the National Trust"
00:23:03,00:23:06,"is it's got a lot of great characters at its beginning,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,hasn't it?
00:23:07,00:23:09,So there were three founders.
00:23:09,00:23:13,"It was a lawyer, clergyman, and social reformer."
00:23:13,00:23:14,"Sounds like a savage joke, doesn't it?"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"A lawyer, a priest, and a social reformer walking down."
00:23:17,00:23:19,What happens?
00:23:19,00:23:21,They make a socially responsible organization.
00:23:21,00:23:26,"But yeah, this woman called Octavia Hill,"
00:23:26,00:23:29,"who was the eighth daughter of her father,"
00:23:29,00:23:32,which I always like if you're called Octavia or Tertius
00:23:32,00:23:34,"or whatever, be the eighth."
00:23:34,00:23:35,Yes.
00:23:36,00:23:37,"And so maybe that's why he had eight daughters,"
00:23:37,00:23:38,so he could call on Octavia.
00:23:38,00:23:40,And she was amazing.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"She, her parents had sort of set up a school"
00:23:43,00:23:45,for the poor and stuff and would do good as anyway.
00:23:45,00:23:47,So she had good examples set for her.
00:23:47,00:23:49,But then her dad went bankrupt
00:23:49,00:23:51,and left the family in the 19th century.
00:23:51,00:23:52,Maybe.
00:23:52,00:23:54,Because he had eight children.
00:23:54,00:23:55,"Yeah, he does."
00:23:55,00:23:58,"I've read a story where age 14,"
00:23:58,00:23:59,she was left home alone.
00:23:59,00:24:01,Her family had gone to church.
00:24:01,00:24:02,"Oh, I know this story, isn't it?"
00:24:02,00:24:03,And two burglars.
00:24:05,00:24:06,The iron on the face.
00:24:06,00:24:06,Yes.
00:24:06,00:24:06,Yes.
00:24:06,00:24:09,And she mutilated them horribly.
00:24:09,00:24:10,Yes.
00:24:10,00:24:10,But they came back.
00:24:10,00:24:12,They came back.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Now you've said that I think this might have been
00:24:13,00:24:15,the home alone origin story.
00:24:15,00:24:15,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:15,00:24:17,"Because it was, it was one burglar."
00:24:17,00:24:18,"Oh, seriously?"
00:24:18,00:24:19,"Yeah, yeah, one burglar came in,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"came out, fell out of a cupboard actually."
00:24:21,00:24:23,She was on the surface of their house.
00:24:23,00:24:25,He fell out of a cupboard where he'd been hiding.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"And apparently she said,"
00:24:27,00:24:28,"""How did you get in here?"""
00:24:28,00:24:29,"And he said, ""I walked up the stairs."""
00:24:29,00:24:30,"And she just said,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"""Then will you please to walk down them again?"""
00:24:32,00:24:34,And then she led him down the stairs
00:24:34,00:24:35,and out of the house.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Wow.
00:24:36,00:24:37,So that's a much shorter whole load.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"Didn't need a punch up, didn't it,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,for the Macaulay Culkin version.
00:24:40,00:24:44,"But what a compliant burglar,"
00:24:44,00:24:45,like how responsible.
00:24:45,00:24:46,Yeah.
00:24:46,00:24:47,To ethical burgling.
00:24:47,00:24:47,Ethical burgling.
00:24:47,00:24:49,Like if you ask me nicely.
00:24:49,00:24:50,I won't do it.
00:24:50,00:24:50,Yeah.
00:24:50,00:24:51,"And didn't she,"
00:24:51,00:24:52,I think I'm right in saying that
00:24:52,00:24:54,she later went to New York
00:24:54,00:24:55,and she got lost.
00:24:55,00:24:55,Didn't she?
00:24:55,00:24:56,"Yeah, that's right."
00:24:56,00:24:58,She boarded the wrong plane.
00:24:58,00:24:59,"Yeah, that's right."
00:24:59,00:25:02,"Yeah, Octavia Hill was amazing."
00:25:03,00:25:06,But I kind of got sidetracked reading about
00:25:06,00:25:08,"the clergyman of the three founders,"
00:25:08,00:25:11,"Kenan Hardwick, Drummond Raunsley."
00:25:11,00:25:12,Which is such an incredible...
00:25:12,00:25:12,A medieval name.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"Yeah, it is formidable."
00:25:13,00:25:16,So he was a bishop from Lincolnshire.
00:25:16,00:25:19,He was described as the most active volcano in Europe
00:25:19,00:25:20,"by one of his parishioners,"
00:25:20,00:25:23,"because he was so energetic, involved, always,"
00:25:23,00:25:25,coming up with new schemes and committees and plans
00:25:25,00:25:28,"and projects and papers and all of this,"
00:25:28,00:25:30,constantly writing and thinking and meeting.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"But his main interest, as far as I can tell,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,seems to be building bonfires.
00:25:34,00:25:36,He had this huge passion about bonfires.
00:25:36,00:25:41,"So there was a diamond jubilee for Queen Victoria in 1897,"
00:25:41,00:25:41,I guess it would have been.
00:25:41,00:25:42,Six of them.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"Yeah, and he was the head of something"
00:25:44,00:25:45,called the National Bonfire Committee.
00:25:45,00:25:47,He basically spent his whole time
00:25:47,00:25:49,"suggesting huge bonfires at any opportunity,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,any national opportunity.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"So when the First World War ended, 1919,"
00:25:52,00:25:54,they had huge bonfires everywhere.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Coronation in 1911, huge bonfires."
00:25:56,00:25:59,So how many national trust properties
00:25:59,00:26:00,"did he burn down, of course,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,when he found the organization?
00:26:01,00:26:03,"It's just amazing, these huge towers of work."
00:26:03,00:26:07,"The coronation ones in 1911 are so impressively massive,"
00:26:07,00:26:11,"and he organized 2,200 of them across the entire country."
00:26:11,00:26:14,It was a mega theme of his life.
00:26:14,00:26:15,Really?
00:26:15,00:26:15,Yeah.
00:26:15,00:26:16,"We should have like a bonfire czar,"
00:26:16,00:26:17,a national bonfire czar.
00:26:17,00:26:18,"Oh, that's such a good idea."
00:26:18,00:26:19,That's an awesome idea.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Because we just had the jubilee
00:26:20,00:26:21,and there were lots of beacons.
00:26:21,00:26:24,But they were tiny compared with these things.
00:26:24,00:26:24,I mean...
00:26:24,00:26:25,I didn't know.
00:26:25,00:26:26,We're making cuts to the civil service.
00:26:26,00:26:29,I'm not sure we're talking about the bonfire czar
00:26:29,00:26:30,and Boris's vision.
00:26:30,00:26:33,"Just back to Octavia for one second,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,because I think it's worth mentioning
00:26:34,00:26:37,there's quite a lot of descriptions about her character
00:26:37,00:26:39,"and who she was by her friends,"
00:26:39,00:26:43,and I find them such bizarre representations.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"So she had a friend called Henrietta Barnett,"
00:26:45,00:26:47,and Henrietta described her saying
00:26:47,00:26:50,she was small in stature with a long body and short legs.
00:26:50,00:26:52,She did not dress.
00:26:52,00:26:53,"She only wore clothes,"
00:26:53,00:26:55,which were often unnecessarily unbecoming.
00:26:55,00:26:57,"Her mouth was large and mobile,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,but not improved by laughter.
00:26:59,00:27:02,Really quite cutting stuff.
00:27:02,00:27:03,And one of her friends writing this thing.
00:27:03,00:27:06,"Yeah, it was her friend."
00:27:06,00:27:07,Gertrude Bell had a comment about her
00:27:07,00:27:09,saying she was despotic.
00:27:09,00:27:11,So not a great review.
00:27:11,00:27:13,"And the Bishop of London,"
00:27:13,00:27:14,"who was called Frederick Temple,"
00:27:14,00:27:16,"he had a meeting with her,"
00:27:16,00:27:17,"and afterwards he wrote,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,"she spoke for half an hour,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"""I never had such a beating in my life."""
00:27:21,00:27:22,Really?
00:27:22,00:27:22,Yeah.
00:27:22,00:27:24,"So, you know, it sounds like she was really,"
00:27:24,00:27:25,"you know, sort of confident."
00:27:25,00:27:27,"She was formidable, definitely."
00:27:27,00:27:28,But then I was reading a lot of--
00:27:28,00:27:29,Just quick nominative determinism.
00:27:29,00:27:31,"Sorry, Bishop called Frederick Temple."
00:27:31,00:27:31,"Yes, yes."
00:27:31,00:27:32,That's nice.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Good pause.
00:27:33,00:27:33,Thank you.
00:27:33,00:27:34,The pause for that.
00:27:34,00:27:35,Octavia Hill as well.
00:27:35,00:27:36,Hill National Trust.
00:27:36,00:27:38,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:38,00:27:39,Because the first thing that was donated
00:27:39,00:27:41,to the National Trust was a hillside.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Really?
00:27:42,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:44,By someone called Fanny Tolbert.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"But you know that one of the,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,the lawyer that was one of the trio
00:27:48,00:27:49,was Robert Hunter.
00:27:49,00:27:50,He's a lawyer.
00:27:50,00:27:51,Lawyers are like hunters.
00:27:51,00:27:52,"They're like, ""Find it."""
00:27:52,00:27:53,"And you stretched it too far, Bobby."
00:27:53,00:27:53,I'm sorry.
00:27:53,00:27:55,"Yeah, that's one too."
00:27:55,00:27:55,It's okay.
00:27:55,00:27:56,You're new to the show.
00:27:56,00:27:57,It's fine.
00:27:57,00:27:58,You'll find your seat.
00:27:58,00:27:59,You've lost everyone.
00:27:59,00:28:02,Beatrix Potter too.
00:28:02,00:28:03,I'm sure you guys came across this.
00:28:03,00:28:04,Yeah.
00:28:04,00:28:05,What did you just say?
00:28:05,00:28:06,Beatrix Potter.
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Well, what's her--"
00:28:07,00:28:08,I'm sure you guys came across--
00:28:08,00:28:08,Beatrix.
00:28:08,00:28:10,He pronouncing her name in a really odd way.
00:28:10,00:28:11,"Oh, God, oh, God."
00:28:11,00:28:12,I've said all my life is Beatrix Potter.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Beatrix, I think Beatrix Potter."
00:28:14,00:28:14,Beatrix.
00:28:14,00:28:15,"Yes, Beatrix."
00:28:15,00:28:16,What did you say?
00:28:16,00:28:17,Beatrix.
00:28:17,00:28:18,"Oh, like, you know, beetroot."
00:28:18,00:28:19,"Yeah, I guess."
00:28:19,00:28:22,People are going to have an absolute field day with that.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"Yeah, well, get over it, guys."
00:28:24,00:28:25,I say Beatrix.
00:28:26,00:28:27,"I'm sorry, come on."
00:28:27,00:28:28,Christ.
00:28:28,00:28:31,She donated so much to the National Trust.
00:28:31,00:28:34,"She'd made 4,000 acres after the success of Jemima Puddleduck"
00:28:34,00:28:36,and Mr. Jeremy Fisher and all of that.
00:28:36,00:28:38,She just devoted her time to breeding sheep.
00:28:38,00:28:39,"Sorry, Puddleduck?"
00:28:39,00:28:41,"Oh, God, how do I--"
00:28:41,00:28:42,How are you meant to pronounce it?
00:28:42,00:28:43,"Well, that's just another--"
00:28:43,00:28:44,"Jemima Puddleduck, yeah?"
00:28:44,00:28:46,Do you not know Jemima Puddleduck?
00:28:46,00:28:46,No.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"Oh, that's a character."
00:28:48,00:28:49,That's a character.
00:28:49,00:28:50,We've been in the--
00:28:50,00:28:51,19th century reform.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"Prison reforms, particularly."
00:28:53,00:28:56,"Founder of the National Trust, I thought we were saying."
00:28:56,00:28:59,"She advocated, I think, for free bread for everybody."
00:28:59,00:28:59,Yeah.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Yeah.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"Near, like, watering holes."
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Oh, come on."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Who gives a duck a surname?
00:29:05,00:29:07,That's unfair.
00:29:07,00:29:08,"Oh, my God."
00:29:08,00:29:17,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:29:17,00:29:20,My fact is that the French-speaking clock
00:29:20,00:29:22,was created by an astronomer who was annoyed
00:29:22,00:29:25,that members of the public kept phoning his office
00:29:25,00:29:28,"to ask for the time, which would be annoying."
00:29:28,00:29:32,"So this was from an article in The Times,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"which was about the fact that the French-speaking clock,"
00:29:35,00:29:39,"l'horloge parallelante, is winding down, and winding up,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,and closing down.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"Clock related things, yeah."
00:29:43,00:29:47,"It's the oldest speaking clock in the world, I think,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,"or it was the first one founded,"
00:29:49,00:29:53,and it was pioneered by a man called Ernest Esquelongan
00:29:53,00:29:55,"in 1933, who was a French astronomer,"
00:29:55,00:29:58,"and I think was at the sort of official,"
00:29:58,00:29:59,"you know, the government."
00:29:59,00:30:01,He was the director of the Paris Observatory.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"Oh, there we go."
00:30:02,00:30:03,"OK, yeah."
00:30:03,00:30:05,"And people kept ringing up to ask the time,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"because that was one of the ways, before speaking"
00:30:07,00:30:09,"clocks existed, you verified the absolute nailed-on time,"
00:30:09,00:30:13,"was you phoned an astronomer, and his phone line"
00:30:13,00:30:15,"was constantly busy with people phoning up,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,and his office staff were always being distracted
00:30:16,00:30:19,"by people saying, yeah, it's 1033 and a bit."
00:30:21,00:30:23,So that was the inspiration.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"I love the idea that maybe he spotted an oncoming comet,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,"you know, crashing into Earth,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,and he just wasn't able to notify anyone.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"Did he have, then, a reliable clock in front of him"
00:30:33,00:30:37,"that he set, or would he, how was he telling the time?"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"I don't know, I think it would have been,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,that's where the official time-keeping device
00:30:42,00:30:43,for the country was kept.
00:30:43,00:30:44,That's where it started.
00:30:44,00:30:45,I think the Paris Observatory was where it was.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yeah.
00:30:46,00:30:48,More like the way that Greenwich were the official stewards
00:30:48,00:30:49,"of, you know, official time."
00:30:49,00:30:51,"Because there was huge rivalry, time-wise,"
00:30:51,00:30:52,between Britain and France.
00:30:52,00:30:55,"It's the main beef between us, almost, to this day."
00:30:55,00:30:56,I would say it wasn't there.
00:30:56,00:30:59,"It was like, where's official time gonna rest?"
00:30:59,00:31:01,And it ended up being Greenwich for the world.
00:31:01,00:31:04,But I think Paris Observatory was the other big contender.
00:31:04,00:31:07,I think they defined Greenwich time
00:31:07,00:31:09,"as Paris time minus two and a half minutes,"
00:31:09,00:31:11,or whatever number of minutes it was.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"And they did it so, until about the 1990s,"
00:31:13,00:31:17,"like they really dug their heels in on Greenwich time, yeah."
00:31:17,00:31:20,"So this clock, the first speaking clock in France,"
00:31:20,00:31:23,"it was the 14th of February, 1933, when it debuted."
00:31:23,00:31:24,And on its very first day.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"Oh, it's romantic."
00:31:26,00:31:27,"That's true, yeah."
00:31:27,00:31:28,That's lovely.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"So 140,000 people called up,"
00:31:31,00:31:34,"or rather recalled up, trying to hear it,"
00:31:34,00:31:37,"because they could only get 20,000 answers"
00:31:37,00:31:38,"during the course of the day,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,because they had 20 lines that were doing it.
00:31:40,00:31:43,"So that might have been one person just recalling,"
00:31:43,00:31:44,just desperate to hear it.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"But yeah, incredible."
00:31:45,00:31:48,Very lonely people on Valentine's Day that year.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"When you were children,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,"did you ever call up the one, two, three number?"
00:31:51,00:31:53,"In the UK, we've got like a one, two, three number."
00:31:53,00:31:54,I used to annoy my parents.
00:31:54,00:31:56,I used to call them up on the number.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"And you'd hear like, at the third stroke, the time would be,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,"and then 10 seconds later, I'd call again,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,and then my parents would get like an enormous bill.
00:32:01,00:32:03,It was so expensive.
00:32:03,00:32:04,So expensive.
00:32:04,00:32:07,"But in the UK, I think is the BT speaking clock."
00:32:07,00:32:09,"And at some stage, they called it,"
00:32:09,00:32:10,"I think they called it timeline,"
00:32:10,00:32:12,"or they called it Tim for short,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,"because for the major cities,"
00:32:14,00:32:15,"if you're trying to get the time,"
00:32:15,00:32:20,"you dial 846, which T-I-M would be on that."
00:32:20,00:32:20,"Oh, so good."
00:32:20,00:32:23,"Although, ironically, even though the name was Tim,"
00:32:23,00:32:26,the first two clock speakers in Britain
00:32:26,00:32:28,for the last 50 years were females.
00:32:28,00:32:31,"Ethel, Jane Kane, and Miss Pat Simmons."
00:32:31,00:32:32,"But the first one,"
00:32:32,00:32:34,there was an incredible competition to select them.
00:32:34,00:32:37,"So there was a pool of 15,000 telephone operators"
00:32:37,00:32:39,who worked for the general post office.
00:32:39,00:32:41,And they organized a nationwide competition
00:32:41,00:32:43,to find the golden voice.
00:32:43,00:32:44,"And a bit like X Factor, or Britain's Got Talent,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,they got like the judges.
00:32:46,00:32:48,"We got the poet laureate, John Mayfield."
00:32:48,00:32:49,Yay!
00:32:49,00:32:51,"We got the actress, Dame Sybil Thorndike."
00:32:51,00:32:51,Yay!
00:32:51,00:32:54,"And we got the chief BBC announcer, Stuart Hibbert."
00:32:54,00:32:55,Yay!
00:32:55,00:32:58,For this week's edition of The Speaking Clock.
00:32:58,00:32:58,Yeah.
00:32:58,00:32:59,Who will win this week?
00:32:59,00:33:00,Awesome.
00:33:00,00:33:01,Proper competition.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"It was so eminent, the panel."
00:33:03,00:33:03,Yeah.
00:33:03,00:33:04,You're a poet laureate.
00:33:04,00:33:05,I know.
00:33:05,00:33:07,"And Sybil Thorndike, who's a famous name even today."
00:33:07,00:33:07,Who's that?
00:33:07,00:33:08,"I actually don't know, Sybil."
00:33:08,00:33:10,Just an incredibly famous actress from the time
00:33:10,00:33:13,"of, you know, a great heroine of stage, basically."
00:33:13,00:33:13,Right.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"Because I think she was a bit pre-screen, almost."
00:33:15,00:33:15,Yeah.
00:33:15,00:33:18,But then you've got the crap one on the end.
00:33:18,00:33:19,"Is there one of those in X Factor, the one who's like"
00:33:19,00:33:21,the expert but no one cares about them?
00:33:21,00:33:26,Someone called Mrs. Atkinson and Lord Eiley
00:33:26,00:33:30,rounded out the committee in 1936.
00:33:30,00:33:33,"But so they always have a kind of fancy panel of judges,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,which I love.
00:33:34,00:33:36,So I think we're only on the fifth voice
00:33:36,00:33:38,"of The Speaking Clock now, the official Speaking Clock."
00:33:39,00:33:40,They always have a fancy panel who choose.
00:33:40,00:33:43,And I think the panel these days always includes
00:33:43,00:33:45,"the previous Speaking Clock voice, if you see what I mean."
00:33:45,00:33:46,"Oh, yeah, that makes sense."
00:33:46,00:33:48,They sign up too.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"So it was a guy called Brian Cobby, who was on the committee"
00:33:51,00:33:53,in 2006 when they were picking the new voice.
00:33:53,00:33:56,But he had been the voice for the previous 20 years.
00:33:56,00:33:59,"So they had him, the current voice, Natasha Kaplinsky."
00:33:59,00:34:01,Newsreader.
00:34:01,00:34:01,Newsreader.
00:34:01,00:34:03,And strictly come dancing.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"Yeah, did she win the first, or was she in the first season?"
00:34:05,00:34:06,"She was in the first season, certainly."
00:34:06,00:34:10,"I don't know if she, this was pre or post her strictly triumph."
00:34:10,00:34:11,So she knows how to read stuff.
00:34:11,00:34:13,I guess she knows what a good voice sounds like.
00:34:13,00:34:13,I know.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"And the other voices, the other members of the panel included"
00:34:15,00:34:17,the guy who voiced the National Lottery.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"Oh, okay."
00:34:18,00:34:20,47.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"Yeah, exactly, reading numbers."
00:34:22,00:34:25,"Exactly, reading numbers is basically that's the gig."
00:34:25,00:34:25,My dream job.
00:34:25,00:34:29,Who can read numbers best?
00:34:29,00:34:30,You're going to get the Lottery guy.
00:34:30,00:34:31,And then a couple of others.
00:34:31,00:34:33,But it wasn't the Poet Laureate.
00:34:34,00:34:36,"You know, you mentioned Brian Cobby because I found"
00:34:36,00:34:39,"unsubstantiated claims that at one stage,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,he may have been the person that did
00:34:41,00:34:42,the voiceover to the Thunderbirds 5.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"I read that, yeah."
00:34:45,00:34:48,"But I think the Thunderbirds, the main creator says it wasn't him,"
00:34:48,00:34:50,but Brian Cobby claims it was him.
00:34:50,00:34:52,Interesting.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"Okay, controls it."
00:34:53,00:34:54,What's happened there?
00:34:54,00:34:59,"It's quite a strange thing to claim if it wasn't you, isn't it?"
00:34:59,00:35:01,"Well, you might think it like, you know,"
00:35:01,00:35:04,Brian Blessed claims that he was the voice of Tarzan's
00:35:04,00:35:07,"""oh, oh, oh"" when Johnny Weismiller couldn't do it anymore."
00:35:07,00:35:09,But is that true?
00:35:09,00:35:10,I don't know.
00:35:10,00:35:11,Is it a Brian thing?
00:35:11,00:35:13,Brian's just makeup random shit themselves.
00:35:13,00:35:17,When Cobby recorded his script.
00:35:17,00:35:18,So he started in 1985.
00:35:18,00:35:19,I really like this.
00:35:19,00:35:22,"So you don't have to do 24 hours, obviously."
00:35:22,00:35:25,"You just, there's a limited number of numbers"
00:35:25,00:35:27,that you have to record.
00:35:28,00:35:31,And that's something like 86 different prompts.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"But you have to record, you know, for about an hour, I think."
00:35:34,00:35:35,"Oh, okay."
00:35:35,00:35:37,But the script that Cobby recorded was about 33 pages
00:35:37,00:35:40,"with various different things on it, you know, that you have to."
00:35:40,00:35:43,"But amazingly, they spent a while in the recording studio."
00:35:43,00:35:44,They sent him home and then they had to summon him back
00:35:44,00:35:46,because they forgot to record the o'clock.
00:35:46,00:35:51,You only need that once.
00:35:51,00:35:51,"Oh, okay."
00:35:51,00:35:53,But it is important.
00:35:53,00:35:54,"It is important, yeah."
00:35:54,00:35:56,"You need it for the beats because when it's on the hour,"
00:35:56,00:36:00,"because usually it'll be, you know, it's one and 24 minutes."
00:36:00,00:36:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:01,00:36:04,Do they say precisely at that when it's like a round time?
00:36:04,00:36:05,"Yeah, exactly."
00:36:05,00:36:05,"They do, yeah, yeah."
00:36:05,00:36:07,Two o'clock precisely.
00:36:07,00:36:08,"Yes, precisely."
00:36:08,00:36:12,That's what everyone loved about the first reader was her precisely.
00:36:12,00:36:12,"Oh, really?"
00:36:12,00:36:15,"Yeah, that was the famous, yeah, the famous word."
00:36:15,00:36:17,"The most, her most famous word."
00:36:17,00:36:21,"Can I ask, did they like it because it sounded quite sexy?"
00:36:21,00:36:22,"Is that, is that what you were trying to?"
00:36:22,00:36:24,Get your brain out of the gutter.
00:36:24,00:36:27,"Just curious, like, you know, sometimes people with sexy accents,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,"you know, can make any word sound sexy."
00:36:29,00:36:32,"I'm sure there were people on Valentine's Day who did ring up,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,"you know, you know, I don't know, cock in hands."
00:36:34,00:36:40,I do like the use of the word sexy.
00:36:40,00:36:45,I do like the use of the word sexy for time because time is based on base 60.
00:36:45,00:36:48,"And sex, sex, sex, yeah."
00:36:48,00:36:50,"Sex adjustable is the, is the word."
00:36:50,00:36:51,That is very sexy.
00:36:51,00:36:52,You need a sexy voice.
00:36:52,00:36:53,Sexy time.
00:36:53,00:36:53,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"And that's the joke you were making, wasn't it?"
00:36:55,00:36:56,Exactly.
00:36:56,00:36:57,I knew that we had the mathematician in.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"I thought, I'm just going to leave that."
00:36:59,00:37:01,"She, Ethel Cain, she had a speech impediment,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,which they didn't notice when they were recording it.
00:37:03,00:37:05,She had a slight speech impediment.
00:37:05,00:37:07,She whistled a bit at the end of each word.
00:37:07,00:37:09,It's two o'clock.
00:37:09,00:37:13,And that's where the cuckoo clock comes from.
00:37:13,00:37:16,"Yeah, but they didn't notice in the recording."
00:37:16,00:37:17,So it must have been quite slight.
00:37:17,00:37:19,"And then they spent, they decided,"
00:37:19,00:37:22,because the clock ran on these beautiful glass discs.
00:37:22,00:37:23,I have read about it.
00:37:23,00:37:25,"I don't understand fully the mechanism they used,"
00:37:25,00:37:27,but they had to take the glass discs out of the machine
00:37:27,00:37:28,and edit them.
00:37:28,00:37:30,And it took about a year to fix this.
00:37:30,00:37:30,How to get through the water.
00:37:30,00:37:31,Very minor thing.
00:37:31,00:37:32,No way.
00:37:32,00:37:33,"Yeah, way."
00:37:33,00:37:34,She can say the word precisely.
00:37:34,00:37:36,Is that the word precisely?
00:37:36,00:37:37,"Precisely, yeah."
00:37:37,00:37:41,Down at the other end of the line.
00:37:41,00:37:45,"So in the 1970s, I think 1971,"
00:37:45,00:37:47,the UK experienced decimalization.
00:37:47,00:37:48,So we lost the imperial system.
00:37:48,00:37:52,"Not lost, we had imperial with the decimals as well."
00:37:53,00:37:54,But in 1975.
00:37:54,00:37:55,Much longer though.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:37:56,00:37:59,"Oh, I missed my ounces and my miles and..."
00:37:59,00:38:01,Farthings.
00:38:01,00:38:02,"Farthings, hogs, heads."
00:38:02,00:38:02,Kenny Farthings.
00:38:02,00:38:06,"So in 1975, in a Northern Ireland BBC programme"
00:38:06,00:38:09,"called Scene Around Six, they had a newscast."
00:38:09,00:38:10,"And it started off saying,"
00:38:10,00:38:13,"""It looks a lot more frightening than it actually is,"
00:38:13,00:38:14,but the government's preparing people
00:38:14,00:38:17,for the phased introduction of the decimalization of time.
00:38:17,00:38:21,You need to get dual standard timepieces.
00:38:21,00:38:22,"There'll be 100 seconds to a minute,"
00:38:22,00:38:25,"100 minutes to the hour, 20 hours per day."""
00:38:25,00:38:27,"But it was the first of April, 1970."
00:38:27,00:38:29,"Oh, so good."
00:38:29,00:38:30,"Meanies, those meanies at the BBC."
00:38:30,00:38:32,"They said, ""You'll take 10 years for this to come through,"
00:38:32,00:38:33,"so don't panic right now."""
00:38:33,00:38:34,Yes.
00:38:34,00:38:34,Wow.
00:38:34,00:38:35,"I mean, that's brilliant."
00:38:35,00:38:36,Do we know if people believed it?
00:38:36,00:38:40,"It was a BBC broadcast, the Scene Around Six,"
00:38:40,00:38:42,so people wouldn't...
00:38:42,00:38:43,I thought the French government
00:38:43,00:38:46,"actually did something similar with the calendar, didn't they?"
00:38:46,00:38:48,The French Revolutionary Calendar.
00:38:48,00:38:49,"They wanted to, yeah."
00:38:49,00:38:51,And I think they might have even tried...
00:38:51,00:38:52,But they did an April first.
00:38:52,00:38:53,"No, it wasn't an April first."
00:38:53,00:38:55,It was just do this or you get your head chopped off thing.
00:38:55,00:38:58,Napoleon loved a joke.
00:38:58,00:38:59,What if the French Revolution
00:38:59,00:39:01,was just an April Fool's that got badly out of hand?
00:39:01,00:39:03,"Guys, we were joking."
00:39:03,00:39:04,What if it was No King?
00:39:04,00:39:07,Say No King.
00:39:07,00:39:08,I said joking.
00:39:08,00:39:08,"Oh, God."
00:39:08,00:39:13,"The people who do the speaking clock just quickly on that,"
00:39:13,00:39:17,"sorry, back to my obsession, Brian Cobby, who I love."
00:39:17,00:39:19,"Bizarrely, two out of the five of them have been from Hove."
00:39:19,00:39:20,Okay.
00:39:20,00:39:21,I don't...
00:39:21,00:39:23,"I'm not suggesting any conspiracy or anything like that,"
00:39:23,00:39:24,but I just find that quite weird.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"They always have loads of finalists, by the way."
00:39:26,00:39:28,"The last time they did it, there were 15 finalists,"
00:39:28,00:39:30,which is so many for the judges to listen to.
00:39:30,00:39:32,"But when Brian Cobby got the job,"
00:39:32,00:39:34,"the runner-up was Lady from Lowestoft,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,and she got the consolation prize.
00:39:36,00:39:37,Can you guess what the consolation prize
00:39:37,00:39:38,for this specific job would be?
00:39:38,00:39:41,Doing the London Underground announcement.
00:39:41,00:39:43,"Not bad, very close."
00:39:43,00:39:43,That's good.
00:39:43,00:39:46,"Oh, doing like a Sainsbury's announcement,"
00:39:46,00:39:49,"you know, sort of aisle six needs."
00:39:49,00:39:50,That's very close.
00:39:50,00:39:51,"Okay, I'll tell you."
00:39:51,00:39:52,She got...
00:39:52,00:39:53,You will all have heard this.
00:39:53,00:39:55,"The runner-up became the voice of,"
00:39:55,00:39:58,"""The number you have called has not been recognised."""
00:39:58,00:39:58,No!
00:39:58,00:39:59,Yeah!
00:39:59,00:40:01,That is...
00:40:01,00:40:04,"Oh, my God, and the most terrifying words"
00:40:04,00:40:06,you can ever hear as a child.
00:40:06,00:40:07,Was she the person who did the...
00:40:07,00:40:08,When he did 1471 as well?
00:40:08,00:40:09,"Oh, I don't know."
00:40:09,00:40:10,Because I think...
00:40:10,00:40:13,You were called today at 1722.
00:40:13,00:40:14,"Oh, I think you might..."
00:40:14,00:40:15,It is a similar voice.
00:40:15,00:40:15,I think it might be.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"I think it might be,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,because I always found that the most terrifying thing was...
00:40:18,00:40:19,Really? I found it quite sexy.
00:40:19,00:40:20,What? Do I have to have found it?
00:40:20,00:40:22,"Gosh! Oh, God, damn!"
00:40:22,00:40:25,"So, do you have this in Australia?"
00:40:25,00:40:27,"When you did 1471, if someone called,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,"you're alone in the house, you're 12."
00:40:29,00:40:31,"And usually it would be,"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"""You were called today by this number."""
00:40:33,00:40:35,"And then, one in ten times it would go,"
00:40:35,00:40:37,"""You were called today at 1700 hours."
00:40:37,00:40:39,"The caller withheld their number."""
00:40:39,00:40:40,Do you have to...?
00:40:40,00:40:41,Do you have to...?
00:40:41,00:40:42,Why would they do such a terrifying...
00:40:42,00:40:44,Look in the cupboard on the third floor.
00:40:44,00:40:45,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:45,00:40:48,The ethical burglars would be fine.
00:40:49,00:40:54,"I was just generally looking into interesting clocks,"
00:40:54,00:40:55,not just speaking clocks.
00:40:55,00:40:56,Okay.
00:40:56,00:40:59,Can I give you a couple of interesting normal clocks?
00:40:59,00:41:02,Are they sexy clocks to go with this new facet
00:41:02,00:41:03,of your personality?
00:41:03,00:41:04,"I'll let you be the judge, yeah."
00:41:04,00:41:05,I'll let you be the judge.
00:41:05,00:41:09,"Now, I was reading that Windsor Castle,"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"so on the Queen's staff,"
00:41:11,00:41:16,is an actual clock man who goes around every single day
00:41:16,00:41:19,"checking out all of the clocks within the Windsor Estate,"
00:41:19,00:41:20,which is up to 400.
00:41:20,00:41:23,There's 250 clocks within the castle itself.
00:41:23,00:41:25,"If he looks at his, you know, pedometer,"
00:41:25,00:41:29,"he gets 16,000 steps in every single day."
00:41:29,00:41:31,"Yeah, and the clocks there are absolutely amazing."
00:41:31,00:41:34,"So there's your normal clocks,"
00:41:34,00:41:35,"but you've got historical clocks, right?"
00:41:35,00:41:38,So my favorite one is that there was a clock
00:41:38,00:41:41,"that was made by Charles Clay in 1740,"
00:41:41,00:41:44,and it plays melodies by the composer Handel.
00:41:44,00:41:47,And four of the songs that it plays
00:41:47,00:41:49,were composed specifically by Handel for this clock.
00:41:49,00:41:52,So they're original pieces.
00:41:52,00:41:53,"They worked in collaboration,"
00:41:53,00:41:54,and I think they made a few of these
00:41:54,00:41:56,that went out to different royal families
00:41:56,00:41:57,all through Europe.
00:41:57,00:41:59,And it's just an extraordinary thing
00:41:59,00:42:01,that has pipes underneath it and so on
00:42:01,00:42:03,that plays out the tunes.
00:42:03,00:42:05,And they have all sorts of clocks like this
00:42:05,00:42:08,that have historical relevance within the castle itself.
00:42:08,00:42:09,Yeah.
00:42:09,00:42:11,Can I tell you one more weird time?
00:42:11,00:42:12,It's actually not a time thing.
00:42:12,00:42:15,"It's just a weird, disappointed speaking voice thing,"
00:42:15,00:42:17,which is an innovation in Tokyo.
00:42:17,00:42:20,It's a toilet that has just been launched in Tokyo
00:42:20,00:42:22,where you don't need to touch anything.
00:42:22,00:42:24,How do you wipe your bum?
00:42:24,00:42:29,"Okay, you might need to do one thing."
00:42:29,00:42:30,You just stand and just water it.
00:42:30,00:42:33,Fully the pumps come.
00:42:33,00:42:35,Because there are lots of studies
00:42:35,00:42:36,"that show that when people use public toilets,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,they kind of avoid using their hands.
00:42:38,00:42:41,"They'll step on the lever,"
00:42:41,00:42:44,which is actually a reason why you would need to step on the lever
00:42:44,00:42:46,if the previous 50 people have all stepped on it.
00:42:46,00:42:47,"No, anyway."
00:42:47,00:42:50,"So you walk in and you just say, ""Hi, toilet."""
00:42:50,00:42:52,And it kind of responds.
00:42:52,00:42:55,"So if it gives you a menu of actions,"
00:42:55,00:42:56,you can flush the toilet.
00:42:56,00:42:57,"Hello, Andy."
00:42:57,00:42:59,Back again.
00:42:59,00:43:01,Sexy toilet.
00:43:01,00:43:07,I don't know what you could say.
00:43:07,00:43:10,"I don't know if you could say, ""Get my knob out."""
00:43:10,00:43:12,"I don't know how to do that, but it's..."
00:43:12,00:43:15,So how's it work?
00:43:15,00:43:18,"You say, ""Turn on the tap or flush the toilet."""
00:43:18,00:43:20,So that's the hands-free element of the system.
00:43:20,00:43:20,Okay.
00:43:20,00:43:22,I think it may even be able to raise and lower the seat.
00:43:22,00:43:23,I'm not sure.
00:43:23,00:43:24,"But you've still got to sit on the seat,"
00:43:24,00:43:25,"which is, I would argue,"
00:43:25,00:43:28,largely the biggest bit of touching that happens in the...
00:43:28,00:43:30,You can hover slightly above it.
00:43:30,00:43:31,Can you?
00:43:31,00:43:35,"I don't have the thym muscles to achieve that, I'm afraid."
00:43:35,00:43:38,You lay the lube all down on the seat.
00:43:38,00:43:39,I cover the whole thing.
00:43:39,00:43:40,But you can do well.
00:43:40,00:43:41,You can lay it and hover.
00:43:41,00:43:43,Feel like doubly pretend.
00:43:43,00:43:44,Double say.
00:43:44,00:43:46,"Well, I mean, we have those anyway."
00:43:46,00:43:48,We have toilets where...
00:43:48,00:43:49,Which is so irritating.
00:43:49,00:43:50,Voice-activated ones.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"No, no, but as in we have the non-touch version,"
00:43:52,00:43:54,"which I hate, which is the ones"
00:43:54,00:43:56,"where when you stand up, they flush off their own accord."
00:43:56,00:43:58,"So, you know, sometimes it'll just stand up to turn around"
00:43:58,00:43:59,"a bit to wipe your bum, whatever,"
00:43:59,00:44:01,"or to hang up your coat halfway through a wee,"
00:44:01,00:44:03,and then it flushes itself.
00:44:03,00:44:04,Mid-wee.
00:44:04,00:44:07,"Mid-wee, I'm just going to hold this in,"
00:44:07,00:44:08,"take my coat off, hang it up."
00:44:08,00:44:09,It's going to practice.
00:44:09,00:44:11,It's like clench those muscles.
00:44:11,00:44:13,Is this at home where you're hanging out?
00:44:13,00:44:16,Are you going out the toilet to the hangar in the hall?
00:44:16,00:44:25,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:44:25,00:44:27,and that is Anna.
00:44:27,00:44:30,My fact this week is that Spain's gold reserves
00:44:30,00:44:32,can only be accessed via drawbridge.
00:44:32,00:44:34,It's very cool.
00:44:34,00:44:36,"And they have a dragon as well, don't they?"
00:44:36,00:44:37,"Yeah, they do."
00:44:37,00:44:38,"The other end of the drawbridge, yeah."
00:44:38,00:44:39,"And a trumpeter, like, doodly-doodly."
00:44:39,00:44:44,"This is most of Spain's gold,"
00:44:44,00:44:46,"which is in a bank of Spain vault in Madrid,"
00:44:46,00:44:49,"and it's very well protected,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,"as a lot of gold reserves are,"
00:44:51,00:44:53,but it's such a cool setup.
00:44:53,00:44:54,"So, to get to the gold reserves,"
00:44:54,00:44:58,"you have to penetrate three massive steel doors,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,"and they waste, like, the first door weighs 16 tons,"
00:45:00,00:45:02,which is about eight hippos' worth.
00:45:02,00:45:05,"And also, they fit so well,"
00:45:05,00:45:07,"so when the door closes,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,"it fits so tightly that, according to the bank,"
00:45:09,00:45:12,"even if, like, a tiny bit of fluff got in there,"
00:45:12,00:45:14,it would sense it and would not be able to close.
00:45:14,00:45:16,"It would say, you know, you've got to get rid of that fluff."
00:45:16,00:45:18,"Anyway, once you've got through these doors,"
00:45:18,00:45:22,"then you go down a 35-meter elevator shaft underground,"
00:45:22,00:45:25,"and you're let out, I think you walk through a tunnel,"
00:45:25,00:45:26,and then you've got to cross a drawbridge.
00:45:26,00:45:29,"So, a drawbridge has to be let down over a moat."
00:45:29,00:45:31,"It's not a moat, it's just a ditch."
00:45:31,00:45:35,And I think it's about three or four meters drop.
00:45:35,00:45:36,"Yeah, OK."
00:45:36,00:45:38,"But I struggled to find, like, obviously, pictures"
00:45:38,00:45:40,"are quite limited with this kind of thing,"
00:45:40,00:45:41,they're quite signature about it.
00:45:41,00:45:44,"And once you've got through the retractable drawbridge,"
00:45:44,00:45:45,you've got the gold.
00:45:45,00:45:47,"No, there's another door, isn't there?"
00:45:47,00:45:49,"Oh, then there is another door, one of the last doors."
00:45:49,00:45:51,"Yeah, and there's two people standing outside,"
00:45:51,00:45:52,"telling you a riddle, and you have two."
00:45:52,00:45:55,"But I love the way they, because they have,"
00:45:55,00:45:56,"it's not just a ditch,"
00:45:56,00:45:59,they have a mechanism for filling that ditch with water.
00:45:59,00:46:02,"So, the entire vault is under,"
00:46:02,00:46:04,"obviously, under the city surface,"
00:46:04,00:46:06,"but it's under, there's a subterranean canal"
00:46:06,00:46:08,"which flows along beneath the city,"
00:46:08,00:46:10,and then the vault is beneath that.
00:46:10,00:46:12,"And so, if they need to flood it at any point,"
00:46:12,00:46:14,"they just divert a bit of the subterranean canal,"
00:46:14,00:46:18,"which will then slosh down into the drawbridge area,"
00:46:18,00:46:19,"and then completely flood that,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,so there's no way of getting in or out.
00:46:21,00:46:22,Unless you're a fish.
00:46:22,00:46:23,Unless you're a fish.
00:46:23,00:46:25,A trained fish.
00:46:25,00:46:26,A goldfish.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"Yeah, oh, wow."
00:46:27,00:46:28,Very nice.
00:46:28,00:46:29,Got to watch out for them.
00:46:29,00:46:32,Is it possible that this is just all made up?
00:46:32,00:46:34,"It's just in someone's back garden, isn't it?"
00:46:34,00:46:38,"Yeah, it's just a tiny, like a hotel safe,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,"you know, with just four punched numbers in."
00:46:40,00:46:43,"Have they just created a myth so that we think,"
00:46:43,00:46:44,"""Whoa, it's like Area 51."""
00:46:44,00:46:46,"Those are impossible, the hotel safe I find to get into."
00:46:46,00:46:49,I have a curious knack of like locking myself out
00:46:49,00:46:52,before I've put any of my stuff in the safe.
00:46:52,00:46:53,"I have to call someone at reception,"
00:46:53,00:46:54,and this is the whole thing.
00:46:54,00:46:55,"What do you, what kind of,"
00:46:55,00:46:57,do you put your stuff in the hotel safe?
00:46:57,00:46:59,Your paranoid Android?
00:46:59,00:47:00,"Yeah, of course I do."
00:47:00,00:47:00,Do you?
00:47:00,00:47:01,"Passport, money belt."
00:47:02,00:47:03,Travelers checks.
00:47:03,00:47:04,And pack.
00:47:04,00:47:05,Penny pack.
00:47:05,00:47:06,She's already talking about those locks.
00:47:06,00:47:08,"Can I just, as a mathematician,"
00:47:08,00:47:09,raise a bugbear about terminology.
00:47:09,00:47:12,"So you know these locks, bicycle locks?"
00:47:12,00:47:13,What do you call them?
00:47:13,00:47:14,A combination lock.
00:47:14,00:47:15,"Yeah, combination."
00:47:15,00:47:19,"So if, imagine the combination was one, nine, eight, four,"
00:47:19,00:47:20,like Orwell book.
00:47:20,00:47:21,My birth year.
00:47:21,00:47:22,"Oh, or yes, Orwell's book."
00:47:22,00:47:25,But a dystopian year in many ways.
00:47:25,00:47:28,"Imagine you put one, nine, four, eight."
00:47:28,00:47:29,Would it unlock it?
00:47:29,00:47:30,"Oh, Terry Pratchett's birth year."
00:47:30,00:47:31,Oh my God.
00:47:31,00:47:32,Why would it not unlock it?
00:47:32,00:47:33,I just like a maths lesson here.
00:47:33,00:47:34,Why would it not?
00:47:34,00:47:35,Because it's in the wrong order.
00:47:35,00:47:36,"Yeah, correct."
00:47:36,00:47:39,"Mathematically, one, nine, eight, four,"
00:47:39,00:47:41,"and one, nine, four, eight are the same combination,"
00:47:41,00:47:43,because combination is just
00:47:43,00:47:45,a set of numbers or letters in any order.
00:47:45,00:47:47,"The word, when they're in the precise order,"
00:47:47,00:47:50,"in the precise numbers, it's a permutation."
00:47:50,00:47:53,"So actually, you should be called a bloody permutation lock."
00:47:53,00:47:55,It's bugged me for years.
00:47:55,00:47:55,Wow.
00:47:55,00:47:57,"Well, I'm so glad you've had a chance to air it."
00:47:57,00:47:59,And now we'll all call them permutation locks.
00:48:00,00:48:05,"That is because James calls a single panini opinion no,"
00:48:05,00:48:08,and he is going to be absolutely thrilled to hear that it's
00:48:08,00:48:09,a permutation lock.
00:48:09,00:48:10,This is great.
00:48:10,00:48:12,"I really want to set James up in some way,"
00:48:12,00:48:14,"like expose him to a combination lock,"
00:48:14,00:48:15,get him to refer to it as a combination lock.
00:48:15,00:48:18,"OK, one of us next week picks a combination lock."
00:48:18,00:48:19,"That, yes."
00:48:19,00:48:20,"Ah, I don't see that one."
00:48:20,00:48:21,Take him down right at the top.
00:48:21,00:48:22,"Sorry, Polly."
00:48:22,00:48:22,Sorry.
00:48:22,00:48:24,That's so good.
00:48:24,00:48:25,That's great.
00:48:25,00:48:29,"This bank vault door, the armoured door,"
00:48:29,00:48:30,in the Madrid vault.
00:48:30,00:48:30,Yes.
00:48:30,00:48:31,"There's one extra thing about it,"
00:48:31,00:48:33,which is that it's constantly covered
00:48:33,00:48:35,with a thin layer of Vaseline.
00:48:35,00:48:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:35,00:48:38,Just in case you got a bit excited.
00:48:38,00:48:39,Just in case--
00:48:39,00:48:40,"Wait, is that a talking vault?"
00:48:40,00:48:43,Sexy talking vault.
00:48:43,00:48:46,Dan turns up with his robbery tools in one hand.
00:48:46,00:48:49,Did you get the gold?
00:48:49,00:48:50,"Actually, I got a bit distracted."
00:48:50,00:48:56,"But it stops it rusting because it's made of steel,"
00:48:56,00:48:58,but not stainless steel.
00:48:58,00:49:01,And so it constantly has to be very slightly protected
00:49:01,00:49:02,from rusting.
00:49:02,00:49:04,And someone's job is to apply Vaseline.
00:49:04,00:49:05,There must be.
00:49:05,00:49:07,Like basically a vault goblin.
00:49:07,00:49:09,A huge tub of Vaseline.
00:49:09,00:49:13,Every day.
00:49:13,00:49:15,Smooth as hands on earth.
00:49:15,00:49:17,Welcome.
00:49:17,00:49:20,"Remove the fluff, then apply the Vaseline."
00:49:20,00:49:21,Yes.
00:49:21,00:49:24,Fluff on the door.
00:49:24,00:49:25,Very bad.
00:49:25,00:49:31,I could find out why they're not stainless steel.
00:49:31,00:49:33,"It says everywhere they've got steel,"
00:49:33,00:49:34,but it's not stainless.
00:49:34,00:49:34,So you need Vaseline.
00:49:34,00:49:36,Did they just cock it up at first?
00:49:36,00:49:36,Maybe it's old.
00:49:36,00:49:39,It's an old door pre stainless steel process.
00:49:39,00:49:42,"I mean, lots of bank vault doors are very elderly"
00:49:42,00:49:43,"because, you know, you make them once."
00:49:43,00:49:44,Yeah.
00:49:44,00:49:44,Or--
00:49:44,00:49:45,I don't know.
00:49:45,00:49:48,Is it all bullshit with the draw bridges?
00:49:48,00:49:50,Fucking ditches.
00:49:50,00:49:51,"Yeah, yeah."
00:49:51,00:49:52,Didn't know this before.
00:49:53,00:49:56,Gold bars get ultrasound done on them.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Like pregnant women.
00:49:57,00:49:58,That's right.
00:49:58,00:49:58,Yeah.
00:49:58,00:50:00,They probe it.
00:50:00,00:50:03,And they measure the reflections from the bottom
00:50:03,00:50:04,or from within it.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"And that's because in the early 2000s,"
00:50:06,00:50:09,there was a panic that gold bars
00:50:09,00:50:12,might have been adulterated with tungsten.
00:50:12,00:50:14,Because tungsten has very similar density.
00:50:14,00:50:15,Really similar density.
00:50:15,00:50:16,"Oh, really?"
00:50:16,00:50:17,Yeah.
00:50:17,00:50:18,But sound travels at different speeds
00:50:18,00:50:21,between through tungsten or through gold.
00:50:21,00:50:24,So if you had gold bars which had been adulterated.
00:50:24,00:50:24,Right.
00:50:24,00:50:25,You'd know.
00:50:25,00:50:25,Yeah.
00:50:25,00:50:27,"So when you think of gold vaults,"
00:50:27,00:50:28,what was it?
00:50:28,00:50:28,Bank of England.
00:50:28,00:50:30,Any other famous places you can think of?
00:50:30,00:50:31,Fort Knox.
00:50:31,00:50:31,That's the one.
00:50:31,00:50:32,Fort Knox.
00:50:32,00:50:35,"So I think, yeah, Goldfinger 1964"
00:50:35,00:50:36,is probably what gave it its prominence.
00:50:36,00:50:40,People think it has up to half of the American gold reserves.
00:50:40,00:50:40,"Wait, sorry."
00:50:40,00:50:41,Was that the--
00:50:41,00:50:43,That was the bond plot line for that movie?
00:50:43,00:50:43,Yes.
00:50:43,00:50:43,Yes.
00:50:43,00:50:44,Fort Knox.
00:50:44,00:50:44,Right.
00:50:44,00:50:44,Yes.
00:50:44,00:50:45,Yeah.
00:50:45,00:50:46,So in--
00:50:46,00:50:48,"So it was a conspiracy theorist again,"
00:50:48,00:50:49,"like, oh, there's no Fort Knox."
00:50:49,00:50:50,There's nothing inside there.
00:50:50,00:50:51,There's just like Vaseline and Fluff.
00:50:51,00:50:56,But so presidents actually denied access to Fort Knox.
00:50:56,00:50:58,"Apart from one president, do you know which one?"
00:50:58,00:51:01,First half of the 20th century.
00:51:01,00:51:03,Often known by three initials.
00:51:03,00:51:04,OK.
00:51:04,00:51:05,FDR.
00:51:05,00:51:10,"LBJ. FDR, yeah, Franklin Delano Roosevelt."
00:51:10,00:51:14,"So in 1943, he's the only US president to have visited Fort Knox."
00:51:14,00:51:14,Really?
00:51:14,00:51:18,Because he was concerned that it wasn't secure enough
00:51:18,00:51:19,to be protected from foreign invasion
00:51:19,00:51:22,if the worst happened in World War II.
00:51:22,00:51:24,So he's the only president that we know has visited it.
00:51:24,00:51:27,Are they allowed to keep presidents out?
00:51:27,00:51:29,I thought the president could basically go where--
00:51:29,00:51:29,Yeah.
00:51:29,00:51:30,Wherever he liked.
00:51:30,00:51:31,They're not giving access to it.
00:51:31,00:51:32,"But yeah, he's like, wow."
00:51:32,00:51:34,"I think maybe if they, like, said back to Amateur--"
00:51:34,00:51:36,"I want to see Fort Knox, probably."
00:51:36,00:51:38,But he's the only one that we know.
00:51:38,00:51:39,That's amazing.
00:51:39,00:51:41,"But what's even more fascinating is in World War II,"
00:51:41,00:51:44,they were worried about bombs falling and washing in DC.
00:51:44,00:51:46,"So actually, they moved things like the originals"
00:51:46,00:51:48,"of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"
00:51:48,00:51:52,and the Declaration of Independence to Fort Knox.
00:51:52,00:51:54,But even like Winston Churchill got on the act.
00:51:54,00:51:57,So our Magna Carta was moved in 19--
00:51:57,00:52:00,so the International Magna Carta is like the UK version
00:52:00,00:52:01,"of the Bill of Rights, 1215."
00:52:01,00:52:03,They moved that to Fort Knox.
00:52:03,00:52:05,Did they?
00:52:05,00:52:07,"Because I know we moved our gold to Canada,"
00:52:07,00:52:07,which I hadn't realized.
00:52:07,00:52:10,But it seems like a huge undertaking in the Second World War.
00:52:10,00:52:11,"But it was sent to Canada,"
00:52:11,00:52:13,and so the Bank of England vault became a canteen
00:52:13,00:52:14,in the Second World War.
00:52:14,00:52:16,I've been to the Bank of England canteen.
00:52:16,00:52:16,Have you?
00:52:16,00:52:17,I do.
00:52:17,00:52:18,Cool.
00:52:18,00:52:18,Hang on.
00:52:18,00:52:19,So is that--
00:52:19,00:52:19,It's not still.
00:52:19,00:52:20,The vault hasn't--
00:52:20,00:52:21,the vault has been turned back into a vault.
00:52:21,00:52:23,Is that back into a vault now?
00:52:23,00:52:25,So have you been to the vault that Walter canteen has?
00:52:25,00:52:27,I've just been to the actual canteen.
00:52:27,00:52:29,Twice.
00:52:29,00:52:32,You've had a sandwich at your local branch in Lloyds.
00:52:33,00:52:35,"They're like, why have you brought all this Vaseline?"
00:52:35,00:52:36,What's going on?
00:52:36,00:52:40,The Bank of England vault key is three feet long.
00:52:40,00:52:42,"Yeah, that's pretty cool."
00:52:42,00:52:42,That is--
00:52:42,00:52:43,"It's gray, isn't it?"
00:52:43,00:52:43,Yeah.
00:52:43,00:52:44,It's a real old school.
00:52:44,00:52:46,That's wagon and moat style stuff.
00:52:46,00:52:47,But is it mainly like--
00:52:47,00:52:48,Is it like a--
00:52:48,00:52:48,It's mainly shaft.
00:52:48,00:52:50,Like a javelin stick with one thing at the end?
00:52:50,00:52:51,Or is it all the way down?
00:52:51,00:52:52,It's not.
00:52:52,00:52:53,It's not notched all the way along.
00:52:53,00:52:54,"Yeah, it's not notched all the way along."
00:52:54,00:52:55,That would be amazing.
00:52:55,00:52:56,"Yeah, that would be really good."
00:52:56,00:52:57,That's really funny.
00:52:57,00:52:57,Yeah.
00:52:57,00:52:59,"I think it's pretty remarkable, by the way,"
00:52:59,00:53:02,"that the Bank of England, which is in central London,"
00:53:02,00:53:05,"Bank Station is right next to it,"
00:53:05,00:53:06,if you get on the underground line.
00:53:06,00:53:10,"In fact, the actual tunnel itself has to take a bend."
00:53:10,00:53:12,"Next time you're on the underground,"
00:53:12,00:53:13,"you'll notice that there's a turn,"
00:53:13,00:53:16,and that's because they're going around the vault.
00:53:16,00:53:18,It's because they're literally going around the vault.
00:53:18,00:53:23,"And inside this vault is 400,000 bars of gold."
00:53:23,00:53:26,"So that's worth over 200 billion,"
00:53:26,00:53:28,just sitting something like a half-hour's walk
00:53:28,00:53:30,from where we are right now.
00:53:30,00:53:31,200 billion dollars.
00:53:31,00:53:32,"Why are you doing in half an hour, guys?"
00:53:32,00:53:36,I got some Vasili.
00:53:36,00:53:40,It is amazing.
00:53:40,00:53:41,Yeah.
00:53:41,00:53:42,And there are really strict rules
00:53:42,00:53:45,about how many layers of gold
00:53:45,00:53:47,you can keep in the Bank of England vaults.
00:53:47,00:53:49,And this is a big difference between London and New York.
00:53:49,00:53:51,So London is mostly on clay.
00:53:51,00:53:53,So you're not allowed on most levels
00:53:53,00:53:57,to stack the gold higher than four or six pallets.
00:53:57,00:54:00,"Because it will just start sinking into the ground,"
00:54:00,00:54:01,and that is a problem.
00:54:01,00:54:03,"So whereas New York is on granite,"
00:54:03,00:54:05,"and you can store gold as high as you like in there,"
00:54:05,00:54:06,it will not collapse.
00:54:06,00:54:07,Yeah.
00:54:07,00:54:10,"And I think north of the river in London,"
00:54:10,00:54:12,generally the surface is stronger.
00:54:12,00:54:14,"So if Bank of England were south of the river,"
00:54:14,00:54:15,it would sink even further.
00:54:15,00:54:16,"Yeah, you're so right,"
00:54:16,00:54:20,because that's why we could build the underground at a certain level.
00:54:20,00:54:22,Is that where there are no underground stops south of the river?
00:54:22,00:54:23,That's one of the reasons.
00:54:23,00:54:23,Really?
00:54:23,00:54:25,"Yeah, the ground's too soft."
00:54:25,00:54:26,Yeah.
00:54:26,00:54:29,"Just outside of gold, but still with vaults,"
00:54:29,00:54:31,I was looking into sort of precious items
00:54:31,00:54:33,that have been kept in the vaults of our world.
00:54:33,00:54:35,And it's stuff that is kind of seen
00:54:35,00:54:37,as the precious secrets of our world.
00:54:37,00:54:39,"So for example, the formula for Coca-Cola,"
00:54:39,00:54:42,supposedly kept in a bank vault.
00:54:42,00:54:43,Equals MC Square.
00:54:43,00:54:44,"Well, not Equals MC Square,"
00:54:44,00:54:50,but because Einstein's eyeballs are in a safe deposit box in New York.
00:54:50,00:54:51,"Do you remember after he died,"
00:54:51,00:54:53,there was a surgeon who took his brain away
00:54:53,00:54:54,and took his eyes and took it.
00:54:54,00:54:55,And so the eyeballs are still not been...
00:54:55,00:54:56,I thought it was just his brain.
00:54:56,00:54:58,"No, his eyeballs are sitting in a vault"
00:54:58,00:55:00,or a safe deposit in a bank vault.
00:55:00,00:55:01,They must be preserved.
00:55:01,00:55:03,"Like, they can't just be loose in a box."
00:55:03,00:55:05,"I think they're probably in from Aldehyde,"
00:55:05,00:55:08,"sitting in a little beaker, I imagine."
00:55:08,00:55:08,I didn't know.
00:55:08,00:55:10,Was that because they had to get the brain out the eye sockets?
00:55:10,00:55:11,Do you think?
00:55:11,00:55:11,I think...
00:55:11,00:55:12,They had to remove the doors first.
00:55:12,00:55:14,"I think once you're just collecting bits of them,"
00:55:14,00:55:15,"you might as well grab them while you're there, right?"
00:55:15,00:55:17,"It's, you know..."
00:55:17,00:55:18,That's so creepy.
00:55:18,00:55:19,"Yeah, it is creepy."
00:55:19,00:55:22,"Dr. Pepper, the formula for Dr. Pepper,"
00:55:22,00:55:23,that's sitting in a vault somewhere.
00:55:23,00:55:27,The secret ingredients of how you make WD-40
00:55:27,00:55:28,are sitting in a vault.
00:55:28,00:55:30,"And they were moved once,"
00:55:30,00:55:32,which was on the product's 50th birthday.
00:55:32,00:55:35,"The guy who took it was the CEO, Gary Ridge,"
00:55:35,00:55:37,who rode on a horse through Times Square
00:55:37,00:55:39,while wearing a suit of armour
00:55:39,00:55:42,and holding the secret ingredients to WD-40.
00:55:42,00:55:42,No.
00:55:42,00:55:44,"Before he reached the drawbridge, yeah."
00:55:44,00:55:47,He's here.
00:55:47,00:55:48,That's incredible.
00:55:48,00:55:50,But it wouldn't have been possible
00:55:50,00:55:51,"to rob him, actually, on that occasion,"
00:55:51,00:55:53,because he'd been so thoroughly lubricated.
00:55:53,00:55:55,In the armour.
00:55:55,00:55:56,The robbers would just slide off.
00:55:56,00:56:03,"Okay, that's it."
00:56:03,00:56:05,That is all of our facts.
