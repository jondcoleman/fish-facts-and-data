00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,840
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,080
 I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski and Miller and James Harkin,

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,720
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,040
 seven days and in a particular order, here we go. Starting this week with my fact,

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,880
 my fact is that the Olympics used to have a race just for old ladies.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,160
 Exclusively for old ladies called the old ladies race or old women racing.

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,320
 They didn't put much thought into the name, did they?

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,800
 It wasn't, yeah. The bronze seal approach.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 There was a fuller name actually where it said old ladies racing for a pound of tea.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 That's much better, I'd watch that one.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,960
 Well no, it turns out, you might as well be saying men doing the 100 meter sprint for a gold medal

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
 because the pound of tea was the prize. Because it wasn't like re-hound racing where it's on a

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,440
 screen, but they did get it right. They got the pound of tea, yeah. We should quickly say that this

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,160
 is not what we all perceive as the kind of the modern Olympics, the Olympics that are going on in

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,760
 Rio right now. What this is is a much older version of the Olympics that started in a place called

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,680
 Much Wendlock. This was back in the 1800s. This was way, way before the modern Olympics started

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,880
 again in Athens. One of the races was this. It wasn't that much before, was it? Was it not that

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,840
 the Kubitan who started the Modern Olympics visited much Wendlock and it kind of gave him a

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,720
 bit of the idea? Yes. He actually credited William Penny Brooks who was the guy who set up the

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
 Much Wendlock games as the originator of the Olympics. So even though everyone thinks of

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,600
 the Kubitan as being the guy who brought us a modern Olympics, he said, "No, it was this chap. Get on him."

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,200
 Yeah, and he also, they basically wanted to get him over at a time to actually see the

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
 Olympics and full flow in Much Wendlock, but they ran out of time. He couldn't get over. So they just

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
 had to put on a few events when he eventually visited just as an example of what it looks like.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,080
 Is that what the hastily improvised old ladies race for? The only people who weren't at work that day.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,320
 Yeah, exactly. I have to take issue with that race because you know how old the old ladies were.

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,440
 Go on. I mean, it's over 40s. Over 40s? Yeah. Anyone over 40 is an old lady. But you're not you're not

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,000
 thinking in terms of it's like dog years with athletes. So Michael Jordan retired from basketball

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,040
 for the first time at 30. Yeah. Technically, if you're in your 40s, you are a sports old person.

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
 According to the sports. According to sports. Yeah. By sports rules.

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,600
 And by 19th century rules, life expectancy shorter. Even so, it hurts as someone who's only a decade

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,080
 off being 40 to read old ladies referring to 40 rules. Yeah. Not that far off. It's not. I won't be

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,640
 knocking on the door. I'm only 25 of course. To the nearest 25, I'm still 25. You're halfway there then.

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,920
 But yeah, so the in 1856, the race that you're talking about, the winner, 45 year old winner,

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,960
 Mary Speak. And she defeated the person in second place, who was a 38 year old, called Anne Meredith.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,920
 Wait a minute. Hang on. She got a 40. How does she sneak in? Was it not even a 30 year old?

39
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,000
 It wasn't over 40s. It was just people who look a bit rough. She didn't even win.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,080
 Yes, came second. She got beat by a 45 year old. Yeah. Is embarrassing. Wow, 38. Yeah.

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,600
 So I found this fact in this month's issue of the 40 in times. And there's an amazing article by

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,160
 guy called Rob Gandy called faster, higher, stronger, weirder, all about the much-when-lock Olympics.

43
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,240
 That sounds like a great deaf punk song, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah, faster, stronger.

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,000
 So they were pretty weird. A lot of the contests at those Olympics weren't they? And it grew

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,640
 out of something which wasn't supposed to be specifically sport. So it was actually set up

46
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,760
 as more of an educational thing. And so in the 1950s, when the much-when-lock games were happening,

47
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,800
 a lot of the races or competitions were things like essay-writing or poetry or art.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,000
 Oh, I always thought it was bad at sport. No, yeah, you'd nail this one.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,520
 The other RT events that happened there, there was best Odes. You could enter the best Odes

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,200
 competition. Glee singing. That was one as well. A head of their time. Yeah. Glee singing.

51
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,280
 You just sing "Don't Stop Believing". That's exactly it. That was a "Don't Stop Believing"

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,480
 hadn't been invented yet. So they had to blow you an ode. Yeah. Yeah, really enthusiastic

53
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,960
 ode in a group. Knitting was another one. And then knitting stockings was another one.

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,400
 That's not fun to watch. That's a category. But you can knit as well. You'd be a double-gold

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,400
 better than a knitting victim. I would be kicking ass. Could you enter your knitted stockings

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,840
 into both of those compositions? The knitting and the stockings knitting. Or was it all knitting

57
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
 except stockings was allowed to enter knitting? I don't know if they were accepting finished

58
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
 knitwear. You know what, if they're allowing 38-year-olds in the over 40s race, I think they're not

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,000
 sticklers for the rules. Just because James has mentioned the word "stickle", so there was another

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,880
 kind of Olympic games that preceded these Olympic games and they were actually the Cotswold Olympics,

61
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,360
 which started either in 1622 or 1612, we aren't quite sure. But I was reading that the Cotswold

62
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,480
 Olympics, which had various weird sports like shin kicking. That's not that weird. I'm from Lancashire.

63
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,280
 We do that all the time. Prior traditions. Sorry. In barrels. Yeah, in barrels. How do you match

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,360
 each other's shins when you're in barrels? You're in the same barrel. Oh, you're in the same barrel.

65
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,760
 Tanner just brings his own barrel and sits in it alone. No one will kick me.

66
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,440
 But anyway, the umpire of these mainstream serious sports like shin kicking was called the stickler.

67
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,800
 And I think there's a theory that maybe he was called the stickler because he held a staff or it

68
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,560
 might just come from another old English word. But that's where we get stickler when we say he's

69
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,320
 a stickler for the rules. It comes from that umpire. They were quite balanced as well these

70
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,880
 contests. There was once a sword fight between Sir German pool and Mr Hutchinson and Mr Hutchinson

71
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,560
 lost three of his fingers before he'd even drawn his sword. And then he responded by slicing off

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,920
 pools nose and pocketing it so it couldn't be reattached. Wait, we've gone an hour to reattach it.

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,640
 That's in the guy's pocket. It's gone. That's as good as gone. But it's still going. It's this year.

74
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,640
 They just in July. They just did the 130th much one lock case. And it's still got interesting

75
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,000
 events. I look through the events that were uh done this year. Uh golf was one. So golf's just

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
 joining isn't it? The Olympics. It's just done in the Olympics. Yeah. Um gliding was one. Oh yeah.

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,280
 Gliding event. I reckon they're not going to have professional golfers. There are they.

78
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,080
 Down to it. So I wonder how good I'd have to get. Yes. And anyone can enter. James, you could

79
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,800
 genuinely enter the golfing tournament and win an Olympic medal. Yeah. Well. And if they're still

80
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,400
 I don't know knitting and poetry and odes. There's no going for the writing rather than the odes

81
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,800
 back and there go. You just need to speak the writing. That's all the odes. Yeah. I stick to

82
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,920
 shink in the right line. Yeah. Then you can go and bring your own barrel. No one will kick you.

83
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,040
 I'll bring my own barrel, but I'll just be a spectator. Right. Stopping.

84
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:25,040
 Oh ladies race. Oh. Given eight more years. I'm not risking second place.

85
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,520
 Should we move on shortly? Um, off when luck. Do you remember the really horrible London Olympic

86
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,720
 mascots when lots of managers are like a big eye on a TV remote. They were made by Hornby who

87
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,120
 make the train set and apparently wiped a third off their value because they did so badly. Really?

88
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,720
 Of the company. I think it was at one point because they sold so poorly that they had to issue

89
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,720
 profits warning and their stocks went way down. Wow. I've got some stuff on modern day old ladies running.

90
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:01,200
 Okay. Right. So the world record for the 100 metre dash for people over the age of 100

91
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,000
 or women over the age of 100 has just been beaten by a South Carolina middle school teacher called

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,440
 Ella Mae Colbert and she beat the record in 46.791 seconds or 100 metres. She came very far behind the

93
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,200
 other competitors that because she was older she's in a different category so she broke the record

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,320
 for her age group even though she didn't do it. Oh really? So she was there racing with everyone.

95
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:35,200
 20-something people who were doing it. It was Tyson Gay you saying balls at this lady.

96
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,680
 Yeah it was one week after celebrating her 100th birthday that she did that.

97
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,280
 So the there's a guy called Fooja Singh who I think is one of our greatest athletes in the UK.

98
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,520
 He holds the UK records for the 200 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, mile and 3,000 metres for the over

99
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:08,880
 100s and he set all of those records within a single 94 minute period. He's awesome. So they're UK

100
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,360
 records and he also once set five world records in his age group in a single day and some of the events

101
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,440
 that he got the world record for they didn't have a record holder because no one over the age of 100

102
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,280
 had ever even attempted them. Wow that's pretty good. That sort of puts your old lady to shame a bit

103
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:39,440
 doesn't it? Oh yes. Talk about my wife. Okay it is time for back number two and that is Anne.

104
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
 My fact is that there was a Victorian comic song that was called Tony Blair.

105
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,920
 So good. And it goes. I can't find it. Oh really? I don't know how it goes. If anyone listening knows

106
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,440
 the song or has a sheet music please do send it in. There could be an Olympic medal in that.

107
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,680
 Yes. We bring back Dan's Odes challenge. So I found this on the BBC's 10 Things We Learned This Week

108
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,800
 which is a great feature they do every seven days and it was by a guy called Jeremy Clay who's on

109
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,160
 Twitter at ludicrous scenes who writes a column for them called Victorian Strangeness. So he checked

110
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,040
 out online on the newspaper archive and this is a report from the Croydon advertiser and East

111
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,200
 Starry reporter October 1879 of a performance by a group called the Black Diamonds and it followed

112
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,520
 a performance of a song that was called BROWN which I like to think is Gordon Brown's version of R.E.S.P.E.C.T.

113
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:35,440
 and BROWN quote excited much laughter as of Mr. Harrison's rendering of Tony Blair.

114
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,720
 Wow. I would really like to see Gordon Brown dancing and singing R.E.S.P.E.C.T. but to BROWN do you think

115
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,280
 we could make that happen? There's a lack of letters in his name isn't there so he's not going to scan.

116
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,560
 He could do it to the song D.I.S.C.O couldn't he? Or you could spread the W into three syllables just

117
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,600
 kind of work. Yeah. R.OWN. Why is advisors weren't making him explore this option at the time of his

118
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,760
 tenure? There it is. So it's definitely real. Yeah it's so hard to hide anywhere. So it's very popular

119
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,440
 around the 1880s. In 1887 it was performing in North Devon to show that it was so densely crowded

120
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,600
 that large numbers of people were unable to obtain admittance. Really? Although that show also

121
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,400
 contained a procession of firefighters Hansen-Menderman Ilfrakum and their horse-drawn carriage. So I

122
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,600
 don't know which was drawing them in. I reckon the Hansen-Menderman Ilfrakum. That would get there.

123
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
 There was also a song called "When She Comes With The Milk in the Morning" also a highlight

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,960
 according to the local paper. And what's great about that report is that it's kind of a whole evening

125
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,120
 of revelry. And the paper record is some of the jokes from the evening. Would you like to hear

126
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,080
 some satire from 1887? Oh yeah. Why does Mr. Pit Lewis resemble a shrimp? I don't know. Why does

127
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,880
 Mr. Pit Lewis resemble a shrimp? Because each has MP at the end of his name. It's like Andy's in

128
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:04,080
 the room. And Andy's Edinburgh show is currently going on at the Pleasant's Theatre. Wow, that is,

129
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,840
 I mean, it's not funny, but it's... It is a joke. It's not satirical. It's not satirical.

130
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 What does Donald Trump have in common with a shrimp?

131
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,000
 Pink. Is it the unpeafing? It is. It's like Andy's still in the room.

132
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,560
 So in 1877, a ten-year-old David Cameron fell into the harbor in Dundee. He was rescued and taken

133
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,800
 home. Oh. A Miss Theresa May in 1940 was a shop manager who broke the blackout. Do you know

134
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,720
 there's a glamour model called Theresa May? Yeah, different spelling, right? Different spelling,

135
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,920
 yeah, no age. But if you go on to Twitter, her handle is real Theresa May. And according to one of

136
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,640
 her recent tweets, her website has had over six million hits since the MP Theresa May has become

137
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,040
 prime minister. Didn't her bio use to say, "I am a UK glamour model, not the home secretary"?

138
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,640
 Yes. I am not an MP. I have nothing in common with a shrimp. No M's and P's in my name.

139
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,040
 May I tell you about Mr. J Corbin?

140
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,320
 Ran Corbin's British baking powder, the cheapest and the best. Wow.

141
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,040
 Ran that in favour? Dairy journal 1892. James Harkin has opened a new wine and

142
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,160
 spirit bar in the Long Tower, liquors of the best quality or within stock. Sounds right? Classic.

143
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,040
 And you were killed in 1896. You were a gamekeeper going to be in a cook case against

144
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,720
 poaching. You witnessed your bombsaw. Wasn't that the year of the modern Olympics in Greece in 1896?

145
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,880
 Chazinski, headlined Chazinski for the Bristol Hippodrome. This was a great dancer who was coming

146
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,840
 from the Budapest Royal Opera House. That came in 1923. That was me. It contains a helpful

147
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,200
 pronunciation guide to Chazinski in the article. You can pass that on to Dan.

148
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,560
 It's just another kind of thing about names and people with similar names. If you go into Wikipedia

149
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,720
 and search for Neil Horan, you get the message. This article is about the Dancing Laiasized Roman

150
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,560
 Catholic Priest. For one direction member, see Nile Horan. Does it say that on Nile Horan's page?

151
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,400
 If you were looking for the Dancing Laiasized Roman Catholic Priest. Please look here.

152
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,560
 That made me think about disambiguation on Wikipedia. If you search for disambiguation,

153
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,320
 you get word sense disambiguation. For other uses, see disambiguation, disambiguation.

154
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,360
 Oh, that's fantastic. That's very good. I did disambiguation on Tony Blair, because I wanted to

155
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,360
 see other famous Tony Blair's out there. I found my favorite Tony Blair. It's a high title.

156
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,160
 I've ordered with great ideas. This is interesting because it's not a single person. It's a lot of people

157
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:52,640
 called Tony Blair. It's T-O-N-I-B-L-E-R, Tony Blair. It's a male name that's given out in Kosovo,

158
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,400
 and it's because it's in honor of the fact that during the 1999 NATO air campaigns, Tony Blair

159
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,640
 was seen as a massive hero. They've created a name now, which children now and now adults carry.

160
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,880
 I think Pristina has a big road called Bill Clinton Boulevard or something.

161
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,120
 I lived in Pristina for three months and everywhere you went, there was a picture of Bill Clinton.

162
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,720
 Interestingly, I then clicked on to Kosovo names for new male children names and no Bill Clinton

163
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,000
 names. Tony Blair got given a name, but Bill Clinton didn't know. There's Bill got the Boulevard,

164
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,640
 which is not Tony Blair. Can we go back to the songs? Yeah. C-R-O-W-N. So, B-R-O-W-N and Tony Blair were

165
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:44,880
 songs. I found a website called monologues.co.uk, which has an enormous list of Victorian and early

166
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,400
 20th century music haul songs, and they're just amazing, so can I read some out? Please do.

167
00:15:51,600 --> 00:16:04,320
 Don't stick it out like that! Open your mouth and shut your eyes. What about this one? I'm a member of

168
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:12,320
 the county council. That sounds like a great song, doesn't it? Yeah. It could be the precursor to Tony Blair

169
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:23,280
 MP. And they bumped him in my grower. We're going to need that last word. Dan, can you grab the notes?

170
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:32,160
 And they bumped him in my grower. Yeah. So, the words go, they bumped him in my grower and they made

171
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 the Gigi fly. Felt so gay, sang all the way to Peckham Rye. They picked me up in the strand,

172
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,720
 and I drove him ever so far. The night I took the prodigal son, home to his dear mama, and that's

173
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,040
 they bumped him in my grower. That's a beautiful song. So, there used to be, yeah, really raunchy. I think

174
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,080
 the idea of music calls was supposed to be partly that they would be a kind of entertainment for the

175
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,040
 working class, but the guy who sort of set them off and started them off, Charles Morton in the mid-19th

176
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,960
 century, said that women should be allowed to come because he thought it meant people behaving

177
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,440
 in a more respectable manner. What that actually meant was, men just invited loads of prostitutes,

178
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,560
 and they were these baudy, really, really rowdy places. And yeah, they'd have songbooks called

179
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,720
 things like the frisky vocalist and the gentleman's spicy songster, but they used to get really violent.

180
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,960
 So, I think in one performance there was evidence that a dead cat was thrown at the performers.

181
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,600
 There'd be bottles and old boots would be thrown at the singers. The industrial town's

182
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,760
 favourite hurling iron rivets, apparently. And so much so that waiters in music calls would have to

183
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,080
 have their bottles that they serve from chain to their trays so that people didn't grab the bottles

184
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,080
 and start fighting with them. And if there was an orchestra in the pit, sometimes it would be covered

185
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,960
 up with the steel grill so that the orchestra couldn't be attacked. Wow. Yeah, it's hardcore.

186
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,600
 Was this only if they didn't enjoy it, or did they just do it anyway? I think everyone's pissed

187
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,920
 there are prostitutes around. You just get rowdy. It's not necessarily a negative or a positive thing.

188
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,680
 Imagine just like, "I'll bring the dead cat just in case."

189
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,640
 It's always hard to be a great gig, you're like, "Oh, that's a shame."

190
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,560
 That's coming in with me. Back in the bag.

191
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:23,440
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is that people shouldn't skip.

192
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,320
 Yeah, my fact this week is that the first president of the UK's women's institute

193
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,200
 used a frying pan as a whip, wore an entire stuffed owl on her head and officially named

194
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,720
 the city of Cumber. It's a hell of a CV. Yeah, it's so impressive. So I didn't know anything about this

195
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,800
 woman, but she was Lady Gertrude Denman, and she was this eccentric English woman who just

196
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,600
 achieved an extraordinary amount in her life. So she started, she became president of the

197
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,040
 National Federation of Women's Institutes in 1917, and she held that post until 1946,

198
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,600
 and yeah, she was just this great force of a woman. So the reason that she named the city of

199
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,240
 Cumber was that she married the man who went on to become the governor of Australia. So they

200
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,280
 moved out to Australia, and it was decided that she would be the one who opened this little golden

201
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,600
 casket, which contained the name that had been chosen for the city. Oh, I see. So someone else came up

202
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,000
 with the idea, but she was one who chose it. So she was, yeah, she's the official name. So,

203
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,040
 did you know that Australia had a King O'Malley? So it was in 1911, there was a competition to design

204
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,920
 the new capital. They were going with the working title Federal Capital City, but then two years later,

205
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,840
 King decided to suggest people's implements, put forward names for it. They had 39 suggestions,

206
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,440
 which included Eden, Hopeton, Aurora, Home, Unison, Andyman, Flinders, and Frieza Roo.

207
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,560
 I also heard Kangamoo, is that right? Is that one of them? Yeah, they wanted to call it after

208
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,160
 that, some of their animals. So they also suggested Cookabara and Masupiala, although there were so

209
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,600
 many good suggestions actually for the name of Canberra. I think my favourites are things like Bunkham

210
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,160
 and Bungtown are there and gone broke. There was one suggestion was Climax. Could have been called Climax.

211
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,400
 But the one that comes up a lot is the name Sid Melad Per Briso, which is obviously a hyphenated

212
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,800
 combination of Sidney Melbourne, Adelaide Perth, Brisbane and Hobart. They thought they'd combine

213
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,520
 them all, that's such an interesting idea. I did. It sounds like an amazing character.

214
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,400
 According to one description of her I read, she was a compulsive lumberjack.

215
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,160
 Compulsive? Does that mean you literally can't walk past a tree without chopping it down?

216
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,000
 Yeah, when she was riding the horses and whipping them with the frying pan, they just say that she

217
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,040
 couldn't pass a tree without chopping it down, so she had the knacks on her at all times. It's a very

218
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,560
 interesting character. Her dad was called Wheatman, W-E-E-T-M-A-N. That's her first name, so let's get

219
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,600
 that going again. I'm going to name my first son that. Another one, second one, Tony Blair.

220
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,400
 Yes. And just some other good things Lady Denman did. When she came to Australia, she sort of created

221
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,240
 waves. Everyone thought she was really, really cool and she didn't act really up herself,

222
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,280
 like former kind of governors had. And she did things like, she played golf down the corridors

223
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,120
 of her house, so she would put cushions out and they would be the holes I think and then she'd play

224
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,840
 golf towards them. She let her brother explain how she did a lot of lumberjacking and a lot of shooting

225
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,480
 and she also played hockey in the ballroom and then she said in the letter, "This last amusement must

226
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,200
 on no account be mentioned." Yeah, she was a massive aristocrat though, wasn't she? Like she's

227
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,280
 born into a really, really wealthy family. Oh, she was born super privileged, yeah. So it's all

228
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,640
 right when you're like that and you can just wear it out while your head doesn't play hockey that

229
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,680
 straight. Working class people couldn't afford stuffed out. They couldn't even afford a barrelage.

230
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,720
 So a lot of the information that I'm talking about here about the WI and about Lady Denman comes

231
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,520
 from this great book called "A Force to Be Reckoned With" by Jane Robinson. Do you know that during

232
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,520
 World War One, but Netflix had women members out patrolling and after the war, they cancelled it,

233
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,000
 so the boys were back, given back their jobs and the WI did a 26 year campaign to get them back.

234
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,640
 Wow. They did. They just waited for the next one to start. It was during World War Two and they came back.

235
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,240
 But I mean, that's brilliant. I didn't know they didn't know why, that's terrible. And also good on the WI.

236
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,440
 Yeah, during the second World War meetings might include something called "Apin the Moustache

237
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,520
 on a Hitler Competition" or "The Passing Around of a Lemon" with a penny buying you a sniff.

238
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,840
 It was a different time. It wasn't a lot to do for some people.

239
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,480
 What a James's music was, I'll give you a sniff of my lemon.

240
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,240
 What I really like as well is they've got tons of branches and there's lots of different ways of doing it,

241
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,560
 so I completely am keen on this one. This is Gothic Valley, a WI branch in North London,

242
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,720
 and they are a Goth branch of the WI, but they welcome non-Goths. And according to the website,

243
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,600
 they like baking jam, making crafting and wearing lots of black. And then they also say,

244
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,240
 "Come and join us, help put the black in blackberry jam." I think they sound awesome.

245
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,120
 Yeah, that sounds great. Speaking of jam actually, the reason that I found this fact is that there was

246
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,600
 Police Commissioner recently who announced that the WI is the largest organized crime group in the UK,

247
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,040
 because it's actually illegal to pick wild berries and sell them for profit. And the WI not only does that,

248
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,680
 but encourages its members to do that, because they pick berries and then sell their jam at fates.

249
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,120
 Is that really illegal? Apparently it's illegal according to him, yeah.

250
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
 There was a real nice story how in World War I the home guards needed wood. And so they came

251
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,920
 around and they chopped the legs off to Piano, that was...

252
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,400
 They chopped the legs off every single member of a WI. One of these guys must have a wooden leg.

253
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,440
 The WI members retain their legs, but the home guard chopped the legs off one of their pianos,

254
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,080
 and then a future WI meetings in the area where that happened. The women still continue to sing

255
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,560
 Jerusalem, and the pianist just lay on the floor playing the piano.

256
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,920
 Another contemporary WI, WI, is the Seven Hills WI in Sheffield.

257
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,480
 Their average age of the member is 34, and their speakers have included the true manager for the Arctic Monkeys.

258
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960
 It's cool. There's something for everyone, they do all the things.

259
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,560
 As we walked in today Anna, you said I'm thinking of joining the WI now.

260
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,440
 I think, but I will. And they're the Arctic Monkeys.

261
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,520
 They were so influential, so they were really a big deal, especially in the early days.

262
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,560
 I really like, I was really a story about a guy, so they do do a lot of talks. They get people to come in

263
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,800
 and talk, and they got a man to come in who was a retired sailor from North Devon, and they wanted

264
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,720
 to talk to him about his experiences. So basically, he wrote a book about being kidnapped by pirates,

265
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
 and he thought I'll go and do a talk, so I'm doing talks, and they booked him.

266
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,440
 But this is what he said. When I arrived there, there were ladies with blue rinses wearing pirate

267
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,320
 hats and waving swords around. They'd been led to believe that it was a talk about piracy through

268
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,560
 the ages and not something right up to date. So basically, a man who'd been held for 47 days

269
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,200
 to tell about his traumatic experience. You can see a photo. He took a photo with them.

270
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,120
 They've got the sculling cross modes that kind of weird-captored grudge hats.

271
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,080
 That's because back in their day, that's how pirates look.

272
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,360
 Didn't they famously boo off Tony Blair or something?

273
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,080
 They slow-flat it. They watched it today. It's amazing. They didn't want any party politics,

274
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
 and it's a huge haul full of music. They thought it was a music haul song.

275
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:27,200
 We're trying to get the beat to kick it. Also, as per your 100-year-old runner,

276
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,560
 that could just be the speed at which older people跳.

277
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,200
 And if he had left the stage, he would have realised 20 minutes later,

278
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,920
 they were actually giving him a static ovation. It's just taken a while to get there.

279
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:47,520
 [Music]

280
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,240
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show, and that is James.

281
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,280
 Okay, my fact this week is that you can make yourself more attractive to members of the opposite sex

282
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,920
 by giving them a magnet. How powerful a magnet.

283
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 So, this is a controversial bit of science called social priming. Not everyone believes it's real,

284
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,720
 but there was a recent study at Texas A&M University, where participants were given a couple

285
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,360
 of attracting blocks to play with, and some others were given ones that weren't magnetic.

286
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,560
 Then they questioned them about their relationship, and they found the ones who had been given the

287
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,840
 magnets were more positive about their relationships, and found the people there with more attractive.

288
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,200
 Basically, social priming is the idea that you can mention things, and it will affect the way people

289
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,040
 behave. So, there's a very famous study where they gave people words to do with old age,

290
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,800
 and then as they left the building, they walked slower. Now, that study is very controversial,

291
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,400
 because people have tried to replicate it, and they've not been able to, but this whole idea of

292
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,800
 social priming is a thing that people are currently studying. So, the fact, this fact, your fact,

293
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,920
 is sort of about how the things we speak about metaphorically can actually affect how we feel.

294
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,000
 So, it's thought that the reason that you are more attracted to someone when they're holding a

295
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,560
 magnet is because we talk about magnetism, I'm magnetically attracted to him, and that metaphor

296
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,360
 that we've used has actually seems to have made its way into now how we instinctively respond.

297
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,800
 And there are other instances of this happening, so with the word "sweet," it was shown that,

298
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,720
 you know, we refer to people as being sweet people, and there was an experiment that was done where

299
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,880
 students were asked to write either about their experience of romantic love, or about an experience

300
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,480
 of being jealous, or just about a neutral experience, and then after that, they were given,

301
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,600
 in one experiment, they were given sweets, and then in another experiment, they were just given

302
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,680
 tap water, and in both cases, the students who've written about romantic love found the sweets,

303
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,400
 and the tap water tasted sweeter, because it's thought kind of, they'd written about something

304
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,920
 that they considered a sweet topic. You're in like a happy mood to start with.

305
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,320
 Yeah, it's so interesting. Do you have another one?

306
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,080
 Well, I just thought this was really weird, because the reverse seems to be true with sweet stuff

307
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,880
 as well. There was this study done in 2011, which showed that people who like sweet stuff

308
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,320
 are just sweeter people, as a nicer people. So, this was published in the Journal of Personality

309
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,600
 and Social Psychology, and it found that people who said that they preferred, they had a sweet

310
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,960
 tooth, were more likely to help someone out, so there was a professor who wanted to help with

311
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,560
 doing a study, they were more likely to help him out, they were more likely to help clear up

312
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,040
 sandbags after stopping a flood, and just they like sweet food, and there seemed to be this

313
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,480
 correlation, which obviously sounds very dubious. It was maybe anything I might get a sweet

314
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,640
 for this. Yeah. Yeah, like crunchy bar. Yeah, great theory.

315
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
 People give you pretentious biscuits when you help out at such a good point.

316
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It does sound dubious, slightly. So, I was reading also examples of where psychologically,

317
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
 they think that the opposite sex can make themselves more attractive. So, in this case,

318
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,160
 how a man can become more attractive to a woman, one suggestion that they've said, why don't you

319
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,440
 try this, is to wear a t-shirt, a white t-shirt with a big t printed on it, just the big letter t,

320
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,400
 and the reason that they say is that women who see this shirt with the t-on are 12% more

321
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,760
 attracted to this person. The women always want a pound of t, don't they? We've already

322
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,080
 established that within like t. So, what it is is that they say that the top bar of the t

323
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,040
 makes it so that it broadens the shoulders of the person, and then the bar going down,

324
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:30,400
 slims the body, creating a v-shaped body. So, that's my interesting fact. In order to get a v,

325
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,880
 you need to wear a t. How cool is that? That's good. Everyone used to say to me, by the way,

326
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,920
 that raises an interesting point, because I usually wear a tie. I'm always a love wearing ties,

327
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,120
 and people have said to me that I'm directly trying to draw attention to the crotch,

328
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,440
 that apparently, an arrow pointing downwards, as I've tried. I'd never heard that before.

329
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,640
 Well, it's just because you have written on your tie penis this way as an arrow.

330
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,320
 It's just really inappropriate for the workplace that we talked about this.

331
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,480
 So, the science of dating is interesting. I found one piece which concluded,

332
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,600
 the keys to dating someone hotter than you get to know them first, which is a really good tip.

333
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,280
 Oh, thanks, guys. And another one that said, "Sexually aroused by farts."

334
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,520
 You know, I'll love. The scientists are doing scientists to do some weird studies.

335
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,800
 So, there's a study done in 2010, which is kind of depressing, but it's interesting that it's still,

336
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:30,640
 this is still the case. And what it did was it put a man in a high status car, and then the same man

337
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,920
 in a low status car. So, there was a man in a silver Bentley Continental GT, which I believe

338
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,720
 is an expensive car. And then that man was also put in a red Ford Fiesta. And it found that when women

339
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,800
 are asked if the man is attractive, they're much more likely to think he's attractive if he's in the

340
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,280
 high status car. But in the reverse way round, when the woman is in the high status car compared to

341
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,840
 being in the normal car, then men do not find women any more attractive when they're in a high status

342
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,160
 car. Because traditionally, for thousands of years, women have been attracted to men who can provide

343
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,640
 for them. It's my Fred Flintstone. It was so popular with the ladies.

344
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,080
 Yeah, I read an article which said that 89% of UK men think that a flashy car helps them with women,

345
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,080
 but only 41% of women think that that's true. But that's, I guess, they're not testing it out in a

346
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,400
 blind way. Are they just asking you what you think? Yeah, so women, we don't think we're attracted to

347
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,000
 only rich men, but it turns out we're all extremely shallow. And that is the case.

348
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,120
 It's interesting. It's just, you know, men have been the providers traditionally, so it must be

349
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,440
 something that's so deeply engraved now for a lot of women that you want someone who you know can

350
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,280
 provide for you. Even though consciously, we definitely don't feel like that's what we want.

351
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,640
 I have one more thing, which is the good news is beer does make you more attractive. The bad news is

352
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,600
 it's to mosquitoes carry on real area. And that is my take up. Magnets can't be useless.

353
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,840
 We need to wrap up soon. We haven't done any magnet stuff. Has anyone got anything just

354
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,560
 magnesium? I was reading a report from the Royal Society of Medicine from 2005, which was called

355
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,800
 Painful Attraction, a magnetic penile injury. And it was describing, it sounded horrific, but I did

356
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,400
 find it quite amusing. It was describing an 11-year-old boy who derived an A&E with two magnets stuck

357
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,960
 on either side of his penis. And they couldn't get it off. So we'd actually been referred to this

358
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,840
 hospital from another hospital. It hadn't been able to get these two magnets off. And the report

359
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,000
 said that it was impossible to remove the magnets either by hand or by surgical clamps.

360
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,560
 I've read this paper, I think, actually. And I think that they just kind of did some sheer

361
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,600
 force, didn't they? So they pulled them sideways or something. They eventually did that. Yeah,

362
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,120
 but they did sound. I've just really not the idea that he was overhearing them discussing their

363
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,440
 next options. It said in the report, there are two other ways of dealing with this, usually,

364
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,520
 with two magnets that are stuck together. One is to heat the magnet above the curie point,

365
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,760
 which is the point at which they lose magnets. Isn't that like 7000 degrees or something? It's

366
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,880
 about 500 degrees Celsius for the average toy magnet. And the other one is to apply heavy hammering.

367
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:07,040
 That's extraordinary. What would you go for, Dan? Would you go for the 500-degree heat or the

368
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:14,240
 intense hammering? Or would you just think, actually, they don't look so bad? That's exactly

369
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,640
 why I said, "You know, I'm cool." Wait, would that make you more attractive to the opposite side?

370
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,520
 They'd be like, "Nah, magnetic." The strongest magnets in the world, I think, are in America's

371
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:32,240
 National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee. They're electro magnets, and this facility

372
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,800
 uses 7% of all the electricity used in the whole city of Tallahassee. Whoa, it's absolutely massive,

373
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,200
 and if you want to do any magnetic stuff pretty much anywhere in the world, this is where you go.

374
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,920
 I'm the big sign in the world saying, "Do not put on your penis."

375
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,960
 "Penis not this way."

376
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:58,240
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like to get
