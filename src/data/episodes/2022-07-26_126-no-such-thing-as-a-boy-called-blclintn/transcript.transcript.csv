00:00:10,00:00:15,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:15,00:00:19,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:19,00:00:24,"I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski and Miller and James Harkin,"
00:00:24,00:00:28,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last
00:00:28,00:00:35,"seven days and in a particular order, here we go. Starting this week with my fact,"
00:00:35,00:00:40,my fact is that the Olympics used to have a race just for old ladies.
00:00:40,00:00:46,Exclusively for old ladies called the old ladies race or old women racing.
00:00:46,00:00:48,"They didn't put much thought into the name, did they?"
00:00:48,00:00:50,"It wasn't, yeah. The bronze seal approach."
00:00:50,00:00:54,There was a fuller name actually where it said old ladies racing for a pound of tea.
00:00:55,00:00:57,"That's much better, I'd watch that one."
00:00:57,00:01:04,"Well no, it turns out, you might as well be saying men doing the 100 meter sprint for a gold medal"
00:01:04,00:01:08,because the pound of tea was the prize. Because it wasn't like re-hound racing where it's on a
00:01:08,00:01:13,"screen, but they did get it right. They got the pound of tea, yeah. We should quickly say that this"
00:01:13,00:01:18,"is not what we all perceive as the kind of the modern Olympics, the Olympics that are going on in"
00:01:18,00:01:23,Rio right now. What this is is a much older version of the Olympics that started in a place called
00:01:23,00:01:29,"Much Wendlock. This was back in the 1800s. This was way, way before the modern Olympics started"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"again in Athens. One of the races was this. It wasn't that much before, was it? Was it not that"
00:01:34,00:01:39,the Kubitan who started the Modern Olympics visited much Wendlock and it kind of gave him a
00:01:39,00:01:44,bit of the idea? Yes. He actually credited William Penny Brooks who was the guy who set up the
00:01:44,00:01:48,Much Wendlock games as the originator of the Olympics. So even though everyone thinks of
00:01:48,00:01:53,"the Kubitan as being the guy who brought us a modern Olympics, he said, ""No, it was this chap. Get on him."""
00:01:53,00:01:59,"Yeah, and he also, they basically wanted to get him over at a time to actually see the"
00:01:59,00:02:03,"Olympics and full flow in Much Wendlock, but they ran out of time. He couldn't get over. So they just"
00:02:03,00:02:08,had to put on a few events when he eventually visited just as an example of what it looks like.
00:02:08,00:02:14,Is that what the hastily improvised old ladies race for? The only people who weren't at work that day.
00:02:14,00:02:20,"Yeah, exactly. I have to take issue with that race because you know how old the old ladies were."
00:02:20,00:02:27,"Go on. I mean, it's over 40s. Over 40s? Yeah. Anyone over 40 is an old lady. But you're not you're not"
00:02:27,00:02:34,thinking in terms of it's like dog years with athletes. So Michael Jordan retired from basketball
00:02:34,00:02:39,"for the first time at 30. Yeah. Technically, if you're in your 40s, you are a sports old person."
00:02:39,00:02:42,According to the sports. According to sports. Yeah. By sports rules.
00:02:42,00:02:47,"And by 19th century rules, life expectancy shorter. Even so, it hurts as someone who's only a decade"
00:02:47,00:02:54,off being 40 to read old ladies referring to 40 rules. Yeah. Not that far off. It's not. I won't be
00:02:54,00:03:00,"knocking on the door. I'm only 25 of course. To the nearest 25, I'm still 25. You're halfway there then."
00:03:00,00:03:07,"But yeah, so the in 1856, the race that you're talking about, the winner, 45 year old winner,"
00:03:07,00:03:14,"Mary Speak. And she defeated the person in second place, who was a 38 year old, called Anne Meredith."
00:03:14,00:03:19,Wait a minute. Hang on. She got a 40. How does she sneak in? Was it not even a 30 year old?
00:03:19,00:03:26,It wasn't over 40s. It was just people who look a bit rough. She didn't even win.
00:03:26,00:03:32,"Yes, came second. She got beat by a 45 year old. Yeah. Is embarrassing. Wow, 38. Yeah."
00:03:32,00:03:37,So I found this fact in this month's issue of the 40 in times. And there's an amazing article by
00:03:37,00:03:42,"guy called Rob Gandy called faster, higher, stronger, weirder, all about the much-when-lock Olympics."
00:03:42,00:03:46,"That sounds like a great deaf punk song, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah, faster, stronger."
00:03:46,00:03:52,So they were pretty weird. A lot of the contests at those Olympics weren't they? And it grew
00:03:52,00:03:56,out of something which wasn't supposed to be specifically sport. So it was actually set up
00:03:56,00:04:01,"as more of an educational thing. And so in the 1950s, when the much-when-lock games were happening,"
00:04:01,00:04:08,a lot of the races or competitions were things like essay-writing or poetry or art.
00:04:08,00:04:12,"Oh, I always thought it was bad at sport. No, yeah, you'd nail this one."
00:04:12,00:04:19,"The other RT events that happened there, there was best Odes. You could enter the best Odes"
00:04:19,00:04:25,competition. Glee singing. That was one as well. A head of their time. Yeah. Glee singing.
00:04:25,00:04:29,"You just sing ""Don't Stop Believing"". That's exactly it. That was a ""Don't Stop Believing"""
00:04:29,00:04:34,"hadn't been invented yet. So they had to blow you an ode. Yeah. Yeah, really enthusiastic"
00:04:34,00:04:40,ode in a group. Knitting was another one. And then knitting stockings was another one.
00:04:40,00:04:46,That's not fun to watch. That's a category. But you can knit as well. You'd be a double-gold
00:04:46,00:04:52,better than a knitting victim. I would be kicking ass. Could you enter your knitted stockings
00:04:52,00:04:57,into both of those compositions? The knitting and the stockings knitting. Or was it all knitting
00:04:57,00:05:01,except stockings was allowed to enter knitting? I don't know if they were accepting finished
00:05:01,00:05:05,"knitwear. You know what, if they're allowing 38-year-olds in the over 40s race, I think they're not"
00:05:05,00:05:12,"sticklers for the rules. Just because James has mentioned the word ""stickle"", so there was another"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"kind of Olympic games that preceded these Olympic games and they were actually the Cotswold Olympics,"
00:05:16,00:05:23,"which started either in 1622 or 1612, we aren't quite sure. But I was reading that the Cotswold"
00:05:23,00:05:28,"Olympics, which had various weird sports like shin kicking. That's not that weird. I'm from Lancashire."
00:05:28,00:05:33,"We do that all the time. Prior traditions. Sorry. In barrels. Yeah, in barrels. How do you match"
00:05:33,00:05:37,"each other's shins when you're in barrels? You're in the same barrel. Oh, you're in the same barrel."
00:05:37,00:05:43,Tanner just brings his own barrel and sits in it alone. No one will kick me.
00:05:43,00:05:51,"But anyway, the umpire of these mainstream serious sports like shin kicking was called the stickler."
00:05:51,00:05:54,And I think there's a theory that maybe he was called the stickler because he held a staff or it
00:05:54,00:05:58,might just come from another old English word. But that's where we get stickler when we say he's
00:05:58,00:06:02,a stickler for the rules. It comes from that umpire. They were quite balanced as well these
00:06:02,00:06:08,contests. There was once a sword fight between Sir German pool and Mr Hutchinson and Mr Hutchinson
00:06:08,00:06:14,lost three of his fingers before he'd even drawn his sword. And then he responded by slicing off
00:06:14,00:06:21,"pools nose and pocketing it so it couldn't be reattached. Wait, we've gone an hour to reattach it."
00:06:21,00:06:26,That's in the guy's pocket. It's gone. That's as good as gone. But it's still going. It's this year.
00:06:26,00:06:32,They just in July. They just did the 130th much one lock case. And it's still got interesting
00:06:32,00:06:38,events. I look through the events that were uh done this year. Uh golf was one. So golf's just
00:06:38,00:06:43,joining isn't it? The Olympics. It's just done in the Olympics. Yeah. Um gliding was one. Oh yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:47,Gliding event. I reckon they're not going to have professional golfers. There are they.
00:06:47,00:06:52,"Down to it. So I wonder how good I'd have to get. Yes. And anyone can enter. James, you could"
00:06:52,00:06:56,genuinely enter the golfing tournament and win an Olympic medal. Yeah. Well. And if they're still
00:06:56,00:07:02,I don't know knitting and poetry and odes. There's no going for the writing rather than the odes
00:07:02,00:07:06,back and there go. You just need to speak the writing. That's all the odes. Yeah. I stick to
00:07:06,00:07:11,shink in the right line. Yeah. Then you can go and bring your own barrel. No one will kick you.
00:07:11,00:07:17,"I'll bring my own barrel, but I'll just be a spectator. Right. Stopping."
00:07:17,00:07:25,Oh ladies race. Oh. Given eight more years. I'm not risking second place.
00:07:25,00:07:31,"Should we move on shortly? Um, off when luck. Do you remember the really horrible London Olympic"
00:07:31,00:07:36,mascots when lots of managers are like a big eye on a TV remote. They were made by Hornby who
00:07:36,00:07:41,make the train set and apparently wiped a third off their value because they did so badly. Really?
00:07:41,00:07:46,Of the company. I think it was at one point because they sold so poorly that they had to issue
00:07:46,00:07:52,profits warning and their stocks went way down. Wow. I've got some stuff on modern day old ladies running.
00:07:52,00:08:01,Okay. Right. So the world record for the 100 metre dash for people over the age of 100
00:08:01,00:08:08,or women over the age of 100 has just been beaten by a South Carolina middle school teacher called
00:08:08,00:08:17,Ella Mae Colbert and she beat the record in 46.791 seconds or 100 metres. She came very far behind the
00:08:17,00:08:21,other competitors that because she was older she's in a different category so she broke the record
00:08:21,00:08:26,for her age group even though she didn't do it. Oh really? So she was there racing with everyone.
00:08:26,00:08:35,20-something people who were doing it. It was Tyson Gay you saying balls at this lady.
00:08:35,00:08:41,Yeah it was one week after celebrating her 100th birthday that she did that.
00:08:41,00:08:49,So the there's a guy called Fooja Singh who I think is one of our greatest athletes in the UK.
00:08:50,00:08:57,"He holds the UK records for the 200 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, mile and 3,000 metres for the over"
00:08:57,00:09:08,100s and he set all of those records within a single 94 minute period. He's awesome. So they're UK
00:09:08,00:09:15,records and he also once set five world records in his age group in a single day and some of the events
00:09:15,00:09:19,that he got the world record for they didn't have a record holder because no one over the age of 100
00:09:19,00:09:25,had ever even attempted them. Wow that's pretty good. That sort of puts your old lady to shame a bit
00:09:25,00:09:39,doesn't it? Oh yes. Talk about my wife. Okay it is time for back number two and that is Anne.
00:09:39,00:09:42,My fact is that there was a Victorian comic song that was called Tony Blair.
00:09:44,00:09:49,So good. And it goes. I can't find it. Oh really? I don't know how it goes. If anyone listening knows
00:09:49,00:09:53,the song or has a sheet music please do send it in. There could be an Olympic medal in that.
00:09:53,00:09:59,Yes. We bring back Dan's Odes challenge. So I found this on the BBC's 10 Things We Learned This Week
00:09:59,00:10:04,which is a great feature they do every seven days and it was by a guy called Jeremy Clay who's on
00:10:04,00:10:10,Twitter at ludicrous scenes who writes a column for them called Victorian Strangeness. So he checked
00:10:10,00:10:15,out online on the newspaper archive and this is a report from the Croydon advertiser and East
00:10:15,00:10:21,Starry reporter October 1879 of a performance by a group called the Black Diamonds and it followed
00:10:21,00:10:27,a performance of a song that was called BROWN which I like to think is Gordon Brown's version of R.E.S.P.E.C.T.
00:10:27,00:10:35,and BROWN quote excited much laughter as of Mr. Harrison's rendering of Tony Blair.
00:10:36,00:10:42,Wow. I would really like to see Gordon Brown dancing and singing R.E.S.P.E.C.T. but to BROWN do you think
00:10:42,00:10:47,we could make that happen? There's a lack of letters in his name isn't there so he's not going to scan.
00:10:47,00:10:54,He could do it to the song D.I.S.C.O couldn't he? Or you could spread the W into three syllables just
00:10:54,00:11:01,kind of work. Yeah. R.OWN. Why is advisors weren't making him explore this option at the time of his
00:11:02,00:11:07,tenure? There it is. So it's definitely real. Yeah it's so hard to hide anywhere. So it's very popular
00:11:07,00:11:13,around the 1880s. In 1887 it was performing in North Devon to show that it was so densely crowded
00:11:13,00:11:17,that large numbers of people were unable to obtain admittance. Really? Although that show also
00:11:17,00:11:22,contained a procession of firefighters Hansen-Menderman Ilfrakum and their horse-drawn carriage. So I
00:11:22,00:11:27,don't know which was drawing them in. I reckon the Hansen-Menderman Ilfrakum. That would get there.
00:11:27,00:11:32,"There was also a song called ""When She Comes With The Milk in the Morning"" also a highlight"
00:11:32,00:11:36,according to the local paper. And what's great about that report is that it's kind of a whole evening
00:11:36,00:11:41,of revelry. And the paper record is some of the jokes from the evening. Would you like to hear
00:11:41,00:11:48,some satire from 1887? Oh yeah. Why does Mr. Pit Lewis resemble a shrimp? I don't know. Why does
00:11:48,00:11:54,Mr. Pit Lewis resemble a shrimp? Because each has MP at the end of his name. It's like Andy's in
00:11:54,00:12:04,"the room. And Andy's Edinburgh show is currently going on at the Pleasant's Theatre. Wow, that is,"
00:12:04,00:12:09,"I mean, it's not funny, but it's... It is a joke. It's not satirical. It's not satirical."
00:12:09,00:12:13,What does Donald Trump have in common with a shrimp?
00:12:13,00:12:20,Pink. Is it the unpeafing? It is. It's like Andy's still in the room.
00:12:21,00:12:26,"So in 1877, a ten-year-old David Cameron fell into the harbor in Dundee. He was rescued and taken"
00:12:26,00:12:32,home. Oh. A Miss Theresa May in 1940 was a shop manager who broke the blackout. Do you know
00:12:32,00:12:36,"there's a glamour model called Theresa May? Yeah, different spelling, right? Different spelling,"
00:12:36,00:12:41,"yeah, no age. But if you go on to Twitter, her handle is real Theresa May. And according to one of"
00:12:41,00:12:48,"her recent tweets, her website has had over six million hits since the MP Theresa May has become"
00:12:48,00:12:53,"prime minister. Didn't her bio use to say, ""I am a UK glamour model, not the home secretary""?"
00:12:53,00:12:58,Yes. I am not an MP. I have nothing in common with a shrimp. No M's and P's in my name.
00:12:58,00:13:01,May I tell you about Mr. J Corbin?
00:13:01,00:13:06,"Ran Corbin's British baking powder, the cheapest and the best. Wow."
00:13:06,00:13:11,Ran that in favour? Dairy journal 1892. James Harkin has opened a new wine and
00:13:11,00:13:16,"spirit bar in the Long Tower, liquors of the best quality or within stock. Sounds right? Classic."
00:13:16,00:13:21,And you were killed in 1896. You were a gamekeeper going to be in a cook case against
00:13:21,00:13:26,poaching. You witnessed your bombsaw. Wasn't that the year of the modern Olympics in Greece in 1896?
00:13:26,00:13:32,"Chazinski, headlined Chazinski for the Bristol Hippodrome. This was a great dancer who was coming"
00:13:32,00:13:37,from the Budapest Royal Opera House. That came in 1923. That was me. It contains a helpful
00:13:37,00:13:41,pronunciation guide to Chazinski in the article. You can pass that on to Dan.
00:13:44,00:13:50,It's just another kind of thing about names and people with similar names. If you go into Wikipedia
00:13:50,00:13:56,"and search for Neil Horan, you get the message. This article is about the Dancing Laiasized Roman"
00:13:56,00:14:04,"Catholic Priest. For one direction member, see Nile Horan. Does it say that on Nile Horan's page?"
00:14:04,00:14:12,If you were looking for the Dancing Laiasized Roman Catholic Priest. Please look here.
00:14:12,00:14:18,"That made me think about disambiguation on Wikipedia. If you search for disambiguation,"
00:14:18,00:14:24,"you get word sense disambiguation. For other uses, see disambiguation, disambiguation."
00:14:24,00:14:31,"Oh, that's fantastic. That's very good. I did disambiguation on Tony Blair, because I wanted to"
00:14:31,00:14:37,see other famous Tony Blair's out there. I found my favorite Tony Blair. It's a high title.
00:14:37,00:14:44,I've ordered with great ideas. This is interesting because it's not a single person. It's a lot of people
00:14:44,00:14:52,"called Tony Blair. It's T-O-N-I-B-L-E-R, Tony Blair. It's a male name that's given out in Kosovo,"
00:14:52,00:14:58,"and it's because it's in honor of the fact that during the 1999 NATO air campaigns, Tony Blair"
00:14:58,00:15:04,"was seen as a massive hero. They've created a name now, which children now and now adults carry."
00:15:04,00:15:08,I think Pristina has a big road called Bill Clinton Boulevard or something.
00:15:08,00:15:15,"I lived in Pristina for three months and everywhere you went, there was a picture of Bill Clinton."
00:15:15,00:15:22,"Interestingly, I then clicked on to Kosovo names for new male children names and no Bill Clinton"
00:15:22,00:15:28,"names. Tony Blair got given a name, but Bill Clinton didn't know. There's Bill got the Boulevard,"
00:15:28,00:15:36,"which is not Tony Blair. Can we go back to the songs? Yeah. C-R-O-W-N. So, B-R-O-W-N and Tony Blair were"
00:15:36,00:15:44,"songs. I found a website called monologues.co.uk, which has an enormous list of Victorian and early"
00:15:44,00:15:50,"20th century music haul songs, and they're just amazing, so can I read some out? Please do."
00:15:51,00:16:04,Don't stick it out like that! Open your mouth and shut your eyes. What about this one? I'm a member of
00:16:04,00:16:12,"the county council. That sounds like a great song, doesn't it? Yeah. It could be the precursor to Tony Blair"
00:16:12,00:16:23,"MP. And they bumped him in my grower. We're going to need that last word. Dan, can you grab the notes?"
00:16:23,00:16:32,"And they bumped him in my grower. Yeah. So, the words go, they bumped him in my grower and they made"
00:16:32,00:16:38,"the Gigi fly. Felt so gay, sang all the way to Peckham Rye. They picked me up in the strand,"
00:16:38,00:16:44,"and I drove him ever so far. The night I took the prodigal son, home to his dear mama, and that's"
00:16:44,00:16:51,"they bumped him in my grower. That's a beautiful song. So, there used to be, yeah, really raunchy. I think"
00:16:51,00:16:56,the idea of music calls was supposed to be partly that they would be a kind of entertainment for the
00:16:56,00:17:01,"working class, but the guy who sort of set them off and started them off, Charles Morton in the mid-19th"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"century, said that women should be allowed to come because he thought it meant people behaving"
00:17:04,00:17:09,"in a more respectable manner. What that actually meant was, men just invited loads of prostitutes,"
00:17:09,00:17:14,"and they were these baudy, really, really rowdy places. And yeah, they'd have songbooks called"
00:17:14,00:17:20,"things like the frisky vocalist and the gentleman's spicy songster, but they used to get really violent."
00:17:20,00:17:26,"So, I think in one performance there was evidence that a dead cat was thrown at the performers."
00:17:26,00:17:33,There'd be bottles and old boots would be thrown at the singers. The industrial town's
00:17:33,00:17:39,"favourite hurling iron rivets, apparently. And so much so that waiters in music calls would have to"
00:17:39,00:17:44,have their bottles that they serve from chain to their trays so that people didn't grab the bottles
00:17:44,00:17:48,"and start fighting with them. And if there was an orchestra in the pit, sometimes it would be covered"
00:17:48,00:17:52,"up with the steel grill so that the orchestra couldn't be attacked. Wow. Yeah, it's hardcore."
00:17:52,00:17:57,"Was this only if they didn't enjoy it, or did they just do it anyway? I think everyone's pissed"
00:17:57,00:18:01,there are prostitutes around. You just get rowdy. It's not necessarily a negative or a positive thing.
00:18:01,00:18:05,"Imagine just like, ""I'll bring the dead cat just in case."""
00:18:05,00:18:10,"It's always hard to be a great gig, you're like, ""Oh, that's a shame."""
00:18:10,00:18:12,That's coming in with me. Back in the bag.
00:18:12,00:18:23,"Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is that people shouldn't skip."
00:18:23,00:18:30,"Yeah, my fact this week is that the first president of the UK's women's institute"
00:18:30,00:18:35,"used a frying pan as a whip, wore an entire stuffed owl on her head and officially named"
00:18:35,00:18:40,"the city of Cumber. It's a hell of a CV. Yeah, it's so impressive. So I didn't know anything about this"
00:18:40,00:18:46,"woman, but she was Lady Gertrude Denman, and she was this eccentric English woman who just"
00:18:46,00:18:51,"achieved an extraordinary amount in her life. So she started, she became president of the"
00:18:51,00:18:57,"National Federation of Women's Institutes in 1917, and she held that post until 1946,"
00:18:57,00:19:03,"and yeah, she was just this great force of a woman. So the reason that she named the city of"
00:19:03,00:19:08,Cumber was that she married the man who went on to become the governor of Australia. So they
00:19:08,00:19:13,"moved out to Australia, and it was decided that she would be the one who opened this little golden"
00:19:13,00:19:17,"casket, which contained the name that had been chosen for the city. Oh, I see. So someone else came up"
00:19:17,00:19:22,"with the idea, but she was one who chose it. So she was, yeah, she's the official name. So,"
00:19:22,00:19:27,"did you know that Australia had a King O'Malley? So it was in 1911, there was a competition to design"
00:19:27,00:19:31,"the new capital. They were going with the working title Federal Capital City, but then two years later,"
00:19:31,00:19:37,"King decided to suggest people's implements, put forward names for it. They had 39 suggestions,"
00:19:37,00:19:43,"which included Eden, Hopeton, Aurora, Home, Unison, Andyman, Flinders, and Frieza Roo."
00:19:43,00:19:48,"I also heard Kangamoo, is that right? Is that one of them? Yeah, they wanted to call it after"
00:19:48,00:19:54,"that, some of their animals. So they also suggested Cookabara and Masupiala, although there were so"
00:19:54,00:19:59,many good suggestions actually for the name of Canberra. I think my favourites are things like Bunkham
00:19:59,00:20:06,and Bungtown are there and gone broke. There was one suggestion was Climax. Could have been called Climax.
00:20:06,00:20:12,"But the one that comes up a lot is the name Sid Melad Per Briso, which is obviously a hyphenated"
00:20:12,00:20:16,"combination of Sidney Melbourne, Adelaide Perth, Brisbane and Hobart. They thought they'd combine"
00:20:16,00:20:21,"them all, that's such an interesting idea. I did. It sounds like an amazing character."
00:20:21,00:20:26,"According to one description of her I read, she was a compulsive lumberjack."
00:20:26,00:20:32,Compulsive? Does that mean you literally can't walk past a tree without chopping it down?
00:20:32,00:20:38,"Yeah, when she was riding the horses and whipping them with the frying pan, they just say that she"
00:20:38,00:20:43,"couldn't pass a tree without chopping it down, so she had the knacks on her at all times. It's a very"
00:20:43,00:20:50,"interesting character. Her dad was called Wheatman, W-E-E-T-M-A-N. That's her first name, so let's get"
00:20:50,00:20:55,"that going again. I'm going to name my first son that. Another one, second one, Tony Blair."
00:20:55,00:21:00,"Yes. And just some other good things Lady Denman did. When she came to Australia, she sort of created"
00:21:00,00:21:04,"waves. Everyone thought she was really, really cool and she didn't act really up herself,"
00:21:04,00:21:11,"like former kind of governors had. And she did things like, she played golf down the corridors"
00:21:11,00:21:15,"of her house, so she would put cushions out and they would be the holes I think and then she'd play"
00:21:15,00:21:21,golf towards them. She let her brother explain how she did a lot of lumberjacking and a lot of shooting
00:21:21,00:21:26,"and she also played hockey in the ballroom and then she said in the letter, ""This last amusement must"
00:21:26,00:21:31,"on no account be mentioned."" Yeah, she was a massive aristocrat though, wasn't she? Like she's"
00:21:31,00:21:35,"born into a really, really wealthy family. Oh, she was born super privileged, yeah. So it's all"
00:21:35,00:21:38,right when you're like that and you can just wear it out while your head doesn't play hockey that
00:21:38,00:21:43,straight. Working class people couldn't afford stuffed out. They couldn't even afford a barrelage.
00:21:43,00:21:50,So a lot of the information that I'm talking about here about the WI and about Lady Denman comes
00:21:50,00:21:55,"from this great book called ""A Force to Be Reckoned With"" by Jane Robinson. Do you know that during"
00:21:55,00:21:59,"World War One, but Netflix had women members out patrolling and after the war, they cancelled it,"
00:21:59,00:22:04,"so the boys were back, given back their jobs and the WI did a 26 year campaign to get them back."
00:22:04,00:22:10,Wow. They did. They just waited for the next one to start. It was during World War Two and they came back.
00:22:10,00:22:14,"But I mean, that's brilliant. I didn't know they didn't know why, that's terrible. And also good on the WI."
00:22:14,00:22:19,"Yeah, during the second World War meetings might include something called ""Apin the Moustache"
00:22:19,00:22:25,"on a Hitler Competition"" or ""The Passing Around of a Lemon"" with a penny buying you a sniff."
00:22:25,00:22:31,It was a different time. It wasn't a lot to do for some people.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"What a James's music was, I'll give you a sniff of my lemon."
00:22:34,00:22:40,"What I really like as well is they've got tons of branches and there's lots of different ways of doing it,"
00:22:40,00:22:44,"so I completely am keen on this one. This is Gothic Valley, a WI branch in North London,"
00:22:44,00:22:48,"and they are a Goth branch of the WI, but they welcome non-Goths. And according to the website,"
00:22:48,00:22:53,"they like baking jam, making crafting and wearing lots of black. And then they also say,"
00:22:53,00:22:58,"""Come and join us, help put the black in blackberry jam."" I think they sound awesome."
00:22:58,00:23:03,"Yeah, that sounds great. Speaking of jam actually, the reason that I found this fact is that there was"
00:23:03,00:23:09,"Police Commissioner recently who announced that the WI is the largest organized crime group in the UK,"
00:23:09,00:23:15,"because it's actually illegal to pick wild berries and sell them for profit. And the WI not only does that,"
00:23:15,00:23:19,"but encourages its members to do that, because they pick berries and then sell their jam at fates."
00:23:19,00:23:23,"Is that really illegal? Apparently it's illegal according to him, yeah."
00:23:23,00:23:27,There was a real nice story how in World War I the home guards needed wood. And so they came
00:23:27,00:23:29,"around and they chopped the legs off to Piano, that was..."
00:23:29,00:23:36,They chopped the legs off every single member of a WI. One of these guys must have a wooden leg.
00:23:36,00:23:43,"The WI members retain their legs, but the home guard chopped the legs off one of their pianos,"
00:23:43,00:23:48,and then a future WI meetings in the area where that happened. The women still continue to sing
00:23:48,00:23:50,"Jerusalem, and the pianist just lay on the floor playing the piano."
00:23:50,00:23:55,"Another contemporary WI, WI, is the Seven Hills WI in Sheffield."
00:23:55,00:24:00,"Their average age of the member is 34, and their speakers have included the true manager for the Arctic Monkeys."
00:24:00,00:24:04,"It's cool. There's something for everyone, they do all the things."
00:24:04,00:24:08,"As we walked in today Anna, you said I'm thinking of joining the WI now."
00:24:08,00:24:11,"I think, but I will. And they're the Arctic Monkeys."
00:24:11,00:24:15,"They were so influential, so they were really a big deal, especially in the early days."
00:24:15,00:24:20,"I really like, I was really a story about a guy, so they do do a lot of talks. They get people to come in"
00:24:20,00:24:26,"and talk, and they got a man to come in who was a retired sailor from North Devon, and they wanted"
00:24:26,00:24:32,"to talk to him about his experiences. So basically, he wrote a book about being kidnapped by pirates,"
00:24:32,00:24:36,"and he thought I'll go and do a talk, so I'm doing talks, and they booked him."
00:24:36,00:24:41,"But this is what he said. When I arrived there, there were ladies with blue rinses wearing pirate"
00:24:41,00:24:46,hats and waving swords around. They'd been led to believe that it was a talk about piracy through
00:24:46,00:24:52,"the ages and not something right up to date. So basically, a man who'd been held for 47 days"
00:24:52,00:24:57,to tell about his traumatic experience. You can see a photo. He took a photo with them.
00:24:57,00:25:01,They've got the sculling cross modes that kind of weird-captored grudge hats.
00:25:01,00:25:04,"That's because back in their day, that's how pirates look."
00:25:04,00:25:09,Didn't they famously boo off Tony Blair or something?
00:25:09,00:25:14,"They slow-flat it. They watched it today. It's amazing. They didn't want any party politics,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,and it's a huge haul full of music. They thought it was a music haul song.
00:25:16,00:25:27,"We're trying to get the beat to kick it. Also, as per your 100-year-old runner,"
00:25:27,00:25:30,that could just be the speed at which older people跳.
00:25:30,00:25:35,"And if he had left the stage, he would have realised 20 minutes later,"
00:25:35,00:25:39,they were actually giving him a static ovation. It's just taken a while to get there.
00:25:39,00:25:47,[Music]
00:25:47,00:25:52,"Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:25:52,00:25:57,"Okay, my fact this week is that you can make yourself more attractive to members of the opposite sex"
00:25:57,00:26:01,by giving them a magnet. How powerful a magnet.
00:26:04,00:26:10,"So, this is a controversial bit of science called social priming. Not everyone believes it's real,"
00:26:10,00:26:16,"but there was a recent study at Texas A&M University, where participants were given a couple"
00:26:16,00:26:21,"of attracting blocks to play with, and some others were given ones that weren't magnetic."
00:26:21,00:26:26,"Then they questioned them about their relationship, and they found the ones who had been given the"
00:26:26,00:26:31,"magnets were more positive about their relationships, and found the people there with more attractive."
00:26:32,00:26:39,"Basically, social priming is the idea that you can mention things, and it will affect the way people"
00:26:39,00:26:45,"behave. So, there's a very famous study where they gave people words to do with old age,"
00:26:45,00:26:50,"and then as they left the building, they walked slower. Now, that study is very controversial,"
00:26:50,00:26:54,"because people have tried to replicate it, and they've not been able to, but this whole idea of"
00:26:54,00:27:00,"social priming is a thing that people are currently studying. So, the fact, this fact, your fact,"
00:27:00,00:27:05,is sort of about how the things we speak about metaphorically can actually affect how we feel.
00:27:05,00:27:10,"So, it's thought that the reason that you are more attracted to someone when they're holding a"
00:27:10,00:27:14,"magnet is because we talk about magnetism, I'm magnetically attracted to him, and that metaphor"
00:27:14,00:27:19,that we've used has actually seems to have made its way into now how we instinctively respond.
00:27:19,00:27:24,"And there are other instances of this happening, so with the word ""sweet,"" it was shown that,"
00:27:24,00:27:30,"you know, we refer to people as being sweet people, and there was an experiment that was done where"
00:27:30,00:27:34,"students were asked to write either about their experience of romantic love, or about an experience"
00:27:34,00:27:38,"of being jealous, or just about a neutral experience, and then after that, they were given,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"in one experiment, they were given sweets, and then in another experiment, they were just given"
00:27:41,00:27:47,"tap water, and in both cases, the students who've written about romantic love found the sweets,"
00:27:47,00:27:52,"and the tap water tasted sweeter, because it's thought kind of, they'd written about something"
00:27:52,00:27:55,that they considered a sweet topic. You're in like a happy mood to start with.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"Yeah, it's so interesting. Do you have another one?"
00:27:58,00:28:02,"Well, I just thought this was really weird, because the reverse seems to be true with sweet stuff"
00:28:02,00:28:08,"as well. There was this study done in 2011, which showed that people who like sweet stuff"
00:28:08,00:28:14,"are just sweeter people, as a nicer people. So, this was published in the Journal of Personality"
00:28:14,00:28:19,"and Social Psychology, and it found that people who said that they preferred, they had a sweet"
00:28:19,00:28:22,"tooth, were more likely to help someone out, so there was a professor who wanted to help with"
00:28:22,00:28:26,"doing a study, they were more likely to help him out, they were more likely to help clear up"
00:28:26,00:28:31,"sandbags after stopping a flood, and just they like sweet food, and there seemed to be this"
00:28:31,00:28:34,"correlation, which obviously sounds very dubious. It was maybe anything I might get a sweet"
00:28:34,00:28:38,"for this. Yeah. Yeah, like crunchy bar. Yeah, great theory."
00:28:38,00:28:42,People give you pretentious biscuits when you help out at such a good point.
00:28:42,00:28:48,"It does sound dubious, slightly. So, I was reading also examples of where psychologically,"
00:28:48,00:28:51,"they think that the opposite sex can make themselves more attractive. So, in this case,"
00:28:51,00:28:56,"how a man can become more attractive to a woman, one suggestion that they've said, why don't you"
00:28:56,00:29:03,"try this, is to wear a t-shirt, a white t-shirt with a big t printed on it, just the big letter t,"
00:29:03,00:29:08,and the reason that they say is that women who see this shirt with the t-on are 12% more
00:29:08,00:29:11,"attracted to this person. The women always want a pound of t, don't they? We've already"
00:29:11,00:29:18,"established that within like t. So, what it is is that they say that the top bar of the t"
00:29:18,00:29:23,"makes it so that it broadens the shoulders of the person, and then the bar going down,"
00:29:23,00:29:30,"slims the body, creating a v-shaped body. So, that's my interesting fact. In order to get a v,"
00:29:30,00:29:34,"you need to wear a t. How cool is that? That's good. Everyone used to say to me, by the way,"
00:29:34,00:29:39,"that raises an interesting point, because I usually wear a tie. I'm always a love wearing ties,"
00:29:39,00:29:45,"and people have said to me that I'm directly trying to draw attention to the crotch,"
00:29:45,00:29:49,"that apparently, an arrow pointing downwards, as I've tried. I'd never heard that before."
00:29:49,00:29:52,"Well, it's just because you have written on your tie penis this way as an arrow."
00:29:52,00:29:56,It's just really inappropriate for the workplace that we talked about this.
00:29:56,00:30:02,"So, the science of dating is interesting. I found one piece which concluded,"
00:30:02,00:30:07,"the keys to dating someone hotter than you get to know them first, which is a really good tip."
00:30:07,00:30:13,"Oh, thanks, guys. And another one that said, ""Sexually aroused by farts."""
00:30:13,00:30:17,"You know, I'll love. The scientists are doing scientists to do some weird studies."
00:30:17,00:30:22,"So, there's a study done in 2010, which is kind of depressing, but it's interesting that it's still,"
00:30:22,00:30:30,"this is still the case. And what it did was it put a man in a high status car, and then the same man"
00:30:30,00:30:35,"in a low status car. So, there was a man in a silver Bentley Continental GT, which I believe"
00:30:35,00:30:40,is an expensive car. And then that man was also put in a red Ford Fiesta. And it found that when women
00:30:40,00:30:44,"are asked if the man is attractive, they're much more likely to think he's attractive if he's in the"
00:30:44,00:30:49,"high status car. But in the reverse way round, when the woman is in the high status car compared to"
00:30:49,00:30:53,"being in the normal car, then men do not find women any more attractive when they're in a high status"
00:30:53,00:30:58,"car. Because traditionally, for thousands of years, women have been attracted to men who can provide"
00:30:58,00:31:02,for them. It's my Fred Flintstone. It was so popular with the ladies.
00:31:03,00:31:10,"Yeah, I read an article which said that 89% of UK men think that a flashy car helps them with women,"
00:31:10,00:31:18,"but only 41% of women think that that's true. But that's, I guess, they're not testing it out in a"
00:31:18,00:31:22,"blind way. Are they just asking you what you think? Yeah, so women, we don't think we're attracted to"
00:31:22,00:31:26,"only rich men, but it turns out we're all extremely shallow. And that is the case."
00:31:26,00:31:31,"It's interesting. It's just, you know, men have been the providers traditionally, so it must be"
00:31:31,00:31:35,something that's so deeply engraved now for a lot of women that you want someone who you know can
00:31:35,00:31:39,"provide for you. Even though consciously, we definitely don't feel like that's what we want."
00:31:39,00:31:44,"I have one more thing, which is the good news is beer does make you more attractive. The bad news is"
00:31:44,00:31:49,it's to mosquitoes carry on real area. And that is my take up. Magnets can't be useless.
00:31:49,00:31:55,We need to wrap up soon. We haven't done any magnet stuff. Has anyone got anything just
00:31:55,00:32:00,"magnesium? I was reading a report from the Royal Society of Medicine from 2005, which was called"
00:32:00,00:32:06,"Painful Attraction, a magnetic penile injury. And it was describing, it sounded horrific, but I did"
00:32:06,00:32:12,find it quite amusing. It was describing an 11-year-old boy who derived an A&E with two magnets stuck
00:32:12,00:32:16,on either side of his penis. And they couldn't get it off. So we'd actually been referred to this
00:32:16,00:32:21,hospital from another hospital. It hadn't been able to get these two magnets off. And the report
00:32:21,00:32:26,said that it was impossible to remove the magnets either by hand or by surgical clamps.
00:32:26,00:32:32,"I've read this paper, I think, actually. And I think that they just kind of did some sheer"
00:32:32,00:32:35,"force, didn't they? So they pulled them sideways or something. They eventually did that. Yeah,"
00:32:35,00:32:39,but they did sound. I've just really not the idea that he was overhearing them discussing their
00:32:39,00:32:43,"next options. It said in the report, there are two other ways of dealing with this, usually,"
00:32:43,00:32:47,"with two magnets that are stuck together. One is to heat the magnet above the curie point,"
00:32:47,00:32:51,which is the point at which they lose magnets. Isn't that like 7000 degrees or something? It's
00:32:51,00:32:56,about 500 degrees Celsius for the average toy magnet. And the other one is to apply heavy hammering.
00:32:56,00:33:07,"That's extraordinary. What would you go for, Dan? Would you go for the 500-degree heat or the"
00:33:07,00:33:14,"intense hammering? Or would you just think, actually, they don't look so bad? That's exactly"
00:33:14,00:33:18,"why I said, ""You know, I'm cool."" Wait, would that make you more attractive to the opposite side?"
00:33:18,00:33:25,"They'd be like, ""Nah, magnetic."" The strongest magnets in the world, I think, are in America's"
