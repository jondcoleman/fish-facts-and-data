1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 (bells ringing)

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,800
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:22,480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish," a weekly podcast.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,280
 This week, coming to you live

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,400
 from Perth, Australia.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,400
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,240
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,920
 Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,400
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
 and in no particular order,

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,440
 here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,320
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that in the 1960s,

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,000
 Brazil and France almost went to war with each other

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,960
 over whether lobster's crawl or swim.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,120
 (audience laughing)

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,000
 - What a just war it would have been.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,720
 (audience laughing)

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,360
 - Who side are you on?

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,880
 - Who side are you on?

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,840
 - I think they crawl.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,080
 - I think they swim.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,920
 - Yeah.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,960
 - I will see you on the battlefield.

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,760
 (audience laughing)

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
 - Okay.

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,880
 - Are you seeing me do both, right?

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,720
 - Yeah.

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,600
 - The classic sweatsiland in the corner.

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
 (audience laughing)

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,520
 - No, so it is a problem that they do both,

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,200
 'cause this is the fact that in 1961,

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,560
 a French fisherman found the water of the coast of Brazil

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
 was full of lobsters, and they wanted to fish them,

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,440
 so they could get money from selling the lobsters,

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,280
 and so they side-fishing them,

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,760
 but Brazil claimed exclusive rights to sea creatures

41
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,400
 that were walking along the continental shelf

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,600
 within a certain, like, diameter radius of Brazil.

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,840
 So if creatures were walking in that area,

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,360
 then Brazil had a right to them and no one else did,

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
 but if they were swimming in that area,

46
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,000
 then they did not, and so this huge argument came forward

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,440
 about whether they were walking or swimming,

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,840
 and the French said that they were swimming,

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,320
 so they were open to anyone, 'cause lobsters do sometimes swim,

50
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,560
 and so they said, "We're allowed to fish for these lobsters."

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
 Brazilians said they crawled.

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,880
 There was actually, I think there was a moment

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,200
 where the Brazilian admiral of the Brazilian navy

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,400
 said that, "If you're saying that lobsters swim,

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,160
 "you're also saying that a kangaroo

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,720
 "would be considered a bird when it hops."

57
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,800
 (audience laughs)

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,440
 That is fighting talk.

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,960
 (audience laughs)

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,080
 But it really came to blows.

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
 So there was this huge debate,

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,000
 and eventually Brazil said, "France, can you please go away?"

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,760
 These things are crawling, and France refused,

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,800
 and had a destroyer ship accompany their lobster boats,

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,080
 a warship, and in response, Brazil mobilized its warships,

66
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,040
 including an aircraft carrier.

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
 (audience laughs)

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
 And then both of these sides are ready for battle,

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
 and this lasted for two years.

70
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,560
 They were sitting there with the battleships,

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
 poised, ready to fight each other

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,120
 over where the lobsters crawled or swim,

73
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,120
 and then eventually some laws of the sea were put into force,

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,760
 saying, "Look, guys, chill the fuck out."

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
 (audience laughs)

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
 - It was the official wording on the law.

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
 - It was, yeah.

78
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,600
 And, yeah, war didn't happen,

79
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
 and rights were granted to Brazil,

80
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
 'cause of a fishing act, and it was okay,

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
 but we were pretty close, guys.

82
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,080
 - Wow.

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,920
 - Yeah.

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,040
 - It seems to me that countries are always going

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760
 to war over fish.

86
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,640
 Other things living in the sea.

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,720
 So there's been a turbot war between Canada and Spain,

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,160
 a crab war between North and South Korea.

89
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,240
 There was an oyster war between Maryland and the state

90
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,960
 versus pirates.

91
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
 - Cool.

92
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,280
 - There was a macro war between UK and Iceland,

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
 a prom war between India and Sri Lanka,

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
 a squid war between the UK and Argentina,

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
 a scallop conflict between the UK and France.

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,160
 (audience laughs)

97
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,080
 - A catfish dispute between the US and Vietnam,

98
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,320
 and a sprat spat between Latvia and Russia.

99
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,000
 - Wow.

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 - That's amazing.

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,960
 - God, fish are real trouble makers, aren't they?

102
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
 (audience laughs)

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
 And so, on lobsters, which I believe this was about,

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,000
 so the Caribbean, so the thing that this was originally about,

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
 it was a Caribbean spiny lobster,

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,640
 which was a kind of rock lobster,

107
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,240
 but this is a kind of lobster that cues.

108
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,640
 So a very British brand of lobster,

109
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,440
 but when they migrate, they form orderly single-file cues.

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
 So they migrate seasonally because they want to get away

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,440
 from cold water.

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
 And these, you know, these are the most precious lobsters

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,560
 on that coastline.

114
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,440
 And yeah, they cling to each other and form an orderly cue

115
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,960
 and move single-file, each rest is antennae

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,960
 over the sort of arse of the lobster in front.

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
 - Oh.

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
 - And they move like a conga.

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,160
 - That's so exciting.

120
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
 - It's a lobster conga.

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
 - Yeah, I read that in North America,

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
 back when the European settlers first went there

123
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,760
 for the first time, there was so much lobster in the water

124
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,120
 that they would wash up onto the shore in piles two feet high.

125
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
 - Wow.

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,960
 - Like a tiny tsunami of lobster, tiny and delicious.

127
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,240
 I've got a fact about putting lobsters into the sea,

128
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,880
 which is a thing that sometimes people do.

129
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,400
 So this was in Britain in 2017.

130
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,200
 Two Buddhists were fined 15,000 pounds

131
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,920
 for releasing 700 live lobsters and crabs

132
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,560
 into the sea of Brighton.

133
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
 And they did it as a life-release ceremony,

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,640
 which is the thing you might want to do if you're a Buddhist.

135
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,320
 And unfortunately, they weren't native

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
 and they had the potential to destroy ecosystems.

137
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,920
 And the government had to try and catch them again.

138
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,720
 Only 323 were recovered.

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
 There are still about 400 out there.

140
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,480
 Yeah.

141
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000
 - This is a real problem though.

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
 This is happening in Australia as well,

143
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,960
 genuinely, and in America.

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,800
 So it is the Fangsheng ceremony.

145
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,960
 There's a Buddhist ceremony, which is about returning

146
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,680
 life to where it's meant to be.

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,120
 But it's always returning non-native creatures.

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
 (audience laughing)

149
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,800
 - Oh wow.

150
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,560
 - And they always wipe out local ecosystems.

151
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,360
 And yeah, so it's happens with lobsters

152
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
 in Australia and in China, America.

153
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
 - Do Buddhists have like the equivalent

154
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,360
 of a confession booth that they go into?

155
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
 (audience laughing)

156
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,280
 Forgive me, monk father, I don't know what it would be.

157
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,120
 - Lama.

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
 - Forgive me, Lama.

159
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,920
 I've seen, I tried to save a life, but I've destroyed

160
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 an entire ecosystem.

161
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
 (audience laughing)

162
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,000
 That's 12 reincarnations that you've been deducted.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,920
 (audience laughing)

164
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
 - That's how it works.

165
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
 - You know, Peter, the people for the ethical

166
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,120
 treatment of animals, we've discussed them a few times.

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,800
 And they kind of suggest that people might wanna do

168
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 this thing as well, which they call lobster liberation.

169
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,920
 And they have posters, they put posters up saying,

170
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,240
 "Been boiled hurts, lobster liberation."

171
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,200
 But unfortunately, the lobster in their picture

172
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,240
 is bright red, which means it's already been cooked.

173
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
 - Oh no.

174
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,480
 (audience laughing)

175
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,360
 - Lobsters do have a very, very tough time.

176
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,120
 So whenever they malt, they have to,

177
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,280
 obviously they have to get rid of their old shell

178
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,360
 to grow larger.

179
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,000
 But they have to lose half their claw weight,

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,720
 'cause otherwise the claw is too big

181
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,080
 to fit out of the old shell.

182
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,960
 And the claw muscles are so massive,

183
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,080
 'cause obviously that's what lobsters are like.

184
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
 They have to rip, they've got very slim wrists.

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,440
 So they have to rip the claw.

186
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,640
 Basically, when they try to malt,

187
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,720
 they have to rip out the lining of their throat,

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
 their stomach, and their anus.

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,080
 Which is, I think that's the trifexer

190
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,320
 of things you don't wanna rip out.

191
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,160
 - Yes.

192
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
 (audience laughing)

193
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,760
 - What is the least classy use of the word trifector?

194
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,800
 (audience laughing)

195
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
 - Yeah.

196
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,480
 - But they are, they're weird, aren't they?

197
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,800
 I was reading on national geographic.

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,400
 So, okay, their brain is located in their throat,

199
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,120
 their nervous system, in their abdomen,

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
 their teeth, in their stomach,

201
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
 their kidneys, in their head.

202
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,960
 They hear through their legs,

203
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,520
 and they taste with their feet.

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,040
 They're all over the shop.

205
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,880
 (audience laughing)

206
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,560
 - So the bladder being very much in the head

207
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,000
 means that they urinate out of their faces.

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,880
 And urinating is very important to lobsters,

209
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,560
 and especially female lobsters, 'cause it's quite sexy.

210
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,840
 So, the way that female lobsters

211
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,120
 seduce male lobsters is that they urinate out of their face

212
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,840
 into the male lobsters den.

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,920
 - That is sexy.

214
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
 (audience laughing)

215
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,680
 - Oh, you wouldn't want, imagine your letterbox

216
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,520
 in the morning.

217
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 (audience laughing)

218
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
 Oh, no, it's Valentine's Day.

219
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,040
 (audience laughing)

220
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,720
 - Well, it's very attractive in some circles.

221
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,400
 But yeah, the females urinate in the male dens

222
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,640
 until the male is attracted enough for the urine.

223
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,080
 All things are really to get rid of this urine somehow.

224
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
 So, he invites the female in.

225
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,000
 And then, immediately, she gets naked.

226
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,960
 So, as soon as she's been invited in,

227
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,400
 she sheds all of her shell.

228
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,120
 And also, I think this is really insulting.

229
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
 The other thing that the female sheds

230
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,680
 once she gets into a lobsters den

231
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,400
 is the pouch where she had banked the sperm

232
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,840
 from the prior mate.

233
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,200
 (audience laughing)

234
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,840
 - I'll just leave this by the door.

235
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,640
 (audience laughing)

236
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,960
 - Can she put back her shell on?

237
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,480
 - If he's not interested?

238
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,640
 - No. - No.

239
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
 (audience laughing)

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,920
 - Well, you can't rip out the lining

241
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,240
 of your throat, stomach and anus.

242
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,640
 And then say, I miss those.

243
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,920
 (audience laughing)

244
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,200
 I've misread those sides.

245
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 I'll just get my pouches for them, maybe on my way.

246
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,320
 - Hey, we need to move on to our next fact, surely.

247
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
 - Oh, I think we should honestly give a shout out

248
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,440
 to the amazing lobsters, which are

249
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,720
 the largest freshwater invertebrates on earth,

250
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,880
 which is the Tasmanian lobster.

251
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,280
 And yeah, they're incredible.

252
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,680
 So, they're the size of kind of a normal sized dog.

253
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,520
 And they're extremely strong.

254
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,240
 - And a dog's coming lots of different sizes.

255
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,280
 (audience laughing)

256
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,880
 - That's one of the main things about dogs.

257
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,400
 - They're like a coca-spaniel.

258
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,120
 - Wow. - Wow.

259
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
 - They are extremely big.

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
 They live to be 60 years old, at least.

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,920
 And they can break human bones, so with their claws,

262
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
 or they can crush beer bottles.

263
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,280
 And they're just incredible.

264
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,800
 And they can't breed until they're 14 years old.

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,280
 - Come on. - What?

266
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,920
 - Which we laugh at, but we're humans.

267
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
 That's literally the same as humans.

268
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,440
 But.

269
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
 (audience laughing)

270
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,960
 - Breed.

271
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,840
 - Yeah. - I had breathed.

272
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,760
 (audience laughing)

273
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
 - I thought that when the lobster gets to 14,

274
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
 it goes, "Goo."

275
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
 - Oh.

276
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
 (audience laughing)

277
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,120
 - That's better.

278
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,840
 - Fitting me, it does make that noise,

279
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,600
 but it's a complete of a reason.

280
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 (audience laughing)

281
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
 (upbeat music)

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,720
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

283
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
 And that is James.

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1350,

285
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,520
 there was a man called Williams Stand Up Right.

286
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,520
 (audience laughing)

287
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,920
 And he annoyed everyone else in his village

288
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,640
 so much that every single one of them moved away.

289
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,480
 - Wow.

290
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
 (audience laughing)

291
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
 - It really sounds awesome.

292
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,000
 - Do we know anything about what he did?

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,600
 - Well, so the thing is, this comes from the parish rolls

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
 in England, so it's where, if you're a historian,

295
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,880
 it's a really good place to get all the really small things

296
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,520
 that happen in the villages.

297
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,960
 And in this one, in particular, it says,

298
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,680
 "The coroner testifies that Williams Stand Up Right

299
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,360
 "is so quarrelsome and rancorous

300
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,720
 "that none of the Lord's tenants

301
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,400
 "can bear to live in the village because of him,

302
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,840
 "and he has caused the village to be deserted."

303
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
 (audience laughing)

304
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,800
 And then by 1356, so that's six years later,

305
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,480
 he had also left the village.

306
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,080
 (audience laughing)

307
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,240
 Presumably because he had no one left to argue with.

308
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
 (audience laughing)

309
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,800
 - That's amazing.

310
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,080
 And that's all we know about him.

311
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,680
 Like, a lot of these things, these kind of parish things,

312
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,360
 all you see is a very, very tiny snapshot of people's lives.

313
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
 It's amazing. - Right.

314
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,120
 - So, for instance, in 1328,

315
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 John Francy claimed two shillings in damages

316
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,840
 because Alice Devaney's had accused his wife

317
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,080
 of wearing her short jacket before Easter.

318
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
 (audience laughing)

319
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
 - Whoa.

320
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,720
 - Shot to my mouth.

321
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,600
 (audience laughing)

322
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,400
 In 1347, a man called Roger Sweatin' Bed

323
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
 (audience laughing)

324
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,160
 was accused of fornication with Latisha Bat.

325
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,320
 (audience laughing)

326
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,160
 - Wow.

327
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,000
 - Roger Sweatin' Bed.

328
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,920
 - Sweatin' Bed, stand at right and shot in mouth.

329
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,760
 Was that the third one?

330
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,920
 - No.

331
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,560
 - This is no, it's so fun reading through these old records.

332
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,160
 So there's actually a document called

333
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,120
 the Assize of Nucenses.

334
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
 And I really recommend it.

335
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
 It's what I wasted all of my research time doing

336
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,280
 for this show, but it's from 700 years ago.

337
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,960
 And it's literally a list by,

338
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,680
 from the whole of the UK of all the nuciances

339
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,000
 that are reported by neighbors.

340
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
 And so I read through it.

341
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,640
 And most of them, to be fair,

342
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,400
 are about sewage leaking into other people's gardens.

343
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
 So there were a lot of people.

344
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,640
 - Maybe they were just flirting

345
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,000
 with the next old neighbor in a kind of lobster way.

346
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
 (audience laughing)

347
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,520
 - It didn't sound super sexy in the right up.

348
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,920
 So there was a woman who built her own personal toilet

349
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,960
 'cause she didn't like throwing her sewage out of the window,

350
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,800
 which a lot of people did.

351
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,880
 But the solids blocked her gutter

352
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,000
 and the neighbors that they were greatly inconvenienced

353
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,480
 by the stench.

354
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,440
 So that was then, and there was one more, just in 1377.

355
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,320
 Thomas and Alice Young complained,

356
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,920
 the neighbor built a forge and they were making armor,

357
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,200
 but the sledgehammer crashing

358
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,560
 of them making the armor disturbed them.

359
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
 But worse than that,

360
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,720
 the smoke penetrated their house, so it smelled really bad.

361
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 And also they said,

362
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,440
 "The blows of the hammer shake the walls of our house

363
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,920
 "so much that it spoils our wine."

364
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,760
 - Wow.

365
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,080
 (audience laughing)

366
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,520
 - That is unpleasant, actually,

367
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,560
 tough to live with that.

368
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
 (audience laughing)

369
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,880
 - I've got a fact about kind of celebrity neighbor disputes

370
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,720
 'cause this does happen.

371
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,600
 So for example, in Manhattan in the early 1970s,

372
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,880
 John Cage, famous composer,

373
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,520
 he lived next door to John Lennon

374
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,320
 and he had to go round to complain about the noise.

375
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,160
 - Well, can I just say,

376
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,120
 John Cage is most famous for writing that song

377
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,280
 which is complete silence.

378
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,120
 - Exactly.

379
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,960
 - All right.

380
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,840
 - It's like the idea of John Lennon

381
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,360
 going background and complaining anytime he likes.

382
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,800
 - Can you please stop playing four minutes

383
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,040
 and 33 seconds?

384
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,200
 (audience laughing)

385
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,400
 - I saw another, this is just very, to me,

386
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,680
 this is very British about noisy neighbors

387
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,440
 in Crystal Palace in London,

388
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
 which is where I live.

389
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,760
 This family discovered in their basement

390
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,720
 an unexploded World War II bomb

391
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,640
 and they found it in the evening,

392
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,320
 but they didn't call the police

393
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,240
 because they didn't wanna wake the neighbors overnight.

394
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
 (audience laughing)

395
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,280
 And so patiently guarded the bomb.

396
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,640
 - How loudly do they talk on the phone?

397
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,840
 - They just didn't want everyone to be evacuated

398
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,680
 because they might be blown up by a World War II bomb.

399
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,680
 - To be honest, if the World War II bomb has lasted 60 full years,

400
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,600
 it's probably gonna be okay for an extra 12 hours.

401
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,800
 - That was their logic.

402
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,640
 - It's so...

403
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,360
 - If it had one of those timers counting down

404
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
 from 60 years ago.

405
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,000
 (audience laughing)

406
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,880
 - We've overset this one, but one day.

407
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,640
 (audience laughing)

408
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,160
 - But there is, there are often sort of surveys done

409
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,200
 about the items that people find most annoying in neighbors

410
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,280
 and they include hot tubs annoying

411
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,840
 'cause they, people are making a lot of noise

412
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,920
 and hot tubs when they're in them.

413
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,160
 Barbecues, automatic soda lights, trampolines

414
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,360
 are a very common cause of complaint.

415
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,640
 And I like this in the Guardian newspaper

416
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,040
 who commented that trampolines are complained about

417
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,680
 because they allow the neighbor's children

418
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,080
 to spy on you on an intermittent basis.

419
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,080
 (audience laughing)

420
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,320
 Very annoying.

421
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,960
 - I was just looking at some stupid names

422
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
 because of this guy called William Standup, right.

423
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,560
 I found a website which had every single name

424
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,600
 that's mentioned in the Doomsday book.

425
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
 And I spent most of my time reading that, to be honest.

426
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,120
 In the Doomsday book, there are four people called Abba,

427
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,800
 12 people called Alfred the Butler.

428
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,120
 - Wow.

429
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,160
 - Two called ape, one called Bono,

430
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,280
 one fish, two gods and a snot.

431
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,440
 (audience laughing)

432
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,360
 And there is one person called Anna,

433
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,200
 who was a man living in Puckle Church in Gloucestershire.

434
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
 - No relation.

435
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,520
 (audience laughing)

436
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,040
 - My past is not supposed to be delved into it.

437
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,320
 That was in my contract.

438
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,440
 - There were no dans, no andes.

439
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,080
 And there was one James who lived in Cockfield in Suffolk.

440
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,240
 - Really? - Wow.

441
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,400
 - He actually is a relation.

442
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,320
 (audience laughing)

443
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,920
 - I looked up a few names too.

444
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,560
 So I found that in the last decade,

445
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,840
 several dozen people have named their daughters unique.

446
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,840
 (audience laughing)

447
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,520
 And I also looked up some medieval ones as well.

448
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,680
 And just on the origins of root words,

449
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,200
 there's in the middle ages,

450
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
 the early uses of the F word, the word fuck,

451
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,680
 meant to hit something.

452
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,200
 So there is a man in 1290 whose name was Simon Fuckbutter.

453
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,440
 (audience laughing)

454
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,960
 He probably worked in Terry.

455
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
 (audience laughing)

456
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,120
 There's actually, there's a really cool Twitter account,

457
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,960
 which is called Name Curator, at Name Curator.

458
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,040
 And it's an account run by an Australian called Ben Osborne.

459
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,760
 And Ben Osborne just puts just his favorite names that he's found.

460
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,680
 So a couple that have gone up on the site,

461
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,440
 these are all real people.

462
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,480
 Dick Passwater is one guy who was a NASCAR driver in the '50s.

463
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
 So Dick Passwater and my favorite, a guy called Hans.

464
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,120
 Hans Off.

465
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,280
 (audience laughing)

466
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,280
 And he's a former submarine official.

467
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,880
 - What was he called, Dick Passwater?

468
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
 - Yeah, Dick. - And he was a NASCAR driver

469
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,960
 because he was also another NASCAR driver at the same time,

470
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,680
 or maybe the following decade called Dick Trickle.

471
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,800
 - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah.

472
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,760
 - And he's one of my favorite people because Dick Trickle,

473
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,520
 he was an amazing motor racing driver,

474
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
 but he liked to smoke.

475
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,520
 And they changed the rules and said,

476
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,760
 "You weren't allowed to smoke anymore

477
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,880
 "because you had to wear helmets

478
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,640
 "and you couldn't smoke while you were wearing your helmet."

479
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,120
 And so what he did was he drilled a hole in his helmet.

480
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
 - Yeah.

481
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,240
 - And he smoked with putting the cigarette in there.

482
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,520
 - Wow. - And so for QI,

483
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,000
 I always wanted to ask the question,

484
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,360
 why did Dick Trickle have a hole in his helmet?

485
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,880
 (audience laughing)

486
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
 - Beautiful.

487
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,640
 (audience applauding)

488
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,200
 - Didn't make it pass the sensors, didn't it?

489
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,720
 - No, I never made it pass the producer.

490
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,840
 - Do you know what Shakespeare means?

491
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,040
 - Just is it like literally shaking the spear?

492
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,960
 - Well, according to the came out in 2014,

493
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,640
 which is the dictionary of surnames.

494
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,520
 It's written by a couple of professors.

495
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,800
 And one of them said that the medieval surname Shakespeare

496
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,480
 is probably an obscene name originally for a masturbator.

497
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,320
 - No.

498
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,160
 - Wow. - Really?

499
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
 - He's a masturbator.

500
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,680
 - Hands off.

501
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,920
 (audience laughing)

502
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,080
 - I think it was pretty hands-on.

503
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,480
 (audience laughing)

504
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,400
 - I was on ancestry.com, and ancestry.com

505
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,800
 has been listing surnames that have gone extinct.

506
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,360
 So obviously the ones that like stand upright,

507
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
 I believe will have been extinct.

508
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,680
 So ones that have recently gone extinct include ships,

509
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,640
 temples, rummage, Sothec.

510
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,440
 So those they've seen that there are virtually no new members

511
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,080
 who are being born with the surname.

512
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
 And on the endangered list,

513
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,000
 and what counts as an endangered surname is so rare

514
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
 that less than 50 people in England and Wales have them.

515
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,920
 So this is for England and Wales.

516
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,760
 Included on the list is Marin, as in Helen Marin,

517
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,280
 Nike, as in Bill Nike, and Bonneville,

518
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,160
 as in Hugh Bonneville, all three leading actors.

519
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,360
 - The endangered species basically.

520
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,200
 - Yeah.

521
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,160
 - It's all of our solemn duty tonight,

522
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,280
 if we can, to mate with Helen Marin, Bill Nye,

523
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,400
 or Hugh Bonneville, depending on your preference.

524
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,040
 - Or more than he cares.

525
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,520
 (laughing)

526
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

527
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
 and that is my fact.

528
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,160
 My fact this week is that the man who invented

529
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,160
 the Australian Labradoodle deeply, deeply regrets it.

530
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,960
 (laughing)

531
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,560
 He is so sorry that he did that to all of us.

532
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,720
 This is a guy called Wally Conran.

533
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,240
 Wally Conran, who's now approaching his 90s.

534
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,600
 He was the first person in a mass sense

535
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,160
 and is credited with creating the trend

536
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,720
 which started in the '80s of the cross between

537
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,000
 the Labradoodle and a poodle.

538
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,040
 And what he hates is it kind of took off

539
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,680
 and it became a celebrity dog,

540
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,920
 and Jennifer Aniston has one,

541
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,880
 and crown princes around the world have them,

542
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,400
 and it became such a fashionable dog.

543
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,280
 But to get the specific dog,

544
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
 there's a lot of breeding that needs to happen,

545
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,680
 and he thinks he's created the Frankenstein

546
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,880
 that has set off all these people

547
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,080
 experimenting with different breeds and so on

548
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
 for design or dog.

549
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,480
 So yeah, he's very sorry, he asked me to say he's very sorry.

550
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
 (laughing)

551
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,680
 - I thought the reason that he,

552
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,160
 one of the reasons that he was sorry was because

553
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,320
 the whole reason the Labradoodle came to be

554
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,560
 was because he was asked to create a guy dog

555
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,560
 for a woman whose husband had a dog allergy.

556
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,800
 And so by merging those two, that anti-allergenic,

557
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,680
 so you're not allergic to them.

558
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,600
 I thought one of the reasons that he didn't like

559
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,960
 the Labradoodle is that it's advertised

560
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,680
 as a hyperallergenic dog.

561
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,920
 And yet, a lot of people now breed them

562
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,280
 without actually testing whether or not they are.

563
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,480
 So I think quite a small percentage of them now

564
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,920
 are nonallergenic, but.

565
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,680
 - But he is definitely against all of this

566
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,800
 kind of crossbreeding, I'm pretty sure.

567
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,920
 Yeah, he said, I just heard about someone

568
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,840
 who wants to cross a poodle with a rot wiler,

569
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,760
 but that is a thing.

570
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,600
 - That's correct.

571
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,920
 - Yeah, it's called a rottle.

572
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,520
 Also called a roti poo.

573
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,320
 A roti doodle or a rot wiler poo.

574
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,440
 - Yeah, oh.

575
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,040
 - But a rot wiler poo sounds like,

576
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,720
 that's a, yeah.

577
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,560
 - Yeah.

578
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,640
 - Yeah, you can get a coca poo.

579
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
 That's a cross between a coca spaniel and a poodle.

580
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
 A she poo, which is a shitsoo and a poodle.

581
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,160
 - Yeah, a beach poo, which is a beach on freeze and a poodle.

582
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,680
 A peek a poo, which is a peeking ease and a poodle.

583
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,440
 - No, stop it.

584
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,680
 - I mean, it does sound like they do it

585
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,880
 just for their names, doesn't it?

586
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

587
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,400
 - There's a schnailser scotty cross called a schnotty.

588
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
 (audience laughs)

589
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,920
 - Yeah. - It's one of the fun cross,

590
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,400
 which is a crossbreeding a shitsoo and a jack russle,

591
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,200
 which has two names, but one of them is the jack shit.

592
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,020
 (audience laughs)

593
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,880
 - Have you guys, there are some other dogs that went extinct

594
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
 or dogs we don't have anymore.

595
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
 - Yeah.

596
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,880
 - So have you heard of the salish wool dog?

597
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,720
 - No.

598
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,040
 - The wool dog was a dog you could shear

599
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,680
 and then you would wear their coat as your coat.

600
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,160
 It was a dog that was big and fluffy enough

601
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
 that you could keep on sharing it.

602
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,320
 - Could you not do that with any dog?

603
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,160
 No.

604
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,980
 - I don't know.

605
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,440
 - You could have a go, couldn't you?

606
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,280
 Might as well try.

607
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,560
 (audience laughs)

608
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,520
 - But you know why poodles have those stupid cuts of hair

609
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 that they have?

610
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,240
 Well, there's a proper reason behind it.

611
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,920
 And that is because they're originally

612
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,000
 to collect stuff from water.

613
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,440
 And if they had this kind of really bushy hair

614
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,040
 and they would just get wet and they'd get heavy.

615
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,200
 - So, but like, is it hunting, use?

616
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,160
 - It was collecting quarry, so you've been hunting

617
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,600
 and then the water says it's a duck, it's in the water.

618
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
 And then the poodle would go in and get it.

619
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,040
 And the idea was, so they wanted to have

620
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,680
 as little hair as possible, but it still needed hair

621
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,320
 to keep it in turn Logan's warm.

622
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,040
 So that's why it kept it round there.

623
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,600
 It still needed it to keep the joints warm

624
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
 to stop arthritis, so it still needed it round there.

625
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
 And the top nut was to keep the long hair out of its eyes

626
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,640
 when it was swimming.

627
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,560
 (audience laughs)

628
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,920
 - And that's it, it's a water dog.

629
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,520
 So the word poodle comes from the old German poodle,

630
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,800
 doesn't it, for puddle?

631
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,000
 Because it was best at going into water

632
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,200
 and getting ducks out of it.

633
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,880
 But do you know the best thing about a poodle these days

634
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
 when they're often shown in dog shows

635
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
 is the thing that you're striving for

636
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,840
 is for them to be square.

637
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,920
 So I didn't squareness is the thing you strive for most

638
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
 above all things.

639
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,080
 So the Westminster Kennel show allows two styles of poodle.

640
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
 It's not too many.

641
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,840
 They have continental and English, like breakfasts.

642
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
 And...

643
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,720
 - And the English one is a much grezier dog.

644
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,040
 (audience laughs)

645
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,200
 - Yeah, but who's going to pay that much for a continental?

646
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,040
 - Yeah, true.

647
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
 The continental is a journey over.

648
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
 - It's so overpriced.

649
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,600
 (audience laughs)

650
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,720
 - But the other, there are two styles of poodles

651
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,600
 that are allowed at these dog competitions

652
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,160
 and they're judged on squareness.

653
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,200
 And they're properly square.

654
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,800
 The area from their breast to their bottom

655
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 has to be the same as the area from their shoulder

656
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,240
 to the ground.

657
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,040
 And it's very precise.

658
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,680
 So in shows where poodles are being shown,

659
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,040
 they have to be really groomed very well.

660
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,200
 And groomers work with only the finest scissors, apparently.

661
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,000
 And the best poodle scissors are made in Japan.

662
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,880
 And they cost more than $600.

663
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,960
 - Done.

664
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,840
 - It sounds like you're sellerized scissors.

665
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,680
 - Yeah.

666
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,880
 - My dad has, he's a hairdresser and so is my mom.

667
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,520
 And he bought when he was young, a pair of scissors,

668
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,080
 scissors that were forged in the fires of a seller.

669
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,000
 (audience laughs)

670
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,120
 - They are samurai scissors.

671
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,600
 They were made by samurai.

672
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,160
 - And you set that on the show,

673
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,920
 and we really did not believe you.

674
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,760
 - Yeah.

675
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,560
 - And then I showed you the article

676
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,600
 where he was in the newspaper.

677
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
 It's true.

678
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,160
 I mean, it's still him going samurai scissors,

679
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,720
 but they're so sharp because they're made by the samurai.

680
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,640
 That when you're a hairdresser and you have your scissors,

681
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
 you need to get them sharpened every two or three years.

682
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,640
 You go and do it.

683
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,400
 My dad takes them every two or three years

684
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,320
 and they say to him,

685
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,920
 "There is nothing we can do for you."

686
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,160
 They are as sharp as the day you bought them.

687
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,600
 Samarized.

688
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,440
 (audience laughs)

689
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,600
 - Wow.

690
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,040
 - I've got a fact about dog mentality assessments.

691
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,120
 If anyone's up for that.

692
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,360
 - Yes, please.

693
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,200
 - It's, sorry, dog mentality assessments in Sweden.

694
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,040
 - Oh, no, no.

695
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,680
 (audience laughs)

696
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,320
 - So there's a Swedish association which has to assess

697
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,960
 how relaxed and calm a dog is.

698
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,320
 And it uses this thing called the dog mentality assessment.

699
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,200
 And what it is, it's basically a haunted house for dogs.

700
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,920
 So they make a dog walk along a long path in some woods.

701
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,880
 And then as it walks along,

702
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,200
 they suddenly, they play a gunshot sound.

703
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
 They play the sound of a metal chain

704
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
 being creepily dragged along.

705
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,440
 And then suddenly a ghost appears.

706
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,280
 - What?

707
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
 - Is it a dog ghost?

708
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,760
 - It's a human ghost.

709
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,760
 It's a person coming in a sheet with a plastic bucket on there.

710
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
 (audience laughs)

711
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,280
 And they test how calm or aggressive the dog is.

712
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,520
 - Right, so are they doing this

713
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,760
 because it's like a seeing dog like a...

714
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,600
 - I think they're doing this

715
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,560
 'cause they have time on their hands.

716
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,120
 - Like if it was like a blind person.

717
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,780
 - I think it might be to assess it in that kind of

718
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,200
 in working dogs, the aggressiveness, yeah.

719
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 - Right.

720
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
 - Wow, that's exciting.

721
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,600
 - I have a couple of things on,

722
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
 so the main headline fact is the inventor regretting

723
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,360
 his invention.

724
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,680
 I found a few other people who've regretted their inventions.

725
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,440
 So Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web,

726
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,680
 he really regrets, you know, originally,

727
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,080
 when we all had to put in a web address, HTTP and so on,

728
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,800
 he regrets the two forward slashes that you do.

729
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,640
 - Because...

730
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
 - That's the best bit.

731
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,440
 - Well, I agree, James.

732
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,520
 I had great fun.

733
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,640
 I wish there were more.

734
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,480
 But...

735
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 (audience laughs)

736
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,600
 - I sense those put an extra one in, just for fun.

737
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,440
 - Exactly.

738
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,080
 - Hour's a fun.

739
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,640
 And so the two forward slashes on it,

740
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,160
 which is completely useless, didn't need to be there.

741
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,360
 He just put them in because like James and I,

742
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,760
 he loves a good forward slash.

743
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,600
 And...

744
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,440
 (audience laughs)

745
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,280
 And they had no purpose at all, and he regrets that.

746
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,000
 He's publicly spoken and said,

747
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,760
 "I'm very sorry, I didn't mean to do that."

748
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,600
 - Okay.

749
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,120
 - Yeah, I think people thought they did code at the time.

750
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,360
 I mean, they did serve purpose in certain code, didn't they?

751
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,480
 And so he assumed they were useful.

752
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,320
 - Yes.

753
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,480
 - But then it turned out later that they weren't,

754
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,120
 and he said the countless hours of human labor

755
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
 and time spent typing those two key strokes.

756
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,640
 - Oh, what, what will we have done with the time?

757
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,400
 - I could have watched the wire.

758
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,240
 - Okay, yeah.

759
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,640
 - I'll never watch the wire because it didn't burn as late.

760
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,680
 - Hey, we need to move on to our final fact soon.

761
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,280
 Guys got anything before we do?

762
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,560
 - The queen is very responsible for dog crossbreeds.

763
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,400
 - Is she?

764
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,200
 - Our queen and yours guys.

765
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,840
 (audience laughs)

766
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,800
 - Don't forget.

767
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,720
 - Hers was one of the first crossbreeds

768
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,080
 as the BBC put it to infiltrate the Kennel Club

769
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,880
 because she bred daxans with corgis

770
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,800
 and she insisted on her doggy being in the portrait

771
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,880
 that she had done with her in the 1970s in 1975.

772
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,480
 And quite sweetly, the secretary of the Kennel Club

773
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,720
 at the time that judges all of these things said that,

774
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,080
 look, the daxan was evolved to chase badgers down holes

775
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,520
 and corgis were evolved to round up cattle.

776
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,120
 So if anyone loses a herd of cattle down a badger hole,

777
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,880
 these are just the dogs to get them.

778
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,880
 (audience laughs)

779
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,040
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

780
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,920
 and that is Andy.

781
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,320
 - My fact has a content warning, this bit's rude.

782
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,160
 - Okay cool.

783
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,680
 - Unlike that lobster bit we did earlier.

784
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,520
 - Oh yeah.

785
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,760
 (audience laughs)

786
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,440
 - So my fact is that the word shit faced originally meant

787
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,480
 having a very small face.

788
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,720
 (audience laughs)

789
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,360
 So if you said I was absolutely shit faced last night,

790
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,280
 it just means all your features bunched up

791
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,800
 right in the middle.

792
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,720
 - It's because it comes from the word shit.

793
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,480
 You hear that, it's very old fashioned saying

794
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,360
 you hear it said sometimes a mere shit of a lot.

795
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
 - Or like a chitty is a little receipt or something.

796
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,800
 - Exactly, yeah, it just means it's like a small thing.

797
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,400
 So the first usage that I've been able to find

798
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,400
 is 1622 where there's a child described as a peaking

799
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
 shit faced page.

800
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,040
 (audience laughs)

801
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,480
 Just means small face.

802
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
 (audience laughs)

803
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,200
 - I think we should bring it back, don't you?

804
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,560
 - Yes, I do.

805
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,520
 - There are loads of words for being drunk,

806
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,840
 but there were very few for having a small face.

807
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,760
 (audience laughs)

808
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,440
 - Imagine if the band, the small faces,

809
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,400
 had originally called themselves the shit faces.

810
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,760
 (audience laughs)

811
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,520
 - So this is the weird thing, but last night,

812
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,440
 Andy said to all of us, who do you think

813
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,520
 has the smallest face?

814
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,640
 I've all of us for, and I don't know what we were doing

815
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,480
 this for.

816
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,320
 - Is that what you were doing?

817
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,160
 - It's not what, it's not consciously why I asked.

818
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,520
 - Because you were called pinhead at school, aren't you?

819
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
 - Yeah.

820
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,160
 (audience laughs)

821
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,080
 - But as I pointed out, pins famously have very large

822
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,720
 heads relative to their body.

823
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,240
 (audience laughs)

824
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,600
 So let me tell you, the drunk was on those guys.

825
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 (audience laughs)

826
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,280
 Nice one shit face.

827
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,280
 (audience laughs)

828
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,080
 I was looking up other false shit words, basically.

829
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,840
 So there's the word shittle, which means inconstant.

830
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,880
 So like a shuttle, it means back and forward,

831
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,720
 the word shittle.

832
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,480
 So you used to play badminton with a shittle cock.

833
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
 - No way.

834
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,160
 - Yeah.

835
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,000
 - No way.

836
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,960
 - Wait, shite poke, shite poke, yes.

837
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,000
 Sorry, I just don't like you.

838
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,840
 - I'm sorry.

839
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,680
 (audience laughs)

840
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,280
 - Now, shite poke was an old word for a heron.

841
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,120
 - Wow.

842
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,160
 - And the reason was because people thought that herons

843
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,000
 defecated when taking flight.

844
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,320
 - We say do sometimes, or not all the time.

845
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,160
 Yeah.

846
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
 - There was a guy in the 19th century who wrote,

847
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,320
 the dictionary of West Somerset in 1875,

848
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,120
 and he said that the 29th of May is shit sack day.

849
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,560
 And he writes this, the writer of the dictionary says,

850
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,280
 in the northwest of Somerset and North Devon,

851
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,480
 it is common to hear boys call out on that day,

852
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,240
 shit sack, shit sack, but I have been unable

853
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,520
 to discover the origin.

854
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,000
 (audience laughs)

855
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,520
 It feels to me like he's not heard them saying it

856
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
 to him on the other day.

857
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,360
 - Yes.

858
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,800
 (audience laughs)

859
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,920
 - There's a three volume dictionary of slang

860
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,760
 called Jonathan Greene's,

861
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,080
 Jonathan Greene is the guy who wrote it.

862
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,920
 He's a genius.

863
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,920
 But I looked up peculiarly Australian shit slang words.

864
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,200
 So I don't know how familiar these might be,

865
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,520
 everyone knows them.

866
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,640
 So for example, I'm so hungry,

867
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,680
 I could eat a shit sandwich, only I don't like bread.

868
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,400
 (audience laughs)

869
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,880
 There's to take the shit with the sugar,

870
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,400
 which is to accept that one must have

871
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,760
 both bad and good experiences in life.

872
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,600
 And my favorite is you don't know

873
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,480
 whether you want a shit or a haircut.

874
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,040
 (audience laughs)

875
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,840
 Which is, you're stupid, that's what that means.

876
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,320
 (audience laughs)

877
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,360
 - I think it's possible to want both of those things.

878
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,800
 (audience laughs)

879
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,600
 - The word shit though, has a long history,

880
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,560
 doesn't it, in a long etymological history.

881
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,960
 So it comes from "skay" which meant to cut.

882
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,280
 And so it's the same origin as words like science

883
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,400
 and schedule and shield.

884
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,480
 And it was spelled "shite" until the 1700s.

885
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,120
 But they used to kind of broaden their shit base vocabulary.

886
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,120
 So in Old English, "skite" was direer

887
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,480
 and "besketan" was one word that meant to cover with excrement.

888
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,640
 And also in 18th century,

889
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,960
 according to the Partridge Dictionary of Slang,

890
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,680
 to shit through your teeth was to vomit,

891
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,280
 which does make a lot of sense.

892
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,120
 (audience laughs)

893
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,360
 The example that's given in this dictionary

894
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,160
 is "Egy Harky Friend,

895
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,200
 "have you got a padlock on your ass

896
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,120
 "that you shite through your teeth?"

897
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,600
 (audience laughs)

898
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,920
 - Wow, wow.

899
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,200
 I have some swear words which are not a tall rude,

900
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,760
 but they are awesome.

901
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,240
 These are incredibly rude in the languages that they are in.

902
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
 Okay, so for example.

903
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,760
 - So we're gonna alienate not just the English-speaking world

904
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,920
 of this podcast.

905
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,880
 - Yeah, the Swedish, the Romanians and the Japanese

906
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,560
 have better buckle up when they're listening to this.

907
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,160
 So in Sweden, you can say,

908
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,400
 go and put an old blanket over yourself,

909
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,240
 which is really rude to them.

910
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,080
 - In Sweden.

911
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,920
 - Yeah, in Sweden.

912
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,960
 - But that's what that guy who is pretending

913
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,160
 to be a ghost was doing.

914
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,000
 (audience laughs)

915
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,720
 - So in Japan, you can say,

916
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,080
 "Tofu no kado ni atama wo butsu kete shine,"

917
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,120
 or hit your head on a corner of tofu and die.

918
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,120
 (audience laughs)

919
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,000
 In Romanian, there's a phrase which means,

920
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,080
 I can't believe this is true.

921
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,120
 It means, "I would dry my dirty pants

922
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,040
 on your mum's crucifix."

923
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,960
 (audience laughs)

924
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,000
 That one's quite rude in English as well.

925
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,040
 (audience laughs)

926
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,560
 - Can I just, in Romanian, I read an article on Vice,

927
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,880
 which had a Romanian person writing in

928
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,400
 about swearing in Romania,

929
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,920
 and they said, "Swearing culture in Romania

930
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,200
 is built on oral sex, mothers, and Christ."

931
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,600
 (audience laughs)

932
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
 - That's very much the trifecta of things

933
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,920
 not to say in Romania.

934
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,760
 (audience laughs)

935
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,840
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts.

936
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,600
 Thank you so much for listening.

937
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,560
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

938
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,680

00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,320

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,200
 which is @nosuchthing, our Facebook page.

947
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,560
 No such thing as a fish, no such thing as a fish.com.

948
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,240
 It's so many no such things as fish, things you can go to.

949
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,560
 But the website does have all of our previous episodes.

950
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,360
 It has our tour dates and everything.

951
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,840
 So head there, we will be back again next week

952
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,240
 with another episode.

953
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,720
 Guys, you have been awesome.

954
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,920
 Thank you so much.

955
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,080
 We'll be back again.

956
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,640
 Goodbye!

957
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,640
 (audience cheering)

958
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,060
 (upbeat music)

959
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,060
 (audience cheering)
