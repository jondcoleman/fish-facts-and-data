00:00:00,00:00:02,(bells ringing)
00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:07,(upbeat music)
00:00:07,00:00:22,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:22,00:00:26,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish,"" a weekly podcast."
00:00:26,00:00:28,"This week, coming to you live"
00:00:28,00:00:30,"from Perth, Australia."
00:00:30,00:00:33,(audience cheering)
00:00:33,00:00:38,"My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:00:38,00:00:41,"and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:41,00:00:43,"Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:00:43,00:00:46,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:46,00:00:49,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:49,00:00:50,"and in no particular order,"
00:00:50,00:00:54,"here we go, starting with you, Chazinski."
00:00:54,00:00:57,"- Yeah, my fact this week is that in the 1960s,"
00:00:57,00:01:01,Brazil and France almost went to war with each other
00:01:01,00:01:03,over whether lobster's crawl or swim.
00:01:03,00:01:06,(audience laughing)
00:01:06,00:01:08,- What a just war it would have been.
00:01:08,00:01:09,(audience laughing)
00:01:09,00:01:11,- Who side are you on?
00:01:11,00:01:12,- Who side are you on?
00:01:12,00:01:14,- I think they crawl.
00:01:14,00:01:16,- I think they swim.
00:01:16,00:01:16,- Yeah.
00:01:16,00:01:18,- I will see you on the battlefield.
00:01:18,00:01:20,(audience laughing)
00:01:20,00:01:21,- Okay.
00:01:21,00:01:22,"- Are you seeing me do both, right?"
00:01:22,00:01:23,- Yeah.
00:01:23,00:01:25,- The classic sweatsiland in the corner.
00:01:25,00:01:26,(audience laughing)
00:01:26,00:01:28,"- No, so it is a problem that they do both,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"'cause this is the fact that in 1961,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,a French fisherman found the water of the coast of Brazil
00:01:34,00:01:37,"was full of lobsters, and they wanted to fish them,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"so they could get money from selling the lobsters,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"and so they side-fishing them,"
00:01:41,00:01:45,but Brazil claimed exclusive rights to sea creatures
00:01:45,00:01:48,that were walking along the continental shelf
00:01:48,00:01:51,"within a certain, like, diameter radius of Brazil."
00:01:51,00:01:54,"So if creatures were walking in that area,"
00:01:54,00:01:57,"then Brazil had a right to them and no one else did,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,"but if they were swimming in that area,"
00:01:59,00:02:04,"then they did not, and so this huge argument came forward"
00:02:04,00:02:05,"about whether they were walking or swimming,"
00:02:05,00:02:06,"and the French said that they were swimming,"
00:02:06,00:02:10,"so they were open to anyone, 'cause lobsters do sometimes swim,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,"and so they said, ""We're allowed to fish for these lobsters."""
00:02:12,00:02:14,Brazilians said they crawled.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"There was actually, I think there was a moment"
00:02:16,00:02:20,where the Brazilian admiral of the Brazilian navy
00:02:20,00:02:23,"said that, ""If you're saying that lobsters swim,"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"""you're also saying that a kangaroo"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"""would be considered a bird when it hops."""
00:02:27,00:02:28,(audience laughs)
00:02:28,00:02:30,That is fighting talk.
00:02:30,00:02:31,(audience laughs)
00:02:31,00:02:34,But it really came to blows.
00:02:34,00:02:35,"So there was this huge debate,"
00:02:35,00:02:39,"and eventually Brazil said, ""France, can you please go away?"""
00:02:39,00:02:41,"These things are crawling, and France refused,"
00:02:41,00:02:44,"and had a destroyer ship accompany their lobster boats,"
00:02:44,00:02:49,"a warship, and in response, Brazil mobilized its warships,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,including an aircraft carrier.
00:02:51,00:02:53,(audience laughs)
00:02:53,00:02:55,"And then both of these sides are ready for battle,"
00:02:55,00:02:56,and this lasted for two years.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"They were sitting there with the battleships,"
00:02:58,00:03:00,"poised, ready to fight each other"
00:03:00,00:03:02,"over where the lobsters crawled or swim,"
00:03:02,00:03:05,"and then eventually some laws of the sea were put into force,"
00:03:05,00:03:07,"saying, ""Look, guys, chill the fuck out."""
00:03:07,00:03:09,(audience laughs)
00:03:09,00:03:11,- It was the official wording on the law.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"- It was, yeah."
00:03:12,00:03:15,"And, yeah, war didn't happen,"
00:03:15,00:03:17,"and rights were granted to Brazil,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,"'cause of a fishing act, and it was okay,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"but we were pretty close, guys."
00:03:21,00:03:22,- Wow.
00:03:22,00:03:22,- Yeah.
00:03:22,00:03:25,- It seems to me that countries are always going
00:03:25,00:03:26,to war over fish.
00:03:26,00:03:28,Other things living in the sea.
00:03:28,00:03:31,"So there's been a turbot war between Canada and Spain,"
00:03:31,00:03:34,a crab war between North and South Korea.
00:03:34,00:03:37,There was an oyster war between Maryland and the state
00:03:37,00:03:38,versus pirates.
00:03:38,00:03:39,- Cool.
00:03:39,00:03:43,"- There was a macro war between UK and Iceland,"
00:03:43,00:03:45,"a prom war between India and Sri Lanka,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,"a squid war between the UK and Argentina,"
00:03:47,00:03:50,a scallop conflict between the UK and France.
00:03:50,00:03:52,(audience laughs)
00:03:52,00:03:56,"- A catfish dispute between the US and Vietnam,"
00:03:56,00:04:00,and a sprat spat between Latvia and Russia.
00:04:00,00:04:02,- Wow.
00:04:02,00:04:03,- That's amazing.
00:04:03,00:04:04,"- God, fish are real trouble makers, aren't they?"
00:04:04,00:04:06,(audience laughs)
00:04:06,00:04:09,"And so, on lobsters, which I believe this was about,"
00:04:09,00:04:13,"so the Caribbean, so the thing that this was originally about,"
00:04:13,00:04:14,"it was a Caribbean spiny lobster,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,"which was a kind of rock lobster,"
00:04:16,00:04:20,but this is a kind of lobster that cues.
00:04:20,00:04:22,"So a very British brand of lobster,"
00:04:22,00:04:27,"but when they migrate, they form orderly single-file cues."
00:04:27,00:04:30,So they migrate seasonally because they want to get away
00:04:30,00:04:31,from cold water.
00:04:31,00:04:34,"And these, you know, these are the most precious lobsters"
00:04:34,00:04:35,on that coastline.
00:04:35,00:04:39,"And yeah, they cling to each other and form an orderly cue"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"and move single-file, each rest is antennae"
00:04:42,00:04:45,over the sort of arse of the lobster in front.
00:04:45,00:04:46,- Oh.
00:04:46,00:04:48,- And they move like a conga.
00:04:48,00:04:49,- That's so exciting.
00:04:49,00:04:50,- It's a lobster conga.
00:04:50,00:04:52,"- Yeah, I read that in North America,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,back when the European settlers first went there
00:04:54,00:04:57,"for the first time, there was so much lobster in the water"
00:04:57,00:05:02,that they would wash up onto the shore in piles two feet high.
00:05:02,00:05:02,- Wow.
00:05:02,00:05:07,"- Like a tiny tsunami of lobster, tiny and delicious."
00:05:07,00:05:13,"I've got a fact about putting lobsters into the sea,"
00:05:13,00:05:14,which is a thing that sometimes people do.
00:05:14,00:05:17,So this was in Britain in 2017.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"Two Buddhists were fined 15,000 pounds"
00:05:20,00:05:22,for releasing 700 live lobsters and crabs
00:05:22,00:05:24,into the sea of Brighton.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"And they did it as a life-release ceremony,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,which is the thing you might want to do if you're a Buddhist.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"And unfortunately, they weren't native"
00:05:30,00:05:32,and they had the potential to destroy ecosystems.
00:05:32,00:05:34,And the government had to try and catch them again.
00:05:34,00:05:36,Only 323 were recovered.
00:05:36,00:05:38,There are still about 400 out there.
00:05:38,00:05:39,Yeah.
00:05:39,00:05:41,- This is a real problem though.
00:05:41,00:05:42,"This is happening in Australia as well,"
00:05:42,00:05:43,"genuinely, and in America."
00:05:43,00:05:45,So it is the Fangsheng ceremony.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"There's a Buddhist ceremony, which is about returning"
00:05:47,00:05:49,life to where it's meant to be.
00:05:49,00:05:53,But it's always returning non-native creatures.
00:05:53,00:05:53,(audience laughing)
00:05:53,00:05:54,- Oh wow.
00:05:54,00:05:57,- And they always wipe out local ecosystems.
00:05:57,00:05:59,"And yeah, so it's happens with lobsters"
00:05:59,00:06:02,"in Australia and in China, America."
00:06:02,00:06:03,- Do Buddhists have like the equivalent
00:06:03,00:06:06,of a confession booth that they go into?
00:06:06,00:06:07,(audience laughing)
00:06:07,00:06:10,"Forgive me, monk father, I don't know what it would be."
00:06:10,00:06:11,- Lama.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"- Forgive me, Lama."
00:06:12,00:06:16,"I've seen, I tried to save a life, but I've destroyed"
00:06:16,00:06:18,an entire ecosystem.
00:06:18,00:06:20,(audience laughing)
00:06:20,00:06:23,That's 12 reincarnations that you've been deducted.
00:06:23,00:06:25,(audience laughing)
00:06:25,00:06:26,- That's how it works.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"- You know, Peter, the people for the ethical"
00:06:28,00:06:31,"treatment of animals, we've discussed them a few times."
00:06:31,00:06:33,And they kind of suggest that people might wanna do
00:06:33,00:06:36,"this thing as well, which they call lobster liberation."
00:06:36,00:06:38,"And they have posters, they put posters up saying,"
00:06:38,00:06:42,"""Been boiled hurts, lobster liberation."""
00:06:42,00:06:44,"But unfortunately, the lobster in their picture"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"is bright red, which means it's already been cooked."
00:06:46,00:06:47,- Oh no.
00:06:47,00:06:49,(audience laughing)
00:06:49,00:06:51,"- Lobsters do have a very, very tough time."
00:06:51,00:06:54,"So whenever they malt, they have to,"
00:06:54,00:06:56,obviously they have to get rid of their old shell
00:06:56,00:06:57,to grow larger.
00:06:57,00:07:00,"But they have to lose half their claw weight,"
00:07:00,00:07:01,'cause otherwise the claw is too big
00:07:01,00:07:03,to fit out of the old shell.
00:07:03,00:07:04,"And the claw muscles are so massive,"
00:07:04,00:07:08,'cause obviously that's what lobsters are like.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"They have to rip, they've got very slim wrists."
00:07:10,00:07:12,So they have to rip the claw.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Basically, when they try to malt,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"they have to rip out the lining of their throat,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"their stomach, and their anus."
00:07:18,00:07:21,"Which is, I think that's the trifexer"
00:07:21,00:07:22,of things you don't wanna rip out.
00:07:22,00:07:23,- Yes.
00:07:23,00:07:26,(audience laughing)
00:07:26,00:07:28,- What is the least classy use of the word trifector?
00:07:28,00:07:30,(audience laughing)
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Yeah.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"- But they are, they're weird, aren't they?"
00:07:32,00:07:34,I was reading on national geographic.
00:07:34,00:07:37,"So, okay, their brain is located in their throat,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,"their nervous system, in their abdomen,"
00:07:39,00:07:40,"their teeth, in their stomach,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"their kidneys, in their head."
00:07:42,00:07:43,"They hear through their legs,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,and they taste with their feet.
00:07:45,00:07:47,They're all over the shop.
00:07:47,00:07:47,(audience laughing)
00:07:47,00:07:50,- So the bladder being very much in the head
00:07:50,00:07:53,means that they urinate out of their faces.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"And urinating is very important to lobsters,"
00:07:55,00:07:58,"and especially female lobsters, 'cause it's quite sexy."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"So, the way that female lobsters"
00:08:00,00:08:04,seduce male lobsters is that they urinate out of their face
00:08:04,00:08:05,into the male lobsters den.
00:08:05,00:08:06,- That is sexy.
00:08:06,00:08:07,(audience laughing)
00:08:07,00:08:09,"- Oh, you wouldn't want, imagine your letterbox"
00:08:09,00:08:10,in the morning.
00:08:10,00:08:12,(audience laughing)
00:08:12,00:08:13,"Oh, no, it's Valentine's Day."
00:08:13,00:08:17,(audience laughing)
00:08:17,00:08:19,"- Well, it's very attractive in some circles."
00:08:19,00:08:22,"But yeah, the females urinate in the male dens"
00:08:22,00:08:24,until the male is attracted enough for the urine.
00:08:24,00:08:27,All things are really to get rid of this urine somehow.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"So, he invites the female in."
00:08:29,00:08:31,"And then, immediately, she gets naked."
00:08:31,00:08:32,"So, as soon as she's been invited in,"
00:08:32,00:08:35,she sheds all of her shell.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"And also, I think this is really insulting."
00:08:38,00:08:39,The other thing that the female sheds
00:08:39,00:08:41,once she gets into a lobsters den
00:08:41,00:08:44,is the pouch where she had banked the sperm
00:08:44,00:08:45,from the prior mate.
00:08:45,00:08:48,(audience laughing)
00:08:48,00:08:49,- I'll just leave this by the door.
00:08:49,00:08:52,(audience laughing)
00:08:52,00:08:54,- Can she put back her shell on?
00:08:54,00:08:56,- If he's not interested?
00:08:56,00:08:57,- No. - No.
00:08:57,00:08:58,(audience laughing)
00:08:58,00:08:59,"- Well, you can't rip out the lining"
00:08:59,00:09:01,"of your throat, stomach and anus."
00:09:01,00:09:03,"And then say, I miss those."
00:09:03,00:09:04,(audience laughing)
00:09:04,00:09:07,I've misread those sides.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"I'll just get my pouches for them, maybe on my way."
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- Hey, we need to move on to our next fact, surely."
00:09:12,00:09:14,"- Oh, I think we should honestly give a shout out"
00:09:14,00:09:16,"to the amazing lobsters, which are"
00:09:16,00:09:19,"the largest freshwater invertebrates on earth,"
00:09:19,00:09:21,which is the Tasmanian lobster.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"And yeah, they're incredible."
00:09:24,00:09:27,"So, they're the size of kind of a normal sized dog."
00:09:27,00:09:29,And they're extremely strong.
00:09:29,00:09:32,- And a dog's coming lots of different sizes.
00:09:32,00:09:33,(audience laughing)
00:09:33,00:09:35,- That's one of the main things about dogs.
00:09:35,00:09:37,- They're like a coca-spaniel.
00:09:37,00:09:39,- Wow. - Wow.
00:09:39,00:09:40,- They are extremely big.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"They live to be 60 years old, at least."
00:09:42,00:09:45,"And they can break human bones, so with their claws,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,or they can crush beer bottles.
00:09:47,00:09:50,And they're just incredible.
00:09:50,00:09:52,And they can't breed until they're 14 years old.
00:09:52,00:09:54,- Come on. - What?
00:09:54,00:09:56,"- Which we laugh at, but we're humans."
00:09:56,00:09:58,That's literally the same as humans.
00:09:58,00:09:59,But.
00:09:59,00:10:00,(audience laughing)
00:10:00,00:10:01,- Breed.
00:10:01,00:10:03,- Yeah. - I had breathed.
00:10:03,00:10:05,(audience laughing)
00:10:05,00:10:07,"- I thought that when the lobster gets to 14,"
00:10:07,00:10:09,"it goes, ""Goo."""
00:10:09,00:10:10,- Oh.
00:10:10,00:10:13,(audience laughing)
00:10:13,00:10:14,- That's better.
00:10:14,00:10:15,"- Fitting me, it does make that noise,"
00:10:15,00:10:18,but it's a complete of a reason.
00:10:18,00:10:21,(audience laughing)
00:10:21,00:10:23,(upbeat music)
00:10:23,00:10:26,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:10:26,00:10:28,And that is James.
00:10:28,00:10:31,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1350,"
00:10:31,00:10:34,there was a man called Williams Stand Up Right.
00:10:34,00:10:37,(audience laughing)
00:10:37,00:10:40,And he annoyed everyone else in his village
00:10:40,00:10:44,so much that every single one of them moved away.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Wow.
00:10:45,00:10:48,(audience laughing)
00:10:48,00:10:50,- It really sounds awesome.
00:10:50,00:10:54,- Do we know anything about what he did?
00:10:54,00:10:57,"- Well, so the thing is, this comes from the parish rolls"
00:10:57,00:10:59,"in England, so it's where, if you're a historian,"
00:10:59,00:11:02,it's a really good place to get all the really small things
00:11:02,00:11:04,that happen in the villages.
00:11:04,00:11:06,"And in this one, in particular, it says,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,"""The coroner testifies that Williams Stand Up Right"
00:11:09,00:11:12,"""is so quarrelsome and rancorous"
00:11:12,00:11:13,"""that none of the Lord's tenants"
00:11:13,00:11:16,"""can bear to live in the village because of him,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"""and he has caused the village to be deserted."""
00:11:18,00:11:20,(audience laughing)
00:11:20,00:11:23,"And then by 1356, so that's six years later,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,he had also left the village.
00:11:25,00:11:27,(audience laughing)
00:11:27,00:11:29,Presumably because he had no one left to argue with.
00:11:29,00:11:30,(audience laughing)
00:11:30,00:11:31,- That's amazing.
00:11:31,00:11:34,And that's all we know about him.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"Like, a lot of these things, these kind of parish things,"
00:11:37,00:11:41,"all you see is a very, very tiny snapshot of people's lives."
00:11:41,00:11:42,It's amazing. - Right.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"- So, for instance, in 1328,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,John Francy claimed two shillings in damages
00:11:47,00:11:49,because Alice Devaney's had accused his wife
00:11:49,00:11:53,of wearing her short jacket before Easter.
00:11:53,00:11:54,(audience laughing)
00:11:54,00:11:55,- Whoa.
00:11:55,00:11:56,- Shot to my mouth.
00:11:56,00:11:58,(audience laughing)
00:11:58,00:12:02,"In 1347, a man called Roger Sweatin' Bed"
00:12:02,00:12:05,(audience laughing)
00:12:05,00:12:10,was accused of fornication with Latisha Bat.
00:12:10,00:12:11,(audience laughing)
00:12:11,00:12:12,- Wow.
00:12:12,00:12:13,- Roger Sweatin' Bed.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"- Sweatin' Bed, stand at right and shot in mouth."
00:12:15,00:12:16,Was that the third one?
00:12:16,00:12:17,- No.
00:12:17,00:12:21,"- This is no, it's so fun reading through these old records."
00:12:21,00:12:23,So there's actually a document called
00:12:23,00:12:25,the Assize of Nucenses.
00:12:25,00:12:26,And I really recommend it.
00:12:26,00:12:28,It's what I wasted all of my research time doing
00:12:28,00:12:31,"for this show, but it's from 700 years ago."
00:12:31,00:12:33,"And it's literally a list by,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,from the whole of the UK of all the nuciances
00:12:36,00:12:38,that are reported by neighbors.
00:12:38,00:12:39,And so I read through it.
00:12:39,00:12:40,"And most of them, to be fair,"
00:12:40,00:12:43,are about sewage leaking into other people's gardens.
00:12:43,00:12:44,So there were a lot of people.
00:12:44,00:12:45,- Maybe they were just flirting
00:12:45,00:12:48,with the next old neighbor in a kind of lobster way.
00:12:48,00:12:49,(audience laughing)
00:12:49,00:12:52,- It didn't sound super sexy in the right up.
00:12:52,00:12:55,So there was a woman who built her own personal toilet
00:12:55,00:12:57,"'cause she didn't like throwing her sewage out of the window,"
00:12:57,00:12:58,which a lot of people did.
00:12:58,00:13:01,But the solids blocked her gutter
00:13:01,00:13:04,and the neighbors that they were greatly inconvenienced
00:13:04,00:13:05,by the stench.
00:13:05,00:13:09,"So that was then, and there was one more, just in 1377."
00:13:09,00:13:11,"Thomas and Alice Young complained,"
00:13:11,00:13:13,"the neighbor built a forge and they were making armor,"
00:13:13,00:13:16,but the sledgehammer crashing
00:13:16,00:13:18,of them making the armor disturbed them.
00:13:18,00:13:19,"But worse than that,"
00:13:19,00:13:22,"the smoke penetrated their house, so it smelled really bad."
00:13:22,00:13:23,"And also they said,"
00:13:23,00:13:26,"""The blows of the hammer shake the walls of our house"
00:13:26,00:13:28,"""so much that it spoils our wine."""
00:13:28,00:13:29,- Wow.
00:13:29,00:13:32,(audience laughing)
00:13:32,00:13:33,"- That is unpleasant, actually,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,tough to live with that.
00:13:34,00:13:36,(audience laughing)
00:13:36,00:13:40,- I've got a fact about kind of celebrity neighbor disputes
00:13:40,00:13:41,'cause this does happen.
00:13:41,00:13:45,"So for example, in Manhattan in the early 1970s,"
00:13:45,00:13:47,"John Cage, famous composer,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,he lived next door to John Lennon
00:13:50,00:13:53,and he had to go round to complain about the noise.
00:13:53,00:13:54,"- Well, can I just say,"
00:13:54,00:13:56,John Cage is most famous for writing that song
00:13:56,00:13:57,which is complete silence.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Exactly.
00:13:58,00:13:58,- All right.
00:13:58,00:13:59,- It's like the idea of John Lennon
00:13:59,00:14:02,going background and complaining anytime he likes.
00:14:02,00:14:03,- Can you please stop playing four minutes
00:14:03,00:14:05,and 33 seconds?
00:14:05,00:14:08,(audience laughing)
00:14:08,00:14:11,"- I saw another, this is just very, to me,"
00:14:11,00:14:14,this is very British about noisy neighbors
00:14:14,00:14:16,"in Crystal Palace in London,"
00:14:16,00:14:18,which is where I live.
00:14:18,00:14:21,This family discovered in their basement
00:14:21,00:14:24,an unexploded World War II bomb
00:14:24,00:14:26,"and they found it in the evening,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,but they didn't call the police
00:14:28,00:14:31,because they didn't wanna wake the neighbors overnight.
00:14:31,00:14:32,(audience laughing)
00:14:32,00:14:35,And so patiently guarded the bomb.
00:14:35,00:14:37,- How loudly do they talk on the phone?
00:14:37,00:14:39,- They just didn't want everyone to be evacuated
00:14:39,00:14:43,because they might be blown up by a World War II bomb.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"- To be honest, if the World War II bomb has lasted 60 full years,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,it's probably gonna be okay for an extra 12 hours.
00:14:48,00:14:49,- That was their logic.
00:14:49,00:14:50,- It's so...
00:14:50,00:14:52,- If it had one of those timers counting down
00:14:52,00:14:53,from 60 years ago.
00:14:53,00:14:55,(audience laughing)
00:14:55,00:14:56,"- We've overset this one, but one day."
00:14:56,00:14:58,(audience laughing)
00:14:58,00:15:01,"- But there is, there are often sort of surveys done"
00:15:01,00:15:04,about the items that people find most annoying in neighbors
00:15:04,00:15:06,and they include hot tubs annoying
00:15:06,00:15:07,"'cause they, people are making a lot of noise"
00:15:07,00:15:08,and hot tubs when they're in them.
00:15:08,00:15:12,"Barbecues, automatic soda lights, trampolines"
00:15:12,00:15:14,are a very common cause of complaint.
00:15:14,00:15:16,And I like this in the Guardian newspaper
00:15:16,00:15:19,who commented that trampolines are complained about
00:15:19,00:15:20,because they allow the neighbor's children
00:15:20,00:15:23,to spy on you on an intermittent basis.
00:15:23,00:15:26,(audience laughing)
00:15:26,00:15:29,Very annoying.
00:15:29,00:15:33,- I was just looking at some stupid names
00:15:33,00:15:36,"because of this guy called William Standup, right."
00:15:36,00:15:39,I found a website which had every single name
00:15:39,00:15:41,that's mentioned in the Doomsday book.
00:15:41,00:15:44,"And I spent most of my time reading that, to be honest."
00:15:44,00:15:48,"In the Doomsday book, there are four people called Abba,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,12 people called Alfred the Butler.
00:15:50,00:15:52,- Wow.
00:15:52,00:15:55,"- Two called ape, one called Bono,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"one fish, two gods and a snot."
00:15:57,00:15:59,(audience laughing)
00:15:59,00:16:02,"And there is one person called Anna,"
00:16:02,00:16:06,who was a man living in Puckle Church in Gloucestershire.
00:16:06,00:16:07,- No relation.
00:16:07,00:16:09,(audience laughing)
00:16:09,00:16:12,- My past is not supposed to be delved into it.
00:16:12,00:16:13,That was in my contract.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- There were no dans, no andes."
00:16:15,00:16:19,And there was one James who lived in Cockfield in Suffolk.
00:16:19,00:16:20,- Really? - Wow.
00:16:20,00:16:21,- He actually is a relation.
00:16:21,00:16:23,(audience laughing)
00:16:23,00:16:24,- I looked up a few names too.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"So I found that in the last decade,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,several dozen people have named their daughters unique.
00:16:29,00:16:32,(audience laughing)
00:16:32,00:16:35,And I also looked up some medieval ones as well.
00:16:35,00:16:39,"And just on the origins of root words,"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"there's in the middle ages,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"the early uses of the F word, the word fuck,"
00:16:44,00:16:45,meant to hit something.
00:16:45,00:16:50,So there is a man in 1290 whose name was Simon Fuckbutter.
00:16:50,00:16:51,(audience laughing)
00:16:51,00:16:52,He probably worked in Terry.
00:16:52,00:16:54,(audience laughing)
00:16:54,00:16:57,"There's actually, there's a really cool Twitter account,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,"which is called Name Curator, at Name Curator."
00:16:59,00:17:03,And it's an account run by an Australian called Ben Osborne.
00:17:03,00:17:07,And Ben Osborne just puts just his favorite names that he's found.
00:17:07,00:17:09,"So a couple that have gone up on the site,"
00:17:09,00:17:11,these are all real people.
00:17:11,00:17:16,Dick Passwater is one guy who was a NASCAR driver in the '50s.
00:17:16,00:17:20,"So Dick Passwater and my favorite, a guy called Hans."
00:17:20,00:17:22,Hans Off.
00:17:22,00:17:25,(audience laughing)
00:17:25,00:17:28,And he's a former submarine official.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"- What was he called, Dick Passwater?"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"- Yeah, Dick. - And he was a NASCAR driver"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"because he was also another NASCAR driver at the same time,"
00:17:34,00:17:38,or maybe the following decade called Dick Trickle.
00:17:38,00:17:39,- Oh yeah. - Oh yeah.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"- And he's one of my favorite people because Dick Trickle,"
00:17:42,00:17:45,"he was an amazing motor racing driver,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,but he liked to smoke.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"And they changed the rules and said,"
00:17:48,00:17:49,"""You weren't allowed to smoke anymore"
00:17:49,00:17:50,"""because you had to wear helmets"
00:17:50,00:17:53,"""and you couldn't smoke while you were wearing your helmet."""
00:17:53,00:17:56,And so what he did was he drilled a hole in his helmet.
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Yeah.
00:17:57,00:18:00,- And he smoked with putting the cigarette in there.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"- Wow. - And so for QI,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"I always wanted to ask the question,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,why did Dick Trickle have a hole in his helmet?
00:18:05,00:18:07,(audience laughing)
00:18:07,00:18:08,- Beautiful.
00:18:08,00:18:11,(audience applauding)
00:18:11,00:18:13,"- Didn't make it pass the sensors, didn't it?"
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- No, I never made it pass the producer."
00:18:15,00:18:17,- Do you know what Shakespeare means?
00:18:17,00:18:20,- Just is it like literally shaking the spear?
00:18:20,00:18:23,"- Well, according to the came out in 2014,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,which is the dictionary of surnames.
00:18:26,00:18:28,It's written by a couple of professors.
00:18:28,00:18:31,And one of them said that the medieval surname Shakespeare
00:18:31,00:18:35,is probably an obscene name originally for a masturbator.
00:18:35,00:18:36,- No.
00:18:36,00:18:38,- Wow. - Really?
00:18:38,00:18:39,- He's a masturbator.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Hands off.
00:18:40,00:18:43,(audience laughing)
00:18:43,00:18:45,- I think it was pretty hands-on.
00:18:45,00:18:47,(audience laughing)
00:18:47,00:18:50,"- I was on ancestry.com, and ancestry.com"
00:18:50,00:18:52,has been listing surnames that have gone extinct.
00:18:52,00:18:55,"So obviously the ones that like stand upright,"
00:18:55,00:18:57,I believe will have been extinct.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"So ones that have recently gone extinct include ships,"
00:19:00,00:19:04,"temples, rummage, Sothec."
00:19:04,00:19:08,So those they've seen that there are virtually no new members
00:19:08,00:19:10,who are being born with the surname.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"And on the endangered list,"
00:19:11,00:19:15,and what counts as an endangered surname is so rare
00:19:15,00:19:17,that less than 50 people in England and Wales have them.
00:19:17,00:19:19,So this is for England and Wales.
00:19:19,00:19:23,"Included on the list is Marin, as in Helen Marin,"
00:19:23,00:19:27,"Nike, as in Bill Nike, and Bonneville,"
00:19:27,00:19:30,"as in Hugh Bonneville, all three leading actors."
00:19:30,00:19:32,- The endangered species basically.
00:19:32,00:19:33,- Yeah.
00:19:33,00:19:35,"- It's all of our solemn duty tonight,"
00:19:35,00:19:39,"if we can, to mate with Helen Marin, Bill Nye,"
00:19:39,00:19:42,"or Hugh Bonneville, depending on your preference."
00:19:42,00:19:44,- Or more than he cares.
00:19:44,00:19:46,(laughing)
00:19:46,00:19:50,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:19:50,00:19:51,and that is my fact.
00:19:51,00:19:55,My fact this week is that the man who invented
00:19:55,00:20:00,"the Australian Labradoodle deeply, deeply regrets it."
00:20:00,00:20:02,(laughing)
00:20:02,00:20:07,He is so sorry that he did that to all of us.
00:20:07,00:20:11,This is a guy called Wally Conran.
00:20:11,00:20:15,"Wally Conran, who's now approaching his 90s."
00:20:15,00:20:18,He was the first person in a mass sense
00:20:18,00:20:21,and is credited with creating the trend
00:20:21,00:20:23,which started in the '80s of the cross between
00:20:23,00:20:26,the Labradoodle and a poodle.
00:20:26,00:20:29,And what he hates is it kind of took off
00:20:29,00:20:30,"and it became a celebrity dog,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"and Jennifer Aniston has one,"
00:20:32,00:20:35,"and crown princes around the world have them,"
00:20:35,00:20:37,and it became such a fashionable dog.
00:20:37,00:20:39,"But to get the specific dog,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,"there's a lot of breeding that needs to happen,"
00:20:41,00:20:44,and he thinks he's created the Frankenstein
00:20:44,00:20:46,that has set off all these people
00:20:46,00:20:49,experimenting with different breeds and so on
00:20:49,00:20:50,for design or dog.
00:20:50,00:20:53,"So yeah, he's very sorry, he asked me to say he's very sorry."
00:20:53,00:20:54,(laughing)
00:20:54,00:20:55,"- I thought the reason that he,"
00:20:55,00:20:58,one of the reasons that he was sorry was because
00:20:58,00:21:00,the whole reason the Labradoodle came to be
00:21:00,00:21:04,was because he was asked to create a guy dog
00:21:04,00:21:07,for a woman whose husband had a dog allergy.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"And so by merging those two, that anti-allergenic,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,so you're not allergic to them.
00:21:12,00:21:15,I thought one of the reasons that he didn't like
00:21:15,00:21:17,the Labradoodle is that it's advertised
00:21:17,00:21:19,as a hyperallergenic dog.
00:21:19,00:21:21,"And yet, a lot of people now breed them"
00:21:21,00:21:24,without actually testing whether or not they are.
00:21:24,00:21:26,So I think quite a small percentage of them now
00:21:26,00:21:28,"are nonallergenic, but."
00:21:28,00:21:30,- But he is definitely against all of this
00:21:30,00:21:32,"kind of crossbreeding, I'm pretty sure."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"Yeah, he said, I just heard about someone"
00:21:34,00:21:37,"who wants to cross a poodle with a rot wiler,"
00:21:37,00:21:38,but that is a thing.
00:21:38,00:21:39,- That's correct.
00:21:39,00:21:40,"- Yeah, it's called a rottle."
00:21:40,00:21:42,Also called a roti poo.
00:21:42,00:21:45,A roti doodle or a rot wiler poo.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"- Yeah, oh."
00:21:46,00:21:48,"- But a rot wiler poo sounds like,"
00:21:48,00:21:49,"that's a, yeah."
00:21:49,00:21:50,- Yeah.
00:21:50,00:21:52,"- Yeah, you can get a coca poo."
00:21:52,00:21:55,That's a cross between a coca spaniel and a poodle.
00:21:55,00:21:57,"A she poo, which is a shitsoo and a poodle."
00:21:57,00:22:01,"- Yeah, a beach poo, which is a beach on freeze and a poodle."
00:22:01,00:22:03,"A peek a poo, which is a peeking ease and a poodle."
00:22:03,00:22:05,"- No, stop it."
00:22:05,00:22:06,"- I mean, it does sound like they do it"
00:22:06,00:22:07,"just for their names, doesn't it?"
00:22:07,00:22:08,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:22:08,00:22:11,- There's a schnailser scotty cross called a schnotty.
00:22:11,00:22:12,(audience laughs)
00:22:12,00:22:13,"- Yeah. - It's one of the fun cross,"
00:22:13,00:22:17,"which is a crossbreeding a shitsoo and a jack russle,"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"which has two names, but one of them is the jack shit."
00:22:21,00:22:23,(audience laughs)
00:22:23,00:22:25,"- Have you guys, there are some other dogs that went extinct"
00:22:25,00:22:27,or dogs we don't have anymore.
00:22:27,00:22:28,- Yeah.
00:22:28,00:22:29,- So have you heard of the salish wool dog?
00:22:29,00:22:30,- No.
00:22:30,00:22:32,- The wool dog was a dog you could shear
00:22:32,00:22:34,and then you would wear their coat as your coat.
00:22:34,00:22:37,It was a dog that was big and fluffy enough
00:22:37,00:22:39,that you could keep on sharing it.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- Could you not do that with any dog?
00:22:40,00:22:41,No.
00:22:41,00:22:42,- I don't know.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"- You could have a go, couldn't you?"
00:22:44,00:22:45,Might as well try.
00:22:45,00:22:47,(audience laughs)
00:22:47,00:22:51,- But you know why poodles have those stupid cuts of hair
00:22:51,00:22:52,that they have?
00:22:52,00:22:54,"Well, there's a proper reason behind it."
00:22:54,00:22:55,And that is because they're originally
00:22:55,00:22:58,to collect stuff from water.
00:22:58,00:23:00,And if they had this kind of really bushy hair
00:23:00,00:23:03,and they would just get wet and they'd get heavy.
00:23:03,00:23:06,"- So, but like, is it hunting, use?"
00:23:06,00:23:09,"- It was collecting quarry, so you've been hunting"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"and then the water says it's a duck, it's in the water."
00:23:11,00:23:13,And then the poodle would go in and get it.
00:23:13,00:23:16,"And the idea was, so they wanted to have"
00:23:16,00:23:18,"as little hair as possible, but it still needed hair"
00:23:18,00:23:21,to keep it in turn Logan's warm.
00:23:21,00:23:23,So that's why it kept it round there.
00:23:23,00:23:25,It still needed it to keep the joints warm
00:23:25,00:23:28,"to stop arthritis, so it still needed it round there."
00:23:28,00:23:30,And the top nut was to keep the long hair out of its eyes
00:23:30,00:23:31,when it was swimming.
00:23:31,00:23:33,(audience laughs)
00:23:33,00:23:34,"- And that's it, it's a water dog."
00:23:34,00:23:38,"So the word poodle comes from the old German poodle,"
00:23:38,00:23:39,"doesn't it, for puddle?"
00:23:39,00:23:42,Because it was best at going into water
00:23:42,00:23:44,and getting ducks out of it.
00:23:44,00:23:46,But do you know the best thing about a poodle these days
00:23:46,00:23:49,when they're often shown in dog shows
00:23:49,00:23:50,is the thing that you're striving for
00:23:50,00:23:52,is for them to be square.
00:23:52,00:23:56,So I didn't squareness is the thing you strive for most
00:23:56,00:23:57,above all things.
00:23:57,00:24:02,So the Westminster Kennel show allows two styles of poodle.
00:24:02,00:24:03,It's not too many.
00:24:03,00:24:05,"They have continental and English, like breakfasts."
00:24:05,00:24:07,And...
00:24:07,00:24:09,- And the English one is a much grezier dog.
00:24:09,00:24:12,(audience laughs)
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- Yeah, but who's going to pay that much for a continental?"
00:24:14,00:24:15,"- Yeah, true."
00:24:15,00:24:16,The continental is a journey over.
00:24:16,00:24:17,- It's so overpriced.
00:24:17,00:24:18,(audience laughs)
00:24:18,00:24:20,"- But the other, there are two styles of poodles"
00:24:20,00:24:22,that are allowed at these dog competitions
00:24:22,00:24:24,and they're judged on squareness.
00:24:24,00:24:25,And they're properly square.
00:24:25,00:24:26,The area from their breast to their bottom
00:24:26,00:24:28,has to be the same as the area from their shoulder
00:24:28,00:24:30,to the ground.
00:24:30,00:24:32,And it's very precise.
00:24:32,00:24:34,"So in shows where poodles are being shown,"
00:24:34,00:24:37,they have to be really groomed very well.
00:24:37,00:24:41,"And groomers work with only the finest scissors, apparently."
00:24:41,00:24:44,And the best poodle scissors are made in Japan.
00:24:44,00:24:46,And they cost more than $600.
00:24:46,00:24:47,- Done.
00:24:47,00:24:49,- It sounds like you're sellerized scissors.
00:24:49,00:24:50,- Yeah.
00:24:50,00:24:56,"- My dad has, he's a hairdresser and so is my mom."
00:24:56,00:25:01,"And he bought when he was young, a pair of scissors,"
00:25:01,00:25:05,scissors that were forged in the fires of a seller.
00:25:05,00:25:08,(audience laughs)
00:25:08,00:25:10,- They are samurai scissors.
00:25:10,00:25:11,They were made by samurai.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"- And you set that on the show,"
00:25:13,00:25:14,and we really did not believe you.
00:25:14,00:25:15,- Yeah.
00:25:15,00:25:16,- And then I showed you the article
00:25:16,00:25:17,where he was in the newspaper.
00:25:17,00:25:18,It's true.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"I mean, it's still him going samurai scissors,"
00:25:20,00:25:24,but they're so sharp because they're made by the samurai.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"That when you're a hairdresser and you have your scissors,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,you need to get them sharpened every two or three years.
00:25:28,00:25:29,You go and do it.
00:25:29,00:25:31,My dad takes them every two or three years
00:25:31,00:25:32,"and they say to him,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,"""There is nothing we can do for you."""
00:25:33,00:25:36,They are as sharp as the day you bought them.
00:25:36,00:25:38,Samarized.
00:25:38,00:25:39,(audience laughs)
00:25:39,00:25:40,- Wow.
00:25:40,00:25:45,- I've got a fact about dog mentality assessments.
00:25:45,00:25:46,If anyone's up for that.
00:25:46,00:25:47,"- Yes, please."
00:25:47,00:25:50,"- It's, sorry, dog mentality assessments in Sweden."
00:25:50,00:25:51,"- Oh, no, no."
00:25:51,00:25:52,(audience laughs)
00:25:52,00:25:55,- So there's a Swedish association which has to assess
00:25:55,00:25:57,how relaxed and calm a dog is.
00:25:57,00:26:00,And it uses this thing called the dog mentality assessment.
00:26:00,00:26:03,"And what it is, it's basically a haunted house for dogs."
00:26:03,00:26:06,So they make a dog walk along a long path in some woods.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"And then as it walks along,"
00:26:08,00:26:11,"they suddenly, they play a gunshot sound."
00:26:11,00:26:12,They play the sound of a metal chain
00:26:12,00:26:14,being creepily dragged along.
00:26:14,00:26:17,And then suddenly a ghost appears.
00:26:17,00:26:18,- What?
00:26:18,00:26:19,- Is it a dog ghost?
00:26:19,00:26:20,- It's a human ghost.
00:26:20,00:26:23,It's a person coming in a sheet with a plastic bucket on there.
00:26:23,00:26:25,(audience laughs)
00:26:25,00:26:29,And they test how calm or aggressive the dog is.
00:26:29,00:26:30,"- Right, so are they doing this"
00:26:30,00:26:32,because it's like a seeing dog like a...
00:26:32,00:26:33,- I think they're doing this
00:26:33,00:26:35,'cause they have time on their hands.
00:26:35,00:26:38,- Like if it was like a blind person.
00:26:38,00:26:39,- I think it might be to assess it in that kind of
00:26:39,00:26:42,"in working dogs, the aggressiveness, yeah."
00:26:42,00:26:43,- Right.
00:26:43,00:26:44,"- Wow, that's exciting."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"- I have a couple of things on,"
00:26:46,00:26:50,so the main headline fact is the inventor regretting
00:26:50,00:26:51,his invention.
00:26:51,00:26:55,I found a few other people who've regretted their inventions.
00:26:55,00:26:59,"So Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,"he really regrets, you know, originally,"
00:27:01,00:27:05,"when we all had to put in a web address, HTTP and so on,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,he regrets the two forward slashes that you do.
00:27:08,00:27:09,- Because...
00:27:09,00:27:10,- That's the best bit.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"- Well, I agree, James."
00:27:12,00:27:13,I had great fun.
00:27:13,00:27:14,I wish there were more.
00:27:14,00:27:15,But...
00:27:15,00:27:16,(audience laughs)
00:27:16,00:27:18,"- I sense those put an extra one in, just for fun."
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Exactly.
00:27:19,00:27:22,- Hour's a fun.
00:27:22,00:27:25,"And so the two forward slashes on it,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,"which is completely useless, didn't need to be there."
00:27:28,00:27:30,"He just put them in because like James and I,"
00:27:30,00:27:31,he loves a good forward slash.
00:27:31,00:27:32,And...
00:27:32,00:27:33,(audience laughs)
00:27:33,00:27:37,"And they had no purpose at all, and he regrets that."
00:27:37,00:27:39,"He's publicly spoken and said,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"""I'm very sorry, I didn't mean to do that."""
00:27:41,00:27:42,- Okay.
00:27:42,00:27:45,"- Yeah, I think people thought they did code at the time."
00:27:45,00:27:48,"I mean, they did serve purpose in certain code, didn't they?"
00:27:48,00:27:50,And so he assumed they were useful.
00:27:50,00:27:51,- Yes.
00:27:51,00:27:53,"- But then it turned out later that they weren't,"
00:27:53,00:27:57,and he said the countless hours of human labor
00:27:57,00:27:59,and time spent typing those two key strokes.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"- Oh, what, what will we have done with the time?"
00:28:01,00:28:03,- I could have watched the wire.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- Okay, yeah."
00:28:04,00:28:06,- I'll never watch the wire because it didn't burn as late.
00:28:06,00:28:11,"- Hey, we need to move on to our final fact soon."
00:28:11,00:28:13,Guys got anything before we do?
00:28:13,00:28:16,- The queen is very responsible for dog crossbreeds.
00:28:16,00:28:17,- Is she?
00:28:17,00:28:19,- Our queen and yours guys.
00:28:19,00:28:20,(audience laughs)
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Don't forget.
00:28:21,00:28:23,- Hers was one of the first crossbreeds
00:28:23,00:28:27,as the BBC put it to infiltrate the Kennel Club
00:28:27,00:28:29,because she bred daxans with corgis
00:28:29,00:28:33,and she insisted on her doggy being in the portrait
00:28:33,00:28:37,that she had done with her in the 1970s in 1975.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"And quite sweetly, the secretary of the Kennel Club"
00:28:40,00:28:43,"at the time that judges all of these things said that,"
00:28:43,00:28:47,"look, the daxan was evolved to chase badgers down holes"
00:28:47,00:28:49,and corgis were evolved to round up cattle.
00:28:49,00:28:52,"So if anyone loses a herd of cattle down a badger hole,"
00:28:52,00:28:53,these are just the dogs to get them.
00:28:53,00:28:56,(audience laughs)
00:28:57,00:29:01,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:29:01,00:29:02,and that is Andy.
00:29:02,00:29:06,"- My fact has a content warning, this bit's rude."
00:29:06,00:29:07,- Okay cool.
00:29:07,00:29:08,- Unlike that lobster bit we did earlier.
00:29:08,00:29:09,- Oh yeah.
00:29:09,00:29:10,(audience laughs)
00:29:10,00:29:15,- So my fact is that the word shit faced originally meant
00:29:15,00:29:17,having a very small face.
00:29:17,00:29:20,(audience laughs)
00:29:20,00:29:23,"So if you said I was absolutely shit faced last night,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,it just means all your features bunched up
00:29:25,00:29:26,right in the middle.
00:29:26,00:29:29,- It's because it comes from the word shit.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"You hear that, it's very old fashioned saying"
00:29:31,00:29:33,you hear it said sometimes a mere shit of a lot.
00:29:33,00:29:35,- Or like a chitty is a little receipt or something.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"- Exactly, yeah, it just means it's like a small thing."
00:29:37,00:29:40,So the first usage that I've been able to find
00:29:40,00:29:44,is 1622 where there's a child described as a peaking
00:29:44,00:29:45,shit faced page.
00:29:45,00:29:48,(audience laughs)
00:29:48,00:29:49,Just means small face.
00:29:49,00:29:50,(audience laughs)
00:29:50,00:29:52,"- I think we should bring it back, don't you?"
00:29:52,00:29:53,"- Yes, I do."
00:29:53,00:29:55,"- There are loads of words for being drunk,"
00:29:55,00:29:57,but there were very few for having a small face.
00:29:57,00:29:59,(audience laughs)
00:29:59,00:30:01,"- Imagine if the band, the small faces,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,had originally called themselves the shit faces.
00:30:03,00:30:05,(audience laughs)
00:30:05,00:30:08,"- So this is the weird thing, but last night,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,"Andy said to all of us, who do you think"
00:30:10,00:30:11,has the smallest face?
00:30:11,00:30:13,"I've all of us for, and I don't know what we were doing"
00:30:13,00:30:14,this for.
00:30:14,00:30:15,- Is that what you were doing?
00:30:15,00:30:17,"- It's not what, it's not consciously why I asked."
00:30:17,00:30:19,"- Because you were called pinhead at school, aren't you?"
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Yeah.
00:30:20,00:30:22,(audience laughs)
00:30:22,00:30:25,"- But as I pointed out, pins famously have very large"
00:30:25,00:30:26,heads relative to their body.
00:30:26,00:30:28,(audience laughs)
00:30:28,00:30:30,"So let me tell you, the drunk was on those guys."
00:30:30,00:30:33,(audience laughs)
00:30:33,00:30:36,Nice one shit face.
00:30:36,00:30:39,(audience laughs)
00:30:39,00:30:44,"I was looking up other false shit words, basically."
00:30:44,00:30:47,"So there's the word shittle, which means inconstant."
00:30:47,00:30:50,"So like a shuttle, it means back and forward,"
00:30:50,00:30:51,the word shittle.
00:30:51,00:30:54,So you used to play badminton with a shittle cock.
00:30:54,00:30:55,- No way.
00:30:55,00:30:56,- Yeah.
00:30:56,00:30:57,- No way.
00:30:57,00:31:00,"- Wait, shite poke, shite poke, yes."
00:31:00,00:31:02,"Sorry, I just don't like you."
00:31:02,00:31:02,- I'm sorry.
00:31:02,00:31:03,(audience laughs)
00:31:03,00:31:06,"- Now, shite poke was an old word for a heron."
00:31:06,00:31:07,- Wow.
00:31:07,00:31:09,- And the reason was because people thought that herons
00:31:09,00:31:11,defecated when taking flight.
00:31:11,00:31:14,"- We say do sometimes, or not all the time."
00:31:14,00:31:15,Yeah.
00:31:15,00:31:17,"- There was a guy in the 19th century who wrote,"
00:31:17,00:31:20,"the dictionary of West Somerset in 1875,"
00:31:20,00:31:25,and he said that the 29th of May is shit sack day.
00:31:25,00:31:28,"And he writes this, the writer of the dictionary says,"
00:31:28,00:31:30,"in the northwest of Somerset and North Devon,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"it is common to hear boys call out on that day,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,"shit sack, shit sack, but I have been unable"
00:31:35,00:31:36,to discover the origin.
00:31:36,00:31:39,(audience laughs)
00:31:39,00:31:41,It feels to me like he's not heard them saying it
00:31:41,00:31:42,to him on the other day.
00:31:42,00:31:43,- Yes.
00:31:43,00:31:44,(audience laughs)
00:31:44,00:31:46,- There's a three volume dictionary of slang
00:31:46,00:31:48,"called Jonathan Greene's,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,Jonathan Greene is the guy who wrote it.
00:31:50,00:31:50,He's a genius.
00:31:50,00:31:54,But I looked up peculiarly Australian shit slang words.
00:31:54,00:31:57,"So I don't know how familiar these might be,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,everyone knows them.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"So for example, I'm so hungry,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"I could eat a shit sandwich, only I don't like bread."
00:32:03,00:32:06,(audience laughs)
00:32:06,00:32:07,"There's to take the shit with the sugar,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,which is to accept that one must have
00:32:09,00:32:11,both bad and good experiences in life.
00:32:11,00:32:13,And my favorite is you don't know
00:32:13,00:32:15,whether you want a shit or a haircut.
00:32:15,00:32:18,(audience laughs)
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Which is, you're stupid, that's what that means."
00:32:20,00:32:23,(audience laughs)
00:32:23,00:32:25,- I think it's possible to want both of those things.
00:32:25,00:32:27,(audience laughs)
00:32:27,00:32:30,"- The word shit though, has a long history,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,"doesn't it, in a long etymological history."
00:32:32,00:32:36,"So it comes from ""skay"" which meant to cut."
00:32:36,00:32:40,And so it's the same origin as words like science
00:32:40,00:32:42,and schedule and shield.
00:32:42,00:32:45,"And it was spelled ""shite"" until the 1700s."
00:32:45,00:32:50,But they used to kind of broaden their shit base vocabulary.
00:32:50,00:32:53,"So in Old English, ""skite"" was direer"
00:32:53,00:32:57,"and ""besketan"" was one word that meant to cover with excrement."
00:32:57,00:32:59,"And also in 18th century,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"according to the Partridge Dictionary of Slang,"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"to shit through your teeth was to vomit,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,which does make a lot of sense.
00:33:07,00:33:08,(audience laughs)
00:33:08,00:33:10,The example that's given in this dictionary
00:33:10,00:33:13,"is ""Egy Harky Friend,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,"""have you got a padlock on your ass"
00:33:15,00:33:17,"""that you shite through your teeth?"""
00:33:17,00:33:18,(audience laughs)
00:33:18,00:33:19,"- Wow, wow."
00:33:19,00:33:23,"I have some swear words which are not a tall rude,"
00:33:23,00:33:24,but they are awesome.
00:33:24,00:33:27,These are incredibly rude in the languages that they are in.
00:33:27,00:33:29,"Okay, so for example."
00:33:29,00:33:31,- So we're gonna alienate not just the English-speaking world
00:33:31,00:33:32,of this podcast.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"- Yeah, the Swedish, the Romanians and the Japanese"
00:33:35,00:33:38,have better buckle up when they're listening to this.
00:33:38,00:33:42,"So in Sweden, you can say,"
00:33:42,00:33:44,"go and put an old blanket over yourself,"
00:33:44,00:33:46,which is really rude to them.
00:33:46,00:33:47,- In Sweden.
00:33:47,00:33:47,"- Yeah, in Sweden."
00:33:47,00:33:48,- But that's what that guy who is pretending
00:33:48,00:33:50,to be a ghost was doing.
00:33:50,00:33:52,(audience laughs)
00:33:52,00:33:54,"- So in Japan, you can say,"
00:33:54,00:33:58,"""Tofu no kado ni atama wo butsu kete shine,"""
00:33:58,00:34:01,or hit your head on a corner of tofu and die.
00:34:01,00:34:04,(audience laughs)
00:34:04,00:34:10,"In Romanian, there's a phrase which means,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,I can't believe this is true.
00:34:11,00:34:13,"It means, ""I would dry my dirty pants"
00:34:13,00:34:15,"on your mum's crucifix."""
00:34:15,00:34:17,(audience laughs)
00:34:17,00:34:21,That one's quite rude in English as well.
00:34:21,00:34:23,(audience laughs)
00:34:23,00:34:26,"- Can I just, in Romanian, I read an article on Vice,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,which had a Romanian person writing in
00:34:28,00:34:30,"about swearing in Romania,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"and they said, ""Swearing culture in Romania"
00:34:32,00:34:36,"is built on oral sex, mothers, and Christ."""
00:34:36,00:34:37,(audience laughs)
00:34:37,00:34:39,- That's very much the trifecta of things
00:34:39,00:34:40,not to say in Romania.
00:34:40,00:34:43,(audience laughs)
00:34:43,00:34:48,"Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts."
00:34:48,00:34:50,Thank you so much for listening.
00:34:50,00:34:52,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us
