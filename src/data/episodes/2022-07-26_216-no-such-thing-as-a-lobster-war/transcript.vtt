WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 (bells ringing)

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.200
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.800
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:22.480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.320
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish," a weekly podcast.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.280
 This week, coming to you live

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.400
 from Perth, Australia.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.400
 (audience cheering)

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.240
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.920
 Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.800
 and in no particular order,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.440
 here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.320
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that in the 1960s,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.000
 Brazil and France almost went to war with each other

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.960
 over whether lobster's crawl or swim.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.120
 (audience laughing)

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.000
 - What a just war it would have been.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 (audience laughing)

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.360
 - Who side are you on?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.880
 - Who side are you on?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.840
 - I think they crawl.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.080
 - I think they swim.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.920
 - Yeah.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.960
 - I will see you on the battlefield.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.760
 (audience laughing)

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.600
 - Okay.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.880
 - Are you seeing me do both, right?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.720
 - Yeah.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.600
 - The classic sweatsiland in the corner.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 (audience laughing)

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 - No, so it is a problem that they do both,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 'cause this is the fact that in 1961,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.560
 a French fisherman found the water of the coast of Brazil

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.360
 was full of lobsters, and they wanted to fish them,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.440
 so they could get money from selling the lobsters,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.280
 and so they side-fishing them,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.760
 but Brazil claimed exclusive rights to sea creatures

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.400
 that were walking along the continental shelf

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.600
 within a certain, like, diameter radius of Brazil.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.840
 So if creatures were walking in that area,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.360
 then Brazil had a right to them and no one else did,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120
 but if they were swimming in that area,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.000
 then they did not, and so this huge argument came forward

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 about whether they were walking or swimming,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.840
 and the French said that they were swimming,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.320
 so they were open to anyone, 'cause lobsters do sometimes swim,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.560
 and so they said, "We're allowed to fish for these lobsters."

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.480
 Brazilians said they crawled.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.880
 There was actually, I think there was a moment

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.200
 where the Brazilian admiral of the Brazilian navy

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.400
 said that, "If you're saying that lobsters swim,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.160
 "you're also saying that a kangaroo

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.720
 "would be considered a bird when it hops."

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.800
 (audience laughs)

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.440
 That is fighting talk.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.960
 (audience laughs)

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.080
 But it really came to blows.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.920
 So there was this huge debate,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.000
 and eventually Brazil said, "France, can you please go away?"

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.760
 These things are crawling, and France refused,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.800
 and had a destroyer ship accompany their lobster boats,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.080
 a warship, and in response, Brazil mobilized its warships,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.040
 including an aircraft carrier.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.280
 (audience laughs)

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.200
 And then both of these sides are ready for battle,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.600
 and this lasted for two years.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.560
 They were sitting there with the battleships,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.480
 poised, ready to fight each other

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.120
 over where the lobsters crawled or swim,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 and then eventually some laws of the sea were put into force,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.760
 saying, "Look, guys, chill the fuck out."

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.440
 (audience laughs)

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.360
 - It was the official wording on the law.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.200
 - It was, yeah.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.600
 And, yeah, war didn't happen,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.400
 and rights were granted to Brazil,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.280
 'cause of a fishing act, and it was okay,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.240
 but we were pretty close, guys.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.080
 - Wow.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.920
 - Yeah.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.040
 - It seems to me that countries are always going

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.760
 to war over fish.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.640
 Other things living in the sea.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.720
 So there's been a turbot war between Canada and Spain,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.160
 a crab war between North and South Korea.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.240
 There was an oyster war between Maryland and the state

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.960
 versus pirates.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.800
 - Cool.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.280
 - There was a macro war between UK and Iceland,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.120
 a prom war between India and Sri Lanka,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.760
 a squid war between the UK and Argentina,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.400
 a scallop conflict between the UK and France.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.160
 (audience laughs)

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.080
 - A catfish dispute between the US and Vietnam,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.320
 and a sprat spat between Latvia and Russia.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.000
 - Wow.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 - That's amazing.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.960
 - God, fish are real trouble makers, aren't they?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.000
 (audience laughs)

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.280
 And so, on lobsters, which I believe this was about,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.000
 so the Caribbean, so the thing that this was originally about,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.800
 it was a Caribbean spiny lobster,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.640
 which was a kind of rock lobster,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.240
 but this is a kind of lobster that cues.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.640
 So a very British brand of lobster,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.440
 but when they migrate, they form orderly single-file cues.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.080
 So they migrate seasonally because they want to get away

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.440
 from cold water.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.320
 And these, you know, these are the most precious lobsters

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.560
 on that coastline.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.440
 And yeah, they cling to each other and form an orderly cue

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.960
 and move single-file, each rest is antennae

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.960
 over the sort of arse of the lobster in front.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.800
 - Oh.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.320
 - And they move like a conga.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.160
 - That's so exciting.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160
 - It's a lobster conga.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.800
 - Yeah, I read that in North America,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.840
 back when the European settlers first went there

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.760
 for the first time, there was so much lobster in the water

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.120
 that they would wash up onto the shore in piles two feet high.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.960
 - Wow.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.960
 - Like a tiny tsunami of lobster, tiny and delicious.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.240
 I've got a fact about putting lobsters into the sea,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.880
 which is a thing that sometimes people do.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.400
 So this was in Britain in 2017.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.200
 Two Buddhists were fined 15,000 pounds

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.920
 for releasing 700 live lobsters and crabs

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.560
 into the sea of Brighton.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.560
 And they did it as a life-release ceremony,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.640
 which is the thing you might want to do if you're a Buddhist.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.320
 And unfortunately, they weren't native

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.960
 and they had the potential to destroy ecosystems.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.920
 And the government had to try and catch them again.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.720
 Only 323 were recovered.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.640
 There are still about 400 out there.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.480
 Yeah.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.000
 - This is a real problem though.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.400
 This is happening in Australia as well,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.960
 genuinely, and in America.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.800
 So it is the Fangsheng ceremony.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.960
 There's a Buddhist ceremony, which is about returning

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.680
 life to where it's meant to be.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.120
 But it's always returning non-native creatures.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.960
 (audience laughing)

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.800
 - Oh wow.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.560
 - And they always wipe out local ecosystems.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.360
 And yeah, so it's happens with lobsters

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.160
 in Australia and in China, America.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.920
 - Do Buddhists have like the equivalent

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.360
 of a confession booth that they go into?

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.200
 (audience laughing)

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.280
 Forgive me, monk father, I don't know what it would be.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.120
 - Lama.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.440
 - Forgive me, Lama.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.920
 I've seen, I tried to save a life, but I've destroyed

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.920
 an entire ecosystem.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.320
 (audience laughing)

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.000
 That's 12 reincarnations that you've been deducted.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.920
 (audience laughing)

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.760
 - That's how it works.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.760
 - You know, Peter, the people for the ethical

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.120
 treatment of animals, we've discussed them a few times.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.800
 And they kind of suggest that people might wanna do

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 this thing as well, which they call lobster liberation.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.920
 And they have posters, they put posters up saying,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.240
 "Been boiled hurts, lobster liberation."

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.200
 But unfortunately, the lobster in their picture

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.240
 is bright red, which means it's already been cooked.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.080
 - Oh no.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.480
 (audience laughing)

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.360
 - Lobsters do have a very, very tough time.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.120
 So whenever they malt, they have to,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.280
 obviously they have to get rid of their old shell

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.360
 to grow larger.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.000
 But they have to lose half their claw weight,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.720
 'cause otherwise the claw is too big

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.080
 to fit out of the old shell.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.960
 And the claw muscles are so massive,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.080
 'cause obviously that's what lobsters are like.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.400
 They have to rip, they've got very slim wrists.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.440
 So they have to rip the claw.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.640
 Basically, when they try to malt,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.720
 they have to rip out the lining of their throat,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.720
 their stomach, and their anus.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.080
 Which is, I think that's the trifexer

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.320
 of things you don't wanna rip out.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.160
 - Yes.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
 (audience laughing)

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.760
 - What is the least classy use of the word trifector?

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.800
 (audience laughing)

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.640
 - Yeah.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.480
 - But they are, they're weird, aren't they?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.800
 I was reading on national geographic.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.400
 So, okay, their brain is located in their throat,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.120
 their nervous system, in their abdomen,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.720
 their teeth, in their stomach,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.480
 their kidneys, in their head.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.960
 They hear through their legs,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.520
 and they taste with their feet.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.040
 They're all over the shop.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.880
 (audience laughing)

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.560
 - So the bladder being very much in the head

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.000
 means that they urinate out of their faces.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.880
 And urinating is very important to lobsters,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.560
 and especially female lobsters, 'cause it's quite sexy.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.840
 So, the way that female lobsters

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.120
 seduce male lobsters is that they urinate out of their face

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.840
 into the male lobsters den.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.920
 - That is sexy.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.760
 (audience laughing)

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.680
 - Oh, you wouldn't want, imagine your letterbox

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.520
 in the morning.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.520
 (audience laughing)

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.960
 Oh, no, it's Valentine's Day.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.040
 (audience laughing)

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.720
 - Well, it's very attractive in some circles.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.400
 But yeah, the females urinate in the male dens

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.640
 until the male is attracted enough for the urine.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.080
 All things are really to get rid of this urine somehow.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.080
 So, he invites the female in.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.000
 And then, immediately, she gets naked.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.960
 So, as soon as she's been invited in,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.400
 she sheds all of her shell.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.120
 And also, I think this is really insulting.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.800
 The other thing that the female sheds

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.680
 once she gets into a lobsters den

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.400
 is the pouch where she had banked the sperm

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.840
 from the prior mate.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.200
 (audience laughing)

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.840
 - I'll just leave this by the door.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.640
 (audience laughing)

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.960
 - Can she put back her shell on?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.480
 - If he's not interested?

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.640
 - No. - No.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.640
 (audience laughing)

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.920
 - Well, you can't rip out the lining

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.240
 of your throat, stomach and anus.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.640
 And then say, I miss those.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.920
 (audience laughing)

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.200
 I've misread those sides.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.200
 I'll just get my pouches for them, maybe on my way.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.320
 - Hey, we need to move on to our next fact, surely.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.240
 - Oh, I think we should honestly give a shout out

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.440
 to the amazing lobsters, which are

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.720
 the largest freshwater invertebrates on earth,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.880
 which is the Tasmanian lobster.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.280
 And yeah, they're incredible.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.680
 So, they're the size of kind of a normal sized dog.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.520
 And they're extremely strong.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.240
 - And a dog's coming lots of different sizes.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.280
 (audience laughing)

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.880
 - That's one of the main things about dogs.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.400
 - They're like a coca-spaniel.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.120
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.320
 - They are extremely big.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.880
 They live to be 60 years old, at least.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.920
 And they can break human bones, so with their claws,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.680
 or they can crush beer bottles.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.280
 And they're just incredible.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.800
 And they can't breed until they're 14 years old.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.280
 - Come on. - What?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.920
 - Which we laugh at, but we're humans.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.600
 That's literally the same as humans.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.440
 But.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.800
 (audience laughing)

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.960
 - Breed.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.840
 - Yeah. - I had breathed.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.760
 (audience laughing)

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.920
 - I thought that when the lobster gets to 14,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.440
 it goes, "Goo."

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.280
 - Oh.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.280
 (audience laughing)

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.120
 - That's better.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.840
 - Fitting me, it does make that noise,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.600
 but it's a complete of a reason.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 (audience laughing)

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.000
 (upbeat music)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.720
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.560
 And that is James.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1350,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.520
 there was a man called Williams Stand Up Right.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.520
 (audience laughing)

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.920
 And he annoyed everyone else in his village

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.640
 so much that every single one of them moved away.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.480
 - Wow.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.480
 (audience laughing)

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.560
 - It really sounds awesome.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.000
 - Do we know anything about what he did?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.600
 - Well, so the thing is, this comes from the parish rolls

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.920
 in England, so it's where, if you're a historian,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.880
 it's a really good place to get all the really small things

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.520
 that happen in the villages.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.960
 And in this one, in particular, it says,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.680
 "The coroner testifies that Williams Stand Up Right

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.360
 "is so quarrelsome and rancorous

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.720
 "that none of the Lord's tenants

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.400
 "can bear to live in the village because of him,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.840
 "and he has caused the village to be deserted."

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.240
 (audience laughing)

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.800
 And then by 1356, so that's six years later,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.480
 he had also left the village.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.080
 (audience laughing)

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.240
 Presumably because he had no one left to argue with.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.720
 (audience laughing)

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.800
 - That's amazing.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.080
 And that's all we know about him.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.680
 Like, a lot of these things, these kind of parish things,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.360
 all you see is a very, very tiny snapshot of people's lives.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.200
 It's amazing. - Right.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.120
 - So, for instance, in 1328,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.120
 John Francy claimed two shillings in damages

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.840
 because Alice Devaney's had accused his wife

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.080
 of wearing her short jacket before Easter.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.480
 (audience laughing)

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480
 - Whoa.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.720
 - Shot to my mouth.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.600
 (audience laughing)

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.400
 In 1347, a man called Roger Sweatin' Bed

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.400
 (audience laughing)

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.160
 was accused of fornication with Latisha Bat.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.320
 (audience laughing)

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.160
 - Wow.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.000
 - Roger Sweatin' Bed.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.920
 - Sweatin' Bed, stand at right and shot in mouth.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.760
 Was that the third one?

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.920
 - No.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.560
 - This is no, it's so fun reading through these old records.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.160
 So there's actually a document called

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.120
 the Assize of Nucenses.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.720
 And I really recommend it.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.880
 It's what I wasted all of my research time doing

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.280
 for this show, but it's from 700 years ago.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.960
 And it's literally a list by,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.680
 from the whole of the UK of all the nuciances

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.000
 that are reported by neighbors.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.360
 And so I read through it.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.640
 And most of them, to be fair,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.400
 are about sewage leaking into other people's gardens.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.600
 So there were a lot of people.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.640
 - Maybe they were just flirting

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.000
 with the next old neighbor in a kind of lobster way.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.920
 (audience laughing)

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.520
 - It didn't sound super sexy in the right up.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.920
 So there was a woman who built her own personal toilet

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.960
 'cause she didn't like throwing her sewage out of the window,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.800
 which a lot of people did.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.880
 But the solids blocked her gutter

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.000
 and the neighbors that they were greatly inconvenienced

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.480
 by the stench.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.440
 So that was then, and there was one more, just in 1377.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.320
 Thomas and Alice Young complained,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.920
 the neighbor built a forge and they were making armor,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.200
 but the sledgehammer crashing

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.560
 of them making the armor disturbed them.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.400
 But worse than that,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.720
 the smoke penetrated their house, so it smelled really bad.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720
 And also they said,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.440
 "The blows of the hammer shake the walls of our house

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.920
 "so much that it spoils our wine."

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.760
 - Wow.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.080
 (audience laughing)

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.520
 - That is unpleasant, actually,

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.560
 tough to live with that.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.480
 (audience laughing)

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.880
 - I've got a fact about kind of celebrity neighbor disputes

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.720
 'cause this does happen.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.600
 So for example, in Manhattan in the early 1970s,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.880
 John Cage, famous composer,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.520
 he lived next door to John Lennon

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320
 and he had to go round to complain about the noise.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.160
 - Well, can I just say,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.120
 John Cage is most famous for writing that song

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.280
 which is complete silence.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.120
 - Exactly.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.960
 - All right.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.840
 - It's like the idea of John Lennon

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.360
 going background and complaining anytime he likes.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.800
 - Can you please stop playing four minutes

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.040
 and 33 seconds?

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.200
 (audience laughing)

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.400
 - I saw another, this is just very, to me,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.680
 this is very British about noisy neighbors

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.440
 in Crystal Palace in London,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.200
 which is where I live.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.760
 This family discovered in their basement

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.720
 an unexploded World War II bomb

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.640
 and they found it in the evening,

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.320
 but they didn't call the police

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.240
 because they didn't wanna wake the neighbors overnight.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.440
 (audience laughing)

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.280
 And so patiently guarded the bomb.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.640
 - How loudly do they talk on the phone?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.840
 - They just didn't want everyone to be evacuated

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.680
 because they might be blown up by a World War II bomb.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.680
 - To be honest, if the World War II bomb has lasted 60 full years,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.600
 it's probably gonna be okay for an extra 12 hours.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.800
 - That was their logic.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.640
 - It's so...

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.360
 - If it had one of those timers counting down

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.480
 from 60 years ago.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.000
 (audience laughing)

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.880
 - We've overset this one, but one day.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.640
 (audience laughing)

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.160
 - But there is, there are often sort of surveys done

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.200
 about the items that people find most annoying in neighbors

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.280
 and they include hot tubs annoying

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.840
 'cause they, people are making a lot of noise

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.920
 and hot tubs when they're in them.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.160
 Barbecues, automatic soda lights, trampolines

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.360
 are a very common cause of complaint.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.640
 And I like this in the Guardian newspaper

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.040
 who commented that trampolines are complained about

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.680
 because they allow the neighbor's children

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.080
 to spy on you on an intermittent basis.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.080
 (audience laughing)

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.320
 Very annoying.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.960
 - I was just looking at some stupid names

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.960
 because of this guy called William Standup, right.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.560
 I found a website which had every single name

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.600
 that's mentioned in the Doomsday book.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.800
 And I spent most of my time reading that, to be honest.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.120
 In the Doomsday book, there are four people called Abba,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.800
 12 people called Alfred the Butler.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.120
 - Wow.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.160
 - Two called ape, one called Bono,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.280
 one fish, two gods and a snot.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.440
 (audience laughing)

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.360
 And there is one person called Anna,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.200
 who was a man living in Puckle Church in Gloucestershire.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.240
 - No relation.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.520
 (audience laughing)

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.040
 - My past is not supposed to be delved into it.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.320
 That was in my contract.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.440
 - There were no dans, no andes.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.080
 And there was one James who lived in Cockfield in Suffolk.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.240
 - Really? - Wow.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.400
 - He actually is a relation.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.320
 (audience laughing)

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.920
 - I looked up a few names too.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.560
 So I found that in the last decade,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.840
 several dozen people have named their daughters unique.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.840
 (audience laughing)

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.520
 And I also looked up some medieval ones as well.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.680
 And just on the origins of root words,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.200
 there's in the middle ages,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.400
 the early uses of the F word, the word fuck,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.680
 meant to hit something.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.200
 So there is a man in 1290 whose name was Simon Fuckbutter.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.440
 (audience laughing)

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.960
 He probably worked in Terry.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.960
 (audience laughing)

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.120
 There's actually, there's a really cool Twitter account,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.960
 which is called Name Curator, at Name Curator.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.040
 And it's an account run by an Australian called Ben Osborne.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.760
 And Ben Osborne just puts just his favorite names that he's found.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.680
 So a couple that have gone up on the site,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.440
 these are all real people.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.480
 Dick Passwater is one guy who was a NASCAR driver in the '50s.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.640
 So Dick Passwater and my favorite, a guy called Hans.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.120
 Hans Off.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.280
 (audience laughing)

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.280
 And he's a former submarine official.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.880
 - What was he called, Dick Passwater?

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.240
 - Yeah, Dick. - And he was a NASCAR driver

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.960
 because he was also another NASCAR driver at the same time,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.680
 or maybe the following decade called Dick Trickle.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.800
 - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.760
 - And he's one of my favorite people because Dick Trickle,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.520
 he was an amazing motor racing driver,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.200
 but he liked to smoke.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.520
 And they changed the rules and said,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.760
 "You weren't allowed to smoke anymore

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.880
 "because you had to wear helmets

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.640
 "and you couldn't smoke while you were wearing your helmet."

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.120
 And so what he did was he drilled a hole in his helmet.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120
 - Yeah.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.240
 - And he smoked with putting the cigarette in there.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.520
 - Wow. - And so for QI,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.000
 I always wanted to ask the question,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.360
 why did Dick Trickle have a hole in his helmet?

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.880
 (audience laughing)

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.880
 - Beautiful.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.640
 (audience applauding)

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.200
 - Didn't make it pass the sensors, didn't it?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.720
 - No, I never made it pass the producer.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.840
 - Do you know what Shakespeare means?

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.040
 - Just is it like literally shaking the spear?

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.960
 - Well, according to the came out in 2014,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.640
 which is the dictionary of surnames.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.520
 It's written by a couple of professors.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.800
 And one of them said that the medieval surname Shakespeare

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.480
 is probably an obscene name originally for a masturbator.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.320
 - No.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.160
 - Wow. - Really?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.440
 - He's a masturbator.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.680
 - Hands off.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.920
 (audience laughing)

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.080
 - I think it was pretty hands-on.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.480
 (audience laughing)

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.400
 - I was on ancestry.com, and ancestry.com

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.800
 has been listing surnames that have gone extinct.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.360
 So obviously the ones that like stand upright,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.120
 I believe will have been extinct.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.680
 So ones that have recently gone extinct include ships,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.640
 temples, rummage, Sothec.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.440
 So those they've seen that there are virtually no new members

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.080
 who are being born with the surname.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.440
 And on the endangered list,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.000
 and what counts as an endangered surname is so rare

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.400
 that less than 50 people in England and Wales have them.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.920
 So this is for England and Wales.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.760
 Included on the list is Marin, as in Helen Marin,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.280
 Nike, as in Bill Nike, and Bonneville,

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.160
 as in Hugh Bonneville, all three leading actors.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.360
 - The endangered species basically.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.200
 - Yeah.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.160
 - It's all of our solemn duty tonight,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.280
 if we can, to mate with Helen Marin, Bill Nye,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.400
 or Hugh Bonneville, depending on your preference.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.040
 - Or more than he cares.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.520
 (laughing)

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.840
 and that is my fact.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.160
 My fact this week is that the man who invented

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:00.160
 the Australian Labradoodle deeply, deeply regrets it.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.960
 (laughing)

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.560
 He is so sorry that he did that to all of us.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.720
 This is a guy called Wally Conran.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.240
 Wally Conran, who's now approaching his 90s.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.600
 He was the first person in a mass sense

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.160
 and is credited with creating the trend

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.720
 which started in the '80s of the cross between

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.000
 the Labradoodle and a poodle.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.040
 And what he hates is it kind of took off

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.680
 and it became a celebrity dog,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.920
 and Jennifer Aniston has one,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.880
 and crown princes around the world have them,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.400
 and it became such a fashionable dog.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.280
 But to get the specific dog,

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.600
 there's a lot of breeding that needs to happen,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.680
 and he thinks he's created the Frankenstein

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.880
 that has set off all these people

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.080
 experimenting with different breeds and so on

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.240
 for design or dog.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.480
 So yeah, he's very sorry, he asked me to say he's very sorry.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.480
 (laughing)

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.680
 - I thought the reason that he,

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.160
 one of the reasons that he was sorry was because

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.320
 the whole reason the Labradoodle came to be

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.560
 was because he was asked to create a guy dog

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.560
 for a woman whose husband had a dog allergy.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.800
 And so by merging those two, that anti-allergenic,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.680
 so you're not allergic to them.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.600
 I thought one of the reasons that he didn't like

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.960
 the Labradoodle is that it's advertised

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.680
 as a hyperallergenic dog.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.920
 And yet, a lot of people now breed them

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.280
 without actually testing whether or not they are.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.480
 So I think quite a small percentage of them now

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.920
 are nonallergenic, but.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.680
 - But he is definitely against all of this

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.800
 kind of crossbreeding, I'm pretty sure.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.920
 Yeah, he said, I just heard about someone

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.840
 who wants to cross a poodle with a rot wiler,

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.760
 but that is a thing.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.600
 - That's correct.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.920
 - Yeah, it's called a rottle.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.520
 Also called a roti poo.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.320
 A roti doodle or a rot wiler poo.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.440
 - Yeah, oh.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.040
 - But a rot wiler poo sounds like,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.720
 that's a, yeah.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.560
 - Yeah.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.640
 - Yeah, you can get a coca poo.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.200
 That's a cross between a coca spaniel and a poodle.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.440
 A she poo, which is a shitsoo and a poodle.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.160
 - Yeah, a beach poo, which is a beach on freeze and a poodle.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.680
 A peek a poo, which is a peeking ease and a poodle.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.440
 - No, stop it.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.680
 - I mean, it does sound like they do it

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.880
 just for their names, doesn't it?

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.400
 - There's a schnailser scotty cross called a schnotty.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400
 (audience laughs)

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.920
 - Yeah. - It's one of the fun cross,

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.400
 which is a crossbreeding a shitsoo and a jack russle,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.200
 which has two names, but one of them is the jack shit.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.020
 (audience laughs)

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.880
 - Have you guys, there are some other dogs that went extinct

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.400
 or dogs we don't have anymore.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.240
 - Yeah.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.880
 - So have you heard of the salish wool dog?

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.720
 - No.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.040
 - The wool dog was a dog you could shear

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.680
 and then you would wear their coat as your coat.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.160
 It was a dog that was big and fluffy enough

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.160
 that you could keep on sharing it.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.320
 - Could you not do that with any dog?

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.160
 No.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.980
 - I don't know.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.440
 - You could have a go, couldn't you?

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.280
 Might as well try.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.560
 (audience laughs)

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.520
 - But you know why poodles have those stupid cuts of hair

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 that they have?

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.240
 Well, there's a proper reason behind it.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.920
 And that is because they're originally

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.000
 to collect stuff from water.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.440
 And if they had this kind of really bushy hair

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.040
 and they would just get wet and they'd get heavy.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.200
 - So, but like, is it hunting, use?

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.160
 - It was collecting quarry, so you've been hunting

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.600
 and then the water says it's a duck, it's in the water.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.760
 And then the poodle would go in and get it.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.040
 And the idea was, so they wanted to have

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.680
 as little hair as possible, but it still needed hair

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.320
 to keep it in turn Logan's warm.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.040
 So that's why it kept it round there.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.600
 It still needed it to keep the joints warm

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.400
 to stop arthritis, so it still needed it round there.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.720
 And the top nut was to keep the long hair out of its eyes

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.640
 when it was swimming.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.560
 (audience laughs)

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.920
 - And that's it, it's a water dog.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.520
 So the word poodle comes from the old German poodle,

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.800
 doesn't it, for puddle?

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.000
 Because it was best at going into water

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.200
 and getting ducks out of it.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.880
 But do you know the best thing about a poodle these days

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.120
 when they're often shown in dog shows

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.960
 is the thing that you're striving for

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.840
 is for them to be square.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.920
 So I didn't squareness is the thing you strive for most

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920
 above all things.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.080
 So the Westminster Kennel show allows two styles of poodle.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080
 It's not too many.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.840
 They have continental and English, like breakfasts.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.360
 And...

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.720
 - And the English one is a much grezier dog.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.040
 (audience laughs)

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.200
 - Yeah, but who's going to pay that much for a continental?

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.040
 - Yeah, true.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.360
 The continental is a journey over.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360
 - It's so overpriced.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.600
 (audience laughs)

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.720
 - But the other, there are two styles of poodles

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.600
 that are allowed at these dog competitions

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.160
 and they're judged on squareness.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.200
 And they're properly square.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.800
 The area from their breast to their bottom

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.800
 has to be the same as the area from their shoulder

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.240
 to the ground.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.040
 And it's very precise.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.680
 So in shows where poodles are being shown,

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.040
 they have to be really groomed very well.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.200
 And groomers work with only the finest scissors, apparently.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.000
 And the best poodle scissors are made in Japan.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.880
 And they cost more than $600.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.960
 - Done.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.840
 - It sounds like you're sellerized scissors.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.680
 - Yeah.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:56.880
 - My dad has, he's a hairdresser and so is my mom.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.520
 And he bought when he was young, a pair of scissors,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.080
 scissors that were forged in the fires of a seller.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.000
 (audience laughs)

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.120
 - They are samurai scissors.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.600
 They were made by samurai.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.160
 - And you set that on the show,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.920
 and we really did not believe you.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.760
 - Yeah.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.560
 - And then I showed you the article

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.600
 where he was in the newspaper.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.600
 It's true.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.160
 I mean, it's still him going samurai scissors,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.720
 but they're so sharp because they're made by the samurai.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.640
 That when you're a hairdresser and you have your scissors,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.960
 you need to get them sharpened every two or three years.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.640
 You go and do it.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.400
 My dad takes them every two or three years

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.320
 and they say to him,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.920
 "There is nothing we can do for you."

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.160
 They are as sharp as the day you bought them.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.600
 Samarized.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.440
 (audience laughs)

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.600
 - Wow.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.040
 - I've got a fact about dog mentality assessments.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.120
 If anyone's up for that.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.360
 - Yes, please.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.200
 - It's, sorry, dog mentality assessments in Sweden.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.040
 - Oh, no, no.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.680
 (audience laughs)

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.320
 - So there's a Swedish association which has to assess

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.960
 how relaxed and calm a dog is.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.320
 And it uses this thing called the dog mentality assessment.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.200
 And what it is, it's basically a haunted house for dogs.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.920
 So they make a dog walk along a long path in some woods.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.880
 And then as it walks along,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.200
 they suddenly, they play a gunshot sound.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.880
 They play the sound of a metal chain

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.640
 being creepily dragged along.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.440
 And then suddenly a ghost appears.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.280
 - What?

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.280
 - Is it a dog ghost?

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.760
 - It's a human ghost.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.760
 It's a person coming in a sheet with a plastic bucket on there.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.760
 (audience laughs)

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.280
 And they test how calm or aggressive the dog is.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.520
 - Right, so are they doing this

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.760
 because it's like a seeing dog like a...

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.600
 - I think they're doing this

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.560
 'cause they have time on their hands.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.120
 - Like if it was like a blind person.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.780
 - I think it might be to assess it in that kind of

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.200
 in working dogs, the aggressiveness, yeah.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200
 - Right.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.960
 - Wow, that's exciting.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.600
 - I have a couple of things on,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.600
 so the main headline fact is the inventor regretting

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.360
 his invention.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.680
 I found a few other people who've regretted their inventions.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.440
 So Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.680
 he really regrets, you know, originally,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.080
 when we all had to put in a web address, HTTP and so on,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.800
 he regrets the two forward slashes that you do.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.640
 - Because...

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640
 - That's the best bit.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.440
 - Well, I agree, James.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.520
 I had great fun.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.640
 I wish there were more.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.480
 But...

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 (audience laughs)

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.600
 - I sense those put an extra one in, just for fun.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.440
 - Exactly.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.080
 - Hour's a fun.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.640
 And so the two forward slashes on it,

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.160
 which is completely useless, didn't need to be there.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.360
 He just put them in because like James and I,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.760
 he loves a good forward slash.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.600
 And...

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.440
 (audience laughs)

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.280
 And they had no purpose at all, and he regrets that.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.000
 He's publicly spoken and said,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.760
 "I'm very sorry, I didn't mean to do that."

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.600
 - Okay.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.120
 - Yeah, I think people thought they did code at the time.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.360
 I mean, they did serve purpose in certain code, didn't they?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.480
 And so he assumed they were useful.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.320
 - Yes.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.480
 - But then it turned out later that they weren't,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.120
 and he said the countless hours of human labor

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.600
 and time spent typing those two key strokes.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.640
 - Oh, what, what will we have done with the time?

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.400
 - I could have watched the wire.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.240
 - Okay, yeah.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.640
 - I'll never watch the wire because it didn't burn as late.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.680
 - Hey, we need to move on to our final fact soon.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.280
 Guys got anything before we do?

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.560
 - The queen is very responsible for dog crossbreeds.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.400
 - Is she?

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.200
 - Our queen and yours guys.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.840
 (audience laughs)

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.800
 - Don't forget.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.720
 - Hers was one of the first crossbreeds

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.080
 as the BBC put it to infiltrate the Kennel Club

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.880
 because she bred daxans with corgis

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.800
 and she insisted on her doggy being in the portrait

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.880
 that she had done with her in the 1970s in 1975.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.480
 And quite sweetly, the secretary of the Kennel Club

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.720
 at the time that judges all of these things said that,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.080
 look, the daxan was evolved to chase badgers down holes

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.520
 and corgis were evolved to round up cattle.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.120
 So if anyone loses a herd of cattle down a badger hole,

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.880
 these are just the dogs to get them.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.880
 (audience laughs)

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.040
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.920
 and that is Andy.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.320
 - My fact has a content warning, this bit's rude.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.160
 - Okay cool.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.680
 - Unlike that lobster bit we did earlier.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.520
 - Oh yeah.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.760
 (audience laughs)

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.440
 - So my fact is that the word shit faced originally meant

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.480
 having a very small face.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.720
 (audience laughs)

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.360
 So if you said I was absolutely shit faced last night,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.280
 it just means all your features bunched up

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.800
 right in the middle.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.720
 - It's because it comes from the word shit.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.480
 You hear that, it's very old fashioned saying

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.360
 you hear it said sometimes a mere shit of a lot.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.840
 - Or like a chitty is a little receipt or something.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.800
 - Exactly, yeah, it just means it's like a small thing.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.400
 So the first usage that I've been able to find

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.400
 is 1622 where there's a child described as a peaking

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.880
 shit faced page.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.040
 (audience laughs)

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.480
 Just means small face.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.480
 (audience laughs)

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.200
 - I think we should bring it back, don't you?

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.560
 - Yes, I do.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.520
 - There are loads of words for being drunk,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.840
 but there were very few for having a small face.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.760
 (audience laughs)

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.440
 - Imagine if the band, the small faces,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.400
 had originally called themselves the shit faces.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.760
 (audience laughs)

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.520
 - So this is the weird thing, but last night,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.440
 Andy said to all of us, who do you think

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.520
 has the smallest face?

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.640
 I've all of us for, and I don't know what we were doing

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.480
 this for.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.320
 - Is that what you were doing?

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.160
 - It's not what, it's not consciously why I asked.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.520
 - Because you were called pinhead at school, aren't you?

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.520
 - Yeah.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.160
 (audience laughs)

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.080
 - But as I pointed out, pins famously have very large

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.720
 heads relative to their body.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.240
 (audience laughs)

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.600
 So let me tell you, the drunk was on those guys.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.600
 (audience laughs)

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.280
 Nice one shit face.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.280
 (audience laughs)

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.080
 I was looking up other false shit words, basically.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.840
 So there's the word shittle, which means inconstant.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.880
 So like a shuttle, it means back and forward,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.720
 the word shittle.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.480
 So you used to play badminton with a shittle cock.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.320
 - No way.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.160
 - Yeah.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.000
 - No way.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.960
 - Wait, shite poke, shite poke, yes.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.000
 Sorry, I just don't like you.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.840
 - I'm sorry.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.680
 (audience laughs)

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.280
 - Now, shite poke was an old word for a heron.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.120
 - Wow.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.160
 - And the reason was because people thought that herons

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.000
 defecated when taking flight.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.320
 - We say do sometimes, or not all the time.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.160
 Yeah.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.160
 - There was a guy in the 19th century who wrote,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.320
 the dictionary of West Somerset in 1875,

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.120
 and he said that the 29th of May is shit sack day.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.560
 And he writes this, the writer of the dictionary says,

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.280
 in the northwest of Somerset and North Devon,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.480
 it is common to hear boys call out on that day,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.240
 shit sack, shit sack, but I have been unable

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.520
 to discover the origin.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.000
 (audience laughs)

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.520
 It feels to me like he's not heard them saying it

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.520
 to him on the other day.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.360
 - Yes.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.800
 (audience laughs)

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.920
 - There's a three volume dictionary of slang

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.760
 called Jonathan Greene's,

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.080
 Jonathan Greene is the guy who wrote it.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.920
 He's a genius.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.920
 But I looked up peculiarly Australian shit slang words.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.200
 So I don't know how familiar these might be,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.520
 everyone knows them.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.640
 So for example, I'm so hungry,

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.680
 I could eat a shit sandwich, only I don't like bread.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.400
 (audience laughs)

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.880
 There's to take the shit with the sugar,

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.400
 which is to accept that one must have

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.760
 both bad and good experiences in life.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.600
 And my favorite is you don't know

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.480
 whether you want a shit or a haircut.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.040
 (audience laughs)

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.840
 Which is, you're stupid, that's what that means.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.320
 (audience laughs)

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.360
 - I think it's possible to want both of those things.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.800
 (audience laughs)

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.600
 - The word shit though, has a long history,

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.560
 doesn't it, in a long etymological history.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.960
 So it comes from "skay" which meant to cut.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.280
 And so it's the same origin as words like science

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.400
 and schedule and shield.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.480
 And it was spelled "shite" until the 1700s.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.120
 But they used to kind of broaden their shit base vocabulary.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.120
 So in Old English, "skite" was direer

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.480
 and "besketan" was one word that meant to cover with excrement.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.640
 And also in 18th century,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.960
 according to the Partridge Dictionary of Slang,

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.680
 to shit through your teeth was to vomit,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.280
 which does make a lot of sense.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.120
 (audience laughs)

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.360
 The example that's given in this dictionary

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.160
 is "Egy Harky Friend,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.200
 "have you got a padlock on your ass

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.120
 "that you shite through your teeth?"

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.600
 (audience laughs)

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.920
 - Wow, wow.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.200
 I have some swear words which are not a tall rude,

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.760
 but they are awesome.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.240
 These are incredibly rude in the languages that they are in.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.240
 Okay, so for example.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.760
 - So we're gonna alienate not just the English-speaking world

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.920
 of this podcast.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.880
 - Yeah, the Swedish, the Romanians and the Japanese

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.560
 have better buckle up when they're listening to this.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.160
 So in Sweden, you can say,

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.400
 go and put an old blanket over yourself,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.240
 which is really rude to them.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.080
 - In Sweden.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.920
 - Yeah, in Sweden.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.960
 - But that's what that guy who is pretending

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.160
 to be a ghost was doing.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.000
 (audience laughs)

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.720
 - So in Japan, you can say,

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.080
 "Tofu no kado ni atama wo butsu kete shine,"

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.120
 or hit your head on a corner of tofu and die.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.120
 (audience laughs)

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:10.000
 In Romanian, there's a phrase which means,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.080
 I can't believe this is true.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.120
 It means, "I would dry my dirty pants

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.040
 on your mum's crucifix."

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.960
 (audience laughs)

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.000
 That one's quite rude in English as well.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.040
 (audience laughs)

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.560
 - Can I just, in Romanian, I read an article on Vice,

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.880
 which had a Romanian person writing in

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.400
 about swearing in Romania,

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.920
 and they said, "Swearing culture in Romania

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.200
 is built on oral sex, mothers, and Christ."

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.600
 (audience laughs)

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.600
 - That's very much the trifecta of things

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.920
 not to say in Romania.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.760
 (audience laughs)

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.840
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.600
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.560
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.680

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.560
 of this podcast, we are on our Twitter accounts.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.320
 I am on @Sriberland, Andy.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.000
 - James.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.800

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.160

 - Yeah, well, you can go to our group account,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.200
 which is @nosuchthing, our Facebook page.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.560
 No such thing as a fish, no such thing as a fish.com.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.240
 It's so many no such things as fish, things you can go to.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.560
 But the website does have all of our previous episodes.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.360
 It has our tour dates and everything.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.840
 So head there, we will be back again next week

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.240
 with another episode.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.720
 Guys, you have been awesome.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.920
 Thank you so much.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.080
 We'll be back again.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.640
 Goodbye!

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.640
 (audience cheering)

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.060
 (upbeat music)

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.060
 (audience cheering)
