00:01:10,00:01:13,(lively music)
00:01:25,00:01:28,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:28,00:01:29,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:29,00:01:31,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:01:31,00:01:34,from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:01:34,00:01:36,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:36,00:01:38,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:38,00:01:41,"Anna Tyshinski, and it's our special guest,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"our good friend, co-host of My Dad wrote a porno,"
00:01:43,00:01:44,Jamie Morton.
00:01:44,00:01:47,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:47,00:01:50,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:50,00:01:53,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:53,00:01:56,"Starting with fact number one, and that's you, Jamie."
00:01:56,00:02:01,"- My fact is in 2007, tennis legends Roger Federer"
00:02:01,00:02:04,and Raphael Nadal played a match on a court
00:02:04,00:02:08,that was 50% grass and 50% clay.
00:02:08,00:02:11,- Like a Frankencourt.
00:02:11,00:02:13,- Exactly that.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"Basically they were both, and still kind of are,"
00:02:15,00:02:19,"seen as the greatest on clay and grass,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,"Rafa being the best on clay,"
00:02:21,00:02:22,Roger being the best on grass.
00:02:22,00:02:25,"And so they thought, why not combine the services"
00:02:25,00:02:29,and see who is the ultimate tennis player?
00:02:29,00:02:30,This was the idea.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"- It's worth saying though, it's not a combination"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"of grass and clay, like some new court that's been made."
00:02:36,00:02:37,"It's literally, and you can see photos"
00:02:37,00:02:41,"or watch it online even, half of it is solid grass."
00:02:41,00:02:44,"And then if you cross the court, it's solid clay."
00:02:44,00:02:46,It's the most bizarre looking.
00:02:46,00:02:47,- It's so stupid. - It's wonderful.
00:02:47,00:02:50,"- Exactly, let me give you some kind of background to them."
00:02:50,00:02:54,Nadal had kind of emerged as the first real rival
00:02:54,00:02:55,to Roger Federer.
00:02:55,00:02:56,"Roger Federer was basically beating everybody,"
00:02:56,00:02:58,"and then Raphael Nadal came along in 2005,"
00:02:58,00:03:02,"started to beat him on a lot of services, but never on grass."
00:03:02,00:03:05,"So he had won 48 straight matches on grass,"
00:03:05,00:03:09,and he was undefeated on the surface for five years.
00:03:09,00:03:12,"Five years undefeated on grass, that's insane."
00:03:12,00:03:17,"At the same point, Nadal had won 72 straight matches on clay,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,and he was three years undefeated.
00:03:19,00:03:22,So they really were coming at the peak of their powers
00:03:22,00:03:23,on both surfaces.
00:03:23,00:03:26,"- Yeah, the match ended in a tie break as well."
00:03:26,00:03:29,"So it was meant to be a friendly, it was an exhibition match,"
00:03:29,00:03:30,"but the guys took it very seriously,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"and Nadal took the first set, Federer the second,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"and then they went to a tie break in the third,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,and that's where Nadal took it.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- It was very close, and also a lot of Federer fans"
00:03:39,00:03:40,were bitching about the fact
00:03:40,00:03:42,that the grass wasn't proper grass.
00:03:42,00:03:45,They had a bit of a worm infestation in the day before
00:03:45,00:03:47,the match was supposed to take place.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"Yeah, and it kind of buggered up all the grass."
00:03:49,00:03:53,They had to get some putting green grass put in overnight.
00:03:53,00:03:56,And so it was kind of like a carpet of grass
00:03:56,00:03:57,that wasn't really grass at all.
00:03:57,00:04:00,"So it wasn't really a fair test, guys, if you were at school."
00:04:00,00:04:01,- Didn't Federer say it at the end?
00:04:01,00:04:04,"The court was great, especially the clay part of it."
00:04:04,00:04:07,"It's an insane to contemplate that this is 2007,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"and yeah, I agree, you know, you always think"
00:04:09,00:04:11,"when Federer goes back into a Grand Slam,"
00:04:11,00:04:12,hopefully he'll win again.
00:04:12,00:04:15,And I think he still won his last one in 2018.
00:04:15,00:04:20,"And yet, this, in May 2007, he was exactly halfway through"
00:04:20,00:04:22,the number of Grand Slams that he'd won.
00:04:22,00:04:26,"So he had won 10 of his 20 Grand Slams by that point,"
00:04:26,00:04:27,whereas Nadal was just starting out.
00:04:27,00:04:29,- What's nice about them now is that
00:04:29,00:04:31,they've both got 20 Grand Slams.
00:04:31,00:04:33,It's almost like they should both retire now
00:04:33,00:04:34,and just be equal forever.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"'Cause this whole kind of conversation,"
00:04:36,00:04:37,"who's the greatest of all time,"
00:04:37,00:04:38,it will go on and on and on.
00:04:38,00:04:41,I guess this was a kind of a gimmicky way
00:04:41,00:04:43,to try and settle who was the best.
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- Yeah, and no one ever says,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"""Oh, actually, Nadal's officially the better player,"""
00:04:46,00:04:50,"'cause he won that match on the half grass, half Play-Con 2007."
00:04:50,00:04:53,"- Also, it is insane how these guys stay"
00:04:53,00:04:54,at the top of their game.
00:04:54,00:04:55,Do you remember there was that story
00:04:55,00:04:58,"of the guy who went in the coma,"
00:04:58,00:04:59,"and when he went in the coma,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,Federer was number one in the world.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"He was in it for 11 years,"
00:05:03,00:05:06,"and when he came out, Federer was still up there."
00:05:06,00:05:07,I think he was number two.
00:05:07,00:05:09,- Was that his first question when he came out?
00:05:09,00:05:10,Is Federer still number one?
00:05:10,00:05:10,"They said, ""Yes."""
00:05:10,00:05:12,"And he said, ""Thank God, it must have just been"
00:05:12,00:05:13,"""a fortnight or something."""
00:05:13,00:05:15,"- Well, he went into the coma in the first place"
00:05:15,00:05:18,because Federer accidentally knocked a ball into his head.
00:05:18,00:05:20,So it was a reasonable question
00:05:20,00:05:21,to ask how's Federer doing.
00:05:21,00:05:25,"- Just on weird tennis matches,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,do you know that Andy Roddick once played a game of tennis
00:05:28,00:05:30,with a frying pan instead of a racket?
00:05:30,00:05:31,"- Wow, really?"
00:05:31,00:05:35,"- And I learned about this in a book called,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"""Andy Roddick Beat Me with a Frying Pan,"""
00:05:37,00:05:42,which is actually an incredibly confusingly titled book
00:05:42,00:05:44,"because it's by a guy called Todd Gallagher,"
00:05:44,00:05:46,and it's a book about all these sports questions
00:05:46,00:05:47,that you wish could be answered.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"Like, what would happen if the NBA raised the basket"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"to 12 feet, or how good a pro golfer's at miniature golf?"
00:05:53,00:05:55,"And one of them is, what would happen if you gave"
00:05:55,00:05:57,an amazing tennis player a frying pan to play with?
00:05:57,00:05:58,Could I still beat him?
00:05:58,00:06:01,And the outcome is that the author beats Andy Roddick.
00:06:01,00:06:04,And I've never met a book where the title
00:06:04,00:06:08,is just a direct lie once you read the actual contest.
00:06:08,00:06:10,(laughing)
00:06:10,00:06:13,"He says, the match like Roddick played really, really well,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,"but with a frying pan, it's quite difficult."
00:06:14,00:06:16,You can't put any spin on the ball.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"You can't hit backhands, apparently,"
00:06:17,00:06:18,which I would have thought you could just spin it around
00:06:18,00:06:20,"in your hand, but you can't hit backhands."
00:06:20,00:06:21,- Quite heavy.
00:06:21,00:06:25,"- He could maneuver it around, but anyway, he struggled,"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"but he did give an interview afterwards saying,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,"he thought that if he got to practice a little bit,"
00:06:29,00:06:30,he'd get used to it.
00:06:30,00:06:34,"And indeed, for charity, he later that year, I think,"
00:06:34,00:06:37,"played another guy called Chris Wetzel,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"who won this charity event, and he played him"
00:06:39,00:06:42,"with a frying pan, and he did then win."
00:06:42,00:06:43,He actually thrashed him.
00:06:43,00:06:44,And so--
00:06:44,00:06:48,"- Andy Roddick, the title Andy Roddick beat Chris Wetzel"
00:06:48,00:06:50,with a frying pan is less intriguing
00:06:50,00:06:53,than Andy Roddick beat me with a frying pan.
00:06:53,00:06:55,"- That's a problem, yeah, but he didn't want"
00:06:55,00:06:57,to credit Chris Wetzel with writing the book
00:06:57,00:07:00,"that he'd written, so he's in a difficult place."
00:07:00,00:07:02,"- Yeah, and he could have called it,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,"I beat Andy Roddick with a frying pan,"
00:07:04,00:07:08,"but it sounds, it sounds more menacing and fiery."
00:07:08,00:07:10,(laughs)
00:07:10,00:07:12,"- And it's a dangling modifier, isn't it?"
00:07:12,00:07:12,It's very misleading.
00:07:12,00:07:14,It does imply that he's got the frying pan.
00:07:14,00:07:21,- Another amazingly weird match that occurred
00:07:21,00:07:24,"is the longest match in women's singles,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"which lasted over six hours long,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,but that's not the interesting bit about it.
00:07:28,00:07:31,Within that match was the longest single rally
00:07:31,00:07:33,of tennis ever to occur.
00:07:33,00:07:36,"So this was September 24th, 1984,"
00:07:36,00:07:39,"and this was the longest in terms of a pro match,"
00:07:39,00:07:42,"longest rally, how many shots do you think"
00:07:42,00:07:43,this rally went for?
00:07:43,00:07:45,"- Shots, what?"
00:07:45,00:07:47,- 160.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"- Yeah, 110."
00:07:48,00:07:50,"- Pretty good, pretty good."
00:07:50,00:07:52,- I'm gonna say a hundred.
00:07:52,00:07:56,- It lasted 29 minutes and it went for 643 shots.
00:07:56,00:07:59,- Oh my God.
00:07:59,00:08:03,Serena Williams has won matches in shorter time than that.
00:08:03,00:08:06,"- Yeah, it was between Vicki Nelson Dunbar"
00:08:06,00:08:10,"and Jean Hepner, and it was a set point for Hepner,"
00:08:10,00:08:14,"and it was in a tie break at the end of the match,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"and it went 29 minutes long,"
00:08:16,00:08:20,and Vicki Nelson managed to take it on the 643rd shot.
00:08:20,00:08:21,- Oh my God.
00:08:21,00:08:22,- Jean of the match.
00:08:22,00:08:24,"- Oh, she would never have recovered for Jean."
00:08:24,00:08:26,"- Oh, it was horrible."
00:08:26,00:08:30,Vicki Nelson immediately collapsed with cramps in her legs.
00:08:30,00:08:32,She was in so much pain.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"And the umpire, the umpire,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,gave her a time violation warning.
00:08:36,00:08:37,- No.
00:08:37,00:08:38,- Because she was taking too long
00:08:38,00:08:39,to get back up for the next shot.
00:08:39,00:08:40,Yeah.
00:08:40,00:08:41,- They're so strict to those umpires.
00:08:41,00:08:42,It's just so unfair.
00:08:42,00:08:43,- Yeah.
00:08:43,00:08:44,- So unfair.
00:08:44,00:08:46,- That's insane that you could start watching
00:08:46,00:08:50,an episode of EastEnders at the start of that rally
00:08:50,00:08:52,"and come out of that episode and be like,"
00:08:52,00:08:53,"""So what's happening in the match?"""
00:08:53,00:08:55,"It's like, ""Well, it's the same rally."""
00:08:55,00:08:57,- You could be in an extremely short coma
00:08:57,00:09:01,"and come out of the coma and say, ""Who won that set?"""
00:09:01,00:09:02,We don't know.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"- Are you okay, Andy?"
00:09:03,00:09:05,- There's a lot of comas today.
00:09:05,00:09:06,Are you all right?
00:09:06,00:09:08,(all laughing)
00:09:08,00:09:09,Second coma of the day.
00:09:09,00:09:10,- Sorry.
00:09:10,00:09:11,Andy Roddick beat me with a frying pan.
00:09:11,00:09:13,(all laughing)
00:09:13,00:09:14,Unfortunately.
00:09:14,00:09:17,- I do love the story of a really early tennis player
00:09:17,00:09:19,called Suzanne Longlin.
00:09:19,00:09:20,Have you heard of this woman?
00:09:20,00:09:21,- No.
00:09:21,00:09:22,- She was basically the most famous woman in the world
00:09:22,00:09:25,in the 1920s when tennis was quite the sport
00:09:25,00:09:26,and everyone loved it.
00:09:26,00:09:27,And she was amazing.
00:09:27,00:09:31,She was the first number one female tennis player ever.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"She won six women and titles,"
00:09:32,00:09:34,including five in a row.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"And from the First World War to her retirement in 1923,"
00:09:38,00:09:40,"she never lost a match,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,except once when she retired.
00:09:43,00:09:44,She didn't lose it.
00:09:44,00:09:46,She just retired from the match.
00:09:46,00:09:48,"But my favorite thing about her is that in between points,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,she would sit and drink wine and cognac.
00:09:51,00:09:54,Because she felt that that was the only way
00:09:54,00:09:56,she could play properly.
00:09:56,00:09:57,- Wow.
00:09:57,00:09:59,"- In between points, not in between--"
00:09:59,00:10:00,"- Well, changeovers, I guess."
00:10:00,00:10:01,Games.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- Okay, all right."
00:10:02,00:10:04,- That's 'cause you do get points docked
00:10:04,00:10:06,for interrupting a point in order to have a drink.
00:10:06,00:10:08,I think that's pushing it.
00:10:08,00:10:09,"- A cramp, you're not allowed,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,but a drink of cognac is actually fine.
00:10:11,00:10:13,And she was so powerful
00:10:13,00:10:14,in terms of getting people to come and see her
00:10:14,00:10:16,"that when she wanted to go and play in America,"
00:10:16,00:10:21,the USTA conspired to circumnavigate
00:10:21,00:10:22,the prohibition laws
00:10:22,00:10:25,that would mean that she could actually drink in America.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"- Oh, really?"
00:10:26,00:10:26,- So that she could take part in the tournament
00:10:26,00:10:28,'cause she wouldn't play without drinking.
00:10:28,00:10:29,- Wow.
00:10:29,00:10:31,- That's amazing.
00:10:31,00:10:34,- The most watched tennis game of all time
00:10:34,00:10:36,was The Battle of the Sexes.
00:10:36,00:10:39,The very famous match.
00:10:39,00:10:43,And so this was obviously the tennis game
00:10:43,00:10:45,that's played between Polygyne King and Bobby Riggs
00:10:45,00:10:47,to definitively decide whether a woman
00:10:47,00:10:49,"could be a man at tennis, quite bizarre concept."
00:10:49,00:10:51,But I had not realized how many people watched it.
00:10:51,00:10:54,90 million people tuned in to watch it.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Wow.
00:10:55,00:10:56,- Wow.
00:10:56,00:10:57,"- And Bobby Riggs said,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,"""It was the most disappointing,"
00:10:59,00:11:02,"""disheartening experience of my life losing."""
00:11:02,00:11:03,But she's kind of sad for him.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"He was, and it wasn't even a victory for King"
00:11:06,00:11:09,because she was 29 and he was 55.
00:11:09,00:11:11,So it's quite hard to lord that over him.
00:11:11,00:11:13,She actually said to be a 55-year-old guy
00:11:13,00:11:15,was no thrill for me at all.
00:11:15,00:11:18,The thrill was exposing a lot of new people to tennis.
00:11:18,00:11:19,- Okay.
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- But yeah, everyone in straight sets."
00:11:20,00:11:22,- She said that it was never about the athleticism
00:11:22,00:11:23,and she would say that
00:11:23,00:11:25,'cause obviously quite the advantage.
00:11:25,00:11:27,She said it was about respect is what she said.
00:11:27,00:11:30,She wanted to prove that women could compete against men.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- Yeah.
00:11:31,00:11:31,- And she did that.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"I mean, it was amazing."
00:11:32,00:11:35,"- So speaking of greatest players of all time,"
00:11:35,00:11:36,"Anna recommended a book to me recently,"
00:11:36,00:11:39,"which I've ordered and I've just been reading reviews of it,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,"which is Andre Agassiz autobiography,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,which is said to be one of the greatest
00:11:43,00:11:45,sort of tell-alls of recent years.
00:11:45,00:11:49,"In the 90s, when he had his awesome long hair"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"that was coming down from his bandana,"
00:11:51,00:11:52,turns out that was a wig.
00:11:52,00:11:56,The whole time he was wearing a wig on the court.
00:11:56,00:11:57,I had no idea.
00:11:57,00:11:59,"I mean, he was a hero in my day."
00:11:59,00:12:01,- But does it say why?
00:12:01,00:12:04,"'Cause that must have been so annoying to play with a big,"
00:12:04,00:12:05,'cause it was a big wig.
00:12:05,00:12:06,It was like a mullet wig.
00:12:06,00:12:07,'Cause a lot of hair at the back of your hair.
00:12:07,00:12:08,- A huge amount of hair at the back.
00:12:08,00:12:10,He was going bald and he didn't wanna go bald
00:12:10,00:12:12,and he just thought he was less rock and roll
00:12:12,00:12:14,and his hair was falling out in the shower
00:12:14,00:12:16,and so on and he thought it's gonna look disgusting
00:12:16,00:12:19,when it's in the grass and on the clay.
00:12:19,00:12:22,"- I mean, sure, but like, why a mullet?"
00:12:22,00:12:23,"Why so much, right?"
00:12:23,00:12:26,He's over-competiting with like...
00:12:26,00:12:28,- He went all the way down his back.
00:12:28,00:12:29,"- Look, he was an angry man."
00:12:29,00:12:32,There's no explaining his actions in those days.
00:12:32,00:12:33,"Well, there is explaining it."
00:12:33,00:12:38,"He was trained, almost tortured with the aim"
00:12:38,00:12:39,"of making him a great tennis player, which he was."
00:12:39,00:12:41,But it's a brilliant book.
00:12:41,00:12:42,It's kind of a sad book.
00:12:42,00:12:46,He had so many issues back then.
00:12:46,00:12:48,So the bit of it that I remember
00:12:48,00:12:50,is that he was married to Brooke Shields for a while
00:12:50,00:12:52,"and there was this scene in Friends,"
00:12:52,00:12:54,"which people probably remember,"
00:12:54,00:12:57,where Joey Tribbiani has a stalker.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"So when he's on Days of Our Lives, he has a stalker"
00:12:59,00:13:01,who thinks that he's the real Dr. Drake Ramore
00:13:01,00:13:03,and that stalker is played by Brooke Shields
00:13:03,00:13:05,"and she's a crazy, creepy stalker"
00:13:05,00:13:08,and she licks his hands at one point
00:13:08,00:13:09,"in this really crazy, creepy way."
00:13:09,00:13:12,"And when Andre Agassi saw that scene,"
00:13:12,00:13:15,he was so overwhelmed with hatred and jealousy
00:13:15,00:13:18,that he drove home and he smashed all of his tennis trophies.
00:13:18,00:13:21,So all the tennis trophies he's won up until that point
00:13:21,00:13:22,were completely destroyed.
00:13:22,00:13:23,So he smashed them to pieces.
00:13:23,00:13:25,-What? -Wow.
00:13:25,00:13:28,-He was an angry man. -And then she filed for divorce.
00:13:28,00:13:30,-Very quickly after that. -He lived happily ever after.
00:13:30,00:13:32,He's now made a steppy graph.
00:13:32,00:13:35,Like two of the greatest tennis players ever.
00:13:35,00:13:36,They're like two of the only people
00:13:36,00:13:39,"that have ever done the Golden Slam,"
00:13:39,00:13:40,which is winning all four Grand Slams
00:13:40,00:13:42,"and the Olympic Gold Medal, and they're married."
00:13:42,00:13:43,-Strong. -Isn't that insane?
00:13:43,00:13:45,And both very fucked up by tennis.
00:13:45,00:13:46,I think that's what drew them together.
00:13:46,00:13:49,-It's a bond. -They kind of both hated tennis.
00:13:49,00:13:51,"Yeah, exactly. That's a really good point."
00:13:51,00:13:54,Because they were both children of obsessed fathers
00:13:54,00:13:55,"with the game, right?"
00:13:55,00:13:57,"And apparently the two dads, when they met,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,almost came to blows while arguing
00:13:59,00:14:01,over who had the superior backhand technique.
00:14:01,00:14:04,-Did we? -It must have been a really fun wedding.
00:14:04,00:14:09,"Hey, someone else who had a fun record"
00:14:09,00:14:13,"was the only person ever to win the men's doubles,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,"the mixed doubles, and the men's singles at Wimbledon."
00:14:15,00:14:17,And that was Bobby Riggs.
00:14:17,00:14:19,"And the fun thing about this,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,"so this guy who then lost to Billy Jean King,"
00:14:21,00:14:24,"the fun thing about this was that this was in 1939,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,but he was mostly known after that
00:14:26,00:14:30,for being an inveterate gambler and a real rogue.
00:14:30,00:14:33,"And we should say that he became friends with Billy Jean King,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"so the whole misogynist thing was an act,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,"and they became very good friends afterwards,"
00:14:37,00:14:39,and she spoke to him the day before he died.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"So he was a rogue, so he was obsessed with gambling."
00:14:42,00:14:45,He put a bet on himself in 1939
00:14:45,00:14:47,"to win the men's doubles, the mixed doubles,"
00:14:47,00:14:49,and the men's singles.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"And this had never been done, never been done since."
00:14:51,00:14:54,"And so he won $108,000,"
00:14:54,00:14:59,so the equivalent of $1.5 million at the time.
00:14:59,00:14:59,-Yeah. -Wow.
00:14:59,00:15:01,And he only put... I think he put $500 on.
00:15:01,00:15:02,"-Well done, Bobby. -Good on him."
00:15:02,00:15:06,"Well, Billy Jean King said that he was always one of her heroes"
00:15:06,00:15:08,"because he won that triple crown, I guess,"
00:15:08,00:15:09,and it was a great tennis player.
00:15:09,00:15:12,And she said that she thought it was the fact
00:15:12,00:15:13,that his career had been overshadowed
00:15:13,00:15:15,by the Second World War that made him so bitter.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"-Oh, really? -No one really remembered him."
00:15:17,00:15:19,"And his achievements, 'cause that's a pretty major thing."
00:15:19,00:15:22,"No one's done it since, and no one really gave him credit for it."
00:15:22,00:15:25,"It was bigger news then, and it's bigger news now."
00:15:25,00:15:28,"Yeah, you can't imagine much sympathy"
00:15:28,00:15:30,with the war veterans around the table.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"Oh, God, my life is ruined by World War II as well."
00:15:33,00:15:34,Tell me about it.
00:15:34,00:15:45,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:15:45,00:15:49,"My fact this week is that when Britain invaded Iceland in 1940,"
00:15:49,00:15:52,they knocked on all the doors before breaking them down
00:15:52,00:15:55,and officially apologized for the inconvenience.
00:15:55,00:15:58,Chills. So proud.
00:15:58,00:16:00,So proud of my nation.
00:16:00,00:16:03,They have flasks of tea as well.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:16:04,00:16:08,"This was the British invasion of Iceland in 1940,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,which I didn't know happened.
00:16:10,00:16:14,"And so don't worry, it wasn't too big a deal."
00:16:14,00:16:16,And it was almost not an invasion.
00:16:16,00:16:18,It was basically an invasion
00:16:18,00:16:20,because the Brits didn't tell Iceland about it.
00:16:20,00:16:24,"So it was in May 1940, and it's called Operation Fork."
00:16:24,00:16:29,"And basically, the Germans had their eyes on Iceland."
00:16:29,00:16:32,They'd just taken charge of Norway and Denmark.
00:16:32,00:16:33,And Iceland seemed like the obvious next step.
00:16:33,00:16:37,"So the Brits thought, let's get there in advance of the Germans."
00:16:37,00:16:41,"And they thought, if we ask the Icelandics if we can go in,"
00:16:41,00:16:44,"then they might say no, 'cause Iceland was very determinedly neutral."
00:16:44,00:16:46,"They were really like, we're not getting involved"
00:16:46,00:16:48,"with this whole war business, not a jam."
00:16:48,00:16:49,And so we thought they'll probably say no.
00:16:49,00:16:52,"So let's just storm them, let's just invade."
00:16:52,00:16:55,"So Britain invaded, but they invaded very politely."
00:16:55,00:16:58,"So the British commander was a guy called Sturgis,"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"and he issued fliers immediately after getting there,"
00:17:00,00:17:03,apologizing sincerely for the inconvenience
00:17:03,00:17:05,"and saying, look, we're just saving you from the Germans."
00:17:05,00:17:07,"Really, really sorry about this invasion."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"And they took over communications,"
00:17:09,00:17:11,"like any good invasion does, you know,"
00:17:11,00:17:13,they seize radio communications and stuff like that.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"But before breaking all the doors down to those buildings,"
00:17:15,00:17:17,they did knock on the doors.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"And then once they've broken them down,"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"they showered the janitor with apologies, apparently,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,in the big radio building that they invaded.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"- They didn't speak Icelandic,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"so they would have been apologizing, I think,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,in another language.
00:17:29,00:17:30,"They may have had a translator with them,"
00:17:30,00:17:31,but they really--
00:17:31,00:17:33,- It was the worst planned.
00:17:33,00:17:37,It's unbelievably shoddy reading this incredible account of it.
00:17:37,00:17:40,"So they planned to invade in secret,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"so they were sending a couple of detachments of troops,"
00:17:43,00:17:43,several hundred troops.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"I think about 700, maybe, was the invasion force."
00:17:46,00:17:48,And they thought they were departing from Scotland.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"Greenock was the station they were getting to,"
00:17:50,00:17:52,"and they thought, let's be inconspicuous,"
00:17:52,00:17:56,"let's send the troops so they arrive staggered in Greenock,"
00:17:56,00:17:59,so it's not clear whether they're sending huge arms like us.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"Exactly, really clever."
00:18:00,00:18:02,"Unfortunately, due to delays on the line,"
00:18:02,00:18:03,all the soldiers arrived in Greenock
00:18:03,00:18:05,at exactly the same time.
00:18:05,00:18:08,It was manifestly obvious they were planning something big.
00:18:08,00:18:09,So--
00:18:09,00:18:10,- That's even more British
00:18:10,00:18:12,"than the more apologizing, to be fair."
00:18:12,00:18:14,"- Yes, the trains didn't work well."
00:18:14,00:18:16,"- Yeah, nothing wrong on time."
00:18:16,00:18:17,"- Andy, didn't they also--"
00:18:17,00:18:20,"The idea was let's invade by night,"
00:18:20,00:18:23,"but in May, in that bit of the year,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,Iceland is basically bathed in light.
00:18:26,00:18:28,"Even though it wasn't completely light,"
00:18:28,00:18:30,"it was light enough that people saw it coming,"
00:18:30,00:18:33,crowds formed because it was a public holiday
00:18:33,00:18:35,and a payday for all of the fishermen.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"So they were drinking late into the night out on the docks,"
00:18:38,00:18:41,"looking out, going, oh, what are those massive ships coming?"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"- Imagine how fun that is, 'cause you're on a night out,"
00:18:43,00:18:44,"you're thinking, what are we gonna do now?"
00:18:44,00:18:47,"The pubs have shut, a bit boring, do we go home?"
00:18:47,00:18:51,"And then round the corner, invading Naval Force, dreamy."
00:18:51,00:18:52,- Amazing.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"- I mean, that's gonna extend your night."
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- And they wouldn't have known if it was a German invasion,"
00:18:56,00:18:57,a British invasion.
00:18:57,00:19:00,Think of that kind of the buildup of that.
00:19:00,00:19:01,What ship is it?
00:19:01,00:19:01,Can we see it yet?
00:19:01,00:19:04,"- Yeah, what do you guess?"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"- There was jeopardy at the time over that,"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"because as you say, there were shapes of ships,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,"ship shapes, if you like, in the water."
00:19:11,00:19:14,And I think they sent out a late night policeman
00:19:14,00:19:18,"on his bicycle to try and assess the situation a bit better,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"but he came back and said, I can't see what kind they are."
00:19:20,00:19:21,- Where did he ride to?
00:19:21,00:19:24,How is he getting further than anyone else at the dock?
00:19:24,00:19:26,"- Maybe they sent a policeman with the best eyesight,"
00:19:26,00:19:27,I'm not sure.
00:19:27,00:19:30,But the invasion force had already
00:19:30,00:19:31,"massively given themselves away,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,because one of the ships traveling
00:19:33,00:19:37,"had a little seaplane attached to it,"
00:19:37,00:19:41,"which was a model of plane called a super marine walrus,"
00:19:41,00:19:42,which is a great name for a plane.
00:19:42,00:19:43,Really good.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"You know, you want an amphibious plane,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,"super marine walrus, brilliant."
00:19:47,00:19:50,"Anyway, they sent up the pilot saying,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,"look, we're looking for German submarines in the area,"
00:19:52,00:19:53,which could be a huge threat.
00:19:53,00:19:56,We've got hundreds of troops on these ships.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"So look for subs in the area, be careful,"
00:19:58,00:20:00,"don't fly directly over Reykjavík,"
00:20:00,00:20:03,"the main city in Iceland,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,"which the plane immediately then did several times,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,waking up everyone in Reykjavík.
00:20:07,00:20:10,- I mean--
00:20:10,00:20:12,"- This is such a balls up, I love it."
00:20:12,00:20:14,"- It's truly heinous, it's brilliant."
00:20:14,00:20:16,"The soldiers hadn't fired their guns,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,lots of them had never fired the rifles
00:20:18,00:20:19,they'd just been issued with.
00:20:19,00:20:21,- Really? - Yeah.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"- They didn't need to, to be fair."
00:20:22,00:20:24,"They brought some loaded rifles,"
00:20:24,00:20:27,"but it was very much a case of the ship docking,"
00:20:27,00:20:30,"and in fact, I think the British ambassador"
00:20:30,00:20:31,who was the only person in Iceland
00:20:31,00:20:34,"who knew that what was gonna happen,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,"the British ambassador sort of saying to the crowd,"
00:20:36,00:20:37,do you mind standing back a bit
00:20:37,00:20:39,so these invading soldiers can climb off their ships
00:20:39,00:20:41,"and invade you, and everyone's like,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,"yeah, yeah, of course, so sorry,"
00:20:43,00:20:44,so sorry to have gone the way.
00:20:44,00:20:45,(laughing)
00:20:45,00:20:49,- One of the Icelanders snatched a rifle from a marine
00:20:49,00:20:51,"and just stuffed a cigarette in it,"
00:20:51,00:20:52,"and then threw it back to him,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,telling him to be more careful.
00:20:54,00:20:54,- Really?
00:20:54,00:20:56,- And then the marine got towed off
00:20:56,00:20:57,by his commanding officer.
00:20:57,00:20:59,- That looked really good.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"- Oh, you probably would have been told off"
00:21:00,00:21:04,"for having a random dude manage to snatch your rifle off you,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,like that's pretty bad soldiering.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"- We should say, I think everything we're saying"
00:21:08,00:21:09,"is from this fantastic article,"
00:21:09,00:21:11,so I think we should cite it.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"It's this article in Hakai Magazine,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,"and it's sort of my new favorite site,"
00:21:15,00:21:17,"I've been reading it for about six months now,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,"and it's ostensibly a site about fishing, really,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,but the article's just amazing on it.
00:21:22,00:21:24,"I'm addicted to it, so it's a great magazine"
00:21:24,00:21:25,if you wanna read it.
00:21:25,00:21:27,- And this article is amazing.
00:21:27,00:21:29,Highly recommend checking it out.
00:21:29,00:21:30,"I mean, it opens with this amazing thing"
00:21:30,00:21:32,that some of the earliest colored footage
00:21:32,00:21:34,that we have of Iceland was taken
00:21:34,00:21:38,"from the camera of Eva Braun, Hitler's girlfriend."
00:21:38,00:21:42,"She was the one who had trained it on Iceland,"
00:21:42,00:21:45,"and she caught these little children on camera,"
00:21:45,00:21:48,and it's just mad that that's some of the earliest footage
00:21:48,00:21:50,that we have is filmed by Hitler's crew.
00:21:50,00:21:51,"- Just on a cruise holiday, right?"
00:21:51,00:21:54,"- On a cruise holiday, on a Nazi cruise holiday, right?"
00:21:54,00:21:56,"Like, this was part of a Nazi incentive."
00:21:56,00:21:58,"- If the politics thing doesn't work,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,maybe the whole cruise ship thing might take off.
00:22:01,00:22:03,"- And I didn't realize that she was,"
00:22:03,00:22:05,"as is mentioned again in this article,"
00:22:05,00:22:08,that she was hidden as a girlfriend to the German public
00:22:08,00:22:13,"because much like the Beatles or other pop bands,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,the idea that Hitler being in a relationship
00:22:15,00:22:17,"would have put women off joining the party,"
00:22:17,00:22:20,"but Hitler as a bachelor was, you know, like,"
00:22:20,00:22:21,"""Ah, Hitler!"""
00:22:21,00:22:22,It was a bigger--
00:22:22,00:22:24,"- Oh yeah, 'cause Hitler was such a stud."
00:22:24,00:22:27,"- Well, he was in his mid-40s at this point."
00:22:27,00:22:32,"Surely at some point, the K-pop, not in a relationship,"
00:22:32,00:22:33,fiction has to wear out.
00:22:33,00:22:37,There must be a recruitment ceiling
00:22:37,00:22:38,"where beyond which you're thinking,"
00:22:38,00:22:40,"""Young women are not getting into the party"
00:22:40,00:22:43,"""because they think Hitler might fancy them."""
00:22:43,00:22:45,Interesting counter-historical narrative.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"If Hitler had openly got a girlfriend,"
00:22:47,00:22:48,would he have been forced to leave
00:22:48,00:22:51,like the K-pop stars who get boyfriends or girlfriends?
00:22:51,00:22:53,"Instead, we'd be talking about some guy"
00:22:53,00:22:55,who ran a cruise ship company.
00:22:55,00:23:00,"- God, yeah, I can imagine Goebbels"
00:23:00,00:23:01,"actually knocking on the door saying,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"""May, I'm so sorry."""
00:23:03,00:23:04,Sort of the dominant comments with time.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"- Yeah, I can't start with him."
00:23:06,00:23:10,"- So this invasion was about Norway and Denmark,"
00:23:10,00:23:12,so they'd been taken over by the Nazis.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"So, Eisen was under Danish control at the time,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,although it sort of seceded for the war
00:23:16,00:23:17,and Norway was right there.
00:23:17,00:23:19,And so the reason that the Brits invaded
00:23:19,00:23:22,was because Germany was getting dangerously close to Iceland.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"But in Norway, it was illegal under Nazi occupation"
00:23:25,00:23:26,to do various things.
00:23:26,00:23:30,It was illegal to wear a paperclip as a brooch.
00:23:30,00:23:34,And that was because students used to wear them
00:23:34,00:23:36,as a sign of resistance against the Nazis
00:23:36,00:23:37,to show that they were bound together.
00:23:37,00:23:39,And there was another thing people used to do
00:23:39,00:23:40,"which became a thing in Norway,"
00:23:40,00:23:42,which was giving wrong street directions.
00:23:42,00:23:44,So Nazi soldiers arrived in Norway
00:23:44,00:23:45,and didn't know where anything was
00:23:45,00:23:47,and so would ask for directions to places.
00:23:47,00:23:49,And the thing became to point them
00:23:49,00:23:52,in the opposite direction to where they wanted to go.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"And also, illegal to stand on a bus"
00:23:54,00:23:57,"if a seat was available, why?"
00:23:57,00:24:02,"- Wait, did people refuse to sit next to German soldiers?"
00:24:02,00:24:05,"- It's absolutely correct, yeah, yeah."
00:24:05,00:24:06,- That's pretty petty making a law saying
00:24:06,00:24:08,you have to sit next to our soldiers
00:24:08,00:24:10,"in case their feelings are hurt, I presume."
00:24:10,00:24:11,- It's pretty sad.
00:24:11,00:24:13,- Maybe they're soldiers who are in relationships.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"No one wants to be near them, that's pretty good."
00:24:15,00:24:17,"- The Norwegian invasion,"
00:24:17,00:24:18,"I don't know if we've said this before,"
00:24:18,00:24:21,"is where the word ""quisling"" comes from to mean a traitor"
00:24:21,00:24:24,because their leader who collaborated with the Nazis
00:24:24,00:24:25,was called Vidkun Quisling.
00:24:25,00:24:27,So it's one of those cool examples
00:24:27,00:24:30,"of where an individual, a named individual"
00:24:30,00:24:34,becomes a word to mean characteristic.
00:24:34,00:24:37,- Do you think you'd be pleased or excited or nervous
00:24:37,00:24:39,"if someone said to you, after you die,"
00:24:39,00:24:42,there's going to be a noun that's named after you?
00:24:42,00:24:44,And that's all I'm telling you.
00:24:44,00:24:45,"'Cause it's, you know, you think,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,"oh God, there's gonna be a noun quisling."
00:24:47,00:24:48,"That's so exciting, what's it gonna mean?"
00:24:48,00:24:50,Is it gonna be a really brave person?
00:24:50,00:24:53,Is it gonna be a really beautiful object?
00:24:53,00:24:55,- What would a Tyshensky be?
00:24:55,00:24:57,- It would be like the perfect pub.
00:24:57,00:24:59,"- I think it would be a unit of alcohol,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,but like an unrealistically large.
00:25:01,00:25:03,(all laughing)
00:25:03,00:25:06,- One Tyshensky and you're on the floor.
00:25:06,00:25:08,(upbeat music)
00:25:08,00:25:14,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:25:14,00:25:15,and that is my fact.
00:25:15,00:25:18,My fact this week is that 32 years
00:25:18,00:25:21,"after he defeated Alexander Hamilton in a duel,"
00:25:21,00:25:25,the last thing to happen to Aaron Burr on the day he died
00:25:25,00:25:27,was that he was defeated in a court case
00:25:27,00:25:29,by Alexander Hamilton Jr.
00:25:29,00:25:31,- So incredible.
00:25:31,00:25:32,- Amazing.
00:25:32,00:25:32,- Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:33,"- How so, Dan?"
00:25:33,00:25:34,How so?
00:25:34,00:25:36,"- Obviously we know Hamilton, the musical,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"based on Alexander Hamilton,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,"one of the founding fathers of America,"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"and the fact that he was murdered by Aaron Burr,"
00:25:42,00:25:45,"who was the third vice president of the United States,"
00:25:45,00:25:46,and that happened in 1804.
00:25:46,00:25:50,They had a duel and it resulted in Hamilton's death.
00:25:50,00:25:51,So it was horrible.
00:25:51,00:25:54,He died and it really had horrible ramifications
00:25:54,00:25:55,for the rest of Burr's life
00:25:55,00:25:57,that followed him all the way to his death.
00:25:57,00:26:01,"So in 1833, at the age of 77,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,Burr got remarried having lost his wife
00:26:04,00:26:06,a number of years before
00:26:06,00:26:08,"to a lady called Eliza Jumel,"
00:26:08,00:26:11,who was a very wealthy widow herself.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"She was 19 years younger than he was,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"and he thought, okay, this is great."
00:26:15,00:26:17,This is a second chance to have a huge bit of wealth
00:26:17,00:26:18,in my life.
00:26:18,00:26:21,And so he kind of took control of her wealth
00:26:21,00:26:22,and squandered it.
00:26:22,00:26:24,"He invested it in very odd projects,"
00:26:24,00:26:25,"and she cottoned on to this and went,"
00:26:25,00:26:28,"""Hang on a second, you're bleeding me of all my money."""
00:26:28,00:26:30,So she decided to get a divorce.
00:26:30,00:26:32,"When she decided to get a divorce,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,the divorce lawyer that she hired
00:26:34,00:26:38,"was the son of Alexander Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton Jr.,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,who was an incredibly successful guy.
00:26:40,00:26:42,This case was way below him.
00:26:42,00:26:44,He'd passed doing this kind of menial stuff
00:26:44,00:26:45,"years and years ago,"
00:26:45,00:26:47,"but he said, ""Absolutely, I'll take it on."""
00:26:47,00:26:50,And he used the court case as an excuse
00:26:50,00:26:53,to really showcase what a terrible person
00:26:53,00:26:54,he thought Aaron Burr was.
00:26:54,00:26:56,He talked about all his affairs and so on.
00:26:56,00:26:58,"And the court case took three years,"
00:26:58,00:27:03,and it was finally settled in the favor of Eliza Jumel.
00:27:03,00:27:07,On the very day that Aaron Burr died just a few hours
00:27:07,00:27:08,"before he passed away,"
00:27:08,00:27:11,a final little defeat from the Hamilton.
00:27:11,00:27:12,So he didn't hear about it before he died.
00:27:12,00:27:13,- We don't know.
00:27:13,00:27:14,I don't actually know that.
00:27:14,00:27:16,"Yeah, I'm not sure."
00:27:16,00:27:17,I hope he--
00:27:17,00:27:19,"- Dan, why don't you know that?"
00:27:19,00:27:21,(laughing)
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- Come on, mate, do your research."
00:27:22,00:27:23,Go back in time.
00:27:23,00:27:24,"- Get the facts right, come on."
00:27:24,00:27:25,"- Thank you for saying it, Jamie."
00:27:25,00:27:27,We've all been thinking it for years.
00:27:27,00:27:28,- That's what I'm here for.
00:27:28,00:27:28,"- So this is another,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,'cause one of the famous things in the musical
00:27:30,00:27:33,is that Alexander Hamilton had a son
00:27:33,00:27:35,who died in a duel.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"- Yeah, yes, correct, that was his eldest son."
00:27:37,00:27:40,"Yeah, Philip, Philip Hamilton died"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"in the duel, and he was defending the honor"
00:27:42,00:27:44,"of his dad, Alexander Hamilton."
00:27:44,00:27:46,"Someone was like bad-mouthing his dad,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,"and so he was like, ""I'm not having that."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"""See you on the dueling field, sir."""
00:27:51,00:27:52,"And then he, yeah, died."
00:27:52,00:27:53,- Yeah.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"- Well, then they did the thing"
00:27:54,00:27:55,"that they used to do in the olden days,"
00:27:55,00:27:56,which I always find a bit creepy
00:27:56,00:27:59,"of calling their next son, Philip, as well,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,which always feels like a bit of a burden to carry.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"In fact, they called him Philip II."
00:28:04,00:28:05,"- Oh, wow."
00:28:05,00:28:09,"The son, their next son, born after Philip,"
00:28:09,00:28:10,the elder son had died.
00:28:10,00:28:12,"- Yeah, yeah, the next year, I think."
00:28:12,00:28:13,"- So he started with Philip,"
00:28:13,00:28:16,"then he named a later son, Alexander Jr.,"
00:28:16,00:28:18,which feels like the first name you go to.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- Yeah. - That's true.
00:28:19,00:28:20,And then later on went to another vet.
00:28:20,00:28:22,This is too mixed up for me.
00:28:22,00:28:25,"- I have a quick pitch, a musical pitch here,"
00:28:25,00:28:28,"and we should say, Jamie, you actually are friends"
00:28:28,00:28:30,"with the creator of the Hamilton musical,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,Lin-Manuel Miranda.
00:28:32,00:28:34,"He's been on my dad wrote a porno, right?"
00:28:34,00:28:35,And you've hung out with him.
00:28:35,00:28:37,"- Best friend, Cleveland. - So you could probably get"
00:28:37,00:28:40,this idea to him on my behalf.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- Okay.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"- Sequel to the musical Hamilton, Hamilton Jr., okay?"
00:28:44,00:28:47,"That's the sequel, because the story"
00:28:47,00:28:50,of Alexander Hamilton Jr. is extraordinary.
00:28:50,00:28:53,He was obviously from a family destroyed
00:28:53,00:28:56,by two deaths as a result of gun-jeweling.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"His sister, sadly, lost her mind"
00:28:58,00:29:00,"off the back of her father, dying."
00:29:00,00:29:03,"He was sort of grew up in a broken household,"
00:29:03,00:29:04,but he rose above it all
00:29:04,00:29:06,and became this extraordinary character.
00:29:06,00:29:08,So he was someone who eventually went on
00:29:08,00:29:11,to become a colonel fighting against Napoleon.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"He sailed to Spain in 1811,"
00:29:13,00:29:15,and he was fighting with the first Duke of Wellington.
00:29:15,00:29:17,He came back to America.
00:29:17,00:29:18,He became a lawyer.
00:29:18,00:29:20,He was a big part of Wall Street
00:29:20,00:29:22,when he became a real estate agent
00:29:22,00:29:24,and built that up as well.
00:29:24,00:29:25,And it's full of little cameos.
00:29:25,00:29:27,It's a great story where when he was just traveling
00:29:27,00:29:28,"in the West, he met Abraham Lincoln,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"who was at that point a state legislator,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,nowhere near being coming president.
00:29:32,00:29:33,"He met him in a grocery store,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,where he said Lincoln was lying on the counter
00:29:35,00:29:37,in the midday telling stories.
00:29:37,00:29:41,"Just laying there, just given a yarn of what was going on."
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- Wow, was there a cue?"
00:29:43,00:29:45,"I mean, that's very annoying if you're third of the UK."
00:29:45,00:29:47,You're trying to buy a broccoli.
00:29:47,00:29:49,Some lunatic sprawled out on the counter.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"- Honest Dave, shut up."
00:29:51,00:29:55,"- Dan, would you call it Hamilton?"
00:29:55,00:29:57,"As in, I'm just trying to work out what it would be called."
00:29:57,00:29:59,"Like, is it Hamilton with two L's in the middle,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,Hamill or Tom? - Oh yeah.
00:30:01,00:30:04,"- Or is it Hamill two on, which is where?"
00:30:04,00:30:08,"- Yes, you've put the two in place of the T at the end, yeah."
00:30:08,00:30:09,- Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:12,"- Hamilton. - That's better, that's better."
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Hamilton.
00:30:13,00:30:14,- Nice.
00:30:14,00:30:16,"- Their descendants, Hamilton's and Burst descendants,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,are now friends with each other.
00:30:18,00:30:19,They know each other.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"I think they live in New York,"
00:30:22,00:30:23,or they certainly did a while ago.
00:30:23,00:30:28,They met Alexandra Hamilton Woods and Antonio Burr.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"They met at a party in 2007,"
00:30:30,00:30:33,and they worked out that they had a familial connection.
00:30:33,00:30:35,And they would go kayaking together.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"- Yeah, they're part of this."
00:30:36,00:30:38,"So they're both psychoanalysts,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"and they met at a big psychoanalyst party,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"and they were introduced, and because of the surnames,"
00:30:42,00:30:43,"they were like, ""Any chance,"
00:30:43,00:30:46,"""Alexandra Hamilton, that you are related?"""
00:30:46,00:30:48,And it turned out she was.
00:30:48,00:30:51,"And he said that he's part of this kayaking club,"
00:30:51,00:30:52,"which kayaks on the Hudson,"
00:30:52,00:30:56,which is the river that Hamilton and Burr had to cross
00:30:56,00:30:58,in order to get to their dueling spot.
00:30:58,00:31:01,So they actually do kayak very near to the spot
00:31:01,00:31:03,where the duel happened together.
00:31:03,00:31:04,And they're both--
00:31:04,00:31:06,"- God, that must be tense, surely."
00:31:06,00:31:07,"- Yeah, surely."
00:31:07,00:31:09,- One of them just starts reaching into the bottom
00:31:09,00:31:11,of the kayak and pulling out a pistol.
00:31:11,00:31:12,Remember this?
00:31:12,00:31:14,They do have to get into arguments
00:31:14,00:31:15,"with each other sometimes in debate,"
00:31:15,00:31:17,"because they're both part of the Inwood Canoe Club,"
00:31:17,00:31:18,"you know, the high board."
00:31:18,00:31:20,"So he's one of them's a treasurer,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,and Burr is the president emeritus.
00:31:22,00:31:23,So--
00:31:23,00:31:25,- But finally became president.
00:31:25,00:31:26,That's nice.
00:31:26,00:31:30,"- It's not quite the high stakes battles of yore, is it?"
00:31:30,00:31:31,- No.
00:31:31,00:31:32,- Canoe club.
00:31:32,00:31:33,"- One thing I do love about Aaron Burr,"
00:31:33,00:31:35,"and because you've got me on the show,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,"I feel this is fitting for me to bring up,"
00:31:37,00:31:42,"but in 1861, a piece of erotica was published,"
00:31:42,00:31:43,all about Aaron Burr.
00:31:43,00:31:44,- Really?
00:31:44,00:31:46,"- Really, this is true."
00:31:46,00:31:48,It was called The Amorous Intrigues
00:31:48,00:31:50,and Adventures of Aaron Burr.
00:31:50,00:31:52,And 'cause he had quite a reputation
00:31:52,00:31:53,"for being a womanizer,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,"I think you mentioned earlier, Dan,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"and a lot of his enemies, including Hamilton,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,"who was also a bit of a womanizer himself,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,would often kind of use that as a reason to attack him.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"And so some anonymous person,"
00:32:02,00:32:06,"could it have been Alexander Hamilton II or whoever,"
00:32:06,00:32:10,wrote this sexy book all about Aaron Burr.
00:32:10,00:32:11,- Have you read it?
00:32:11,00:32:13,"- I tried to find some so that I could read it out,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,"Al and my dad wrote a porno,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,but I just couldn't find it anywhere.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"- Good news, I found out about this book as well,"
00:32:19,00:32:20,"and I did find an extract,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,so I'm gonna put it in the chat here.
00:32:22,00:32:24,- Okay.
00:32:24,00:32:27,(upbeat music)
00:32:28,00:32:30,(upbeat music)
00:32:30,00:32:35,- The warm-hearted girl sighed heavily.
00:32:35,00:32:38,"There was a choking sensation in her throat,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,"and her large, dark eyes were rolled up in her head"
00:32:41,00:32:44,with such a softness in their expression
00:32:44,00:32:48,that Burr must have been more or less than man.
00:32:48,00:32:50,"God, this is worse than my dad's."
00:32:50,00:32:53,Not to have desired a more intimate acquaintance with her.
00:32:53,00:32:56,Burr threw up.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"Oh, sorry, Burr threw up her clothes."
00:32:58,00:33:01,(laughing)
00:33:01,00:33:04,"- It's very niche kind of porno, I've got to hear."
00:33:04,00:33:06,"- Burr threw up, different line, guys."
00:33:06,00:33:09,Burr threw up her clothes and revealed such charms
00:33:09,00:33:13,as seldom have been exposed to the light of the sun.
00:33:13,00:33:14,"Oh, that's beautiful."
00:33:14,00:33:17,"The smooth, round belly,"
00:33:17,00:33:22,"the voluminous yet compact thighs,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"the robust calf and small foot and ankle,"
00:33:25,00:33:28,the satin smoothness of the skin
00:33:28,00:33:31,and other graces not to be mentioned.
00:33:31,00:33:32,"Well, it's erotica, mate, mention them."
00:33:32,00:33:34,That's what we're here for.
00:33:34,00:33:34,(laughing)
00:33:34,00:33:35,But who's pouting--
00:33:35,00:33:37,- I'm trying to curse you now.
00:33:37,00:33:40,- But who's pouting and most freshness
00:33:40,00:33:43,"betokened a guarded virginity,"
00:33:43,00:33:47,"which, however, longed for the pressure of manhood."
00:33:47,00:33:50,All these so fired him with passion
00:33:50,00:33:53,that he had scarcely the necessary patience
00:33:53,00:33:57,to prepare himself for the amorous encounter.
00:33:57,00:33:57,Burr.
00:33:57,00:34:00,- It's hot.
00:34:00,00:34:02,- It's hot. - That is hot.
00:34:02,00:34:03,- A red worse.
00:34:03,00:34:04,- I don't know if I would be happy
00:34:04,00:34:06,that this is how he's gonna be remembered
00:34:06,00:34:09,'cause I'm finding it impossible to divorce the real Aaron Burr
00:34:09,00:34:11,from that fictional account now.
00:34:11,00:34:12,(laughing)
00:34:12,00:34:15,"Do you guys know the woman who,"
00:34:15,00:34:17,"he was divorcing, who Burr was divorcing"
00:34:17,00:34:19,"in this original fact, Eliza Jumel?"
00:34:19,00:34:21,So she was kind of interesting.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"She was very much gossiped about,"
00:34:23,00:34:25,I bet there's some fan porn fiction about her
00:34:25,00:34:26,around and about.
00:34:26,00:34:27,And she was--
00:34:27,00:34:28,"- Oh, I'm sure she's in the book."
00:34:28,00:34:31,"- She must be in the book, actually, right."
00:34:31,00:34:36,"She was very poor and she married up above her station,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,"this very rich man called Stephen, Stephen Jumel."
00:34:39,00:34:42,"And then he died, apparently, according to reports,"
00:34:42,00:34:45,"falling off a hay cart and onto a pitchfork,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,which sounds almost completely implausible.
00:34:48,00:34:50,(laughing)
00:34:50,00:34:52,"- That's someone who's stabbed him with a pitchfork,"
00:34:52,00:34:55,hastily positioning him so he looks
00:34:55,00:34:57,like he fell off the hay cart.
00:34:57,00:34:57,Come on.
00:34:57,00:34:59,- Just put the pitchfork facing up
00:34:59,00:35:03,"with his body at the top, oh, that was suspect."
00:35:03,00:35:05,"Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, the rumor spread"
00:35:05,00:35:08,"that she killed him and then let him bleed out,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,so all these rumors about her.
00:35:10,00:35:13,"And she, so she then divorced Burr,"
00:35:13,00:35:14,"but the other thing about her is,"
00:35:14,00:35:15,"and this is why I think Burr's quite exciting,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,'cause he's been responsible for two
00:35:17,00:35:18,of the greatest pieces of entertainment
00:35:18,00:35:20,of the last 10 years.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"'Cause after divorcing Burr and Burr dying,"
00:35:22,00:35:26,she employed in New York a housekeeper called Ann Northup.
00:35:26,00:35:30,"And Ann Northup is the wife of Solomon,"
00:35:30,00:35:34,"Solomon Northup, who was the person in 12 Years of the Slaves"
00:35:34,00:35:37,"who was abducted and sold into slavery,"
00:35:37,00:35:38,and that was Solomon Northup.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"So while her husband was missing,"
00:35:40,00:35:43,Ann Northup was working for Eliza Dhumel.
00:35:43,00:35:44,So how cool is that?
00:35:44,00:35:47,"They were sort of a duo together for a while, a double act."
00:35:47,00:35:48,- That's amazing.
00:35:48,00:35:50,"- And then she lived in the oldest mansion in New York,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,"which is now a hotbed for ghost hunters, Dan,"
00:35:52,00:35:53,if you're ever there.
00:35:53,00:35:57,"- Yeah, well, actually, I read a book by Hans Holzer,"
00:35:57,00:36:00,who is the person who Ghostbusters is based on.
00:36:00,00:36:04,"And he says that when Hamilton was shot,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,he went back to a house in New York
00:36:06,00:36:09,"and supposedly the house that he died in,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"the ghost of Hamilton still haunts,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,and Hans Holzer went to investigate that.
00:36:13,00:36:17,"And if you go to this house in New York these days,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,"what you need to listen out for is the toilet flushing,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,"because apparently Hamilton is obsessed with toilets,"
00:36:22,00:36:25,because it's a technology he didn't know in his days.
00:36:25,00:36:27,This is the thing they say about ghosts generally.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Ghosts are obsessed-- - What?
00:36:28,00:36:32,- Ghosts apparently are obsessed with toilets
00:36:32,00:36:34,and flushing them.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"So if you hear a rogue toilet flush in that house,"
00:36:36,00:36:37,it could be Hamilton.
00:36:37,00:36:40,"- It's not Hamilton, but it could be, I suppose,"
00:36:40,00:36:41,if we're gonna stretch.
00:36:41,00:36:43,- According to Hans Holzer is what I'm saying.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"- Yeah, sure, sure."
00:36:45,00:36:46,- It's a big caveat.
00:36:46,00:36:48,"So you're saying ghost today,"
00:36:48,00:36:50,"they come to the future and they've got the internet,"
00:36:50,00:36:52,"they've got aeroplanes, they've got space travel,"
00:36:52,00:36:55,"they've got microwaves, they've got cars and trains."
00:36:55,00:36:58,"And you're saying the flush of a toilet,"
00:36:58,00:36:59,"that's what astonishes them,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"which I believe the flushing toilet,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,some sort of flushing toilet was invented
00:37:03,00:37:04,"in the Zebethan times, wasn't it?"
00:37:04,00:37:06,Is that the only thing that can impress them?
00:37:06,00:37:08,- I don't know why you say I'm claiming this.
00:37:08,00:37:11,"All I mean is passing on Hans Holzer,"
00:37:11,00:37:14,legendary ghost hunters knowledge.
00:37:14,00:37:16,But we're blaming the messenger here again.
00:37:16,00:37:19,"- And also, ghosts can't hold things or touch it."
00:37:19,00:37:20,How could they operate a toilet?
00:37:20,00:37:21,It makes no sense.
00:37:21,00:37:24,"- Oh, no, I mean, they can, they can smash mirrors"
00:37:24,00:37:25,and they can--
00:37:25,00:37:26,- They're poltergeist.
00:37:26,00:37:27,"- Poltergeist, no, you're very confused there."
00:37:27,00:37:29,- I don't believe I've been well-behaved poltergeist
00:37:29,00:37:31,to an only-interested sanitation.
00:37:31,00:37:33,(laughing)
00:37:33,00:37:35,(upbeat music)
00:37:35,00:37:41,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:37:41,00:37:43,and that is Andy.
00:37:43,00:37:45,- My fact is that the police in Paris
00:37:45,00:37:48,"have an elite unit of cops who are armed,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,but also on roller blades.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"- Ah, yes they are."
00:37:52,00:37:53,- Yeah.
00:37:53,00:37:54,"- Actually, when you said this fact,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,"I wanna know what you mean by elite,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,'cause that sounds like something they tell the cops
00:37:58,00:38:00,to reassure them they don't have like complete twerks
00:38:00,00:38:01,on roller blades.
00:38:01,00:38:02,"- Yeah, that's so fair."
00:38:02,00:38:05,I think maybe I mean niche unit of cops.
00:38:05,00:38:07,(laughing)
00:38:07,00:38:09,"- The ones that are useless to anything else, yeah."
00:38:09,00:38:11,(laughing)
00:38:11,00:38:13,"- So, are they real cops, right?"
00:38:13,00:38:14,- They're not cops.
00:38:14,00:38:15,- They're not token.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"- No, they have guns and truncheons"
00:38:17,00:38:20,"and they, I mean, there aren't very many of them,"
00:38:20,00:38:23,"you know, compared with the overall Parisian police force,"
00:38:23,00:38:24,but they are--
00:38:24,00:38:24,"- Well, they're elite, yeah."
00:38:24,00:38:25,"- They are real, yeah."
00:38:25,00:38:27,They have been going for about 20 years.
00:38:27,00:38:30,There are just eight members of this unit.
00:38:30,00:38:35,"I know, it's extremely elite, yeah."
00:38:35,00:38:37,"It's very hard to recruit into, obviously,"
00:38:37,00:38:38,'cause you need someone who's unbelievably good
00:38:38,00:38:42,"at rollerblading, but they do have advantages"
00:38:42,00:38:44,in urban police work.
00:38:44,00:38:46,"They can go about 30 kilometers an hour normally,"
00:38:46,00:38:48,"'cause they're quite heavily weighed down,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"but if they really get a move on,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,"they can get up to about 50 kilometers an hour,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,"they claim, which is a lot faster than someone can run."
00:38:55,00:38:58,"- Yeah, although as soon as that someone runs over cobblestones,"
00:38:58,00:38:59,they're in serious trouble.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"- Yeah, they're stuffed, they can't,"
00:39:01,00:39:02,they really hate cobblestones.
00:39:02,00:39:04,(laughing)
00:39:04,00:39:07,- A similar scheme was piloted in London in 2000.
00:39:07,00:39:09,The Royal Parks Constabulary attempted to use them
00:39:09,00:39:11,"in Kensington Gardens, but it was abandoned"
00:39:11,00:39:13,"because the minute someone ran on grass,"
00:39:13,00:39:17,"they were screwed, 'cause equally, like cobblestones,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,"rollerblading, not so great on grass."
00:39:19,00:39:21,"- I can't believe they put them in the Royal Parks though,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,which are mostly the grass.
00:39:23,00:39:24,- It's very much in the name.
00:39:24,00:39:25,- It's a predominantly grass environment.
00:39:25,00:39:27,- Should we go for the parks in the gardens for this?
00:39:27,00:39:28,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:39:28,00:39:29,"- Well, what about the beaches?"
00:39:29,00:39:31,Let's do the beaches.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"- If they just put some clay in there as well,"
00:39:33,00:39:35,it would have been perfect.
00:39:35,00:39:38,It is a ridiculous idea because it's only useful
00:39:38,00:39:40,if you have to give chase against someone
00:39:40,00:39:41,and immediately get them.
00:39:41,00:39:43,"Any other situation of policing,"
00:39:43,00:39:46,coming in with rollerblades is just ridiculous.
00:39:46,00:39:47,"And these guys in Paris,"
00:39:47,00:39:49,they are used for different situations.
00:39:49,00:39:52,They're sometimes asked to go and police other bits
00:39:52,00:39:54,outside of just the main street.
00:39:54,00:39:56,"So sometimes they have to go and stop, you know,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,fighting that's going on in a building.
00:39:58,00:40:00,"And in the thing I read that like,"
00:40:00,00:40:02,sometimes we have to go up to the fifth floor.
00:40:02,00:40:03,There's no elevator.
00:40:03,00:40:06,"We're there in our rollerblades, going up the stairs,"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"and then we're arriving at the scene on rollerblades,"
00:40:09,00:40:11,which no one can take seriously.
00:40:11,00:40:14,"- Hang on, do you think surely if you're on the fifth floor,"
00:40:14,00:40:16,"it depends how many floors it is, but if it's five,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,"I'm definitely taking off my rollerblades,"
00:40:18,00:40:19,"running up the stairs, then putting them back on"
00:40:19,00:40:20,"at the top, aren't you?"
00:40:20,00:40:23,- There's probably a guideline about how many floors
00:40:23,00:40:25,it's acceptable to take off your blades for.
00:40:25,00:40:26,"- You're so right, yeah."
00:40:26,00:40:28,Rollerblading is very much something
00:40:28,00:40:31,that shoots up and down in popularity
00:40:31,00:40:32,"in one year, it'll be super popular."
00:40:32,00:40:35,But I remember going on French holidays with my friend
00:40:35,00:40:36,when we were kids.
00:40:36,00:40:39,"And we used to rollerblade a lot then,"
00:40:39,00:40:40,but I haven't seen much of it since.
00:40:40,00:40:44,"And it's basically since the mid 19th century, isn't it?"
00:40:44,00:40:47,"Since it first took off, which was 1863,"
00:40:47,00:40:49,and this is when a guy called James Leonard Plimpton
00:40:49,00:40:52,invented roller skates that actually worked.
00:40:52,00:40:56,"So before that, you couldn't really go around corners."
00:40:56,00:40:59,And he finally invented wheels that were kind of attached
00:40:59,00:41:01,"to a cushioned springy platform,"
00:41:01,00:41:02,and also two rows of wheels rather than one.
00:41:02,00:41:04,"So skates, not blades."
00:41:04,00:41:08,"And it took off overnight, and it became this mad craze"
00:41:08,00:41:11,"to the extent that in 1885, in Scientific American,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,"there was an article that was roller skating,"
00:41:13,00:41:16,"The Medical View, which was analyzing why it was"
00:41:16,00:41:20,that America got so obsessed with certain things.
00:41:20,00:41:22,"And it started, it was such a good article,"
00:41:22,00:41:24,and it rang so true for today.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"It started, ""We hear of no other country"
00:41:26,00:41:30,"so violently perturbed by waves of temperance crusading,"
00:41:30,00:41:34,"religious revivals, velocity crazes, pedestrianism."""
00:41:34,00:41:36,"No one walked, apparently before that."
00:41:36,00:41:40,"And now, roller skating, which exceeds all the others,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,and it was an analysis of how it had managed
00:41:42,00:41:43,"to become such a mad craze,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,and whether it was medically harmful.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"And I concluded, no."
00:41:47,00:41:48,"- Oh, it's safe."
00:41:48,00:41:49,"It's safe, guys, thank God."
00:41:49,00:41:50,"- Oh, thank God."
00:41:50,00:41:52,"- It's safe, yeah, Andy, you can keep them on."
00:41:52,00:41:53,- Thank you.
00:41:53,00:41:56,"- We should say, by the way, we keep saying roller blades,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,"and the reality, which I only just found out"
00:41:59,00:42:01,"through researching this, is that it's a brand name."
00:42:01,00:42:04,It's not the sport itself.
00:42:05,00:42:06,It's a trademark name.
00:42:06,00:42:09,"It's a single manufacturer that make roller blades,"
00:42:09,00:42:11,and the rest of it is called inline skating.
00:42:11,00:42:13,"- Inline skating, that's the generic term."
00:42:13,00:42:14,"- So, that's what we should be saying."
00:42:14,00:42:15,"- Okay, nice."
00:42:15,00:42:18,"- Yeah, we should redo this fact,"
00:42:18,00:42:21,because we don't know they're wearing roller blades.
00:42:21,00:42:23,"- No, you're right."
00:42:23,00:42:24,"Oh, God."
00:42:24,00:42:26,- That's some budget police version.
00:42:26,00:42:33,- The guy who created the first popular inline skates
00:42:33,00:42:34,was a guy called Scott Olson.
00:42:34,00:42:37,"He was a hockey player, and he made them in 1979."
00:42:37,00:42:38,"They had been patented before,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,"and in fact, he was beaten by 20 years"
00:42:40,00:42:43,"by this lady from Palm Beach called Emma DeSaro,"
00:42:43,00:42:45,who got a patent on inline skates.
00:42:45,00:42:48,"She had the idea, and then the patent expired,"
00:42:48,00:42:50,and she never made a penny out of it.
00:42:50,00:42:51,She was-- - No!
00:42:51,00:42:53,- They interviewed her years after
00:42:53,00:42:55,"rollerblading had become a huge thing,"
00:42:55,00:42:57,"and she said, ""Well, I'm obviously glad"
00:42:57,00:43:00,"""everyone's rollerblading, but I did have the idea"
00:43:00,00:43:00,"""of painting."""
00:43:00,00:43:02,"It's really a sad thing, yeah."
00:43:02,00:43:03,- Bless her.
00:43:03,00:43:04,- I know.
00:43:04,00:43:05,- You haven't invented anything else?
00:43:05,00:43:07,- No.
00:43:07,00:43:08,"No, not as far as I know."
00:43:08,00:43:09,"They weren't interviewing her, saying,"
00:43:09,00:43:11,"""We're off to be Emma DeSaro in her mansion,"""
00:43:11,00:43:16,which she got after she invented thermodores or whatever.
00:43:16,00:43:17,I don't know.
00:43:17,00:43:18,"- I can, but dream."
00:43:18,00:43:19,She did one day create something
00:43:19,00:43:20,that we all live day to day.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"- I know, I know."
00:43:22,00:43:24,"But so Olson, that's Scott Olson, the hockey player,"
00:43:24,00:43:27,he has invented so many other silly sports
00:43:27,00:43:28,and means of getting around.
00:43:28,00:43:30,He's a bit of a hero.
00:43:30,00:43:33,"So he was, I think, the guy behind the rollerblade company,"
00:43:33,00:43:34,but then had terrible legal fallings out
00:43:34,00:43:35,"and there were sheet, like, ructions"
00:43:35,00:43:38,and he got kicked out and it was all very chaotic.
00:43:38,00:43:40,- Looks like Steve Jobs.
00:43:40,00:43:40,- Pretty much.
00:43:40,00:43:43,"So in 1996, you made the row bike,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,which is a bike with these kind of push-pull handles
00:43:45,00:43:47,and that's how you propel yourself along.
00:43:47,00:43:48,- Yeah.
00:43:48,00:43:48,- Very exciting.
00:43:48,00:43:51,"He's made the sky ride, which is a rollercoaster,"
00:43:51,00:43:54,but you have to pedal yourself around it.
00:43:54,00:43:56,(laughing)
00:43:56,00:44:01,This huge track suspended 150 feet up
00:44:01,00:44:04,and you get at the thing and you just have to pedal away.
00:44:04,00:44:08,"It's better than it sounds guys, it looks really fun."
00:44:08,00:44:10,- Do you have a sort of safety net or something?
00:44:10,00:44:11,"I mean, how high up are you for that?"
00:44:11,00:44:13,"- 150 feet, you're pretty high up."
00:44:13,00:44:15,- You must have a harness or something.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"- Yeah, I have, yes, I imagine there are some basic"
00:44:18,00:44:19,safety precautions they say.
00:44:19,00:44:21,"- I mean, 'cause I can't get across monkey bars these days,"
00:44:21,00:44:23,that's actually terrifying.
00:44:23,00:44:28,"- You're sitting in a pod, you're sitting in a pod."
00:44:28,00:44:30,- You do thing with all inventors.
00:44:30,00:44:33,"All great inventions, the key is, if there are enough darts,"
00:44:33,00:44:35,"one of them is gonna strike, because every inventor,"
00:44:35,00:44:37,"you look at their history and you go,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,"God, they invented a lot of shit, didn't they?"
00:44:39,00:44:41,"In amongst this whole penicillin thing,"
00:44:41,00:44:45,they invented fluffy bicycles or whatever.
00:44:45,00:44:48,"So the original inventor of roller blades, in fact,"
00:44:48,00:44:50,"which preceded roller skates by about 100 years,"
00:44:50,00:44:52,"was a guy called John Joseph Merlin,"
00:44:52,00:44:53,who we've mentioned before.
00:44:53,00:44:55,And we've mentioned him in the context of
00:44:55,00:44:57,when he invented his blades to publicize his other
00:44:57,00:44:59,"inventions, he showed them off by"
00:44:59,00:45:02,blading straight into a mirror and smashing it.
00:45:02,00:45:04,So they didn't take off at all.
00:45:04,00:45:07,"But his other inventions were kind of cool,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,"he invented a rotating tea table,"
00:45:09,00:45:12,"and this worked by having the teapot,"
00:45:12,00:45:15,"or like the samovar, that poured the tea in the middle,"
00:45:15,00:45:18,"and then he had all the cups around the outside,"
00:45:18,00:45:20,"and your hostess could spin the samovar,"
00:45:20,00:45:23,"which would pour and fill all the cups,"
00:45:23,00:45:25,by just operating a pedal under the table.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"- Oh, that's great."
00:45:26,00:45:29,"- The lazy, lazy woman didn't even have to stand up"
00:45:29,00:45:30,and pour the tea.
00:45:30,00:45:32,(laughing)
00:45:32,00:45:34,That was the start of women's day.
00:45:34,00:45:36,"- I think he was attributed as well with inventing,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,"if you go on a merry-go-round,"
00:45:38,00:45:41,it used to be a stagnant horse that would go around
00:45:41,00:45:43,"the whole way, and he, I think,"
00:45:43,00:45:47,invented the up and down motion of a merry-go-round horse.
00:45:47,00:45:49,- It's the best bit of a merry-go-round.
00:45:49,00:45:50,"- That's not the best bit, Jamie."
00:45:50,00:45:51,- It is.
00:45:51,00:45:52,"- Come on, come on, it is."
00:45:52,00:45:53,- Come on.
00:45:53,00:45:54,- It's about the going around in a circle.
00:45:54,00:45:57,- The best bit is the going round.
00:45:57,00:45:59,"- There's only one way to test this, all right?"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"You both have to create your own merry-go-rounds,"
00:46:01,00:46:03,one where the horse moves in a circle
00:46:03,00:46:05,"and stays on the horizontal plane,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,"and the other way, it just goes up and down"
00:46:07,00:46:08,and doesn't move around in a circle.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"And you'll open one next to each other,"
00:46:10,00:46:12,and you'll see who gets more punters.
00:46:12,00:46:15,"- Oh my god, this is the Feder and Nadal court"
00:46:15,00:46:19,"of up and down, circular entertainment."
00:46:19,00:46:20,- It is.
00:46:20,00:46:22,"- The problem with the one where you stay in one spot,"
00:46:22,00:46:23,"the horse goes up and down,"
00:46:23,00:46:26,and you have to wave at your mum all the way through the ride.
00:46:26,00:46:28,(laughing)
00:46:28,00:46:31,"I have one last really stupid thing of Rollerblades,"
00:46:31,00:46:34,which is a 2016 report of the Wiltshire police
00:46:34,00:46:37,about the 999 calls they got.
00:46:37,00:46:40,One of their operators said that she'd taken a call
00:46:40,00:46:42,from someone who'd been out rollerblading at night
00:46:42,00:46:45,who wanted an officer to come and pick them up
00:46:45,00:46:48,because the caller had come across a very steep hill
00:46:48,00:46:49,"that they couldn't rollerblade up,"
00:46:49,00:46:51,and they went out stranded.
00:46:51,00:46:54,"- Okay, that's the sort of thing that I would do"
00:46:54,00:46:55,"to be fair, come on."
00:46:55,00:46:56,(laughing)
00:46:56,00:46:57,"- The operator said,"
00:46:57,00:47:00,"""I ascertained that the caller was not very far from home"
00:47:00,00:47:02,and suggested that she contact a friend
00:47:02,00:47:04,"or a family member to pick her up instead."""
00:47:04,00:47:06,- Or take them off.
00:47:06,00:47:08,- The old take them off has come back in.
00:47:08,00:47:09,- Oh my god.
00:47:09,00:47:12,- Why not take them off?
00:47:12,00:47:14,- We got an email once from a guy called Marcus
00:47:14,00:47:15,"that I don't think I've ever mentioned,"
00:47:15,00:47:17,"but it's such a good fact, which is that,"
00:47:17,00:47:19,so in some countries you call different numbers
00:47:19,00:47:21,"for a different emergency service,"
00:47:21,00:47:24,"and in Chad, the number you call for police is 17,"
00:47:24,00:47:27,and the number you call for the fire department is 19.
00:47:27,00:47:28,And what do you think the number is
00:47:28,00:47:30,that you call for an ambulance?
00:47:30,00:47:31,- 21.
00:47:31,00:47:33,"- 17, 19, 21."
00:47:33,00:47:34,"- Oh, I like that logic."
00:47:34,00:47:36,I would have guessed 18.
00:47:36,00:47:38,"It is in fact, 2251, 424."
00:47:38,00:47:41,(laughing)
00:47:41,00:47:43,(upbeat music)
00:47:43,00:47:47,"- Okay, that's it."
00:47:47,00:47:48,That's all of our facts.
00:47:48,00:47:50,Thank you so much for listening.
