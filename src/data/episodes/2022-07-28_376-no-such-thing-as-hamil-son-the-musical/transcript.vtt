00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.360
 Before we begin, we just wanna let you know

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.040
 that James is away this week, and so in his place,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.840
 we've got a really good buddy of ours.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.200
 It is Jamie Morton, the co-host of My Dad wrote a porno.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.560
 I'm sure you're all aware of My Dad wrote a porno,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.440
 one of the biggest British podcasts out there,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.840
 and they've just launched their sixth series.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.240
 There are a couple of episodes in, do check it out.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.200
 It is incredibly funny, it is incredibly rude,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.600
 and maybe even go back to the first series

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.160
 and work your way up there, because it's a long narrative

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.280
 and it is so worth the journey.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.800
 They are obviously juggernauts,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.720
 it's not just the podcast that they do.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.200
 You can also find tickets

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.240
 to their upcoming live tours online.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.720
 Why not check out their HBO special as well.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.120
 They've even just released some tie-in beers.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880
 There's My Dad wrote a porno ale

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.040
 that you can get now online, so do find that as well.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.480
 And you can actually see the whole team,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 Alice Levine and James Cooper and Jamie joining us online.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.040
 If you go to YouTube for the comic relief special

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.800
 that we did a few months back, the full team is there

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.160
 and we had a great chat.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.680
 And we had an amazing chat with Jamie on this episode.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.720
 So I hope you enjoy, do check their new series out

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 and on with the show.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.300
 (lively music)

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.000
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.640
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.480
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.880
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.680
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.000
 Anna Tyshinski, and it's our special guest,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.480
 our good friend, co-host of My Dad wrote a porno,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.960
 Jamie Morton.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.520
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.440
 Starting with fact number one, and that's you, Jamie.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.360
 - My fact is in 2007, tennis legends Roger Federer

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 and Raphael Nadal played a match on a court

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.780
 that was 50% grass and 50% clay.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.540
 - Like a Frankencourt.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.440
 - Exactly that.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.880
 Basically they were both, and still kind of are,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.520
 seen as the greatest on clay and grass,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.120
 Rafa being the best on clay,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.640
 Roger being the best on grass.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.880
 And so they thought, why not combine the services

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.080
 and see who is the ultimate tennis player?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.600
 This was the idea.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.680
 - It's worth saying though, it's not a combination

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.200
 of grass and clay, like some new court that's been made.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.920
 It's literally, and you can see photos

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.560
 or watch it online even, half of it is solid grass.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.200
 And then if you cross the court, it's solid clay.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.040
 It's the most bizarre looking.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.680
 - It's so stupid. - It's wonderful.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.480
 - Exactly, let me give you some kind of background to them.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.360
 Nadal had kind of emerged as the first real rival

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.200
 to Roger Federer.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.640
 Roger Federer was basically beating everybody,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.960
 and then Raphael Nadal came along in 2005,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.760
 started to beat him on a lot of services, but never on grass.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.880
 So he had won 48 straight matches on grass,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.520
 and he was undefeated on the surface for five years.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.280
 Five years undefeated on grass, that's insane.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.760
 At the same point, Nadal had won 72 straight matches on clay,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.800
 and he was three years undefeated.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.600
 So they really were coming at the peak of their powers

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.760
 on both surfaces.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.680
 - Yeah, the match ended in a tie break as well.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.080
 So it was meant to be a friendly, it was an exhibition match,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.880
 but the guys took it very seriously,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.280
 and Nadal took the first set, Federer the second,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.320
 and then they went to a tie break in the third,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.040
 and that's where Nadal took it.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.400
 - It was very close, and also a lot of Federer fans

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.440
 were bitching about the fact

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.640
 that the grass wasn't proper grass.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.840
 They had a bit of a worm infestation in the day before

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.520
 the match was supposed to take place.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.240
 Yeah, and it kind of buggered up all the grass.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.000
 They had to get some putting green grass put in overnight.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.320
 And so it was kind of like a carpet of grass

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.760
 that wasn't really grass at all.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.360
 So it wasn't really a fair test, guys, if you were at school.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.600
 - Didn't Federer say it at the end?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.800
 The court was great, especially the clay part of it.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.760
 It's an insane to contemplate that this is 2007,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.520
 and yeah, I agree, you know, you always think

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.320
 when Federer goes back into a Grand Slam,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.360
 hopefully he'll win again.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.360
 And I think he still won his last one in 2018.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.200
 And yet, this, in May 2007, he was exactly halfway through

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.320
 the number of Grand Slams that he'd won.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.360
 So he had won 10 of his 20 Grand Slams by that point,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.960
 whereas Nadal was just starting out.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.400
 - What's nice about them now is that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.680
 they've both got 20 Grand Slams.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.480
 It's almost like they should both retire now

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.640
 and just be equal forever.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.560
 'Cause this whole kind of conversation,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.440
 who's the greatest of all time,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.600
 it will go on and on and on.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.680
 I guess this was a kind of a gimmicky way

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.240
 to try and settle who was the best.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.480
 - Yeah, and no one ever says,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.440
 "Oh, actually, Nadal's officially the better player,"

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.880
 'cause he won that match on the half grass, half Play-Con 2007.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.360
 - Also, it is insane how these guys stay

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.200
 at the top of their game.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.320
 Do you remember there was that story

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.000
 of the guy who went in the coma,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.560
 and when he went in the coma,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.760
 Federer was number one in the world.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.520
 He was in it for 11 years,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.680
 and when he came out, Federer was still up there.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.640
 I think he was number two.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.080
 - Was that his first question when he came out?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080
 Is Federer still number one?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.920
 They said, "Yes."

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.080
 And he said, "Thank God, it must have just been

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080
 "a fortnight or something."

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.680
 - Well, he went into the coma in the first place

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.160
 because Federer accidentally knocked a ball into his head.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.240
 So it was a reasonable question

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.600
 to ask how's Federer doing.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.640
 - Just on weird tennis matches,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.320
 do you know that Andy Roddick once played a game of tennis

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.520
 with a frying pan instead of a racket?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.360
 - Wow, really?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.360
 - And I learned about this in a book called,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.960
 "Andy Roddick Beat Me with a Frying Pan,"

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.120
 which is actually an incredibly confusingly titled book

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.400
 because it's by a guy called Todd Gallagher,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.640
 and it's a book about all these sports questions

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.720
 that you wish could be answered.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.360
 Like, what would happen if the NBA raised the basket

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.760
 to 12 feet, or how good a pro golfer's at miniature golf?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.280
 And one of them is, what would happen if you gave

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.120
 an amazing tennis player a frying pan to play with?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.240
 Could I still beat him?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.960
 And the outcome is that the author beats Andy Roddick.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.840
 And I've never met a book where the title

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.120
 is just a direct lie once you read the actual contest.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.360
 (laughing)

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.320
 He says, the match like Roddick played really, really well,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.680
 but with a frying pan, it's quite difficult.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.040
 You can't put any spin on the ball.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.560
 You can't hit backhands, apparently,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.880
 which I would have thought you could just spin it around

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.760
 in your hand, but you can't hit backhands.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.600
 - Quite heavy.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.240
 - He could maneuver it around, but anyway, he struggled,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.200
 but he did give an interview afterwards saying,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.480
 he thought that if he got to practice a little bit,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.400
 he'd get used to it.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.640
 And indeed, for charity, he later that year, I think,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.040
 played another guy called Chris Wetzel,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.880
 who won this charity event, and he played him

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.360
 with a frying pan, and he did then win.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.920
 He actually thrashed him.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.760
 And so--

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.000
 - Andy Roddick, the title Andy Roddick beat Chris Wetzel

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.960
 with a frying pan is less intriguing

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.240
 than Andy Roddick beat me with a frying pan.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.080
 - That's a problem, yeah, but he didn't want

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.480
 to credit Chris Wetzel with writing the book

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.520
 that he'd written, so he's in a difficult place.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.200
 - Yeah, and he could have called it,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.520
 I beat Andy Roddick with a frying pan,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.520
 but it sounds, it sounds more menacing and fiery.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.280
 (laughs)

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.040
 - And it's a dangling modifier, isn't it?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.880
 It's very misleading.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.920
 It does imply that he's got the frying pan.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.720
 - Another amazingly weird match that occurred

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.760
 is the longest match in women's singles,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.720
 which lasted over six hours long,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.720
 but that's not the interesting bit about it.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.760
 Within that match was the longest single rally

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.880
 of tennis ever to occur.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.600
 So this was September 24th, 1984,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.880
 and this was the longest in terms of a pro match,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.200
 longest rally, how many shots do you think

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.520
 this rally went for?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.920
 - Shots, what?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.240
 - 160.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.720
 - Yeah, 110.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.360
 - Pretty good, pretty good.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.760
 - I'm gonna say a hundred.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.920
 - It lasted 29 minutes and it went for 643 shots.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.320
 - Oh my God.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.440
 Serena Williams has won matches in shorter time than that.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.400
 - Yeah, it was between Vicki Nelson Dunbar

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.680
 and Jean Hepner, and it was a set point for Hepner,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.200
 and it was in a tie break at the end of the match,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.600
 and it went 29 minutes long,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.800
 and Vicki Nelson managed to take it on the 643rd shot.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.640
 - Oh my God.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.680
 - Jean of the match.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.920
 - Oh, she would never have recovered for Jean.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.520
 - Oh, it was horrible.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.040
 Vicki Nelson immediately collapsed with cramps in her legs.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.080
 She was in so much pain.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.600
 And the umpire, the umpire,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.320
 gave her a time violation warning.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.160
 - No.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.120
 - Because she was taking too long

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.720
 to get back up for the next shot.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.560
 Yeah.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.720
 - They're so strict to those umpires.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.880
 It's just so unfair.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.720
 - Yeah.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.560
 - So unfair.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.600
 - That's insane that you could start watching

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.160
 an episode of EastEnders at the start of that rally

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.800
 and come out of that episode and be like,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.760
 "So what's happening in the match?"

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.440
 It's like, "Well, it's the same rally."

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.920
 - You could be in an extremely short coma

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.480
 and come out of the coma and say, "Who won that set?"

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.320
 We don't know.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.680
 - Are you okay, Andy?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.440
 - There's a lot of comas today.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280
 Are you all right?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.120
 (all laughing)

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.240
 Second coma of the day.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.080
 - Sorry.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.800
 Andy Roddick beat me with a frying pan.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.120
 (all laughing)

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.240
 Unfortunately.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.840
 - I do love the story of a really early tennis player

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.040
 called Suzanne Longlin.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.160
 Have you heard of this woman?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.000
 - No.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.880
 - She was basically the most famous woman in the world

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.120
 in the 1920s when tennis was quite the sport

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.280
 and everyone loved it.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.960
 And she was amazing.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.120
 She was the first number one female tennis player ever.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.760
 She won six women and titles,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.320
 including five in a row.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.480
 And from the First World War to her retirement in 1923,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.200
 she never lost a match,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.520
 except once when she retired.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.680
 She didn't lose it.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.000
 She just retired from the match.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.760
 But my favorite thing about her is that in between points,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.680
 she would sit and drink wine and cognac.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.640
 Because she felt that that was the only way

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.240
 she could play properly.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.080
 - Wow.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.200
 - In between points, not in between--

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.680
 - Well, changeovers, I guess.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.520
 Games.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.360
 - Okay, all right.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.040
 - That's 'cause you do get points docked

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.840
 for interrupting a point in order to have a drink.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.000
 I think that's pushing it.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.080
 - A cramp, you're not allowed,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.520
 but a drink of cognac is actually fine.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.000
 And she was so powerful

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.240
 in terms of getting people to come and see her

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.640
 that when she wanted to go and play in America,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.120
 the USTA conspired to circumnavigate

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.720
 the prohibition laws

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.320
 that would mean that she could actually drink in America.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.160
 - Oh, really?

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.980
 - So that she could take part in the tournament

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.400
 'cause she wouldn't play without drinking.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.520
 - Wow.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.280
 - That's amazing.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.080
 - The most watched tennis game of all time

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.640
 was The Battle of the Sexes.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.240
 The very famous match.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.240
 And so this was obviously the tennis game

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.920
 that's played between Polygyne King and Bobby Riggs

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.640
 to definitively decide whether a woman

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.600
 could be a man at tennis, quite bizarre concept.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.480
 But I had not realized how many people watched it.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.840
 90 million people tuned in to watch it.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.680
 - Wow.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.520
 - Wow.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.720
 - And Bobby Riggs said,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.240
 "It was the most disappointing,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.800
 "disheartening experience of my life losing."

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.960
 But she's kind of sad for him.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.040
 He was, and it wasn't even a victory for King

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.000
 because she was 29 and he was 55.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.080
 So it's quite hard to lord that over him.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.440
 She actually said to be a 55-year-old guy

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.240
 was no thrill for me at all.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.160
 The thrill was exposing a lot of new people to tennis.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.000
 - Okay.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.240
 - But yeah, everyone in straight sets.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.520
 - She said that it was never about the athleticism

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.440
 and she would say that

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.040
 'cause obviously quite the advantage.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.560
 She said it was about respect is what she said.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.240
 She wanted to prove that women could compete against men.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.080
 - Yeah.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.920
 - And she did that.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.840
 I mean, it was amazing.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.320
 - So speaking of greatest players of all time,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.840
 Anna recommended a book to me recently,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.240
 which I've ordered and I've just been reading reviews of it,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.040
 which is Andre Agassiz autobiography,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 which is said to be one of the greatest

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.800
 sort of tell-alls of recent years.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.240
 In the 90s, when he had his awesome long hair

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.120
 that was coming down from his bandana,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.840
 turns out that was a wig.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.480
 The whole time he was wearing a wig on the court.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.720
 I had no idea.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.760
 I mean, he was a hero in my day.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.400
 - But does it say why?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.040
 'Cause that must have been so annoying to play with a big,

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.120
 'cause it was a big wig.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120
 It was like a mullet wig.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.440
 'Cause a lot of hair at the back of your hair.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.280
 - A huge amount of hair at the back.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.240
 He was going bald and he didn't wanna go bald

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.480
 and he just thought he was less rock and roll

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.560
 and his hair was falling out in the shower

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.360
 and so on and he thought it's gonna look disgusting

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.000
 when it's in the grass and on the clay.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.280
 - I mean, sure, but like, why a mullet?

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.640
 Why so much, right?

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.880
 He's over-competiting with like...

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.360
 - He went all the way down his back.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.880
 - Look, he was an angry man.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.680
 There's no explaining his actions in those days.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.760
 Well, there is explaining it.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.040
 He was trained, almost tortured with the aim

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.880
 of making him a great tennis player, which he was.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.480
 But it's a brilliant book.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.960
 It's kind of a sad book.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.080
 He had so many issues back then.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.280
 So the bit of it that I remember

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.560
 is that he was married to Brooke Shields for a while

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.920
 and there was this scene in Friends,

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.040
 which people probably remember,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.400
 where Joey Tribbiani has a stalker.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.320
 So when he's on Days of Our Lives, he has a stalker

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.560
 who thinks that he's the real Dr. Drake Ramore

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.680
 and that stalker is played by Brooke Shields

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.680
 and she's a crazy, creepy stalker

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.040
 and she licks his hands at one point

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.680
 in this really crazy, creepy way.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.040
 And when Andre Agassi saw that scene,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.200
 he was so overwhelmed with hatred and jealousy

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.240
 that he drove home and he smashed all of his tennis trophies.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.040
 So all the tennis trophies he's won up until that point

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.320
 were completely destroyed.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.560
 So he smashed them to pieces.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.480
 -What? -Wow.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.120
 -He was an angry man. -And then she filed for divorce.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.840
 -Very quickly after that. -He lived happily ever after.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.640
 He's now made a steppy graph.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.160
 Like two of the greatest tennis players ever.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.360
 They're like two of the only people

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.120
 that have ever done the Golden Slam,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.640
 which is winning all four Grand Slams

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.960
 and the Olympic Gold Medal, and they're married.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.880
 -Strong. -Isn't that insane?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.200
 And both very fucked up by tennis.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.480
 I think that's what drew them together.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.200
 -It's a bond. -They kind of both hated tennis.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.200
 Yeah, exactly. That's a really good point.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.440
 Because they were both children of obsessed fathers

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.240
 with the game, right?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.760
 And apparently the two dads, when they met,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.600
 almost came to blows while arguing

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.560
 over who had the superior backhand technique.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.360
 -Did we? -It must have been a really fun wedding.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.680
 Hey, someone else who had a fun record

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.160
 was the only person ever to win the men's doubles,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.640
 the mixed doubles, and the men's singles at Wimbledon.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.680
 And that was Bobby Riggs.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.200
 And the fun thing about this,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.640
 so this guy who then lost to Billy Jean King,

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.800
 the fun thing about this was that this was in 1939,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.920
 but he was mostly known after that

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.000
 for being an inveterate gambler and a real rogue.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.320
 And we should say that he became friends with Billy Jean King,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.520
 so the whole misogynist thing was an act,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.000
 and they became very good friends afterwards,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.680
 and she spoke to him the day before he died.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.800
 So he was a rogue, so he was obsessed with gambling.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.480
 He put a bet on himself in 1939

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.640
 to win the men's doubles, the mixed doubles,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.200
 and the men's singles.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.880
 And this had never been done, never been done since.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.960
 And so he won $108,000,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.000
 so the equivalent of $1.5 million at the time.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.800
 -Yeah. -Wow.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.560
 And he only put... I think he put $500 on.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.920
 -Well done, Bobby. -Good on him.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.960
 Well, Billy Jean King said that he was always one of her heroes

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.720
 because he won that triple crown, I guess,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.960
 and it was a great tennis player.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.120
 And she said that she thought it was the fact

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.680
 that his career had been overshadowed

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.520
 by the Second World War that made him so bitter.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.520
 -Oh, really? -No one really remembered him.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.800
 And his achievements, 'cause that's a pretty major thing.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.480
 No one's done it since, and no one really gave him credit for it.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.760
 It was bigger news then, and it's bigger news now.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.280
 Yeah, you can't imagine much sympathy

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.280
 with the war veterans around the table.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.040
 Oh, God, my life is ruined by World War II as well.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040
 Tell me about it.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:45.160
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.840
 My fact this week is that when Britain invaded Iceland in 1940,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.400
 they knocked on all the doors before breaking them down

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.080
 and officially apologized for the inconvenience.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.480
 Chills. So proud.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.280
 So proud of my nation.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.280
 They have flasks of tea as well.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.920
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.440
 This was the British invasion of Iceland in 1940,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.640
 which I didn't know happened.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.280
 And so don't worry, it wasn't too big a deal.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.880
 And it was almost not an invasion.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.000
 It was basically an invasion

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.080
 because the Brits didn't tell Iceland about it.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.200
 So it was in May 1940, and it's called Operation Fork.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.200
 And basically, the Germans had their eyes on Iceland.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.000
 They'd just taken charge of Norway and Denmark.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.920
 And Iceland seemed like the obvious next step.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.320
 So the Brits thought, let's get there in advance of the Germans.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.000
 And they thought, if we ask the Icelandics if we can go in,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.800
 then they might say no, 'cause Iceland was very determinedly neutral.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.200
 They were really like, we're not getting involved

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.000
 with this whole war business, not a jam.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.800
 And so we thought they'll probably say no.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.160
 So let's just storm them, let's just invade.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.480
 So Britain invaded, but they invaded very politely.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.320
 So the British commander was a guy called Sturgis,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.920
 and he issued fliers immediately after getting there,

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.520
 apologizing sincerely for the inconvenience

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.840
 and saying, look, we're just saving you from the Germans.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.720
 Really, really sorry about this invasion.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.360
 And they took over communications,

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.160
 like any good invasion does, you know,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.840
 they seize radio communications and stuff like that.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.960
 But before breaking all the doors down to those buildings,

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.440
 they did knock on the doors.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.760
 And then once they've broken them down,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.360
 they showered the janitor with apologies, apparently,

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.600
 in the big radio building that they invaded.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.880
 - They didn't speak Icelandic,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.800
 so they would have been apologizing, I think,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.040
 in another language.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.360
 They may have had a translator with them,

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.320
 but they really--

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.920
 - It was the worst planned.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.280
 It's unbelievably shoddy reading this incredible account of it.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.120
 So they planned to invade in secret,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.000
 so they were sending a couple of detachments of troops,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.840
 several hundred troops.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.360
 I think about 700, maybe, was the invasion force.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.960
 And they thought they were departing from Scotland.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.800
 Greenock was the station they were getting to,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.600
 and they thought, let's be inconspicuous,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.320
 let's send the troops so they arrive staggered in Greenock,

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.000
 so it's not clear whether they're sending huge arms like us.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.200
 Exactly, really clever.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.400
 Unfortunately, due to delays on the line,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.840
 all the soldiers arrived in Greenock

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.240
 at exactly the same time.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.320
 It was manifestly obvious they were planning something big.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.160
 So--

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.320
 - That's even more British

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.200
 than the more apologizing, to be fair.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.120
 - Yes, the trains didn't work well.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.640
 - Yeah, nothing wrong on time.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.960
 - Andy, didn't they also--

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.720
 The idea was let's invade by night,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.760
 but in May, in that bit of the year,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.320
 Iceland is basically bathed in light.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.440
 Even though it wasn't completely light,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.920
 it was light enough that people saw it coming,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.360
 crowds formed because it was a public holiday

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.560
 and a payday for all of the fishermen.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.520
 So they were drinking late into the night out on the docks,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.160
 looking out, going, oh, what are those massive ships coming?

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.400
 - Imagine how fun that is, 'cause you're on a night out,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.760
 you're thinking, what are we gonna do now?

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.640
 The pubs have shut, a bit boring, do we go home?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.720
 And then round the corner, invading Naval Force, dreamy.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.560
 - Amazing.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.560
 - I mean, that's gonna extend your night.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.440
 - And they wouldn't have known if it was a German invasion,

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.280
 a British invasion.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.240
 Think of that kind of the buildup of that.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.080
 What ship is it?

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.920
 Can we see it yet?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.200
 - Yeah, what do you guess?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.560
 - There was jeopardy at the time over that,

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.440
 because as you say, there were shapes of ships,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.560
 ship shapes, if you like, in the water.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.560
 And I think they sent out a late night policeman

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.200
 on his bicycle to try and assess the situation a bit better,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.080
 but he came back and said, I can't see what kind they are.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.680
 - Where did he ride to?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.480
 How is he getting further than anyone else at the dock?

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.440
 - Maybe they sent a policeman with the best eyesight,

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.280
 I'm not sure.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.080
 But the invasion force had already

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.720
 massively given themselves away,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.920
 because one of the ships traveling

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.280
 had a little seaplane attached to it,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.080
 which was a model of plane called a super marine walrus,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.920
 which is a great name for a plane.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.760
 Really good.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.960
 You know, you want an amphibious plane,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.440
 super marine walrus, brilliant.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.160
 Anyway, they sent up the pilot saying,

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.400
 look, we're looking for German submarines in the area,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.600
 which could be a huge threat.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.000
 We've got hundreds of troops on these ships.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.920
 So look for subs in the area, be careful,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.920
 don't fly directly over Reykjavík,

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.120
 the main city in Iceland,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.480
 which the plane immediately then did several times,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.880
 waking up everyone in Reykjavík.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.000
 - I mean--

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.080
 - This is such a balls up, I love it.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.320
 - It's truly heinous, it's brilliant.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.040
 The soldiers hadn't fired their guns,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.320
 lots of them had never fired the rifles

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.800
 they'd just been issued with.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.040
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.920
 - They didn't need to, to be fair.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.400
 They brought some loaded rifles,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.480
 but it was very much a case of the ship docking,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.280
 and in fact, I think the British ambassador

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.960
 who was the only person in Iceland

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.240
 who knew that what was gonna happen,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.440
 the British ambassador sort of saying to the crowd,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.480
 do you mind standing back a bit

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.960
 so these invading soldiers can climb off their ships

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.320
 and invade you, and everyone's like,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.040
 yeah, yeah, of course, so sorry,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.560
 so sorry to have gone the way.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.520
 (laughing)

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.280
 - One of the Icelanders snatched a rifle from a marine

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.000
 and just stuffed a cigarette in it,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.120
 and then threw it back to him,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.080
 telling him to be more careful.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.920
 - Really?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.480
 - And then the marine got towed off

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.880
 by his commanding officer.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.120
 - That looked really good.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.320
 - Oh, you probably would have been told off

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 for having a random dude manage to snatch your rifle off you,

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.680
 like that's pretty bad soldiering.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.600
 - We should say, I think everything we're saying

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.960
 is from this fantastic article,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.200
 so I think we should cite it.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.600
 It's this article in Hakai Magazine,

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.800
 and it's sort of my new favorite site,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.320
 I've been reading it for about six months now,

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.800
 and it's ostensibly a site about fishing, really,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.360
 but the article's just amazing on it.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.840
 I'm addicted to it, so it's a great magazine

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.680
 if you wanna read it.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.400
 - And this article is amazing.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.200
 Highly recommend checking it out.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.720
 I mean, it opens with this amazing thing

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.440
 that some of the earliest colored footage

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.640
 that we have of Iceland was taken

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.600
 from the camera of Eva Braun, Hitler's girlfriend.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.120
 She was the one who had trained it on Iceland,

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.240
 and she caught these little children on camera,

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.040
 and it's just mad that that's some of the earliest footage

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.840
 that we have is filmed by Hitler's crew.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840
 - Just on a cruise holiday, right?

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.500
 - On a cruise holiday, on a Nazi cruise holiday, right?

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.800
 Like, this was part of a Nazi incentive.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.600
 - If the politics thing doesn't work,

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.640
 maybe the whole cruise ship thing might take off.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.360
 - And I didn't realize that she was,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.080
 as is mentioned again in this article,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.880
 that she was hidden as a girlfriend to the German public

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.000
 because much like the Beatles or other pop bands,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.080
 the idea that Hitler being in a relationship

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.040
 would have put women off joining the party,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.040
 but Hitler as a bachelor was, you know, like,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.320
 "Ah, Hitler!"

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.160
 It was a bigger--

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.980
 - Oh yeah, 'cause Hitler was such a stud.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.700
 - Well, he was in his mid-40s at this point.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.100
 Surely at some point, the K-pop, not in a relationship,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.780
 fiction has to wear out.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.060
 There must be a recruitment ceiling

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.760
 where beyond which you're thinking,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.800
 "Young women are not getting into the party

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.580
 "because they think Hitler might fancy them."

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.740
 Interesting counter-historical narrative.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.220
 If Hitler had openly got a girlfriend,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.580
 would he have been forced to leave

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.740
 like the K-pop stars who get boyfriends or girlfriends?

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.560
 Instead, we'd be talking about some guy

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.600
 who ran a cruise ship company.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.440
 - God, yeah, I can imagine Goebbels

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.880
 actually knocking on the door saying,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.480
 "May, I'm so sorry."

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.600
 Sort of the dominant comments with time.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.920
 - Yeah, I can't start with him.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.800
 - So this invasion was about Norway and Denmark,

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.880
 so they'd been taken over by the Nazis.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.680
 So, Eisen was under Danish control at the time,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.440
 although it sort of seceded for the war

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.720
 and Norway was right there.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.160
 And so the reason that the Brits invaded

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.180
 was because Germany was getting dangerously close to Iceland.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.380
 But in Norway, it was illegal under Nazi occupation

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.660
 to do various things.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.900
 It was illegal to wear a paperclip as a brooch.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.260
 And that was because students used to wear them

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.140
 as a sign of resistance against the Nazis

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.700
 to show that they were bound together.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.140
 And there was another thing people used to do

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.300
 which became a thing in Norway,

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.340
 which was giving wrong street directions.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.060
 So Nazi soldiers arrived in Norway

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.460
 and didn't know where anything was

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.900
 and so would ask for directions to places.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.520
 And the thing became to point them

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.040
 in the opposite direction to where they wanted to go.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.360
 And also, illegal to stand on a bus

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.200
 if a seat was available, why?

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.200
 - Wait, did people refuse to sit next to German soldiers?

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.160
 - It's absolutely correct, yeah, yeah.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.980
 - That's pretty petty making a law saying

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.840
 you have to sit next to our soldiers

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.800
 in case their feelings are hurt, I presume.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.760
 - It's pretty sad.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.560
 - Maybe they're soldiers who are in relationships.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.600
 No one wants to be near them, that's pretty good.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.200
 - The Norwegian invasion,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.440
 I don't know if we've said this before,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.540
 is where the word "quisling" comes from to mean a traitor

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.300
 because their leader who collaborated with the Nazis

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.740
 was called Vidkun Quisling.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.900
 So it's one of those cool examples

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.180
 of where an individual, a named individual

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.180
 becomes a word to mean characteristic.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.820
 - Do you think you'd be pleased or excited or nervous

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.660
 if someone said to you, after you die,

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.740
 there's going to be a noun that's named after you?

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.140
 And that's all I'm telling you.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.420
 'Cause it's, you know, you think,

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.060
 oh God, there's gonna be a noun quisling.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.680
 That's so exciting, what's it gonna mean?

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.720
 Is it gonna be a really brave person?

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.560
 Is it gonna be a really beautiful object?

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.760
 - What would a Tyshensky be?

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.560
 - It would be like the perfect pub.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.200
 - I think it would be a unit of alcohol,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.240
 but like an unrealistically large.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.880
 (all laughing)

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.000
 - One Tyshensky and you're on the floor.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.580
 (upbeat music)

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:14.000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.440
 and that is my fact.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.500
 My fact this week is that 32 years

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.660
 after he defeated Alexander Hamilton in a duel,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.220
 the last thing to happen to Aaron Burr on the day he died

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.540
 was that he was defeated in a court case

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.820
 by Alexander Hamilton Jr.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.160
 - So incredible.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.000
 - Amazing.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.840
 - Yeah.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.660
 - How so, Dan?

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.500
 How so?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.780
 - Obviously we know Hamilton, the musical,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.140
 based on Alexander Hamilton,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.100
 one of the founding fathers of America,

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.500
 and the fact that he was murdered by Aaron Burr,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.020
 who was the third vice president of the United States,

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.480
 and that happened in 1804.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.080
 They had a duel and it resulted in Hamilton's death.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.040
 So it was horrible.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.200
 He died and it really had horrible ramifications

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.800
 for the rest of Burr's life

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.840
 that followed him all the way to his death.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.720
 So in 1833, at the age of 77,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.920
 Burr got remarried having lost his wife

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.400
 a number of years before

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.040
 to a lady called Eliza Jumel,

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.240
 who was a very wealthy widow herself.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.440
 She was 19 years younger than he was,

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.740
 and he thought, okay, this is great.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.980
 This is a second chance to have a huge bit of wealth

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.940
 in my life.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.340
 And so he kind of took control of her wealth

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.380
 and squandered it.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.460
 He invested it in very odd projects,

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.740
 and she cottoned on to this and went,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.620
 "Hang on a second, you're bleeding me of all my money."

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.580
 So she decided to get a divorce.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.060
 When she decided to get a divorce,

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.060
 the divorce lawyer that she hired

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.060
 was the son of Alexander Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton Jr.,

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.620
 who was an incredibly successful guy.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.420
 This case was way below him.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.440
 He'd passed doing this kind of menial stuff

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.280
 years and years ago,

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.440
 but he said, "Absolutely, I'll take it on."

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.200
 And he used the court case as an excuse

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.120
 to really showcase what a terrible person

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.240
 he thought Aaron Burr was.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.560
 He talked about all his affairs and so on.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.520
 And the court case took three years,

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.520
 and it was finally settled in the favor of Eliza Jumel.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.120
 On the very day that Aaron Burr died just a few hours

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.320
 before he passed away,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.080
 a final little defeat from the Hamilton.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.720
 So he didn't hear about it before he died.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.560
 - We don't know.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.980
 I don't actually know that.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.060
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.980
 I hope he--

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.480
 - Dan, why don't you know that?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.320
 (laughing)

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.580
 - Come on, mate, do your research.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.420
 Go back in time.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.420
 - Get the facts right, come on.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.660
 - Thank you for saying it, Jamie.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.300
 We've all been thinking it for years.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.140
 - That's what I'm here for.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.980
 - So this is another,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.820
 'cause one of the famous things in the musical

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.980
 is that Alexander Hamilton had a son

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.380
 who died in a duel.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.740
 - Yeah, yes, correct, that was his eldest son.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.740
 Yeah, Philip, Philip Hamilton died

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.920
 in the duel, and he was defending the honor

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.640
 of his dad, Alexander Hamilton.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.600
 Someone was like bad-mouthing his dad,

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.760
 and so he was like, "I'm not having that.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.120
 "See you on the dueling field, sir."

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.440
 And then he, yeah, died.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.280
 - Yeah.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.120
 - Well, then they did the thing

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.280
 that they used to do in the olden days,

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.480
 which I always find a bit creepy

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.080
 of calling their next son, Philip, as well,

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.160
 which always feels like a bit of a burden to carry.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.960
 In fact, they called him Philip II.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.800
 - Oh, wow.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.440
 The son, their next son, born after Philip,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.880
 the elder son had died.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.620
 - Yeah, yeah, the next year, I think.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.940
 - So he started with Philip,

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.380
 then he named a later son, Alexander Jr.,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.320
 which feels like the first name you go to.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.280
 - Yeah. - That's true.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.820
 And then later on went to another vet.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.900
 This is too mixed up for me.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.880
 - I have a quick pitch, a musical pitch here,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.760
 and we should say, Jamie, you actually are friends

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.560
 with the creator of the Hamilton musical,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.240
 Lin-Manuel Miranda.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.120
 He's been on my dad wrote a porno, right?

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.560
 And you've hung out with him.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.060
 - Best friend, Cleveland. - So you could probably get

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.040
 this idea to him on my behalf.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.160
 - Okay.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.840
 - Sequel to the musical Hamilton, Hamilton Jr., okay?

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.320
 That's the sequel, because the story

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.200
 of Alexander Hamilton Jr. is extraordinary.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.280
 He was obviously from a family destroyed

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.760
 by two deaths as a result of gun-jeweling.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.920
 His sister, sadly, lost her mind

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.480
 off the back of her father, dying.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.600
 He was sort of grew up in a broken household,

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.960
 but he rose above it all

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.520
 and became this extraordinary character.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.900
 So he was someone who eventually went on

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.620
 to become a colonel fighting against Napoleon.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.340
 He sailed to Spain in 1811,

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.820
 and he was fighting with the first Duke of Wellington.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.140
 He came back to America.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.500
 He became a lawyer.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.820
 He was a big part of Wall Street

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.620
 when he became a real estate agent

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.060
 and built that up as well.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.180
 And it's full of little cameos.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.020
 It's a great story where when he was just traveling

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.620
 in the West, he met Abraham Lincoln,

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.940
 who was at that point a state legislator,

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.380
 nowhere near being coming president.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.660
 He met him in a grocery store,

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.900
 where he said Lincoln was lying on the counter

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.840
 in the midday telling stories.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.520
 Just laying there, just given a yarn of what was going on.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.660
 - Wow, was there a cue?

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.520
 I mean, that's very annoying if you're third of the UK.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.720
 You're trying to buy a broccoli.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.880
 Some lunatic sprawled out on the counter.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.320
 - Honest Dave, shut up.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.000
 - Dan, would you call it Hamilton?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.520
 As in, I'm just trying to work out what it would be called.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.960
 Like, is it Hamilton with two L's in the middle,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.600
 Hamill or Tom? - Oh yeah.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.840
 - Or is it Hamill two on, which is where?

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.400
 - Yes, you've put the two in place of the T at the end, yeah.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.240
 - Yeah.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.040
 - Hamilton. - That's better, that's better.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.360
 - Hamilton.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.680
 - Nice.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.580
 - Their descendants, Hamilton's and Burst descendants,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.540
 are now friends with each other.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.880
 They know each other.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.060
 I think they live in New York,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.940
 or they certainly did a while ago.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.360
 They met Alexandra Hamilton Woods and Antonio Burr.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.520
 They met at a party in 2007,

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.820
 and they worked out that they had a familial connection.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.680
 And they would go kayaking together.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.760
 - Yeah, they're part of this.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.200
 So they're both psychoanalysts,

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.160
 and they met at a big psychoanalyst party,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.600
 and they were introduced, and because of the surnames,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.760
 they were like, "Any chance,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.040
 "Alexandra Hamilton, that you are related?"

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.480
 And it turned out she was.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.520
 And he said that he's part of this kayaking club,

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.720
 which kayaks on the Hudson,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.320
 which is the river that Hamilton and Burr had to cross

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.020
 in order to get to their dueling spot.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.640
 So they actually do kayak very near to the spot

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.620
 where the duel happened together.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.460
 And they're both--

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.680
 - God, that must be tense, surely.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.520
 - Yeah, surely.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.360
 - One of them just starts reaching into the bottom

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.120
 of the kayak and pulling out a pistol.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.680
 Remember this?

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.080
 They do have to get into arguments

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.440
 with each other sometimes in debate,

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.680
 because they're both part of the Inwood Canoe Club,

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.520
 you know, the high board.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.480
 So he's one of them's a treasurer,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.800
 and Burr is the president emeritus.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.640
 So--

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.440
 - But finally became president.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.280
 That's nice.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.440
 - It's not quite the high stakes battles of yore, is it?

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.280
 - No.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.120
 - Canoe club.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.900
 - One thing I do love about Aaron Burr,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.300
 and because you've got me on the show,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.620
 I feel this is fitting for me to bring up,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:42.560
 but in 1861, a piece of erotica was published,

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.900
 all about Aaron Burr.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.980
 - Really?

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.060
 - Really, this is true.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.300
 It was called The Amorous Intrigues

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.520
 and Adventures of Aaron Burr.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.140
 And 'cause he had quite a reputation

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.060
 for being a womanizer,

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.100
 I think you mentioned earlier, Dan,

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.220
 and a lot of his enemies, including Hamilton,

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.220
 who was also a bit of a womanizer himself,

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.980
 would often kind of use that as a reason to attack him.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.760
 And so some anonymous person,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.640
 could it have been Alexander Hamilton II or whoever,

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.400
 wrote this sexy book all about Aaron Burr.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.240
 - Have you read it?

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.880
 - I tried to find some so that I could read it out,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.080
 Al and my dad wrote a porno,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.560
 but I just couldn't find it anywhere.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.520
 - Good news, I found out about this book as well,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.800
 and I did find an extract,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.880
 so I'm gonna put it in the chat here.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.680
 - Okay.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.260
 (upbeat music)

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.600
 (upbeat music)

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.580
 - The warm-hearted girl sighed heavily.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.580
 There was a choking sensation in her throat,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.780
 and her large, dark eyes were rolled up in her head

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.100
 with such a softness in their expression

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.080
 that Burr must have been more or less than man.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.100
 God, this is worse than my dad's.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.620
 Not to have desired a more intimate acquaintance with her.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.140
 Burr threw up.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.460
 Oh, sorry, Burr threw up her clothes.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.220
 (laughing)

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.180
 - It's very niche kind of porno, I've got to hear.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.300
 - Burr threw up, different line, guys.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.420
 Burr threw up her clothes and revealed such charms

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.260
 as seldom have been exposed to the light of the sun.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.980
 Oh, that's beautiful.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.060
 The smooth, round belly,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.100
 the voluminous yet compact thighs,

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.780
 the robust calf and small foot and ankle,

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.260
 the satin smoothness of the skin

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.100
 and other graces not to be mentioned.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.860
 Well, it's erotica, mate, mention them.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.140
 That's what we're here for.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:34.980
 (laughing)

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.820
 But who's pouting--

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.860
 - I'm trying to curse you now.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.940
 - But who's pouting and most freshness

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.580
 betokened a guarded virginity,

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.660
 which, however, longed for the pressure of manhood.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.820
 All these so fired him with passion

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.200
 that he had scarcely the necessary patience

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.140
 to prepare himself for the amorous encounter.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.980
 Burr.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.980
 - It's hot.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.180
 - It's hot. - That is hot.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.140
 - A red worse.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.660
 - I don't know if I would be happy

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.780
 that this is how he's gonna be remembered

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.300
 'cause I'm finding it impossible to divorce the real Aaron Burr

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.060
 from that fictional account now.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.780
 (laughing)

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.260
 Do you guys know the woman who,

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.060
 he was divorcing, who Burr was divorcing

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.660
 in this original fact, Eliza Jumel?

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.160
 So she was kind of interesting.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.140
 She was very much gossiped about,

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.140
 I bet there's some fan porn fiction about her

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.740
 around and about.

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.580
 And she was--

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.840
 - Oh, I'm sure she's in the book.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.960
 - She must be in the book, actually, right.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.640
 She was very poor and she married up above her station,

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.200
 this very rich man called Stephen, Stephen Jumel.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.400
 And then he died, apparently, according to reports,

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.200
 falling off a hay cart and onto a pitchfork,

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.660
 which sounds almost completely implausible.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.000
 (laughing)

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.800
 - That's someone who's stabbed him with a pitchfork,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.620
 hastily positioning him so he looks

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.060
 like he fell off the hay cart.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.900
 Come on.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.940
 - Just put the pitchfork facing up

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.540
 with his body at the top, oh, that was suspect.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.420
 Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, the rumor spread

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.900
 that she killed him and then let him bleed out,

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.300
 so all these rumors about her.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.180
 And she, so she then divorced Burr,

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.500
 but the other thing about her is,

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.980
 and this is why I think Burr's quite exciting,

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.300
 'cause he's been responsible for two

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.860
 of the greatest pieces of entertainment

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.380
 of the last 10 years.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.540
 'Cause after divorcing Burr and Burr dying,

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.600
 she employed in New York a housekeeper called Ann Northup.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.080
 And Ann Northup is the wife of Solomon,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.400
 Solomon Northup, who was the person in 12 Years of the Slaves

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.240
 who was abducted and sold into slavery,

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.520
 and that was Solomon Northup.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.760
 So while her husband was missing,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.360
 Ann Northup was working for Eliza Dhumel.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.400
 So how cool is that?

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.440
 They were sort of a duo together for a while, a double act.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.280
 - That's amazing.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.640
 - And then she lived in the oldest mansion in New York,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.820
 which is now a hotbed for ghost hunters, Dan,

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.980
 if you're ever there.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.540
 - Yeah, well, actually, I read a book by Hans Holzer,

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.300
 who is the person who Ghostbusters is based on.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.580
 And he says that when Hamilton was shot,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.620
 he went back to a house in New York

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.340
 and supposedly the house that he died in,

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.300
 the ghost of Hamilton still haunts,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.860
 and Hans Holzer went to investigate that.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.380
 And if you go to this house in New York these days,

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.820
 what you need to listen out for is the toilet flushing,

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.720
 because apparently Hamilton is obsessed with toilets,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.400
 because it's a technology he didn't know in his days.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.740
 This is the thing they say about ghosts generally.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.960
 Ghosts are obsessed-- - What?

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.920
 - Ghosts apparently are obsessed with toilets

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.080
 and flushing them.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.680
 So if you hear a rogue toilet flush in that house,

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.720
 it could be Hamilton.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.480
 - It's not Hamilton, but it could be, I suppose,

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.920
 if we're gonna stretch.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.880
 - According to Hans Holzer is what I'm saying.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.200
 - Yeah, sure, sure.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.520
 - It's a big caveat.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.640
 So you're saying ghost today,

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.820
 they come to the future and they've got the internet,

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.460
 they've got aeroplanes, they've got space travel,

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.080
 they've got microwaves, they've got cars and trains.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.240
 And you're saying the flush of a toilet,

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.500
 that's what astonishes them,

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.060
 which I believe the flushing toilet,

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.100
 some sort of flushing toilet was invented

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.460
 in the Zebethan times, wasn't it?

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.540
 Is that the only thing that can impress them?

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.980
 - I don't know why you say I'm claiming this.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.720
 All I mean is passing on Hans Holzer,

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.080
 legendary ghost hunters knowledge.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.740
 But we're blaming the messenger here again.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.280
 - And also, ghosts can't hold things or touch it.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.940
 How could they operate a toilet?

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.880
 It makes no sense.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.400
 - Oh, no, I mean, they can, they can smash mirrors

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.240
 and they can--

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.080
 - They're poltergeist.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.420
 - Poltergeist, no, you're very confused there.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.600
 - I don't believe I've been well-behaved poltergeist

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.960
 to an only-interested sanitation.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.000
 (laughing)

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.580
 (upbeat music)

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:41.420
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.680
 and that is Andy.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.600
 - My fact is that the police in Paris

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.260
 have an elite unit of cops who are armed,

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.980
 but also on roller blades.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.300
 - Ah, yes they are.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.460
 - Yeah.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.700
 - Actually, when you said this fact,

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.180
 I wanna know what you mean by elite,

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.180
 'cause that sounds like something they tell the cops

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.420
 to reassure them they don't have like complete twerks

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.260
 on roller blades.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.500
 - Yeah, that's so fair.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.540
 I think maybe I mean niche unit of cops.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.860
 (laughing)

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.900
 - The ones that are useless to anything else, yeah.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.620
 (laughing)

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.820
 - So, are they real cops, right?

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.660
 - They're not cops.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.500
 - They're not token.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.240
 - No, they have guns and truncheons

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.560
 and they, I mean, there aren't very many of them,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.200
 you know, compared with the overall Parisian police force,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.040
 but they are--

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:24.880
 - Well, they're elite, yeah.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.720
 - They are real, yeah.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.480
 They have been going for about 20 years.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.280
 There are just eight members of this unit.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.320
 I know, it's extremely elite, yeah.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.240
 It's very hard to recruit into, obviously,

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.940
 'cause you need someone who's unbelievably good

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.040
 at rollerblading, but they do have advantages

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.240
 in urban police work.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.860
 They can go about 30 kilometers an hour normally,

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.020
 'cause they're quite heavily weighed down,

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.140
 but if they really get a move on,

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.140
 they can get up to about 50 kilometers an hour,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.780
 they claim, which is a lot faster than someone can run.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.900
 - Yeah, although as soon as that someone runs over cobblestones,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.740
 they're in serious trouble.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.380
 - Yeah, they're stuffed, they can't,

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.820
 they really hate cobblestones.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.060
 (laughing)

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.180
 - A similar scheme was piloted in London in 2000.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.460
 The Royal Parks Constabulary attempted to use them

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.700
 in Kensington Gardens, but it was abandoned

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.820
 because the minute someone ran on grass,

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.080
 they were screwed, 'cause equally, like cobblestones,

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.080
 rollerblading, not so great on grass.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.320
 - I can't believe they put them in the Royal Parks though,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.560
 which are mostly the grass.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.400
 - It's very much in the name.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.240
 - It's a predominantly grass environment.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.400
 - Should we go for the parks in the gardens for this?

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.720
 - Well, what about the beaches?

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.600
 Let's do the beaches.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.760
 - If they just put some clay in there as well,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.560
 it would have been perfect.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.160
 It is a ridiculous idea because it's only useful

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.680
 if you have to give chase against someone

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.880
 and immediately get them.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.940
 Any other situation of policing,

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.380
 coming in with rollerblades is just ridiculous.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.540
 And these guys in Paris,

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.500
 they are used for different situations.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.820
 They're sometimes asked to go and police other bits

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.380
 outside of just the main street.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.780
 So sometimes they have to go and stop, you know,

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.780
 fighting that's going on in a building.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.500
 And in the thing I read that like,

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.280
 sometimes we have to go up to the fifth floor.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.580
 There's no elevator.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.580
 We're there in our rollerblades, going up the stairs,

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.300
 and then we're arriving at the scene on rollerblades,

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.180
 which no one can take seriously.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.240
 - Hang on, do you think surely if you're on the fifth floor,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.280
 it depends how many floors it is, but if it's five,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.280
 I'm definitely taking off my rollerblades,

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.640
 running up the stairs, then putting them back on

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.480
 at the top, aren't you?

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.000
 - There's probably a guideline about how many floors

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 it's acceptable to take off your blades for.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.280
 - You're so right, yeah.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.040
 Rollerblading is very much something

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.000
 that shoots up and down in popularity

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.720
 in one year, it'll be super popular.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.180
 But I remember going on French holidays with my friend

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.680
 when we were kids.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.120
 And we used to rollerblade a lot then,

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.920
 but I haven't seen much of it since.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.260
 And it's basically since the mid 19th century, isn't it?

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.380
 Since it first took off, which was 1863,

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.780
 and this is when a guy called James Leonard Plimpton

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.340
 invented roller skates that actually worked.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:56.100
 So before that, you couldn't really go around corners.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.460
 And he finally invented wheels that were kind of attached

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.020
 to a cushioned springy platform,

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.980
 and also two rows of wheels rather than one.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.380
 So skates, not blades.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.500
 And it took off overnight, and it became this mad craze

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.640
 to the extent that in 1885, in Scientific American,

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.480
 there was an article that was roller skating,

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.840
 The Medical View, which was analyzing why it was

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.160
 that America got so obsessed with certain things.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.640
 And it started, it was such a good article,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.520
 and it rang so true for today.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.760
 It started, "We hear of no other country

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.640
 so violently perturbed by waves of temperance crusading,

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.800
 religious revivals, velocity crazes, pedestrianism."

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.400
 No one walked, apparently before that.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.080
 And now, roller skating, which exceeds all the others,

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.200
 and it was an analysis of how it had managed

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.360
 to become such a mad craze,

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.320
 and whether it was medically harmful.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.340
 And I concluded, no.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.480
 - Oh, it's safe.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.800
 It's safe, guys, thank God.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.640
 - Oh, thank God.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.760
 - It's safe, yeah, Andy, you can keep them on.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.800
 - Thank you.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.120
 - We should say, by the way, we keep saying roller blades,

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.160
 and the reality, which I only just found out

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.840
 through researching this, is that it's a brand name.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.020
 It's not the sport itself.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.420
 It's a trademark name.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.480
 It's a single manufacturer that make roller blades,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.800
 and the rest of it is called inline skating.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.000
 - Inline skating, that's the generic term.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.480
 - So, that's what we should be saying.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.680
 - Okay, nice.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.980
 - Yeah, we should redo this fact,

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.720
 because we don't know they're wearing roller blades.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.420
 - No, you're right.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.260
 Oh, God.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.000
 - That's some budget police version.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.080
 - The guy who created the first popular inline skates

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.720
 was a guy called Scott Olson.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.220
 He was a hockey player, and he made them in 1979.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.820
 They had been patented before,

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.820
 and in fact, he was beaten by 20 years

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.420
 by this lady from Palm Beach called Emma DeSaro,

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.420
 who got a patent on inline skates.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.860
 She had the idea, and then the patent expired,

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.540
 and she never made a penny out of it.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.700
 She was-- - No!

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.500
 - They interviewed her years after

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.820
 rollerblading had become a huge thing,

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.500
 and she said, "Well, I'm obviously glad

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.100
 "everyone's rollerblading, but I did have the idea

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:00.940
 "of painting."

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.780
 It's really a sad thing, yeah.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.620
 - Bless her.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.460
 - I know.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.920
 - You haven't invented anything else?

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.000
 - No.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.600
 No, not as far as I know.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.920
 They weren't interviewing her, saying,

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.680
 "We're off to be Emma DeSaro in her mansion,"

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.200
 which she got after she invented thermodores or whatever.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.040
 I don't know.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.000
 - I can, but dream.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.400
 She did one day create something

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.720
 that we all live day to day.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.400
 - I know, I know.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.520
 But so Olson, that's Scott Olson, the hockey player,

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.320
 he has invented so many other silly sports

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.280
 and means of getting around.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.200
 He's a bit of a hero.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.040
 So he was, I think, the guy behind the rollerblade company,

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.780
 but then had terrible legal fallings out

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.980
 and there were sheet, like, ructions

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.660
 and he got kicked out and it was all very chaotic.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.100
 - Looks like Steve Jobs.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.940
 - Pretty much.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.220
 So in 1996, you made the row bike,

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.700
 which is a bike with these kind of push-pull handles

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.300
 and that's how you propel yourself along.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.140
 - Yeah.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:48.980
 - Very exciting.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.740
 He's made the sky ride, which is a rollercoaster,

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.060
 but you have to pedal yourself around it.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.320
 (laughing)

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:01.740
 This huge track suspended 150 feet up

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.720
 and you get at the thing and you just have to pedal away.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.200
 It's better than it sounds guys, it looks really fun.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.080
 - Do you have a sort of safety net or something?

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.640
 I mean, how high up are you for that?

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.600
 - 150 feet, you're pretty high up.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.840
 - You must have a harness or something.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.200
 - Yeah, I have, yes, I imagine there are some basic

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.520
 safety precautions they say.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.520
 - I mean, 'cause I can't get across monkey bars these days,

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.000
 that's actually terrifying.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.360
 - You're sitting in a pod, you're sitting in a pod.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.320
 - You do thing with all inventors.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.240
 All great inventions, the key is, if there are enough darts,

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.900
 one of them is gonna strike, because every inventor,

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.340
 you look at their history and you go,

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.420
 God, they invented a lot of shit, didn't they?

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.740
 In amongst this whole penicillin thing,

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.140
 they invented fluffy bicycles or whatever.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:48.660
 So the original inventor of roller blades, in fact,

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.960
 which preceded roller skates by about 100 years,

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.500
 was a guy called John Joseph Merlin,

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.900
 who we've mentioned before.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.660
 And we've mentioned him in the context of

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.740
 when he invented his blades to publicize his other

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.680
 inventions, he showed them off by

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.680
 blading straight into a mirror and smashing it.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.760
 So they didn't take off at all.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.120
 But his other inventions were kind of cool,

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.440
 he invented a rotating tea table,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.840
 and this worked by having the teapot,

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.760
 or like the samovar, that poured the tea in the middle,

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.360
 and then he had all the cups around the outside,

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.960
 and your hostess could spin the samovar,

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.080
 which would pour and fill all the cups,

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.440
 by just operating a pedal under the table.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.280
 - Oh, that's great.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.240
 - The lazy, lazy woman didn't even have to stand up

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.600
 and pour the tea.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.080
 (laughing)

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.060
 That was the start of women's day.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.580
 - I think he was attributed as well with inventing,

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.380
 if you go on a merry-go-round,

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:41.940
 it used to be a stagnant horse that would go around

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.860
 the whole way, and he, I think,

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.900
 invented the up and down motion of a merry-go-round horse.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.300
 - It's the best bit of a merry-go-round.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.620
 - That's not the best bit, Jamie.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.460
 - It is.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.300
 - Come on, come on, it is.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.140
 - Come on.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.540
 - It's about the going around in a circle.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.580
 - The best bit is the going round.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.460
 - There's only one way to test this, all right?

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.900
 You both have to create your own merry-go-rounds,

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.880
 one where the horse moves in a circle

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.460
 and stays on the horizontal plane,

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.020
 and the other way, it just goes up and down

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.620
 and doesn't move around in a circle.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.540
 And you'll open one next to each other,

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.060
 and you'll see who gets more punters.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.180
 - Oh my god, this is the Feder and Nadal court

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.540
 of up and down, circular entertainment.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.380
 - It is.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.580
 - The problem with the one where you stay in one spot,

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.540
 the horse goes up and down,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.700
 and you have to wave at your mum all the way through the ride.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.380
 (laughing)

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.060
 I have one last really stupid thing of Rollerblades,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.980
 which is a 2016 report of the Wiltshire police

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.880
 about the 999 calls they got.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.060
 One of their operators said that she'd taken a call

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.860
 from someone who'd been out rollerblading at night

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.260
 who wanted an officer to come and pick them up

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.140
 because the caller had come across a very steep hill

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.980
 that they couldn't rollerblade up,

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.900
 and they went out stranded.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.500
 - Okay, that's the sort of thing that I would do

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.340
 to be fair, come on.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.580
 (laughing)

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.420
 - The operator said,

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.300
 "I ascertained that the caller was not very far from home

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.260
 and suggested that she contact a friend

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.900
 or a family member to pick her up instead."

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.260
 - Or take them off.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.260
 - The old take them off has come back in.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.880
 - Oh my god.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.220
 - Why not take them off?

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.020
 - We got an email once from a guy called Marcus

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.180
 that I don't think I've ever mentioned,

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.380
 but it's such a good fact, which is that,

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.240
 so in some countries you call different numbers

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.220
 for a different emergency service,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.820
 and in Chad, the number you call for police is 17,

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.740
 and the number you call for the fire department is 19.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.740
 And what do you think the number is

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.780
 that you call for an ambulance?

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.940
 - 21.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.300
 - 17, 19, 21.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.860
 - Oh, I like that logic.

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.100
 I would have guessed 18.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.740
 It is in fact, 2251, 424.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.000
 (laughing)

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.580
 (upbeat music)

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.900
 - Okay, that's it.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.940
 That's all of our facts.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.340
