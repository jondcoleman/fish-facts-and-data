00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,360
 Before we begin, we just wanna let you know

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,040
 that James is away this week, and so in his place,

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,840
 we've got a really good buddy of ours.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,200
 It is Jamie Morton, the co-host of My Dad wrote a porno.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,560
 I'm sure you're all aware of My Dad wrote a porno,

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,440
 one of the biggest British podcasts out there,

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,840
 and they've just launched their sixth series.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,240
 There are a couple of episodes in, do check it out.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,200
 It is incredibly funny, it is incredibly rude,

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,600
 and maybe even go back to the first series

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,160
 and work your way up there, because it's a long narrative

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,280
 and it is so worth the journey.

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
 They are obviously juggernauts,

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,720
 it's not just the podcast that they do.

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,200
 You can also find tickets

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,240
 to their upcoming live tours online.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,720
 Why not check out their HBO special as well.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,120
 They've even just released some tie-in beers.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,880
 There's My Dad wrote a porno ale

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,040
 that you can get now online, so do find that as well.

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,480
 And you can actually see the whole team,

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,480
 Alice Levine and James Cooper and Jamie joining us online.

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,040
 If you go to YouTube for the comic relief special

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,800
 that we did a few months back, the full team is there

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,160
 and we had a great chat.

27
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,680
 And we had an amazing chat with Jamie on this episode.

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
 So I hope you enjoy, do check their new series out

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
 and on with the show.

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,300
 (lively music)

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,000
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,640
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,480
 a weekly podcast coming to you

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,880
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,680
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,000
 Anna Tyshinski, and it's our special guest,

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,480
 our good friend, co-host of My Dad wrote a porno,

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,960
 Jamie Morton.

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,340
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
 And in no particular order, here we go.

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,440
 Starting with fact number one, and that's you, Jamie.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,360
 - My fact is in 2007, tennis legends Roger Federer

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,840
 and Raphael Nadal played a match on a court

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,780
 that was 50% grass and 50% clay.

47
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,540
 - Like a Frankencourt.

48
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,440
 - Exactly that.

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,880
 Basically they were both, and still kind of are,

50
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,520
 seen as the greatest on clay and grass,

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
 Rafa being the best on clay,

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
 Roger being the best on grass.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,880
 And so they thought, why not combine the services

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,080
 and see who is the ultimate tennis player?

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,600
 This was the idea.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,680
 - It's worth saying though, it's not a combination

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,200
 of grass and clay, like some new court that's been made.

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,920
 It's literally, and you can see photos

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,560
 or watch it online even, half of it is solid grass.

60
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,200
 And then if you cross the court, it's solid clay.

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,040
 It's the most bizarre looking.

62
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,680
 - It's so stupid. - It's wonderful.

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,480
 - Exactly, let me give you some kind of background to them.

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,360
 Nadal had kind of emerged as the first real rival

65
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
 to Roger Federer.

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
 Roger Federer was basically beating everybody,

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,960
 and then Raphael Nadal came along in 2005,

68
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,760
 started to beat him on a lot of services, but never on grass.

69
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,880
 So he had won 48 straight matches on grass,

70
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,520
 and he was undefeated on the surface for five years.

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,280
 Five years undefeated on grass, that's insane.

72
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,760
 At the same point, Nadal had won 72 straight matches on clay,

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,800
 and he was three years undefeated.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,600
 So they really were coming at the peak of their powers

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,760
 on both surfaces.

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,680
 - Yeah, the match ended in a tie break as well.

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,080
 So it was meant to be a friendly, it was an exhibition match,

78
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,880
 but the guys took it very seriously,

79
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,280
 and Nadal took the first set, Federer the second,

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,320
 and then they went to a tie break in the third,

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
 and that's where Nadal took it.

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,400
 - It was very close, and also a lot of Federer fans

83
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,440
 were bitching about the fact

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,640
 that the grass wasn't proper grass.

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
 They had a bit of a worm infestation in the day before

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
 the match was supposed to take place.

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,240
 Yeah, and it kind of buggered up all the grass.

88
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,000
 They had to get some putting green grass put in overnight.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,320
 And so it was kind of like a carpet of grass

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,760
 that wasn't really grass at all.

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,360
 So it wasn't really a fair test, guys, if you were at school.

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600
 - Didn't Federer say it at the end?

93
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
 The court was great, especially the clay part of it.

94
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,760
 It's an insane to contemplate that this is 2007,

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
 and yeah, I agree, you know, you always think

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,320
 when Federer goes back into a Grand Slam,

97
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,360
 hopefully he'll win again.

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
 And I think he still won his last one in 2018.

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,200
 And yet, this, in May 2007, he was exactly halfway through

100
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,320
 the number of Grand Slams that he'd won.

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,360
 So he had won 10 of his 20 Grand Slams by that point,

102
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
 whereas Nadal was just starting out.

103
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,400
 - What's nice about them now is that

104
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,680
 they've both got 20 Grand Slams.

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
 It's almost like they should both retire now

106
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,640
 and just be equal forever.

107
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
 'Cause this whole kind of conversation,

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440
 who's the greatest of all time,

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,600
 it will go on and on and on.

110
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,680
 I guess this was a kind of a gimmicky way

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
 to try and settle who was the best.

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,480
 - Yeah, and no one ever says,

113
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,440
 "Oh, actually, Nadal's officially the better player,"

114
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,880
 'cause he won that match on the half grass, half Play-Con 2007.

115
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,360
 - Also, it is insane how these guys stay

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
 at the top of their game.

117
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
 Do you remember there was that story

118
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,000
 of the guy who went in the coma,

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,560
 and when he went in the coma,

120
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,760
 Federer was number one in the world.

121
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,520
 He was in it for 11 years,

122
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,680
 and when he came out, Federer was still up there.

123
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,640
 I think he was number two.

124
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
 - Was that his first question when he came out?

125
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
 Is Federer still number one?

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
 They said, "Yes."

127
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,080
 And he said, "Thank God, it must have just been

128
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
 "a fortnight or something."

129
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,680
 - Well, he went into the coma in the first place

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
 because Federer accidentally knocked a ball into his head.

131
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
 So it was a reasonable question

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
 to ask how's Federer doing.

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,640
 - Just on weird tennis matches,

134
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,320
 do you know that Andy Roddick once played a game of tennis

135
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,520
 with a frying pan instead of a racket?

136
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
 - Wow, really?

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
 - And I learned about this in a book called,

138
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,960
 "Andy Roddick Beat Me with a Frying Pan,"

139
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,120
 which is actually an incredibly confusingly titled book

140
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,400
 because it's by a guy called Todd Gallagher,

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,640
 and it's a book about all these sports questions

142
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,720
 that you wish could be answered.

143
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,360
 Like, what would happen if the NBA raised the basket

144
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,760
 to 12 feet, or how good a pro golfer's at miniature golf?

145
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,280
 And one of them is, what would happen if you gave

146
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
 an amazing tennis player a frying pan to play with?

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,240
 Could I still beat him?

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,960
 And the outcome is that the author beats Andy Roddick.

149
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,840
 And I've never met a book where the title

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,120
 is just a direct lie once you read the actual contest.

151
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,360
 (laughing)

152
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,320
 He says, the match like Roddick played really, really well,

153
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
 but with a frying pan, it's quite difficult.

154
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,040
 You can't put any spin on the ball.

155
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,560
 You can't hit backhands, apparently,

156
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,880
 which I would have thought you could just spin it around

157
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,760
 in your hand, but you can't hit backhands.

158
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,600
 - Quite heavy.

159
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,240
 - He could maneuver it around, but anyway, he struggled,

160
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,200
 but he did give an interview afterwards saying,

161
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,480
 he thought that if he got to practice a little bit,

162
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,400
 he'd get used to it.

163
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,640
 And indeed, for charity, he later that year, I think,

164
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,040
 played another guy called Chris Wetzel,

165
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,880
 who won this charity event, and he played him

166
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,360
 with a frying pan, and he did then win.

167
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
 He actually thrashed him.

168
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,760
 And so--

169
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,000
 - Andy Roddick, the title Andy Roddick beat Chris Wetzel

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,960
 with a frying pan is less intriguing

171
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,240
 than Andy Roddick beat me with a frying pan.

172
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,080
 - That's a problem, yeah, but he didn't want

173
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,480
 to credit Chris Wetzel with writing the book

174
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,520
 that he'd written, so he's in a difficult place.

175
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,200
 - Yeah, and he could have called it,

176
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,520
 I beat Andy Roddick with a frying pan,

177
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,520
 but it sounds, it sounds more menacing and fiery.

178
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,280
 (laughs)

179
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,040
 - And it's a dangling modifier, isn't it?

180
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
 It's very misleading.

181
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,920
 It does imply that he's got the frying pan.

182
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,720
 - Another amazingly weird match that occurred

183
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,760
 is the longest match in women's singles,

184
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,720
 which lasted over six hours long,

185
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 but that's not the interesting bit about it.

186
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,760
 Within that match was the longest single rally

187
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,880
 of tennis ever to occur.

188
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,600
 So this was September 24th, 1984,

189
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,880
 and this was the longest in terms of a pro match,

190
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,200
 longest rally, how many shots do you think

191
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,520
 this rally went for?

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,920
 - Shots, what?

193
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,240
 - 160.

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,720
 - Yeah, 110.

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,360
 - Pretty good, pretty good.

196
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,760
 - I'm gonna say a hundred.

197
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,920
 - It lasted 29 minutes and it went for 643 shots.

198
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,320
 - Oh my God.

199
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,440
 Serena Williams has won matches in shorter time than that.

200
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,400
 - Yeah, it was between Vicki Nelson Dunbar

201
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,680
 and Jean Hepner, and it was a set point for Hepner,

202
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,200
 and it was in a tie break at the end of the match,

203
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
 and it went 29 minutes long,

204
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,800
 and Vicki Nelson managed to take it on the 643rd shot.

205
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,640
 - Oh my God.

206
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,680
 - Jean of the match.

207
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,920
 - Oh, she would never have recovered for Jean.

208
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,520
 - Oh, it was horrible.

209
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,040
 Vicki Nelson immediately collapsed with cramps in her legs.

210
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,080
 She was in so much pain.

211
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,600
 And the umpire, the umpire,

212
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,320
 gave her a time violation warning.

213
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,160
 - No.

214
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,120
 - Because she was taking too long

215
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
 to get back up for the next shot.

216
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,560
 Yeah.

217
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,720
 - They're so strict to those umpires.

218
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,880
 It's just so unfair.

219
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,720
 - Yeah.

220
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
 - So unfair.

221
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,600
 - That's insane that you could start watching

222
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,160
 an episode of EastEnders at the start of that rally

223
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
 and come out of that episode and be like,

224
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,760
 "So what's happening in the match?"

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
 It's like, "Well, it's the same rally."

226
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,920
 - You could be in an extremely short coma

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,480
 and come out of the coma and say, "Who won that set?"

228
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
 We don't know.

229
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
 - Are you okay, Andy?

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
 - There's a lot of comas today.

231
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,280
 Are you all right?

232
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,120
 (all laughing)

233
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,240
 Second coma of the day.

234
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
 - Sorry.

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,800
 Andy Roddick beat me with a frying pan.

236
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,120
 (all laughing)

237
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,240
 Unfortunately.

238
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,840
 - I do love the story of a really early tennis player

239
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,040
 called Suzanne Longlin.

240
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,160
 Have you heard of this woman?

241
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
 - No.

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,880
 - She was basically the most famous woman in the world

243
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,120
 in the 1920s when tennis was quite the sport

244
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,280
 and everyone loved it.

245
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,960
 And she was amazing.

246
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,120
 She was the first number one female tennis player ever.

247
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,760
 She won six women and titles,

248
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,320
 including five in a row.

249
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
 And from the First World War to her retirement in 1923,

250
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,200
 she never lost a match,

251
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,520
 except once when she retired.

252
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,680
 She didn't lose it.

253
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,000
 She just retired from the match.

254
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,760
 But my favorite thing about her is that in between points,

255
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,680
 she would sit and drink wine and cognac.

256
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,640
 Because she felt that that was the only way

257
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
 she could play properly.

258
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
 - Wow.

259
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,200
 - In between points, not in between--

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,680
 - Well, changeovers, I guess.

261
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,520
 Games.

262
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,360
 - Okay, all right.

263
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,040
 - That's 'cause you do get points docked

264
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,840
 for interrupting a point in order to have a drink.

265
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,000
 I think that's pushing it.

266
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,080
 - A cramp, you're not allowed,

267
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,520
 but a drink of cognac is actually fine.

268
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,000
 And she was so powerful

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,240
 in terms of getting people to come and see her

270
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
 that when she wanted to go and play in America,

271
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,120
 the USTA conspired to circumnavigate

272
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
 the prohibition laws

273
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,320
 that would mean that she could actually drink in America.

274
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,160
 - Oh, really?

275
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,980
 - So that she could take part in the tournament

276
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,400
 'cause she wouldn't play without drinking.

277
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,520
 - Wow.

278
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,280
 - That's amazing.

279
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,080
 - The most watched tennis game of all time

280
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,640
 was The Battle of the Sexes.

281
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,240
 The very famous match.

282
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,240
 And so this was obviously the tennis game

283
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,920
 that's played between Polygyne King and Bobby Riggs

284
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,640
 to definitively decide whether a woman

285
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,600
 could be a man at tennis, quite bizarre concept.

286
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,480
 But I had not realized how many people watched it.

287
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,840
 90 million people tuned in to watch it.

288
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,680
 - Wow.

289
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,520
 - Wow.

290
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,720
 - And Bobby Riggs said,

291
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,240
 "It was the most disappointing,

292
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,800
 "disheartening experience of my life losing."

293
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,960
 But she's kind of sad for him.

294
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,040
 He was, and it wasn't even a victory for King

295
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,000
 because she was 29 and he was 55.

296
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,080
 So it's quite hard to lord that over him.

297
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,440
 She actually said to be a 55-year-old guy

298
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,240
 was no thrill for me at all.

299
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,160
 The thrill was exposing a lot of new people to tennis.

300
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
 - Okay.

301
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,240
 - But yeah, everyone in straight sets.

302
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,520
 - She said that it was never about the athleticism

303
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
 and she would say that

304
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,040
 'cause obviously quite the advantage.

305
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,560
 She said it was about respect is what she said.

306
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,240
 She wanted to prove that women could compete against men.

307
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
 - Yeah.

308
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
 - And she did that.

309
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,840
 I mean, it was amazing.

310
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,320
 - So speaking of greatest players of all time,

311
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,840
 Anna recommended a book to me recently,

312
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,240
 which I've ordered and I've just been reading reviews of it,

313
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,040
 which is Andre Agassiz autobiography,

314
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 which is said to be one of the greatest

315
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,800
 sort of tell-alls of recent years.

316
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,240
 In the 90s, when he had his awesome long hair

317
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,120
 that was coming down from his bandana,

318
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,840
 turns out that was a wig.

319
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,480
 The whole time he was wearing a wig on the court.

320
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,720
 I had no idea.

321
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,760
 I mean, he was a hero in my day.

322
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,400
 - But does it say why?

323
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,040
 'Cause that must have been so annoying to play with a big,

324
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,120
 'cause it was a big wig.

325
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
 It was like a mullet wig.

326
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,440
 'Cause a lot of hair at the back of your hair.

327
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,280
 - A huge amount of hair at the back.

328
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,240
 He was going bald and he didn't wanna go bald

329
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
 and he just thought he was less rock and roll

330
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,560
 and his hair was falling out in the shower

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,360
 and so on and he thought it's gonna look disgusting

332
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,000
 when it's in the grass and on the clay.

333
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,280
 - I mean, sure, but like, why a mullet?

334
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,640
 Why so much, right?

335
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,880
 He's over-competiting with like...

336
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,360
 - He went all the way down his back.

337
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,880
 - Look, he was an angry man.

338
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,680
 There's no explaining his actions in those days.

339
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,760
 Well, there is explaining it.

340
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,040
 He was trained, almost tortured with the aim

341
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,880
 of making him a great tennis player, which he was.

342
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,480
 But it's a brilliant book.

343
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,960
 It's kind of a sad book.

344
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,080
 He had so many issues back then.

345
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,280
 So the bit of it that I remember

346
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,560
 is that he was married to Brooke Shields for a while

347
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,920
 and there was this scene in Friends,

348
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,040
 which people probably remember,

349
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,400
 where Joey Tribbiani has a stalker.

350
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,320
 So when he's on Days of Our Lives, he has a stalker

351
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,560
 who thinks that he's the real Dr. Drake Ramore

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,680
 and that stalker is played by Brooke Shields

353
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
 and she's a crazy, creepy stalker

354
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,040
 and she licks his hands at one point

355
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,680
 in this really crazy, creepy way.

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,040
 And when Andre Agassi saw that scene,

357
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,200
 he was so overwhelmed with hatred and jealousy

358
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,240
 that he drove home and he smashed all of his tennis trophies.

359
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,040
 So all the tennis trophies he's won up until that point

360
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
 were completely destroyed.

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,560
 So he smashed them to pieces.

362
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,480
 -What? -Wow.

363
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,120
 -He was an angry man. -And then she filed for divorce.

364
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,840
 -Very quickly after that. -He lived happily ever after.

365
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,640
 He's now made a steppy graph.

366
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,160
 Like two of the greatest tennis players ever.

367
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,360
 They're like two of the only people

368
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,120
 that have ever done the Golden Slam,

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,640
 which is winning all four Grand Slams

370
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,960
 and the Olympic Gold Medal, and they're married.

371
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,880
 -Strong. -Isn't that insane?

372
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,200
 And both very fucked up by tennis.

373
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,480
 I think that's what drew them together.

374
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,200
 -It's a bond. -They kind of both hated tennis.

375
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
 Yeah, exactly. That's a really good point.

376
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,440
 Because they were both children of obsessed fathers

377
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,240
 with the game, right?

378
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,760
 And apparently the two dads, when they met,

379
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
 almost came to blows while arguing

380
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,560
 over who had the superior backhand technique.

381
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,360
 -Did we? -It must have been a really fun wedding.

382
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,680
 Hey, someone else who had a fun record

383
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,160
 was the only person ever to win the men's doubles,

384
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,640
 the mixed doubles, and the men's singles at Wimbledon.

385
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,680
 And that was Bobby Riggs.

386
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,200
 And the fun thing about this,

387
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,640
 so this guy who then lost to Billy Jean King,

388
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,800
 the fun thing about this was that this was in 1939,

389
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,920
 but he was mostly known after that

390
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,000
 for being an inveterate gambler and a real rogue.

391
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,320
 And we should say that he became friends with Billy Jean King,

392
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,520
 so the whole misogynist thing was an act,

393
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,000
 and they became very good friends afterwards,

394
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,680
 and she spoke to him the day before he died.

395
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,800
 So he was a rogue, so he was obsessed with gambling.

396
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,480
 He put a bet on himself in 1939

397
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,640
 to win the men's doubles, the mixed doubles,

398
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,200
 and the men's singles.

399
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,880
 And this had never been done, never been done since.

400
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,960
 And so he won $108,000,

401
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,000
 so the equivalent of $1.5 million at the time.

402
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
 -Yeah. -Wow.

403
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,560
 And he only put... I think he put $500 on.

404
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,920
 -Well done, Bobby. -Good on him.

405
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,960
 Well, Billy Jean King said that he was always one of her heroes

406
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,720
 because he won that triple crown, I guess,

407
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
 and it was a great tennis player.

408
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,120
 And she said that she thought it was the fact

409
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,680
 that his career had been overshadowed

410
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,520
 by the Second World War that made him so bitter.

411
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
 -Oh, really? -No one really remembered him.

412
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,800
 And his achievements, 'cause that's a pretty major thing.

413
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,480
 No one's done it since, and no one really gave him credit for it.

414
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,760
 It was bigger news then, and it's bigger news now.

415
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,280
 Yeah, you can't imagine much sympathy

416
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
 with the war veterans around the table.

417
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,040
 Oh, God, my life is ruined by World War II as well.

418
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
 Tell me about it.

419
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:45,160
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

420
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,840
 My fact this week is that when Britain invaded Iceland in 1940,

421
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,400
 they knocked on all the doors before breaking them down

422
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,080
 and officially apologized for the inconvenience.

423
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,480
 Chills. So proud.

424
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
 So proud of my nation.

425
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,280
 They have flasks of tea as well.

426
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,920
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

427
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,440
 This was the British invasion of Iceland in 1940,

428
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,640
 which I didn't know happened.

429
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,280
 And so don't worry, it wasn't too big a deal.

430
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,880
 And it was almost not an invasion.

431
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
 It was basically an invasion

432
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,080
 because the Brits didn't tell Iceland about it.

433
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,200
 So it was in May 1940, and it's called Operation Fork.

434
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,200
 And basically, the Germans had their eyes on Iceland.

435
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,000
 They'd just taken charge of Norway and Denmark.

436
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
 And Iceland seemed like the obvious next step.

437
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,320
 So the Brits thought, let's get there in advance of the Germans.

438
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,000
 And they thought, if we ask the Icelandics if we can go in,

439
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,800
 then they might say no, 'cause Iceland was very determinedly neutral.

440
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
 They were really like, we're not getting involved

441
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,000
 with this whole war business, not a jam.

442
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
 And so we thought they'll probably say no.

443
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,160
 So let's just storm them, let's just invade.

444
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,480
 So Britain invaded, but they invaded very politely.

445
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,320
 So the British commander was a guy called Sturgis,

446
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,920
 and he issued fliers immediately after getting there,

447
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,520
 apologizing sincerely for the inconvenience

448
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,840
 and saying, look, we're just saving you from the Germans.

449
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,720
 Really, really sorry about this invasion.

450
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,360
 And they took over communications,

451
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,160
 like any good invasion does, you know,

452
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,840
 they seize radio communications and stuff like that.

453
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,960
 But before breaking all the doors down to those buildings,

454
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
 they did knock on the doors.

455
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,760
 And then once they've broken them down,

456
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,360
 they showered the janitor with apologies, apparently,

457
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,600
 in the big radio building that they invaded.

458
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,880
 - They didn't speak Icelandic,

459
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,800
 so they would have been apologizing, I think,

460
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,040
 in another language.

461
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,360
 They may have had a translator with them,

462
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,320
 but they really--

463
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,920
 - It was the worst planned.

464
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,280
 It's unbelievably shoddy reading this incredible account of it.

465
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,120
 So they planned to invade in secret,

466
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,000
 so they were sending a couple of detachments of troops,

467
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
 several hundred troops.

468
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,360
 I think about 700, maybe, was the invasion force.

469
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,960
 And they thought they were departing from Scotland.

470
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
 Greenock was the station they were getting to,

471
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
 and they thought, let's be inconspicuous,

472
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,320
 let's send the troops so they arrive staggered in Greenock,

473
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,000
 so it's not clear whether they're sending huge arms like us.

474
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
 Exactly, really clever.

475
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400
 Unfortunately, due to delays on the line,

476
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,840
 all the soldiers arrived in Greenock

477
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,240
 at exactly the same time.

478
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,320
 It was manifestly obvious they were planning something big.

479
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,160
 So--

480
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,320
 - That's even more British

481
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,200
 than the more apologizing, to be fair.

482
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,120
 - Yes, the trains didn't work well.

483
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,640
 - Yeah, nothing wrong on time.

484
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,960
 - Andy, didn't they also--

485
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,720
 The idea was let's invade by night,

486
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,760
 but in May, in that bit of the year,

487
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
 Iceland is basically bathed in light.

488
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,440
 Even though it wasn't completely light,

489
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,920
 it was light enough that people saw it coming,

490
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,360
 crowds formed because it was a public holiday

491
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,560
 and a payday for all of the fishermen.

492
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,520
 So they were drinking late into the night out on the docks,

493
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,160
 looking out, going, oh, what are those massive ships coming?

494
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,400
 - Imagine how fun that is, 'cause you're on a night out,

495
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,760
 you're thinking, what are we gonna do now?

496
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,640
 The pubs have shut, a bit boring, do we go home?

497
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,720
 And then round the corner, invading Naval Force, dreamy.

498
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,560
 - Amazing.

499
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
 - I mean, that's gonna extend your night.

500
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,440
 - And they wouldn't have known if it was a German invasion,

501
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,280
 a British invasion.

502
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,240
 Think of that kind of the buildup of that.

503
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,080
 What ship is it?

504
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,920
 Can we see it yet?

505
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,200
 - Yeah, what do you guess?

506
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,560
 - There was jeopardy at the time over that,

507
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,440
 because as you say, there were shapes of ships,

508
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,560
 ship shapes, if you like, in the water.

509
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
 And I think they sent out a late night policeman

510
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,200
 on his bicycle to try and assess the situation a bit better,

511
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,080
 but he came back and said, I can't see what kind they are.

512
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,680
 - Where did he ride to?

513
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,480
 How is he getting further than anyone else at the dock?

514
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,440
 - Maybe they sent a policeman with the best eyesight,

515
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,280
 I'm not sure.

516
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,080
 But the invasion force had already

517
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,720
 massively given themselves away,

518
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,920
 because one of the ships traveling

519
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,280
 had a little seaplane attached to it,

520
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,080
 which was a model of plane called a super marine walrus,

521
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,920
 which is a great name for a plane.

522
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
 Really good.

523
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
 You know, you want an amphibious plane,

524
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,440
 super marine walrus, brilliant.

525
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
 Anyway, they sent up the pilot saying,

526
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,400
 look, we're looking for German submarines in the area,

527
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
 which could be a huge threat.

528
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,000
 We've got hundreds of troops on these ships.

529
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,920
 So look for subs in the area, be careful,

530
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
 don't fly directly over Reykjavík,

531
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,120
 the main city in Iceland,

532
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,480
 which the plane immediately then did several times,

533
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,880
 waking up everyone in Reykjavík.

534
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,000
 - I mean--

535
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,080
 - This is such a balls up, I love it.

536
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,320
 - It's truly heinous, it's brilliant.

537
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,040
 The soldiers hadn't fired their guns,

538
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,320
 lots of them had never fired the rifles

539
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,800
 they'd just been issued with.

540
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,040
 - Really? - Yeah.

541
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
 - They didn't need to, to be fair.

542
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
 They brought some loaded rifles,

543
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,480
 but it was very much a case of the ship docking,

544
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,280
 and in fact, I think the British ambassador

545
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,960
 who was the only person in Iceland

546
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,240
 who knew that what was gonna happen,

547
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,440
 the British ambassador sort of saying to the crowd,

548
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,480
 do you mind standing back a bit

549
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,960
 so these invading soldiers can climb off their ships

550
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,320
 and invade you, and everyone's like,

551
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,040
 yeah, yeah, of course, so sorry,

552
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,560
 so sorry to have gone the way.

553
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,520
 (laughing)

554
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,280
 - One of the Icelanders snatched a rifle from a marine

555
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
 and just stuffed a cigarette in it,

556
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,120
 and then threw it back to him,

557
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,080
 telling him to be more careful.

558
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,920
 - Really?

559
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,480
 - And then the marine got towed off

560
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,880
 by his commanding officer.

561
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,120
 - That looked really good.

562
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,320
 - Oh, you probably would have been told off

563
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 for having a random dude manage to snatch your rifle off you,

564
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,680
 like that's pretty bad soldiering.

565
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,600
 - We should say, I think everything we're saying

566
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,960
 is from this fantastic article,

567
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,200
 so I think we should cite it.

568
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
 It's this article in Hakai Magazine,

569
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
 and it's sort of my new favorite site,

570
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,320
 I've been reading it for about six months now,

571
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,800
 and it's ostensibly a site about fishing, really,

572
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,360
 but the article's just amazing on it.

573
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,840
 I'm addicted to it, so it's a great magazine

574
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,680
 if you wanna read it.

575
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,400
 - And this article is amazing.

576
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
 Highly recommend checking it out.

577
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
 I mean, it opens with this amazing thing

578
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,440
 that some of the earliest colored footage

579
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,640
 that we have of Iceland was taken

580
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,600
 from the camera of Eva Braun, Hitler's girlfriend.

581
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,120
 She was the one who had trained it on Iceland,

582
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,240
 and she caught these little children on camera,

583
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,040
 and it's just mad that that's some of the earliest footage

584
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,840
 that we have is filmed by Hitler's crew.

585
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 - Just on a cruise holiday, right?

586
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,500
 - On a cruise holiday, on a Nazi cruise holiday, right?

587
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,800
 Like, this was part of a Nazi incentive.

588
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
 - If the politics thing doesn't work,

589
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,640
 maybe the whole cruise ship thing might take off.

590
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,360
 - And I didn't realize that she was,

591
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,080
 as is mentioned again in this article,

592
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,880
 that she was hidden as a girlfriend to the German public

593
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,000
 because much like the Beatles or other pop bands,

594
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,080
 the idea that Hitler being in a relationship

595
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,040
 would have put women off joining the party,

596
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,040
 but Hitler as a bachelor was, you know, like,

597
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,320
 "Ah, Hitler!"

598
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,160
 It was a bigger--

599
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,980
 - Oh yeah, 'cause Hitler was such a stud.

600
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,700
 - Well, he was in his mid-40s at this point.

601
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,100
 Surely at some point, the K-pop, not in a relationship,

602
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,780
 fiction has to wear out.

603
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,060
 There must be a recruitment ceiling

604
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,760
 where beyond which you're thinking,

605
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,800
 "Young women are not getting into the party

606
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,580
 "because they think Hitler might fancy them."

607
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,740
 Interesting counter-historical narrative.

608
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,220
 If Hitler had openly got a girlfriend,

609
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,580
 would he have been forced to leave

610
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,740
 like the K-pop stars who get boyfriends or girlfriends?

611
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,560
 Instead, we'd be talking about some guy

612
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,600
 who ran a cruise ship company.

613
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,440
 - God, yeah, I can imagine Goebbels

614
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,880
 actually knocking on the door saying,

615
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,480
 "May, I'm so sorry."

616
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,600
 Sort of the dominant comments with time.

617
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,920
 - Yeah, I can't start with him.

618
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,800
 - So this invasion was about Norway and Denmark,

619
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,880
 so they'd been taken over by the Nazis.

620
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,680
 So, Eisen was under Danish control at the time,

621
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,440
 although it sort of seceded for the war

622
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,720
 and Norway was right there.

623
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,160
 And so the reason that the Brits invaded

624
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,180
 was because Germany was getting dangerously close to Iceland.

625
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,380
 But in Norway, it was illegal under Nazi occupation

626
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,660
 to do various things.

627
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,900
 It was illegal to wear a paperclip as a brooch.

628
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,260
 And that was because students used to wear them

629
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,140
 as a sign of resistance against the Nazis

630
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,700
 to show that they were bound together.

631
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,140
 And there was another thing people used to do

632
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,300
 which became a thing in Norway,

633
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,340
 which was giving wrong street directions.

634
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,060
 So Nazi soldiers arrived in Norway

635
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,460
 and didn't know where anything was

636
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,900
 and so would ask for directions to places.

637
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,520
 And the thing became to point them

638
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,040
 in the opposite direction to where they wanted to go.

639
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,360
 And also, illegal to stand on a bus

640
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,200
 if a seat was available, why?

641
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 - Wait, did people refuse to sit next to German soldiers?

642
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,160
 - It's absolutely correct, yeah, yeah.

643
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,980
 - That's pretty petty making a law saying

644
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,840
 you have to sit next to our soldiers

645
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,800
 in case their feelings are hurt, I presume.

646
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,760
 - It's pretty sad.

647
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
 - Maybe they're soldiers who are in relationships.

648
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,600
 No one wants to be near them, that's pretty good.

649
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
 - The Norwegian invasion,

650
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,440
 I don't know if we've said this before,

651
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,540
 is where the word "quisling" comes from to mean a traitor

652
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,300
 because their leader who collaborated with the Nazis

653
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,740
 was called Vidkun Quisling.

654
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,900
 So it's one of those cool examples

655
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,180
 of where an individual, a named individual

656
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,180
 becomes a word to mean characteristic.

657
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,820
 - Do you think you'd be pleased or excited or nervous

658
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,660
 if someone said to you, after you die,

659
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,740
 there's going to be a noun that's named after you?

660
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,140
 And that's all I'm telling you.

661
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,420
 'Cause it's, you know, you think,

662
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,060
 oh God, there's gonna be a noun quisling.

663
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,680
 That's so exciting, what's it gonna mean?

664
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,720
 Is it gonna be a really brave person?

665
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,560
 Is it gonna be a really beautiful object?

666
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,760
 - What would a Tyshensky be?

667
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,560
 - It would be like the perfect pub.

668
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,200
 - I think it would be a unit of alcohol,

669
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,240
 but like an unrealistically large.

670
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,880
 (all laughing)

671
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,000
 - One Tyshensky and you're on the floor.

672
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,580
 (upbeat music)

673
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

674
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,440
 and that is my fact.

675
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,500
 My fact this week is that 32 years

676
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,660
 after he defeated Alexander Hamilton in a duel,

677
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,220
 the last thing to happen to Aaron Burr on the day he died

678
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,540
 was that he was defeated in a court case

679
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,820
 by Alexander Hamilton Jr.

680
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,160
 - So incredible.

681
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,000
 - Amazing.

682
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,840
 - Yeah.

683
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,660
 - How so, Dan?

684
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,500
 How so?

685
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,780
 - Obviously we know Hamilton, the musical,

686
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,140
 based on Alexander Hamilton,

687
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,100
 one of the founding fathers of America,

688
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,500
 and the fact that he was murdered by Aaron Burr,

689
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,020
 who was the third vice president of the United States,

690
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,480
 and that happened in 1804.

691
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,080
 They had a duel and it resulted in Hamilton's death.

692
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,040
 So it was horrible.

693
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,200
 He died and it really had horrible ramifications

694
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,800
 for the rest of Burr's life

695
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,840
 that followed him all the way to his death.

696
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,720
 So in 1833, at the age of 77,

697
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,920
 Burr got remarried having lost his wife

698
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,400
 a number of years before

699
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,040
 to a lady called Eliza Jumel,

700
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,240
 who was a very wealthy widow herself.

701
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,440
 She was 19 years younger than he was,

702
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,740
 and he thought, okay, this is great.

703
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,980
 This is a second chance to have a huge bit of wealth

704
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,940
 in my life.

705
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,340
 And so he kind of took control of her wealth

706
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,380
 and squandered it.

707
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,460
 He invested it in very odd projects,

708
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,740
 and she cottoned on to this and went,

709
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,620
 "Hang on a second, you're bleeding me of all my money."

710
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,580
 So she decided to get a divorce.

711
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,060
 When she decided to get a divorce,

712
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
 the divorce lawyer that she hired

713
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,060
 was the son of Alexander Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton Jr.,

714
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,620
 who was an incredibly successful guy.

715
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,420
 This case was way below him.

716
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,440
 He'd passed doing this kind of menial stuff

717
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
 years and years ago,

718
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,440
 but he said, "Absolutely, I'll take it on."

719
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,200
 And he used the court case as an excuse

720
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,120
 to really showcase what a terrible person

721
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
 he thought Aaron Burr was.

722
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,560
 He talked about all his affairs and so on.

723
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,520
 And the court case took three years,

724
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,520
 and it was finally settled in the favor of Eliza Jumel.

725
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,120
 On the very day that Aaron Burr died just a few hours

726
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,320
 before he passed away,

727
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,080
 a final little defeat from the Hamilton.

728
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,720
 So he didn't hear about it before he died.

729
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,560
 - We don't know.

730
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,980
 I don't actually know that.

731
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,060
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

732
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,980
 I hope he--

733
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,480
 - Dan, why don't you know that?

734
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,320
 (laughing)

735
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,580
 - Come on, mate, do your research.

736
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,420
 Go back in time.

737
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
 - Get the facts right, come on.

738
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,660
 - Thank you for saying it, Jamie.

739
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,300
 We've all been thinking it for years.

740
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,140
 - That's what I'm here for.

741
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,980
 - So this is another,

742
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,820
 'cause one of the famous things in the musical

743
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,980
 is that Alexander Hamilton had a son

744
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,380
 who died in a duel.

745
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,740
 - Yeah, yes, correct, that was his eldest son.

746
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,740
 Yeah, Philip, Philip Hamilton died

747
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,920
 in the duel, and he was defending the honor

748
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,640
 of his dad, Alexander Hamilton.

749
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,600
 Someone was like bad-mouthing his dad,

750
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,760
 and so he was like, "I'm not having that.

751
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,120
 "See you on the dueling field, sir."

752
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,440
 And then he, yeah, died.

753
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,280
 - Yeah.

754
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,120
 - Well, then they did the thing

755
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,280
 that they used to do in the olden days,

756
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,480
 which I always find a bit creepy

757
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,080
 of calling their next son, Philip, as well,

758
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,160
 which always feels like a bit of a burden to carry.

759
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,960
 In fact, they called him Philip II.

760
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,800
 - Oh, wow.

761
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,440
 The son, their next son, born after Philip,

762
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,880
 the elder son had died.

763
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,620
 - Yeah, yeah, the next year, I think.

764
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,940
 - So he started with Philip,

765
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,380
 then he named a later son, Alexander Jr.,

766
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,320
 which feels like the first name you go to.

767
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,280
 - Yeah. - That's true.

768
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,820
 And then later on went to another vet.

769
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,900
 This is too mixed up for me.

770
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,880
 - I have a quick pitch, a musical pitch here,

771
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,760
 and we should say, Jamie, you actually are friends

772
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,560
 with the creator of the Hamilton musical,

773
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,240
 Lin-Manuel Miranda.

774
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,120
 He's been on my dad wrote a porno, right?

775
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,560
 And you've hung out with him.

776
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,060
 - Best friend, Cleveland. - So you could probably get

777
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,040
 this idea to him on my behalf.

778
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,160
 - Okay.

779
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,840
 - Sequel to the musical Hamilton, Hamilton Jr., okay?

780
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,320
 That's the sequel, because the story

781
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,200
 of Alexander Hamilton Jr. is extraordinary.

782
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,280
 He was obviously from a family destroyed

783
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,760
 by two deaths as a result of gun-jeweling.

784
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,920
 His sister, sadly, lost her mind

785
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,480
 off the back of her father, dying.

786
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,600
 He was sort of grew up in a broken household,

787
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,960
 but he rose above it all

788
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,520
 and became this extraordinary character.

789
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,900
 So he was someone who eventually went on

790
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,620
 to become a colonel fighting against Napoleon.

791
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,340
 He sailed to Spain in 1811,

792
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,820
 and he was fighting with the first Duke of Wellington.

793
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,140
 He came back to America.

794
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,500
 He became a lawyer.

795
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,820
 He was a big part of Wall Street

796
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,620
 when he became a real estate agent

797
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,060
 and built that up as well.

798
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,180
 And it's full of little cameos.

799
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,020
 It's a great story where when he was just traveling

800
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,620
 in the West, he met Abraham Lincoln,

801
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,940
 who was at that point a state legislator,

802
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,380
 nowhere near being coming president.

803
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,660
 He met him in a grocery store,

804
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,900
 where he said Lincoln was lying on the counter

805
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,840
 in the midday telling stories.

806
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,520
 Just laying there, just given a yarn of what was going on.

807
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,660
 - Wow, was there a cue?

808
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,520
 I mean, that's very annoying if you're third of the UK.

809
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,720
 You're trying to buy a broccoli.

810
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,880
 Some lunatic sprawled out on the counter.

811
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,320
 - Honest Dave, shut up.

812
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,000
 - Dan, would you call it Hamilton?

813
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,520
 As in, I'm just trying to work out what it would be called.

814
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,960
 Like, is it Hamilton with two L's in the middle,

815
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,600
 Hamill or Tom? - Oh yeah.

816
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,840
 - Or is it Hamill two on, which is where?

817
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,400
 - Yes, you've put the two in place of the T at the end, yeah.

818
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
 - Yeah.

819
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,040
 - Hamilton. - That's better, that's better.

820
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,360
 - Hamilton.

821
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,680
 - Nice.

822
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,580
 - Their descendants, Hamilton's and Burst descendants,

823
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,540
 are now friends with each other.

824
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,880
 They know each other.

825
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,060
 I think they live in New York,

826
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,940
 or they certainly did a while ago.

827
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,360
 They met Alexandra Hamilton Woods and Antonio Burr.

828
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,520
 They met at a party in 2007,

829
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,820
 and they worked out that they had a familial connection.

830
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,680
 And they would go kayaking together.

831
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,760
 - Yeah, they're part of this.

832
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,200
 So they're both psychoanalysts,

833
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,160
 and they met at a big psychoanalyst party,

834
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,600
 and they were introduced, and because of the surnames,

835
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,760
 they were like, "Any chance,

836
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,040
 "Alexandra Hamilton, that you are related?"

837
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,480
 And it turned out she was.

838
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,520
 And he said that he's part of this kayaking club,

839
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,720
 which kayaks on the Hudson,

840
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,320
 which is the river that Hamilton and Burr had to cross

841
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,020
 in order to get to their dueling spot.

842
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,640
 So they actually do kayak very near to the spot

843
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,620
 where the duel happened together.

844
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,460
 And they're both--

845
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,680
 - God, that must be tense, surely.

846
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,520
 - Yeah, surely.

847
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,360
 - One of them just starts reaching into the bottom

848
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,120
 of the kayak and pulling out a pistol.

849
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,680
 Remember this?

850
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,080
 They do have to get into arguments

851
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
 with each other sometimes in debate,

852
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,680
 because they're both part of the Inwood Canoe Club,

853
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,520
 you know, the high board.

854
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,480
 So he's one of them's a treasurer,

855
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,800
 and Burr is the president emeritus.

856
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,640
 So--

857
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,440
 - But finally became president.

858
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,280
 That's nice.

859
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,440
 - It's not quite the high stakes battles of yore, is it?

860
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,280
 - No.

861
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,120
 - Canoe club.

862
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,900
 - One thing I do love about Aaron Burr,

863
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,300
 and because you've got me on the show,

864
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,620
 I feel this is fitting for me to bring up,

865
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,560
 but in 1861, a piece of erotica was published,

866
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,900
 all about Aaron Burr.

867
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,980
 - Really?

868
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,060
 - Really, this is true.

869
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,300
 It was called The Amorous Intrigues

870
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,520
 and Adventures of Aaron Burr.

871
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,140
 And 'cause he had quite a reputation

872
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,060
 for being a womanizer,

873
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,100
 I think you mentioned earlier, Dan,

874
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,220
 and a lot of his enemies, including Hamilton,

875
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
 who was also a bit of a womanizer himself,

876
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,980
 would often kind of use that as a reason to attack him.

877
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,760
 And so some anonymous person,

878
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,640
 could it have been Alexander Hamilton II or whoever,

879
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,400
 wrote this sexy book all about Aaron Burr.

880
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
 - Have you read it?

881
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,880
 - I tried to find some so that I could read it out,

882
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,080
 Al and my dad wrote a porno,

883
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,560
 but I just couldn't find it anywhere.

884
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,520
 - Good news, I found out about this book as well,

885
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,800
 and I did find an extract,

886
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,880
 so I'm gonna put it in the chat here.

887
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,680
 - Okay.

888
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,260
 (upbeat music)

889
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,600
 (upbeat music)

890
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,580
 - The warm-hearted girl sighed heavily.

891
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,580
 There was a choking sensation in her throat,

892
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,780
 and her large, dark eyes were rolled up in her head

893
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,100
 with such a softness in their expression

894
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,080
 that Burr must have been more or less than man.

895
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,100
 God, this is worse than my dad's.

896
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,620
 Not to have desired a more intimate acquaintance with her.

897
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,140
 Burr threw up.

898
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,460
 Oh, sorry, Burr threw up her clothes.

899
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,220
 (laughing)

900
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,180
 - It's very niche kind of porno, I've got to hear.

901
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,300
 - Burr threw up, different line, guys.

902
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,420
 Burr threw up her clothes and revealed such charms

903
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,260
 as seldom have been exposed to the light of the sun.

904
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,980
 Oh, that's beautiful.

905
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,060
 The smooth, round belly,

906
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,100
 the voluminous yet compact thighs,

907
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,780
 the robust calf and small foot and ankle,

908
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,260
 the satin smoothness of the skin

909
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,100
 and other graces not to be mentioned.

910
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,860
 Well, it's erotica, mate, mention them.

911
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,140
 That's what we're here for.

912
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,980
 (laughing)

913
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
 But who's pouting--

914
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,860
 - I'm trying to curse you now.

915
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,940
 - But who's pouting and most freshness

916
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,580
 betokened a guarded virginity,

917
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,660
 which, however, longed for the pressure of manhood.

918
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,820
 All these so fired him with passion

919
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,200
 that he had scarcely the necessary patience

920
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,140
 to prepare himself for the amorous encounter.

921
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,980
 Burr.

922
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,980
 - It's hot.

923
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,180
 - It's hot. - That is hot.

924
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,140
 - A red worse.

925
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,660
 - I don't know if I would be happy

926
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,780
 that this is how he's gonna be remembered

927
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,300
 'cause I'm finding it impossible to divorce the real Aaron Burr

928
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,060
 from that fictional account now.

929
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,780
 (laughing)

930
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,260
 Do you guys know the woman who,

931
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,060
 he was divorcing, who Burr was divorcing

932
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,660
 in this original fact, Eliza Jumel?

933
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,160
 So she was kind of interesting.

934
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,140
 She was very much gossiped about,

935
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,140
 I bet there's some fan porn fiction about her

936
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,740
 around and about.

937
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,580
 And she was--

938
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,840
 - Oh, I'm sure she's in the book.

939
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,960
 - She must be in the book, actually, right.

940
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,640
 She was very poor and she married up above her station,

941
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,200
 this very rich man called Stephen, Stephen Jumel.

942
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,400
 And then he died, apparently, according to reports,

943
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,200
 falling off a hay cart and onto a pitchfork,

944
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,660
 which sounds almost completely implausible.

945
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,000
 (laughing)

946
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,800
 - That's someone who's stabbed him with a pitchfork,

947
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,620
 hastily positioning him so he looks

948
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,060
 like he fell off the hay cart.

949
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,900
 Come on.

950
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,940
 - Just put the pitchfork facing up

951
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,540
 with his body at the top, oh, that was suspect.

952
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,420
 Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, the rumor spread

953
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,900
 that she killed him and then let him bleed out,

954
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,300
 so all these rumors about her.

955
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,180
 And she, so she then divorced Burr,

956
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,500
 but the other thing about her is,

957
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,980
 and this is why I think Burr's quite exciting,

958
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,300
 'cause he's been responsible for two

959
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,860
 of the greatest pieces of entertainment

960
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,380
 of the last 10 years.

961
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,540
 'Cause after divorcing Burr and Burr dying,

962
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,600
 she employed in New York a housekeeper called Ann Northup.

963
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,080
 And Ann Northup is the wife of Solomon,

964
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,400
 Solomon Northup, who was the person in 12 Years of the Slaves

965
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,240
 who was abducted and sold into slavery,

966
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,520
 and that was Solomon Northup.

967
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,760
 So while her husband was missing,

968
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,360
 Ann Northup was working for Eliza Dhumel.

969
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,400
 So how cool is that?

970
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,440
 They were sort of a duo together for a while, a double act.

971
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,280
 - That's amazing.

972
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,640
 - And then she lived in the oldest mansion in New York,

973
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,820
 which is now a hotbed for ghost hunters, Dan,

974
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,980
 if you're ever there.

975
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,540
 - Yeah, well, actually, I read a book by Hans Holzer,

976
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,300
 who is the person who Ghostbusters is based on.

977
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,580
 And he says that when Hamilton was shot,

978
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,620
 he went back to a house in New York

979
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,340
 and supposedly the house that he died in,

980
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,300
 the ghost of Hamilton still haunts,

981
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,860
 and Hans Holzer went to investigate that.

982
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,380
 And if you go to this house in New York these days,

983
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,820
 what you need to listen out for is the toilet flushing,

984
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,720
 because apparently Hamilton is obsessed with toilets,

985
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,400
 because it's a technology he didn't know in his days.

986
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,740
 This is the thing they say about ghosts generally.

987
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,960
 Ghosts are obsessed-- - What?

988
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,920
 - Ghosts apparently are obsessed with toilets

989
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,080
 and flushing them.

990
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,680
 So if you hear a rogue toilet flush in that house,

991
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,720
 it could be Hamilton.

992
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,480
 - It's not Hamilton, but it could be, I suppose,

993
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,920
 if we're gonna stretch.

994
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,880
 - According to Hans Holzer is what I'm saying.

995
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,200
 - Yeah, sure, sure.

996
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,520
 - It's a big caveat.

997
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,640
 So you're saying ghost today,

998
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,820
 they come to the future and they've got the internet,

999
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,460
 they've got aeroplanes, they've got space travel,

1000
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,080
 they've got microwaves, they've got cars and trains.

1001
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,240
 And you're saying the flush of a toilet,

1002
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,500
 that's what astonishes them,

1003
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,060
 which I believe the flushing toilet,

1004
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,100
 some sort of flushing toilet was invented

1005
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,460
 in the Zebethan times, wasn't it?

1006
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,540
 Is that the only thing that can impress them?

1007
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,980
 - I don't know why you say I'm claiming this.

1008
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,720
 All I mean is passing on Hans Holzer,

1009
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,080
 legendary ghost hunters knowledge.

1010
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,740
 But we're blaming the messenger here again.

1011
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,280
 - And also, ghosts can't hold things or touch it.

1012
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,940
 How could they operate a toilet?

1013
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,880
 It makes no sense.

1014
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,400
 - Oh, no, I mean, they can, they can smash mirrors

1015
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,240
 and they can--

1016
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,080
 - They're poltergeist.

1017
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,420
 - Poltergeist, no, you're very confused there.

1018
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,600
 - I don't believe I've been well-behaved poltergeist

1019
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,960
 to an only-interested sanitation.

1020
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,000
 (laughing)

1021
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,580
 (upbeat music)

1022
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:41,420
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1023
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,680
 and that is Andy.

1024
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,600
 - My fact is that the police in Paris

1025
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,260
 have an elite unit of cops who are armed,

1026
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,980
 but also on roller blades.

1027
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,300
 - Ah, yes they are.

1028
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,460
 - Yeah.

1029
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,700
 - Actually, when you said this fact,

1030
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,180
 I wanna know what you mean by elite,

1031
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
 'cause that sounds like something they tell the cops

1032
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,420
 to reassure them they don't have like complete twerks

1033
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,260
 on roller blades.

1034
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,500
 - Yeah, that's so fair.

1035
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,540
 I think maybe I mean niche unit of cops.

1036
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,860
 (laughing)

1037
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,900
 - The ones that are useless to anything else, yeah.

1038
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,620
 (laughing)

1039
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,820
 - So, are they real cops, right?

1040
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,660
 - They're not cops.

1041
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,500
 - They're not token.

1042
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,240
 - No, they have guns and truncheons

1043
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,560
 and they, I mean, there aren't very many of them,

1044
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,200
 you know, compared with the overall Parisian police force,

1045
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,040
 but they are--

1046
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,880
 - Well, they're elite, yeah.

1047
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,720
 - They are real, yeah.

1048
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,480
 They have been going for about 20 years.

1049
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,280
 There are just eight members of this unit.

1050
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,320
 I know, it's extremely elite, yeah.

1051
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,240
 It's very hard to recruit into, obviously,

1052
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,940
 'cause you need someone who's unbelievably good

1053
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,040
 at rollerblading, but they do have advantages

1054
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,240
 in urban police work.

1055
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,860
 They can go about 30 kilometers an hour normally,

1056
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,020
 'cause they're quite heavily weighed down,

1057
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,140
 but if they really get a move on,

1058
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
 they can get up to about 50 kilometers an hour,

1059
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,780
 they claim, which is a lot faster than someone can run.

1060
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,900
 - Yeah, although as soon as that someone runs over cobblestones,

1061
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,740
 they're in serious trouble.

1062
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,380
 - Yeah, they're stuffed, they can't,

1063
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,820
 they really hate cobblestones.

1064
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,060
 (laughing)

1065
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,180
 - A similar scheme was piloted in London in 2000.

1066
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,460
 The Royal Parks Constabulary attempted to use them

1067
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,700
 in Kensington Gardens, but it was abandoned

1068
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,820
 because the minute someone ran on grass,

1069
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,080
 they were screwed, 'cause equally, like cobblestones,

1070
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
 rollerblading, not so great on grass.

1071
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,320
 - I can't believe they put them in the Royal Parks though,

1072
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,560
 which are mostly the grass.

1073
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,400
 - It's very much in the name.

1074
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,240
 - It's a predominantly grass environment.

1075
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,400
 - Should we go for the parks in the gardens for this?

1076
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
 - Well, what about the beaches?

1078
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,600
 Let's do the beaches.

1079
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,760
 - If they just put some clay in there as well,

1080
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,560
 it would have been perfect.

1081
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,160
 It is a ridiculous idea because it's only useful

1082
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,680
 if you have to give chase against someone

1083
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,880
 and immediately get them.

1084
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,940
 Any other situation of policing,

1085
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,380
 coming in with rollerblades is just ridiculous.

1086
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,540
 And these guys in Paris,

1087
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,500
 they are used for different situations.

1088
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,820
 They're sometimes asked to go and police other bits

1089
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,380
 outside of just the main street.

1090
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,780
 So sometimes they have to go and stop, you know,

1091
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,780
 fighting that's going on in a building.

1092
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,500
 And in the thing I read that like,

1093
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,280
 sometimes we have to go up to the fifth floor.

1094
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,580
 There's no elevator.

1095
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,580
 We're there in our rollerblades, going up the stairs,

1096
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,300
 and then we're arriving at the scene on rollerblades,

1097
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,180
 which no one can take seriously.

1098
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,240
 - Hang on, do you think surely if you're on the fifth floor,

1099
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,280
 it depends how many floors it is, but if it's five,

1100
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
 I'm definitely taking off my rollerblades,

1101
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,640
 running up the stairs, then putting them back on

1102
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,480
 at the top, aren't you?

1103
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,000
 - There's probably a guideline about how many floors

1104
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 it's acceptable to take off your blades for.

1105
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,280
 - You're so right, yeah.

1106
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,040
 Rollerblading is very much something

1107
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,000
 that shoots up and down in popularity

1108
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,720
 in one year, it'll be super popular.

1109
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,180
 But I remember going on French holidays with my friend

1110
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,680
 when we were kids.

1111
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,120
 And we used to rollerblade a lot then,

1112
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,920
 but I haven't seen much of it since.

1113
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,260
 And it's basically since the mid 19th century, isn't it?

1114
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,380
 Since it first took off, which was 1863,

1115
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,780
 and this is when a guy called James Leonard Plimpton

1116
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,340
 invented roller skates that actually worked.

1117
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,100
 So before that, you couldn't really go around corners.

1118
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,460
 And he finally invented wheels that were kind of attached

1119
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,020
 to a cushioned springy platform,

1120
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,980
 and also two rows of wheels rather than one.

1121
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,380
 So skates, not blades.

1122
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,500
 And it took off overnight, and it became this mad craze

1123
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,640
 to the extent that in 1885, in Scientific American,

1124
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,480
 there was an article that was roller skating,

1125
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,840
 The Medical View, which was analyzing why it was

1126
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,160
 that America got so obsessed with certain things.

1127
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
 And it started, it was such a good article,

1128
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,520
 and it rang so true for today.

1129
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,760
 It started, "We hear of no other country

1130
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,640
 so violently perturbed by waves of temperance crusading,

1131
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,800
 religious revivals, velocity crazes, pedestrianism."

1132
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,400
 No one walked, apparently before that.

1133
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,080
 And now, roller skating, which exceeds all the others,

1134
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,200
 and it was an analysis of how it had managed

1135
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,360
 to become such a mad craze,

1136
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,320
 and whether it was medically harmful.

1137
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,340
 And I concluded, no.

1138
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,480
 - Oh, it's safe.

1139
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,800
 It's safe, guys, thank God.

1140
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,640
 - Oh, thank God.

1141
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,760
 - It's safe, yeah, Andy, you can keep them on.

1142
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,800
 - Thank you.

1143
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,120
 - We should say, by the way, we keep saying roller blades,

1144
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,160
 and the reality, which I only just found out

1145
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,840
 through researching this, is that it's a brand name.

1146
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,020
 It's not the sport itself.

1147
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,420
 It's a trademark name.

1148
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,480
 It's a single manufacturer that make roller blades,

1149
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,800
 and the rest of it is called inline skating.

1150
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,000
 - Inline skating, that's the generic term.

1151
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,480
 - So, that's what we should be saying.

1152
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,680
 - Okay, nice.

1153
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,980
 - Yeah, we should redo this fact,

1154
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,720
 because we don't know they're wearing roller blades.

1155
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,420
 - No, you're right.

1156
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,260
 Oh, God.

1157
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,000
 - That's some budget police version.

1158
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,080
 - The guy who created the first popular inline skates

1159
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,720
 was a guy called Scott Olson.

1160
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,220
 He was a hockey player, and he made them in 1979.

1161
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,820
 They had been patented before,

1162
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
 and in fact, he was beaten by 20 years

1163
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,420
 by this lady from Palm Beach called Emma DeSaro,

1164
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,420
 who got a patent on inline skates.

1165
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,860
 She had the idea, and then the patent expired,

1166
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,540
 and she never made a penny out of it.

1167
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,700
 She was-- - No!

1168
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,500
 - They interviewed her years after

1169
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,820
 rollerblading had become a huge thing,

1170
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,500
 and she said, "Well, I'm obviously glad

1171
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,100
 "everyone's rollerblading, but I did have the idea

1172
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,940
 "of painting."

1173
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,780
 It's really a sad thing, yeah.

1174
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,620
 - Bless her.

1175
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,460
 - I know.

1176
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,920
 - You haven't invented anything else?

1177
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,000
 - No.

1178
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,600
 No, not as far as I know.

1179
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,920
 They weren't interviewing her, saying,

1180
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,680
 "We're off to be Emma DeSaro in her mansion,"

1181
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,200
 which she got after she invented thermodores or whatever.

1182
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,040
 I don't know.

1183
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,000
 - I can, but dream.

1184
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,400
 She did one day create something

1185
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,720
 that we all live day to day.

1186
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,400
 - I know, I know.

1187
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,520
 But so Olson, that's Scott Olson, the hockey player,

1188
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,320
 he has invented so many other silly sports

1189
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,280
 and means of getting around.

1190
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,200
 He's a bit of a hero.

1191
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,040
 So he was, I think, the guy behind the rollerblade company,

1192
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,780
 but then had terrible legal fallings out

1193
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,980
 and there were sheet, like, ructions

1194
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,660
 and he got kicked out and it was all very chaotic.

1195
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,100
 - Looks like Steve Jobs.

1196
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,940
 - Pretty much.

1197
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,220
 So in 1996, you made the row bike,

1198
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,700
 which is a bike with these kind of push-pull handles

1199
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,300
 and that's how you propel yourself along.

1200
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,140
 - Yeah.

1201
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,980
 - Very exciting.

1202
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,740
 He's made the sky ride, which is a rollercoaster,

1203
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,060
 but you have to pedal yourself around it.

1204
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,320
 (laughing)

1205
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,740
 This huge track suspended 150 feet up

1206
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,720
 and you get at the thing and you just have to pedal away.

1207
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,200
 It's better than it sounds guys, it looks really fun.

1208
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,080
 - Do you have a sort of safety net or something?

1209
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,640
 I mean, how high up are you for that?

1210
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,600
 - 150 feet, you're pretty high up.

1211
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,840
 - You must have a harness or something.

1212
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,200
 - Yeah, I have, yes, I imagine there are some basic

1213
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,520
 safety precautions they say.

1214
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
 - I mean, 'cause I can't get across monkey bars these days,

1215
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,000
 that's actually terrifying.

1216
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,360
 - You're sitting in a pod, you're sitting in a pod.

1217
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,320
 - You do thing with all inventors.

1218
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,240
 All great inventions, the key is, if there are enough darts,

1219
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,900
 one of them is gonna strike, because every inventor,

1220
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,340
 you look at their history and you go,

1221
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,420
 God, they invented a lot of shit, didn't they?

1222
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,740
 In amongst this whole penicillin thing,

1223
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,140
 they invented fluffy bicycles or whatever.

1224
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,660
 So the original inventor of roller blades, in fact,

1225
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,960
 which preceded roller skates by about 100 years,

1226
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,500
 was a guy called John Joseph Merlin,

1227
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,900
 who we've mentioned before.

1228
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,660
 And we've mentioned him in the context of

1229
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,740
 when he invented his blades to publicize his other

1230
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,680
 inventions, he showed them off by

1231
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,680
 blading straight into a mirror and smashing it.

1232
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,760
 So they didn't take off at all.

1233
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,120
 But his other inventions were kind of cool,

1234
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,440
 he invented a rotating tea table,

1235
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,840
 and this worked by having the teapot,

1236
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,760
 or like the samovar, that poured the tea in the middle,

1237
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,360
 and then he had all the cups around the outside,

1238
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,960
 and your hostess could spin the samovar,

1239
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,080
 which would pour and fill all the cups,

1240
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,440
 by just operating a pedal under the table.

1241
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,280
 - Oh, that's great.

1242
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,240
 - The lazy, lazy woman didn't even have to stand up

1243
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,600
 and pour the tea.

1244
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,080
 (laughing)

1245
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,060
 That was the start of women's day.

1246
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,580
 - I think he was attributed as well with inventing,

1247
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,380
 if you go on a merry-go-round,

1248
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,940
 it used to be a stagnant horse that would go around

1249
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,860
 the whole way, and he, I think,

1250
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,900
 invented the up and down motion of a merry-go-round horse.

1251
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,300
 - It's the best bit of a merry-go-round.

1252
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,620
 - That's not the best bit, Jamie.

1253
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,460
 - It is.

1254
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,300
 - Come on, come on, it is.

1255
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,140
 - Come on.

1256
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,540
 - It's about the going around in a circle.

1257
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,580
 - The best bit is the going round.

1258
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,460
 - There's only one way to test this, all right?

1259
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,900
 You both have to create your own merry-go-rounds,

1260
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,880
 one where the horse moves in a circle

1261
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,460
 and stays on the horizontal plane,

1262
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,020
 and the other way, it just goes up and down

1263
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,620
 and doesn't move around in a circle.

1264
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,540
 And you'll open one next to each other,

1265
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,060
 and you'll see who gets more punters.

1266
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,180
 - Oh my god, this is the Feder and Nadal court

1267
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,540
 of up and down, circular entertainment.

1268
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,380
 - It is.

1269
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,580
 - The problem with the one where you stay in one spot,

1270
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,540
 the horse goes up and down,

1271
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,700
 and you have to wave at your mum all the way through the ride.

1272
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,380
 (laughing)

1273
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,060
 I have one last really stupid thing of Rollerblades,

1274
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,980
 which is a 2016 report of the Wiltshire police

1275
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,880
 about the 999 calls they got.

1276
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,060
 One of their operators said that she'd taken a call

1277
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,860
 from someone who'd been out rollerblading at night

1278
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,260
 who wanted an officer to come and pick them up

1279
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,140
 because the caller had come across a very steep hill

1280
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,980
 that they couldn't rollerblade up,

1281
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,900
 and they went out stranded.

1282
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,500
 - Okay, that's the sort of thing that I would do

1283
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,340
 to be fair, come on.

1284
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,580
 (laughing)

1285
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,420
 - The operator said,

1286
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,300
 "I ascertained that the caller was not very far from home

1287
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,260
 and suggested that she contact a friend

1288
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,900
 or a family member to pick her up instead."

1289
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,260
 - Or take them off.

1290
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
 - The old take them off has come back in.

1291
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,880
 - Oh my god.

1292
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,220
 - Why not take them off?

1293
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,020
 - We got an email once from a guy called Marcus

1294
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,180
 that I don't think I've ever mentioned,

1295
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,380
 but it's such a good fact, which is that,

1296
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,240
 so in some countries you call different numbers

1297
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,220
 for a different emergency service,

1298
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,820
 and in Chad, the number you call for police is 17,

1299
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,740
 and the number you call for the fire department is 19.

1300
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,740
 And what do you think the number is

1301
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,780
 that you call for an ambulance?

1302
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,940
 - 21.

1303
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,300
 - 17, 19, 21.

1304
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,860
 - Oh, I like that logic.

1305
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,100
 I would have guessed 18.

1306
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,740
 It is in fact, 2251, 424.

1307
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,000
 (laughing)

1308
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,580
 (upbeat music)

1309
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,900
 - Okay, that's it.

1310
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,940
 That's all of our facts.

1311
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,340

00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,500
 There are a couple of episodes in now.

 And yeah, we will be back again next week

1335
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,420
 with another episode.

 So we'll see you all then.

1337
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,840
 Goodbye.
