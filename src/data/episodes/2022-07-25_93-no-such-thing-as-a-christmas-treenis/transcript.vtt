00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:55.040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.280
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden my name is Dan Shriver I'm sitting here

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.160
 with Anich Zinsky James Harkin and Andy Murray and once again we've gathered around the microphone

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.240
 this time with our four favorite Christmas facts because this is our Christmas day special

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.720
 and so in no particular order here we go starting with you James Harkin okay my fact this week

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 is that the oldest turkey in the UK is called dinner that's great and yet so cruel how old is he she

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.560
 it's a he and he is at least 16 years old okay and they know that because for 16 years they

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.320
 haven't eaten to do it does it get to a point where a bird is too old to eat you could eat it but I

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.800
 think birds tend to be nicer when they're younger right yeah because usually we eat turkeys when

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.000
 they're about really young right 12 weeks old chicken's especially very young indeed yeah yeah

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.080
 they just fatten them up straight away and kill them very Christmas everyone this um this on the farm

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.680
 that dinner lives there's a farmer called mr. Guy who sort of manages the farm and he believes

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.240
 that dinner has lived so long because he's got a girlfriend a turkey girlfriend not a human and he

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.600
 said he's got a girlfriend about five years ago and it seems to have given him a new lease of life

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.160
 he's certainly become a bit more of a show off wow how old is she it doesn't say I think it's a bit of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.720
 younger than younger than younger lady yeah I think isn't she also the only other female turkey

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.760
 on the farm I think it sounds wow and she's gone for the old guy the oldest tensioner it was either

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.640
 an old guy or a chicken I think I reckon that her choices were pretty slim they did say that one

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.800
 other reason for his longevity is due to him being too aggressive to catch you know there were so

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.600
 turkey hunting is a thing and turkey calling is a thing in America isn't it and they have they

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.320
 have this with a bunch of bird hunters actually but there I think turkeys can make 28 different

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.880
 distinct sounds with their voices that mean different things they basically have a vocabulary of

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.200
 2028 and turkey then you said it really impressed at that very large vocabulary I'm just wondering

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.080
 what so do you know what the words are there's a per they do a soft per they gobble in various ways

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.960
 to attract attention they've got gradations of alarm cool so I think a certain type of gobble is

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.040
 sort of a I think there's a bit of danger around but don't freak out too much if you're midmeal

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.360
 and then there's a different sound that says really guys get the hell out of here we're in trouble

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.280
 and people who hunt turkeys impersonate them and it's a real skill if you go online there's a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.800
 in fact I read a website online this morning that said something like 20 reasons why you continually

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.440
 fail to attract turkey with your turkey calling and then a list of reasons where people completely

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.880
 screw up turkey calls I was reading about turkey wishbones oh yeah so turkeys are related people think

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.600
 to dinosaurs yeah and if you look at the skeleton of a dinosaur yeah they have wishbones so imagine

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.280
 yeah t-rex sized wishbones god and do we know if they broke them over dinner I'd love

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.440
 yeah good nose but time travel is of the future when they go back yeah thanks giving at Jurassic times

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.320
 that's very cool yeah um you know the thing about um sparing turkeys so the president every

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.920
 year spares a turkey oh yeah yeah of all the turkeys that president abama has freed only one has

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.000
 lived past its second birthday because of the farming practices which mean they have very short

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.600
 lifespans now yeah the last the last two that they pardoned do you know the names no mac and cheese

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.000
 so mac and cheese I got pardoned and um they got to stay in a $350 a night sweet

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.360
 night before they were pardoned did they enjoy that well I don't know but the hotel broke the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.520
 rules for them because there's usually a requirement that any pet over 40 pounds is not

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.800
 allowed to stay and they were 50 pounds each so wow yeah let's hope they stayed it because some rules

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.920
 were bent why is everyone naming turkeys after food it's so mean yeah I know well they are called

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.240
 turkey to be fair and they are named after a food already and do you know what their Latin name

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.400
 means the Latin name that lineas gave them in 1758 is meleagris galapavo galapavo which means

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.280
 guineafowl chicken peacock chicken peacock and I was just hedging his bet yeah I was reading the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.880
 economist thing about it and it said it was wrong five different ways so why is it called turkey

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.360
 like the the animal of the country because when we thought it was from turkey when they were

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.600
 brought over they were brought over by Arab traders who and at the time we just thought all

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.160
 traders from that part of the world swore allegiance to the Ottoman Empire and the capital of that

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.200
 was in turkey okay so we just thought yeah Middle East and equals turkeys yeah okay actually

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.680
 something that we did do because we were so ignorant about where they'd come from when we decided to

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.440
 go back and properly colonize America in the early 1700s we brought a whole bunch of turkeys with us

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.920
 on our ships not we the people who were going to colonize to Jamestown brought a bunch of turkeys

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.680
 from Britain to America say we better bring these turkeys so we can farm them in America and they

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.240
 got off the boat at the other end and we're like there's places full of turkeys guys that was a

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.080
 waste of space and so farmers used to walk their turkeys to London all the way from Norfolk because

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.880
 that's where you know turkey farming really took off and was still there today obviously and it

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.120
 would take months to get them along because they walk quite slowly they're walking about one mile an

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.800
 hour and so frustrated in the weeks before in the week leading up to Christmas in the 18th and 19th

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.800
 centuries all the roots into London would just be clogged up with traffic with the use of turkeys

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.440
 walking along and the thing is it's such a long journey they're not meant to walk long distances

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.600
 or they'd not really built for it so they had to have special little shoes made for them really

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.840
 yeah wow they would show them have you seen the shoes did they not like put tar on their feet

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.880
 that is what they did with geese because geese refused to wear shoes and that's apparently

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.600
 there's a saying to show a goose means something really really difficult to do really it's like

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.440
 showing a goose so they dipped their feet in tar and then they covered them in sand to give them

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.680
 some protection but the turkeys they didn't do that no can they do a thing about old things

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.720
 yeah yeah okay so there's an article in 2010 with Britain's oldest man they asked him what his

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.840
 secret for a long life is and he said he has five secrets but he could only remember four of them

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:24.720
 he said good friends a religion looking for the best in people and being a vegetarian there's one

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.600
 other but I can't remember what it was actually I also found the elixir of life 200 years ago

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.800
 yeah I always forget that one do you have more stuff should we move on to our next facts

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.120
 can I just tell a quite a quick funny turkey story about pet turkey yeah sure um so this is about

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.040
 a pet turkey that went missing it's quite a happy Christmas tale okay um a pet turkey that went

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.360
 missing for 10 days and then returned to its owner it was called Bernard again after Bernard Matthews

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.800
 because we only named turkeys after we eat them um and it was kept as a pet by this family it was

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.560
 taken by a fox so there was a trail of feathers and blood and stuff left in this woman's garden

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.680
 so she said oh bugger so obviously a goner um turned out he'd escaped from the fox himself and he'd

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.480
 turned up like all beaten and battered at someone else's door and this other person had taken him in

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.800
 in a nearby village and looked after him for a bit and then after four or five days he ran away

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.400
 from her shared again and ran and someone else found him he was attacked by a dog and the owner of

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.280
 that dog rescued him and took him in again and then she put out a Facebook thing I think and the

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.120
 original owner was like oh that's my turkey you've got my turkey by the time she'd shown up the

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.840
 turkey had run away again to a different person's farm and eventually this different person put a

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.040
 message up on Facebook going think I got your turkey mate and 10 days of just all of a twisting it

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.400
 from one house to the other it turned up back at home that's nice that's a great story to end up

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.120
 on the on the dinner table how to know how to escape the fox in the first place me too turkey versus

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.760
 fox I feel like I know how that goes most of the time it's pretty big though you know okay yeah

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.640
 yeah they sat on it they flap and you kick and yeah they can be dangerous okay they've been

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:03.520
 described as fluffy velociraptors they've been described by you just now just the last thing they

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.760
 said about this turkey dinner one of the things they said was he normally keeps himself to himself

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.040
 that's the sort of thing you normally say about the serial killers 20 dead foxes

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:23.920
 okay time for our second fact and that is Chazinski my fact this week is that

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.280
 Kerry Grant and Clark Gabel used to meet up once year around Christmas to exchange unwanted

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:36.880
 monogrammed gifts they'd received so good it's so amazing I really hope that Jeremy Corbyn and Jeremy

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:44.320
 Clarkson have the same arrangement so I can't take credit for finding this this was sent in by

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.760
 another QI researcher called Lauren Gilbert but she has given me permission to mention it out loud

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.760
 on this podcast so I am because it's so amazing yeah that's incredible and it just came out

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.280
 in this interview I think it was an interview with Clark Gabel and he said they'd call each other up

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.520
 after Christmas and Clark would say did you get any any gifts for your initials on your don't want

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.320
 and if he had I'd immediately rush around to his house and claim them as my own and we do a swap

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.720
 fantastic yeah I find them really confusing it's but I mean they're very similar in a lot of ways

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.680
 to go around and Clark Gabel aren't they yeah yeah big claim there oh yeah I'm only confused because

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.360
 I did all the research for them I forgot to put their names into each fact I had to re-research

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.920
 everything to work out which one is Gabel did you just put CG for each one yeah you made the same

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.480
 mistake a lot of other people that made they were both married five times which since that's

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.400
 an unusual number of times to be married it is quite a coincidence everything yeah wow the most

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:44.000
 swap wives they did swap monograms happy fifth divorce cards um carry grand uh actually weirdly

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.560
 is quite responsible for a lot of pop culture without probably him knowing it so it's said that a

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.960
 large part of James Bond the character was based on carry grand yeah in Fleming was a big carry grant

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.480
 fan and Christopher Reeves said that he based a lot of his performance as Superman on carry grand

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.880
 apparently he turned down the role of James Bond I'm not sure to what extent that's true but he

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.200
 according to the story he was 58 at the time and he thought that's a bit old to be playing this sort

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:18.960
 of relatively young spy not something that's held back other he wants got a terrier and he named

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.560
 it after his own birth name because he was born Archibald Leach and he got a terrier called Archibald

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.480
 and he called it Archibald Leach he should have called it Archibald Leach yes um carry grand

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:37.680
 also started the English muffin lover's society yeah um he was staying at a Hilton hotel in Istanbul

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.680
 and he only got one and a half English muffins for his breakfast and so he wrote to Conrad Hilton saying

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.600
 was my extra half muffin and they apparently done it as a kind of cost saving because most people

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.440
 only had three quarters of their muffin halves but then he said no I want to and they changed the

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.920
 rules and then he said in the future if anyone ever got only one and a half muffins for their breakfast

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.240
 then they could become a member of his club wow I would just wonder where my where the second half

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.160
 of the second muffin had gone goes on someone else's play I understand that but I would go on the

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.800
 cafe trying to match up my other half with someone else yes and that could end up being the love of your

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.920
 life or something yeah yeah that would be a bit like Kelly Hilda Brunt who in 2009 married Kelly Hilda

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:28.880
 Brunt wow they met each other on Facebook found out they had the same name met each other in real life

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.720
 and then got married well just just because they have the same name they thought that's enough I don't

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:41.040
 like you at all I find you repulsive but you have at least one thing in common Clark Gable said one of

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.680
 the most famous lines in movie history which is from Gone with the Wind and the line being frankly

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.240
 my dear I don't give a damn okay so there was a rumor that they were they were fine for saying damn

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.160
 at the time and no one is quite sure that that's true but they do have scripts of alternative lines

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.240
 that they had before they had that line and you can read them and so these are a few frankly my dear

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:14.240
 I just don't care frankly my dear it makes my gorge rise better federal Senator frankly my dear I

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:21.360
 don't give a hoot frankly my dear my indifference is boundless oh that's a nice one is it

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.640
 yeah it's kind of fun afternoon coming up with all those lines yeah yeah yeah it also had very

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.800
 different names during the draft of the book when it was being written I don't know if we've

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.120
 mentioned this before not in our stars and this is a weird one blah blah black sheep yeah one of

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.120
 the versions of the titles was blah blah black sheep typical of the draft gone with the draft

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:51.920
 do you know how Kerry got his stage name because as I said he was originally called Archibald Leach

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.000
 no and he was a he was an acrobat as a child and he was and he was and he was that's partly why he was

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.080
 so good at physical comedy it's because he from the age of about five or six he'd be walking on

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.920
 stills he'd be doing trapeze stuff um when he went for screen tests in America somebody said to him

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.080
 Archie just doesn't sound right in America and he replied it doesn't sound particularly right in

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.800
 Brittany so they went through a load of names and he was almost going to be Kerry Lockwood but then

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.720
 the studio executives didn't quite like Lockwood either and someone in this meeting just started

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.560
 reading out a list of names and when they got a grant he said that's all right did he say that's

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.800
 all right because he was like I heard Clark Gable gets a lot of really desirable monochrome

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:35.840
 that's gonna work for me he used to do a lot of LSD oh yeah yeah Kerry Grant now he wasn't doing it

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:42.880
 totally recreationally it was a medical thing doctors were trying to combat his depression and

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.080
 all sorts of I think it was a cure for him was it just impotence I mean he took a hundred courses

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.760
 at least of LSD isn't it true that Timothy Larry who's like the great god of LSD he decided to do it

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.600
 because he knew that Kerry Grant did it really really that's right yeah Wow Groucho Marx did it as well

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:06.400
 did he yeah it was 78 this guy Paul Krasner who's a he's a writer um says that he did it with Groucho

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:12.320
 Marx and weirdly I've spoken to a lot of people who knew Groucho Marx who said that they don't think

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.280
 it's true but this guy has a really vivid account and he Groucho Marx turns out to be a collective

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:30.000
 yeah psychosis okay time for our next fact and that is Andrew Hunter Murray so my fact this

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.080
 week is that when it gets really cold Christmas trees can turn to glass

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:44.400
 bullshit that's true we've been doing 90 episodes this is the first time you decided to

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.640
 respond sort of facts in that way and as to one of mine I'm living it's the first time I've

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:55.680
 thought of that is completely ridiculous okay I will explain yeah so lots of Christmas trees as in

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.080
 coniferous trees ever greens you know whether there's bruises or furs whatever they are they live

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.760
 in forest where temperatures get really really cold as in minus 60 degrees sometimes so that's a

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.520
 massive problem for organisms because if you have cells and the water in your cells freezes into

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.840
 ice crystals they can burst through the walls of the cells and cause massive damage do whatever

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.480
 to an animal or to a tree or whatever it might be so trees have this incredibly clever thing they

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.920
 turn to glass I want to say glass I don't mean glass is in a glass of something like silica which

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.360
 is what that's made of the molecules all freeze into this sort of glassy state where they don't move

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.320
 around yeah so it's a state of matter is glass yeah exactly it's not quite a liquid and not quite a

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.840
 solid yeah so the christ the atoms can move around a little bit but they they're not kind of fluid

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.960
 like liquid but they're not really really stuck together like a solid yeah so it's sort of preemptive

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.440
 going into a frozen mode except without that freezing without the ice crystals but so after we're

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:58.080
 to unglasses itself yeah and becomes a normal tree again yeah yeah that's that's crazy it's pretty

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.920
 cool yeah yeah that's amazing there are some animals that do similar things aren't they

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:10.480
 what tade grade which is have we ever spoken about tade grades on this like one of our favorite animals

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.800
 at QI aren't they and these are little tiny things also called water bears which can survive massive

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.680
 heat really really cold temperatures radiation they can survive all sorts they can go into space

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.600
 and still live and one way that they survive very cold temperatures is they get rid of almost all

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.640
 of the water in their cells and they kind of turn their cells into an almost kind of glassy

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.240
 state wow and this kind of glassy state is something that hasn't really been seen much in nature

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.000
 or anywhere else and they think they might be able to make new kinds of glass by studying it

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.600
 very cool they are amazing tade grades maybe that's the fifth secret of how to live for a really

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:54.240
 long time is the no water just dry yourself into a husk yeah have we ever talked about the frog

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.360
 before who when it gets I think we have on this book I haven't we what kind of frog is it where

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.720
 when it gets really cold it just frees is solid and you assume it's dead because it can do that

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.400
 with the mud frog yes and then it can just thought in summer it turns into like a little frog sickle

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.680
 wow and it has it has anti-freeze in its blood and so it stops its blood from freezing

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.640
 really really really cold temperatures there are some fish which have anti-freeze in their blood

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.960
 because they're swimming in water which is sub zero temperatures is that right

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.960
 because it and the water isn't frozen because it's got salt in it I think that's right

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.720
 and so if they're swimming around in the Arctic then that's how they do that don't it's either

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:35.200
 crocodiles or alligators when it becomes to a point where a river or lake or whatever is going to

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:42.160
 freeze over they stick their head near the surface and they let the they let it freeze over their head

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.360
 except for their nostrils which are sticking out so that they can still breathe and survive but

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.680
 they effectively hibernate with a block of ice around their head and their body just flowing in

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:58.240
 the water below wow have I made that up it does sound like a made up thing I really think it's true

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:04.160
 it might be true if that is true that's incredible and if it's not then that's not surprising

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.920
 well you don't call bullshit on his stuff but you'd be saying it non-stop too every time

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.080
 my day ever so yeah I've only got so much breath

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:19.440
 in Antarctica I was looking into their Christmas tree and they obviously don't have a tree there

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.720
 so they created a tree which is made out of rubbish bits it's all iron bars and so on so it's in

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.880
 the shape of a Christmas tree which looks really nice and I started looking into Christmas day they're

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.200
 generally things like they often get quite drunk and they have a challenge whereby they have to get

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.960
 as many Christmas hats onto penguins as possible yeah that's what they get drunk on eggnog and the

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.600
 the challenges you have to using as many little Christmas hats get them onto as many penguins

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.800
 and the most penguins you get them on you win the competition right yeah and also they don't have

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.480
 mistletoe there so what they do instead is they hang a fish's head up and you're meant to kiss

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.160
 under that very romantic image of a stinky rotting but mistletoe comes from the German for

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.200
 dungstick so it's not that romantic in itself that's James's opening line when he catches anyone

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.280
 under it well did you know that's a juster's line to kiss me under the dungstick

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.640
 there was a thing Christmas tree is always used to catch on fire because before electric

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.800
 lights you just stuck candles on the ends of the branches and obviously that's an enormous

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.400
 fire risk and that lots of people died in Christmas tree fires yeah but as a result loads of people

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.320
 in the 19th century especially patented fire extinguishing systems which you can then attach to your tree

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.920
 oh wow so there's a hose running all the way up the trunk and you just sort of secret at the

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.800
 enemy there's instead of a star at the top all the star is actually a sprinkler in the shape of a

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.800
 star so when the tree catches fire it's just that's a great idea yeah that happens to my Christmas tree

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.160
 when you really yeah we came out after we told Santa who had just been and my grandfather accidentally

00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.480
 knocked a candle onto the tree and the whole thing went up as we came out to get our presents and oh my

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.280
 gosh it was a hard moment yeah was it did it properly burn it it was good it would ruin Christmas oh

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.800
 it did it was yeah it was petrifying well that's not petrifying that's a completely different thing

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:19.280
 that happens to you here's something I it's quite a scary little image that I had never heard of

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:27.440
 tarantulas live in Christmas trees oh yeah yeah but not the big home alone guys yeah it's the

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.880
 tiniest of all the tarantulas and they're only a quarter of a centimeter in length so yeah it's

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:38.960
 in Siberia didn't they used to decorate trees in Germanic countries with little kind of spiders

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:46.400
 Christmas spiders and spider webs in Ukraine I think they still do that yeah Christmas spider yeah

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:52.720
 very festive one thing that you get a lot in the newspapers every year is this is the worst

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:59.680
 Christmas tree in Britain I all love that story there's a few this year there's one in stockpot

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.720
 where the locals have said it's the worst Christmas tree in Britain one resident says it's a

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.680
 disgusting tree that looks like it was found in a tip and the other one is in Kempsten in Bevfordshire

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.960
 which apparently is so weedy it has to be propped up by a lab post but I just love these stories

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.360
 because you just see them and they're just like the weedyest rubbishest tree yeah but it's not as

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:30.800
 bad as one there's one in Neuabersk in Russia and the locals have demanded that they remove it because

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.240
 it has been nicknamed the penis fair because it has an extremely bulbous bottom and a shaft

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:43.680
 like top one local said let's be honest it looks more like a penis than a Christmas tree which I've

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.880
 seen it and I think that guy needs to see a doctor I call it my Christmas tree-ness

00:22:50.720 --> 00:23:01.280
 the presents are on the place the presents are my balls all the way that year that it set a light was

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:12.160
 pretty unfortunately it does have a sprinkler system ready installed at the top

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.760
 okay time for a final fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is that one of the contenders

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:33.120
 for this year's Christmas charts is a prog rock album by Pope Francis yeah if you listen to it

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.120
 I have I've listened to the whole album it's weird isn't it it's amazing the opening track sounds

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:45.360
 like a pink Floyd track yeah it's got all these amazing noises is that a Newtio Vobis Gordium Magnum

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:53.040
 yes that it is yeah yeah that means we announce with great joy or we announce with joy Magnum

00:23:53.040 --> 00:24:02.880
 campaign but it's the words that you use when you announce a new pope okay right that word comes

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.240
 from so the the background of this album is that they've taken speeches that the pope has made

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.840
 over the course of his tenure and he's been it's usually you can hear the applause of crowds when

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:20.800
 he starts speaking but they've hired an incredible team to make this prog rock meets just slash metal

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.160
 it's it's an amazing album full of incredible slash metal it's there's shredding on it there is

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.120
 shredding guitar particularly if you listen to the single that he released which is the title of

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:38.640
 the album wake up go go forward that's the that's the title of the single now check this out according

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:45.520
 to a number of sources this cannot be true but the title track which has been released as a single

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.920
 has been downloaded over a billion times a billion well there are more than a billion Catholics

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.000
 in the world their eye looked into this and according to the Guinness World Records the best

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.240
 selling single worldwide is white Christmas by Bing Crosby with 50 million copies oh okay yeah

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.920
 so 50 million to a billion is quite well is the pope just is he just sitting there in the Vatican

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:14.080
 constantly down there yeah if you got a billion downloads you could probably afford to build another

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:20.880
 Vatican like a really classy one this time I do you think it's cost that's stopping them from building a

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:31.360
 um so I read an article about a formula for the ultimate Christmas single oh yeah it's obviously

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.560
 always a bit dubious and it's from about 10 years ago it's from 2004 it's on the BBC and I don't

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:42.720
 know how many of these boxes the pope's album ticks okay but apparently the recipe includes a

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:49.520
 reference to father Christmas slave bells a children's choir and a charity element okay okay so

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.880
 charity element tick yeah there's a charity element I'm sure okay well also the song should include

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.120
 Christmas in the title wishes for peace on earth it's probably got those and lots of airplay at

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:07.120
 office parties well at the QI Christmas party I could guarantee there's going to be Pope Francis and

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:14.880
 rock it out it's true we downloaded it a billion times you said that he might have been on you know

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.680
 iTunes just constantly downloading his song he's never been on the internet in his life so he

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.120
 didn't do that really he does have 20 million Twitter followers despite never having been on the

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.600
 internet we've got two accounts as well right one in Latin and one in English you might even have

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.120
 a few more than that but yeah 20 million wow that's impressive for someone who's never even turned up

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:43.280
 he's never watched TV since 1990 after making a promise to the Virgin Mary so he wouldn't have seen

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.080
 loads of episodes of catchphrase that's terrible he's probably waiting for the box

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:55.920
 a few years ago didn't two minutes silence get into the top 20 into the charts I think in 2010 um on

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.840
 November 11th the two minutes silence was in the top 20 really really

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:08.000
 single yeah weird it was the Royal British Legion um it was way it was them in particular being silent

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.120
 there was those people in particular being silent I mean we've got no evidence it was them because

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.400
 it was just silence but they promised us when we downloaded the album because that always puts me

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.520
 in mind of the famous John Cage 4 minutes 33 which everyone thinks is silence but isn't really

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.440
 it's ambient noise you always have to have an orchestra they're not playing and you need an audience

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:34.560
 there and it's the kind of little kind of cough and a little fart and a little kind of giggle that's

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:43.040
 never going to come to it speaking of weird singles that were unexpected hits yeah um the the singing

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:50.080
 dogs which was released in the 1950s and I think it reached number 22 in the singles charts but it

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.880
 was really sold over a million copies in its first year anyway so the idea came from this Danish

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.520
 recording engineer called Carl Weissmann and he was his job was actually recording bird sounds and he

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.520
 kept getting annoyed because dogs kept I don't know why he was keeping dogs in the studio but dogs kept

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.920
 on barking and getting in the way of his recordings and then he thought actually I could put this

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.400
 to music and make them sing and if you look up the singing dogs it was a hit at the time and it's

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:19.040
 so good they sing jingle bells there's five dogs they were stars yeah I've heard it it's really good

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:27.920
 so good I mean it's okay I'm only downloaded it 900 believe this is completely off topics

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.920
 I'll mention it later but just while we're on Christmas because I'm gonna have another year

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.600
 until I can mention this yeah I read an article last weekend about a Santa school that's being run

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.880
 is the world's largest Santa school okay it's called the International University of Santa Claus

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:51.360
 set in America as a guy called Tim Conahan who runs it and his the curriculum includes wardrobe

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.960
 posing techniques answering difficult questions knowing the current toys and your ho ho ho's

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:04.640
 and if you do one course you get a bachelor of Santa Clausology if you do two you get a master's

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.520
 of Santa Clausology and if you do more and you do a dissertation then you get your doctorate

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:16.080
 of Santa Clausology you don't get a whole whole whole level oh any cracker manufacturers you

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:25.360
 can have that one yeah that's very cool as anyone heard the 1980s album by Anthony Daniels who played

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:33.280
 C3PO oh no that was Christmas album it includes songs such as what can you get a wucky for Christmas

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.360
 when he already owns a comb that's a great title yeah and R2D2 we wish you a merry

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:46.400
 Christmas is another one but this is a weird thing there is a very famous rock star and this album

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:54.160
 was the first time he was on anything oh can you guess who it is Brian ferry no Brian Adams what year

00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:02.160
 what year were we talking 1980 1980 John Bon Jovi correct no what I don't know I just went for

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.120
 an eighties yeah amazing the first his first ever recording on anything was on this R2D2 C3PO

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:15.840
 Christmas album that's amazing yeah and that springboard at his career did it that's weirdly he did

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.760
 because the actors who played R2D2 and C3PO hated each other didn't they no yeah I think they really

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.480
 hated each other and so they obviously set that aside in order to so you know when they're going

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.000
 beep beep beep is that like swearing they actually the beep beeps was just it was originally normal

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.520
 language and they just had to beep over everything they said so do you know the first number one

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:43.360
 single that was banned was it was it the blobby mr blobby christmas single what do you mean band

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.760
 sorry do you know the first time that the BBC I mean band by the BBC and the BBC wouldn't play

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.640
 a lax by Frankie goes to Hollywood it wasn't although that was banned it was jeton which no one

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.960
 was is it a very christmasy yeah it's not christmasy yeah I don't think those are the grounds

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.440
 of which they banned it that it is not christmasy enough I'm not letting people listen to this

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.600
 even though it's released in the middle of the year it's still big it should have a few slave bells

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:12.080
 but yeah and apparently the Vatican hated it it was denounced by the Vatican there were rumors

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:17.280
 at the time that the Pope had excommunicated people who bought it everyone in italy who'd bought

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:22.720
 the single because it was so rude and then I think it was Jane Birkin wasn't it who sang it and

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.320
 she said that the Pope had been her greatest PR man because obviously that made it super popular

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.160
 yeah that's probably the best thing that can ever happen to a song yeah big band by the Pope yeah

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.280
 that's amazing any word on whether the Pope likes no such things a bit just one more thing on Pope

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:46.000
 Francis that I really like have you guys heard of the politician Bob Brady in America so Pope Francis

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.920
 visited America and he did a speech and while he was on stage he drank from a glass of water

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.440
 and put it back down and as the Pope is leaving Bob Brady jumped on to stage and grabbed the glass

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.480
 of water and he started taking photos of himself drinking from the glass that the Pope had drunk from

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:07.120
 and he was really open about it saying that he was going to keep the holy water because he said this

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:13.600
 is holy water and that he was going to use it for the blessing of his grandchildren when they were

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.400
 when they were born and people pointed out to him that just because the Pope drank it it doesn't

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.800
 necessarily mean that he's blessed the liquid so it's not technically holy water so that implies

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.200
 that every Catholic church which has holy water in the font of whatever has had the Pope come and

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:35.760
 it's all people back washed but yeah Bob Brady go online and look at the photos there hilarious and

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.800
 he's just so he doesn't care that he does it he's not embarrassed by it at all he offers to pay

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.120
 for the glass he offers to pay for the glass he's wrote to them said I'll obviously yeah but we

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.320
 know the Pope can pay for a glass because he's had a billion downloads so they should call that

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:59.120
 scandal watergate shouldn't it another one for the cracker by your face
