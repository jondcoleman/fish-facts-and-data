00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
 - They don't look at it, but who don't look at it?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.840
 (techno music)

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:14.620
 - Hi, welcome to Drop us a Line.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.260
 The mailbag special.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.420
 The post-ease sack is bulging.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.060
 Let's empty it.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.260
 All over the desk.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 Was that good?

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.460
 Was it why you were fired for the Royal Mail or something?

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.300
 (laughing)

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.780
 - It was the annual review that you had to give

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.460
 to all the shareholders.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.340
 And it was just followed this bill.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.140
 (laughing)

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.980
 - I was running the Royal Mail for a while.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.740
 (laughing)

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.100
 - I love these jokes more.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.060
 Welcome to Drop us a Line.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.700
 Okay, let's start with some brutal takedowns

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 from our audience.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.540
 - All right.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.380
 - These are good.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.180
 So Jim Robertson dives in.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.180
 This is something based on our London podcast festival shows.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.820
 Watching the livestream tonight, I noticed a wrong fact

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.500
 by James Harkin.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.340
 - Okay.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.180
 - Outfall.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.020
 (laughing)

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.340
 - He stated that facts in Chinawattlitty Chairman who died,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.380
 when in fact, he was Manchester City Chairman

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.180
 who was disgraced, the Leicester City Chairman

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 was Vichai's riddener Praba.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.340
 - Yes, in the helicopter.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.180
 - Accident.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.980
 - But you know what, that is so useful

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.980
 because that show hasn't come out yet,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.900
 and I can edit the actual podcast.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.580
 - That's a great time travel.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.540
 - That's good.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.100
 We should do all of our shows live,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.660
 so the audience to fact check.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.300
 The audience to fact check it.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.300
 And then that would,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.220
 but we'll still get nice emails for Drop us a Line.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.060
 But then the actual show that goes out will be accurate.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.900
 Yes.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.500
 - Was it the Osman one that we said that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.300
 or was it the Jamie Maltemann?

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.660
 - I'm a friend, I don't know.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.580
 - I'll remember.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.420
 It was about Mrs. Golf.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.260
 - No, it was Jamie.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.100
 - It was Jamie.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.660
 It doesn't go out for weeks.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.060
 - So you've got ages to fix it.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.900
 - Oh, what a treat.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.700
 - Or change history.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.140
 So we've opened up some, so all I have to do

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.500
 is get disgraced Manchester City,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.340
 former chairman,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 Thex and Shinnowatra to take over Leicester

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.620
 and have a terrible accident.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.980
 - And you've got three weeks to do it.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.580
 - That's a movie.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.660
 - That's a movie.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.060
 So we've really opened up a lot of timelines there, haven't we?

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.420
 I'm really don't know what's going on anymore,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.620
 but I'm glad for Jim Robertson's email.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.460
 - Thank you, Jim.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.300
 - Thank you, Jim.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.140
 - Yeah.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.740
 Robin, I'm actually me, which should not be.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.740
 - Is there a surname there?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.620
 I'm thinking Fickie.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.460
 - Do you know what?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.940
 - Robin doesn't give a surname, I believe.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.580
 Technically, Louis doesn't come from Clovis,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.260
 but is a doublet of it,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.620
 meaning they both trace back to the same word Ludoig,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.740
 meaning famous in battle.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.740
 - Okay, that's good.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.300
 - That's because Andy said that the word Louis,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.620
 at the name Louis, the French king name,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.620
 came from Clovis.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.460
 You knock off the sea, you get Louis.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.780
 - Yeah, Louis, Louis.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.820
 - Which I stand by.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.540
 - I don't think that's quite right.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.340
 Is it like saying that you're descended from monkeys

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.940
 when actually you and monkeys are descended

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.900
 from the same ancestor?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.900
 - Well, Cludoig, does that really sound like Louis?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.060
 I don't think it does.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.500
 So, sorry, Robin, and thank you.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.660
 - Interesting thing.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.620
 How many different names do you think come from Cludoig?

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.260
 'Cause I reckon Ludoig does, and I reckon Louis does,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.020
 and I reckon Clovis does.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.860
 Clive.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.020
 - Three.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.860
 - Definitely.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.700
 - Yeah.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.540
 - Definitely.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.540
 - Ludo.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.540
 - Ludo.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.540
 - David.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.380
 - David.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.220
 - Yeah, probably.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.140
 - David, yeah.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.140
 - Hugh.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.980
 - Hugh.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.820
 - Cludoig.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.100
 - Yeah, just knock out the elf.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.940
 - Yeah.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.940
 - Basically, we all have the same name

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.940
 if you go back long enough.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.180
 - That's a minute, and it's all this.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.820
 - It's all Cludoig, we're all famous in battle.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.740
 - Cludo-dan-wig.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.580
 - Yeah.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.420
 - Cludo-dan-wig.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.660
 - Dog.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.140
 - Not really a name, but more of a title.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.300
 - Yeah.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.300
 - My dog.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.300
 - All right.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.100
 Dana Johnson writes.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.100
 - Oh, this is...

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.100
 - We're getting one each.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.100
 This is very egalitarian.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.100
 - Yeah.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.100
 - This is really nice.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.100
 Like one chewing each.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.500
 - I mean, you do select the emails.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.700
 It's not as if some bigger force

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.140
 has accidentally put one each.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.340
 - Well, no, but I don't, I'm not planning it at that level.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.340
 - Okay.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.940
 - It's a miracle if I get them in the same categories.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.940
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.220
 - It's a miracle all the corrections are in the same page.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.220
 - Yeah.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.220
 - That's rare.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.220
 I'm a huge fan, right?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.220
 It's Dana Johnson.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.220
 Dana?

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.220
 Comes from Cludoig.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.220
 Of course.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.220
 (laughing)

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.500
 - And got livestream tickets for both the live shows

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.340
 from the London podcast festival this weekend.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.980
 It was my first time watching a live show of yours,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.540
 and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.020
 This probably isn't so important,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.820
 but I'm a professional violinist

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.020
 based in Northern Norway,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.700
 and I just thought I'd mention

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.260
 that the Rachmaninov piece that was quoted in all by myself,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.820
 to your face, was his second piano concerto,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.620
 not his second symphony.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.820
 - Okay, that's gonna be a more difficult edit,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.580
 'cause I'm pretty sure I never said the word concerto.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.580
 I think it was me who said that.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.100
 - I was a U, I'm sorry, I thought it was that,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.860
 'cause it was down the fact.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.540
 So anyways, it's a small detail, but thought I'd share.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.540
 So thank you, Dana.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.380
 - That's good.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.220
 - Lovely.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.060
 - It's a good book,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.500
 and it's all about how to tell the difference between things.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.420
 So it's like it's an encyclopedia of small differences,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.140
 and one of them is concerto and symphony.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.700
 - So concerto is where you have a main instrument

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.180
 who plays the main bit,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.940
 and then you have the orchestra playing the background,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.820
 and you're saying that all by myself was not that?

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.420
 - It was Rachmaninov's second piano concerto,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.500
 so that is that. - But Rachmaninov

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.540
 does have a second symphony,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.780
 and a symphony is all the orchestra playing together.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.580
 There's no king instrument popping over the others.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.420
 - So there you go.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.260
 - Yeah.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.100
 - That's interesting.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.780
 - Sorry James, you were able to go back in time.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.300
 - It feels like I can't fix that one,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.940
 unless I book out the King's Place Theatre,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.540
 and get find 300 people who will sit there

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.820
 to give the same sound effects.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.380
 And I've got three weeks to do it.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.220
 - I actually got it.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.060
 - Yeah.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.140
 - And you're busy with the football thing already.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.020
 It's quite stressful.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.300
 - Oh, dear, interesting.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.380
 - Yeah, we didn't mention on the night, but that song,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.180
 Eric Carmen wrote that song.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.860
 He started, have you listened to the original version?

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.700
 - To the rap map enough.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.060
 - No, to the Eric Carmen all by myself.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.340
 Halfway through it, there's this like five minute long solo piece

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.380
 that he does on the piano and with guitars and stuff.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.860
 And that's what he started with.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.380
 So he finished the solo to the song,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.820
 and then he was like, okay, now I need to book

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.380
 and it with an actual song around it.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.220
 - Interesting.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.660
 - Yeah, he spent months doing that.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.700
 - I think we also didn't mention is that he rips off

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.080
 the rap man enough for the...

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.260
 - The melody of the main.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.920
 - The melody of the verse, I think.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.820
 And then he rips off his own old song for the chorus.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.820
 - Yes, that's right.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.580
 - So chorus is identical to a song that he did with his band

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.900
 before he became a solo artist.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.740
 - Yes, that's right.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.660
 - Eric and the song.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.940
 - We also didn't mention that Carmen is the name

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.460
 of an opera by Beese.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.300
 - Yeah.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.380
 - And that's extra plagiarism by George Carmen

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.060
 of another composer.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.900
 - Yeah, right.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.140
 - Yeah.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.980
 - That's good.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.820
 - This one, I'm sorry.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.100
 - With Eric Cartman from South Park gets his name

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.540
 from Eric Carmen from all by myself or not.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.500
 And I couldn't find non-line whether that's true or not.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.340
 - That's such a good call.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.060
 - They both get their names from Fludeauwig

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.860
 reading "Favorite Battle" eventually.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.020
 So it doesn't sort of, so yes.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.220
 - I wonder who's had more number one hits.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.180
 'Cause South Park have had quite a few.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.020
 - I've never known what to do.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.860
 - I've never known what to do.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.700
 - I've never known what to do.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.700
 - Chocolate salty balls.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.380
 It's the biggest I don't think that got to number one.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.260
 - That's technically chef as well, I guess.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.100
 - That's true.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.460
 - You guys have good knowledge of that.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.300
 - Nice, okay.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.140
 - Amazing.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.220
 - Oh, here's, okay, here's a good question, question corner.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.100
 - Okay.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.820
 - Sammy from Vancouver, right?

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.220
 - Like most of the people emailing you,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.500
 I'm a huge fan of the podcast.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.820
 That's actually not true, Sammy.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.900
 (laughing)

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.180
 It's about 50 spam and indifference corrections.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.900
 But you often bring up weird or cool museums

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.740
 that you visited usually on travels.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.180
 I'll be visiting London in December

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.780
 and I wonder if you have any fish favorites

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.940
 that you'd recommend.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.980
 I've been to the British Museum

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.140
 and the National Library.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.940
 I guess Sammy must be British Library.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.140
 But that's it so far.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.060
 - Good question.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.980
 Maybe you've got one and the one

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.780
 that you went to near the Thames,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.260
 near the Old Office, do you remember?

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.420
 - There's it.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.300
 - Glass Spectacles Library.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.220
 - That one is amazing.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.860
 The British Optical Association Museum,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.300
 but it is appointment only.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.260
 - Well, he's got time.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.380
 - That's true, you've got time to book in.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.220
 It's really cool.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.260
 It's sort of collections of old optical instruments

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.020
 and history of glasses and history of contact lenses and all that.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.620
 It's a, yeah.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.420
 So that's a very niche museum.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.860
 - Yeah, so it's good.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.420
 - Gosh, I mean, they're all brilliant as a truth.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.300
 I really love the Museum of Childhood.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.140
 I really love that stuff.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:52.980
 - Why have you been there?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.100
 - Yeah, I've not been to the National Green, is that?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.820
 - Right, if you've got kids going down the London Museum.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.820
 You've been to dozens of them.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.660
 - I have, yeah.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.780
 I tell you what, this is not a museum

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.220
 but it is as such a sort of museum in the wild.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.260
 I used to love going to Crystal Palace

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
 because there are the oldest examples

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
 of what dinosaurs would have looked like

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.500
 as part of the park.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.300
 - What they wouldn't have looked like.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.020
 - Well, the idea is what they would have looked like

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.420
 and they've got a horribly wrong

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.740
 and they look like these goofy creations.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.060
 It'll take you two minutes to see them

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.900
 but it was part of the Crystal Palace exhibition

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.980
 back in the day.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.220
 It was based off the designs of Richard Owen

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.180
 who's the person who coined the word dinosaur.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.140
 So you're seeing the original Jurassic Park effectively.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:32.980
 - It's very cool.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.820
 It's very cool.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.660
 I'd say that.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.500
 - That is amazing.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.740
 - It'll take a long, old time to get to Crystal Palace,

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.580
 doesn't it?

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.420
 - Absolutely.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.740
 So it'll be empty.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.020
 (laughing)

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.460
 - That's not how time works.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.660
 (laughing)

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.380
 It's not like the time takin' to get them.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.220
 - Yeah.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.060
 - Okay.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.620
 - Handy yourself?

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.460
 - Have you done one?

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.300
 - I've done a museum of chartered.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.700
 - I will say, do you know what?

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.260
 It's in it's own Hoban, the John's Zone Museum.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.100
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.700
 - Which is a collection of John's Zone

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.420
 who was just this mad collector of everything.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.980
 - And I think his collection form

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.580
 the basis of the British Museum, but also his house,

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.180
 which is now three houses, not into one.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.060
 It's just an amazing, weird collection of stuff.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.180
 - Can I say a fact about that,

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.060
 which might not be true 'cause I'm going off memory.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.820
 But I think he might have been friends with Frederick Chopin

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.820
 or I think might not be Chopin, but he's someone like that.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.660
 - Okay.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.900
 - Came over to London, visited him and then put his cup

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.220
 on a place where he shouldn't have put his cup.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.140
 And so John's Zone thought, you know what?

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.900
 I can't have all this stuff in my house anymore.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.260
 I need to find some words and put it.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.900
 And so he put it all in the museum instead.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.740
 - Oh wow.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.580
 - That was really good.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.060
 - I might have got everything wrong about that anecdote.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.940
 - No, I think there's, I can't remember it either,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.460
 but I think, yeah, I've heard that story

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.780
 or something like it, yeah.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.620
 That's great.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.620
 - So are you good, Sammy?

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.740
 - Happy travels.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.820
 - Can we do this as a new thing?

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.700
 If anyone's coming to London and they need some tips,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.140
 maybe next time it'll be a restaurant.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.060
 - Yeah.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.740
 - Or a brothel.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.140
 (laughing)

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.980
 - Who did he point out?

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.820
 I wasn't like it.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.060
 - I don't know, it was a warm gesture.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.780
 (laughing)

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.740
 - For a bookshop.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.500
 - There's great bookshops.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.340
 - Yeah.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.820
 - Okay.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.740
 - Jamie Lerna Brecher, right?

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.580
 - Dan's show, "Big Hands."

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.420
 - Oh yeah. - Yeah.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.860
 - Okay, this was your show you pitched.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.340
 - Yes. - "Big Hands."

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.180
 - Well, "Packanini", the violinist, apparently,

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.860
 also had enormous hands.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.340
 - Yes, that's right.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.260
 - And this often comes up in music classes

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.780
 because when you talk about Rachmaninov,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.980
 because both Rachmaninov and Paganini stuff

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.340
 is extremely difficult to play.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.740
 - He also sold his soul to the devil Paganini.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.580
 - That's right. - That's right.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.420
 - Yeah.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.620
 - His mum had to release a letter

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.420
 like in a newspaper to say,

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.580
 "I can tell you that he's definitely my son

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.860
 and that his father is his father

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.740
 and the devil was not part of our courtship."

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.940
 And he was like the original rock star, wasn't he,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.020
 of the-- - Oh, one of them, yeah.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.700
 - It's a few that I'll name like that.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.540
 - Yeah, but he had like merged people with girls

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.460
 who go nuts for him and he had these giant fingers.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.300
 - Well, I wonder why the girls might not serve.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.020
 (laughing)

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.940
 - No, I mean, I love a bit Paganini, yeah.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.780
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.700
 - I don't really know Paganini's stuff,

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.300
 but apparently historians believe Paganini

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.740
 likely had "Marfan's Syndrome,"

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.420
 or possibly Earl's "Danlos Syndrome,"

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.860
 which often causes double joy to this.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.660
 Other notable people with "Marfan's Syndrome,"

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.380
 and that's definitely "Big Hands," include.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.340
 (humming)

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.460
 - Okay, Abraham Lincoln. - Mm-hmm.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.940
 - Chewbacker. - Peter Mayhew.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.460
 - Who played you right here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.420
 Jonathan Larson.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.060
 - Who's Jonathan Larson? - Reator of Rent.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.060
 - The musical. - The musical.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.260
 - Okay. - And it's no.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.500
 Vincent Sheavelli.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.220
 I mean, there's a big drop off in the fame after Chewbacker.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.420
 I wonder who's this?

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.100
 From Ghost, tomorrow I never dies,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.620
 and first times at Ridgemont High.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.180
 Other people who may have had "Marfan's,"

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.660
 include Shalda Gaulle, Caesar, Jamie.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.460
 You've got to get the order right in terms of fame.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.740
 There's no universe in which Caesar is less famous

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.820
 than Jonathan Larson.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.460
 - No, no, but this is now into the may of her.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.700
 - May of her. - That's the top of the may have.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.700
 - That's true, that's true.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.100
 And King Tutan coming.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.100
 - Really? - Yep.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.780
 - Really? - So they got may have, may have.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.620
 So they just, they had big fingers, but we don't know.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.260
 Or long fingers, rather than big fingers.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.940
 - I believe so. - Interesting, I believe so.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.940
 - I've never heard that about Tut.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.260
 - No. - No. - All Caesar.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.540
 - No. - Are any of those people, I'll be honest.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.020
 The only ones I really believe are the ones

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.700
 I'd never heard of.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.340
 - Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.620
 - Now, Danny Sugar writes.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.460
 - Great name.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.780
 - Coming back to the episode about Jimmy Hendrix,

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.020
 opening for the monkeys, fun fact about the monkeys,

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.900
 is that monkey, Michael, is he called Nesmith?

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.500
 - Nesmith, yeah. - Nesmiths.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.100
 - His mum invented Tipex, is that the facts?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.500
 - Have you been in the inbox?

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.420
 - It's quite a common factoid about it.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.740
 I wasn't on that episode, it was with Nesmith, wasn't it?

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.980
 - It was. - Yes, that's right.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.660
 - Oh, Danny, Danny, Danny, you've been harkened.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.940
 Sorry. - What's this?

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.340
 - I think we could do this as a section as well

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.420
 when people give the facts, you read the first half

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.260
 and I tell you what the second half is.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.540
 Having done this job for 20 years.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.340
 - Anyway, Michael Nesmith's mum invented

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.460
 a correction fluid and founded liquid paper,

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.780
 which later became a large company

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.220
 and was sold to Gillette.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.740
 But that's the, that's just dotting the eyes

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.860
 and crossing the teeth on that one.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.140
 - It's a good fact, we always like it, yeah.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.620
 - And Danny Sugar adds in,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.620
 the paper product company, Torque,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.940
 seems to have nothing at all to do with Monkey Peter Torque.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.660
 So it's good to, good that Mr. Bed.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.380
 I'm sick of it in the inbox every week.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.220
 Does he know?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.220
 - That was great. - Yeah.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.060
 There we go.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.900
 - I'm so funny.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.860
 I'd never even heard of that member of the monkeys.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.740
 - No, no. - Torque.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.500
 - All Torque, would be his podcast.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.260
 - Yes. - Torque with Torque.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.100
 - Oh, yes.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.180
 - That would be good.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.020
 - Is he living?

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.500
 We don't know.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.220
 - I'd never heard of him until 10 seconds ago.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.340
 I used to watch the monkeys when I was a kid.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.220
 One of my earliest memories is being in hospital

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.220
 'cause I had some adnodes removed

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.540
 and watching the monkeys on Saturday.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.380
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.220
 - Good.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.460
 Now let's get into,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.300
 what is it called?

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.420
 Is it called the Big Meat?

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.420
 There's one episode each.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.260
 - Spicy Meat?

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.980
 - No, no, no, spicy meat is controversy

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.820
 in the right environment.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.620
 - You make them up every week, I think.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.340
 - I've got to rigorously maintain

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.580
 spreadsheet of these things.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.180
 I've never bring you with me.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.900
 There's often one subject with which dominates the inbox.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.460
 - Okay. - The rodeo clown section.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.300
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.260
 - Would you use meat twice for your sections?

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.580
 That doesn't feel very-- - Oh, yeah.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.420
 - Spicy meat.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.420
 You wouldn't have then-- - Yeah, you're right.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.460
 - Maybe you should just call it the rodeo clown section.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.300
 - That's it. - Yeah.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.140
 - I'm writing it down.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.140
 This week's rodeo clown.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:50.980
 - Yeah.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.140
 - It's a small rodeo clown this week,

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.340
 but it's the donut hole.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.540
 - Oh, yeah.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.660
 - So we've just broadcasted an episode

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.340
 all about donuts and their holes.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.180
 - Yeah.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.860
 - Is it about the invention or the size or--

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.820
 - It's gonna be, my guess is the pirate ship moment

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.820
 of where it's supposedly put on the wheel of pirate ship.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.460
 - We've had a few correspondence.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.100
 I've only copied out one of their emails

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.020
 'cause it was kind of indicative or representative.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.740
 John G. Erickson said, "I heard James say

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.980
 that the nut in donut referred to a small cake."

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.820
 - Yeah.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.020
 - I knew that was wrong because I knew, in quotes,

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.220
 the correct origin of the word, or so I thought.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.020
 I asked my wife and she knew the same origin that I did.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.580
 Problem is I can't find our version

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.180
 anywhere on the internet, so there you go.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.020
 So that's John, giving himself a show and that.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.020
 - But what's his version?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.940
 - His version. - What are people saying

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.180
 they're saying that that's not true?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.420
 - A couple of people have written in saying

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.620
 that we don't have to shape like a zero for which

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.740
 - Nought is a synonym.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.860
 - Oh yeah, what sounds most likely?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.860
 Me that it's an old word for a cake-like product

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.540
 that's like hundreds of years old.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.700
 Or that someone would call it a doughnut.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.380
 - A doughnut, isn't that more satisfying?

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.100
 - It's a great coincidence. - It's so John.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.660
 - I mean, to be honest, mine just came from memory,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.340
 so it might not be true either.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.740
 - I'm sure you'll do it. - I can check it.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.260
 - John can't find this on the internet,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.900
 the whole internet, so I think you'll save James.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.740
 Yeah, anyway.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.900
 So that's interesting.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.300
 Paul Hoffman, greetings again, says Paul.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.140
 - I have no idea how fish,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.140
 I love it when people start with that.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.220
 Could have a whole question.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.180
 - I shouldn't have already questioned, as well.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.420
 On doughnuts, I'm not mentioning the banned fish

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.180
 with a pH, but I haven't heard of.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.660
 - They like blur, or?

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.620
 - They're less famous than blur, I would say,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.020
 but they're not not famous.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.300
 - Okay, 'cause I'm a rowbacked Paul,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.140
 saying thank you for your email.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.460
 I'd actually never heard of fish,

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.380
 and he wrote back saying, well, they're actually incredibly famous.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.420
 - Yeah. - So they're famous, yeah.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.700
 - Then just they're not a racist and blurred.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.340
 - Right, so they famously did a set of 13 shows,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.660
 a Baker's dozen.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.380
 At each of these shows, fish handed out thousands

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.780
 of one particular type of doughnut,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.340
 and at least one song they played that night

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.180
 was a riff on the type of doughnut.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.940
 - Oh. - Have a go?

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.220
 - So go on.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.780
 - Do they have to be songs by the banned fish?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.260
 - No, no, no, no, they played songs from everyone.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.420
 - I don't know. - So, they play

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.380
 "Hole Again" by Atomic Kitten.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.380
 - Got it in one?

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.900
 - They play "Hole Again" by Atomic Kitten.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.300
 (laughing)

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.340
 - They played "Rigger and Garoses" by "Children."

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.460
 - By "Trad."

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.940
 So it is strawberry, strawberry doughnuts,

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.540
 for strawberry fields. - Oh, that's good.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.260
 Cinnamon doughnuts for cinnamon girl,

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.780
 by someone called Neil Young.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.020
 Night 12, they handed out Boston cream doughnuts,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.540
 which was a matter of more than a feeling by Boston

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.260
 and sunshine of your love by cream.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.100
 - Wow. - Night 12.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.140
 - So they really committed to the bit.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.180
 - Well, they did 13 nights?

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.580
 - I think they possibly could have done more

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.380
 than 13 nights at Madison Square Garden,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.060
 if they'd have thought of more puns about doughnuts.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.740
 - Yeah, for sure, that's the reason they only did 13

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.900
 as that's the most they could think of.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.740
 - That's probably it.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.140
 - If they'd have thought of "Hole Again"

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.940
 right into the kitchen, they might have done 14 nights.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.420
 - Is it, is it, is it, is it sounds that some?

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.980
 - Oh, the gun, no, no.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.060
 - It was "Hole with the Night" or "W", is it?

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.420
 - "Hole Again", yeah, with "W".

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.500
 - All right, is it your gulfing,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.700
 like pump you up song before gulfing?

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700
 - But it was number one.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.140
 And he was written by what's the name for the bangles, I think.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.420
 And also it's, they did a cover version

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.620
 for the World Cup when "Garret the Southgate",

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.700
 they do a "Garret the Southgate" version of it.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.980
 - Mmm, interesting.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.060
 - Gulf, hole?

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.780
 - Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.060
 - This is, there's a lot of pop trivia in this.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.380
 - Yeah, we should do a mashup episode

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.060
 but then no such thing as a fish.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.900
 - Brilliant.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.700
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.460
 Ben Gill says, "My partner's birthday is coming up

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.540
 and I'd like to find her an unusual book.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.780
 She's a quantum physicist, a huge reader,

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.100
 and of course a big fish fan."

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.820
 And we've already made a dent into the fish's books

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.940
 and we love the book of the years,

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.940
 but I would like to ask for your most loved off-piece

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.260
 book recommendations,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.060
 prompted by episode 600 "Donut" book,

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.500
 "What are the still readable books you could recommend?"

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.340
 - Oh.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.500
 - That is so...

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.420
 - 'Cause I had one in my head,

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.180
 but I've got a brilliant history of "Darts",

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.020
 which is...

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.860
 - There we go.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.140
 - Like "Borderline Readable", but it's really good.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.300
 For me, if we're doing non-fiction,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.220
 then "Band Vads" Foley is always my favorite.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.460
 It's a really old book, I can't remember who wrote it now,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.380
 but it's people from history

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.020
 who should be more famous than they are.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.500
 - I'm not quite famous at the time,

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.580
 but aren't famous anymore.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.820
 - So that was a book that we mentioned very early

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.820
 on the podcast, and the earliest of emails would be

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.260
 what was that book?

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.940
 - The original "Dropper's Align"

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.700
 would have just been full of that.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.940
 There's a great book called "Tolstoy's Bicycle",

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.780
 which is a sort of QI classic as well.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.580
 It's basically, it's broken up by ages

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.260
 and what people had achieved by certain ages.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.660
 It starts like one or two, it's a bit thin.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.980
 But then the early chapter is quite nice.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.580
 - So then you've got Mozart wrote his first

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.580
 little piano piece or whatever.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.420
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.260
 - It's really fun.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.460
 It's just a really good encyclopaedic way of breaking up.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.300
 - That's really good.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.140
 - What people have done.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.980
 - I am looking, I'm sorry to be disfigured.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.220
 I'm looking for my favorite one,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.780
 which is not on this bookshelf, which is really annoying.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.620
 No, it's not here.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.140
 I'm looking for Wales' bones of the British Isles.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.140
 - Oh, yeah.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:30.980
 - Which is...

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.060
 - That's a bit big to take on holiday, isn't it?

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.100
 - You look pretty daft at the beach with the 800-page

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.540
 giant whale bone in psychopaedia, but it's bloody good.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.620
 - So anyway, so we can come back to that.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.620
 - Yeah, but those are three.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.100
 - Ben Vars-Folly, Tolstoy's Bicycle,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.500
 - And Wales' bones of the British Isles.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.340
 - There we go.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.180
 - Yeah.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.500
 - Great.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.260
 Oliver Kassel has a suggestion for a section.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.660
 - Ah, thanks with no thanks.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.500
 - Yes.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.060
 - How have you not all come up with a segment

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.660
 for a clubfish bonus episode called Go Fish?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.820
 - Well, we play Cards.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.460
 - And then he says, what would it be?

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.340
 (laughing)

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.340
 - I don't know, Oliver.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.500
 - We could play Go.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.740
 - Yeah, the game of Go.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.900
 - We could play Go.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.740
 - Yeah.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.580
 - Yeah.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.580
 - What was the question that for the three of us to play?

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.420
 - Yeah.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.940
 - Yeah, so it would tie into our knowledge.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.780
 Do you remember we played a game a long time ago?

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.620
 It was so fun.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.300
 And I think we literally only played it once,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.540
 where we used to have, in the office, a big...

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.780
 You know, those big reams of paper and you'd...

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.780
 - A no flip chart.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.860
 - A no flip chart.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.780
 And we used to, so what it was is you would draw the fact,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.020
 and whoever was guess what the fact was as you were drawing.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.500
 It was so much fun.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.340
 That was great.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.420
 - I remember amateuring President Garfield's anus.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.100
 (laughing)

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.260
 - You're like, "I saw wrong."

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.900
 What have you drawn here?

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.380
 - Yeah.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.220
 - God, that's good.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.940
 - That could be a section of the drop us a line,

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.780
 you know.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.620
 - That's a really good idea.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.780
 - And this is gonna be Cold Go Fish.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.460
 - Yeah, that was what the, basically this guy's rotten in,

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.500
 and then with the idea of a title and nothing else.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.340
 - All right.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.660
 - I don't think you get any credit for all of it.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.300
 If we 50/50 on the royalties, coming your way, buddy.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.300
 All right.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.300
 He has a question though.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.140
 - Yeah.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.780
 - And this is a little spicy meat.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.980
 It's slightly spicy meat.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.020
 It's like a pepper army.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.260
 Tell me in secret, I promise I'll keep the secret,

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.780
 or maybe just mention it to all fishers,

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.620
 or do nothing.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.140
 I don't care.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.300
 Oliver, you're really giving us options here.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.660
 What does the organizational chart at no such thing

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.700
 as a fish look like?

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.540
 - What do you mean?

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.980
 - Why is it just you for Illuminati?

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.260
 - Freemasons.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.300
 (laughing)

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.140
 - Shut it down.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.980
 - Shut it down.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.420
 And the episode now, that's the four of us,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.940
 'cause that's how we started out and went on.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.260
 We only brought people in if they missed an episode, right?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.100
 - Yeah.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.260
 - That was the idea behind it.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.860
 - But we are also in the Illuminati.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.540
 Sorry, just to like get below that wide open,

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.540
 but we are Freemasons.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.380
 - Yeah, is it?

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.580
 - Why have we got this desk here?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.540
 'Cause our trouser legs are rolled up.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.540
 - Is that Illuminati thing?

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.740
 - That's Mason's, isn't it?

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.140
 - You roll your trouser legs up.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.980
 - Oh no.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.900
 - You roll one trouser leg up.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.780
 - You two in the first meeting.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.620
 (laughing)

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.740
 - It's gonna be so embarrassing

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.380
 when I bring you to my Illuminati meeting.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.620
 - I've come with shorts.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.940
 They're both Freemasons rolled up.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.180
 (laughing)

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.660
 - What's up, I've never heard that before.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.740
 - Dan, you've written a book

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.180
 about weird things people believe,

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.340
 but I don't do Freemasons.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.100
 - Oh, no, actually we do get emails

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.740
 from Agrived Mason sometimes.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.580
 - Yeah.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.420
 - You mention the Masons.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.260
 - Yeah.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.900
 - They will email it.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.740
 - Yes, they will.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.220
 - And they say we don't do this

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.780
 in that weird utray thing.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.900
 - They emailed in because I said

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.900
 that they all have Harry Potter like wizard ones

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.140
 in their briefcases.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.980
 - I don't know, it was like,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.860
 it's not a wand, it's a staff

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.860
 which we use for our spells.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.980
 (laughing)

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.500
 (laughing)

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.580
 - Come at me Gandalf, right?

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.580
 - Okay, Claire Matthews from Esquimalt,

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.660
 which I'm assuming I'm saying correctly.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.660
 (laughing)

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.060
 - On Vancouver Island.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.820
 - It sounds like how you might spell Eskimo.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.020
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.060
 And maybe it's pronounced like that.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.860
 I just don't know.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.220
 I absolutely loved Dan's comment

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.780
 about how King Dagobair was docked by controversy.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.300
 - Oh.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.100
 - We're back into conspiracy territory.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.740
 - Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.220
 Is this just the dag and dog?

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.420
 Is that what she likes?

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.820
 - No, no, but because in the French translation

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.140
 of Enoch Blighten's famous five series,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.060
 Le Club des Sank, the dog Timmy is called Dagobair.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060
 - No.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.020
 - So you were scoring a hoop you didn't even see.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.860
 - Very good.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.860
 - Yep, that's a lovely fact.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.700
 - I know.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.540
 - Great fact.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.260
 Jetta Doran writes,

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.700
 I grew up in France, Le Bonne Rat Dagobair,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.500
 the song is familiar to me,

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.860
 but only through the nursery rhyme.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.700
 I'm an interior podcast.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.540
 I didn't know he was a real historical figure.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.380
 - Interesting.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.220
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.980
 That is proof that the nursery rhyme exists.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.220
 And she points out that it does not recover his reputation.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.260
 It's making a lot of fun of him and all of that.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.100
 - Right.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.060
 - But he puts his chasers on back to front

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.940
 and he gets chased by a rabbit.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.380
 Another amusing thing's happened.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.980
 Dom Paddon writes,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.860
 in the 1990s German extortionist Arne Funk,

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.540
 Arne Funker modeled himself on Scrooge McDuck,

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.820
 which is Dagobair in German.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.260
 - What, so jacket, no trousers?

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.460
 - No, just, what, sorry, I didn't actually understand

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.980
 that sentence.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.700
 So it doesn't need a bit of passing, doesn't it?

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.300
 - So Dagobair is the German version of Scrooge McDuck?

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.620
 - Yeah, in Germany,

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.940
 Scrooge McDuck is called Dagobair.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:41.780
 - Is he?

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.620
 Wow.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.460
 - And in the 1990s,

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.620
 there was a famous extortionist called Arne Funker,

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.260
 Arne Funk, who modeled himself on Dagobair,

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.460
 and successfully evaded the police for years.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.020
 - What did he do, like, swim in gold coins or something, maybe?

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.420
 I'm trying to think of how you can model yourself

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.420
 on Scrooge McDuck.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.260
 - On Scrooge McDuck.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.180
 - 'Cause he doesn't have that very, very clear characteristic.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.140
 - And you're absolutely right.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.860
 But apparently the police resorted to studying

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.260
 Donald Duckhart's to see what he would do next.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.860
 And there were people wearing,

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.380
 I am Dagobair T-shirts,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.380
 and he was mentioned in rap songs.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.780
 At one point, he evaded capture

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.060
 as the policeman chasing him,

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.900
 slipped on a dog poo.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.740
 - Interesting.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.900
 You know what?

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.180
 I always thought that dog poo's would be a better

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.460
 comedic thing than banana skins.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.460
 'Cause I have stood on banana skins

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.260
 and don't think they're very slippy,

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.900
 but dog poo is really slippy.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.740
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.020
 - If you stand on a dog poo,

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.940
 like I've seen people properly skidding on dog poo.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:38.780
 - You see?

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.780
 - Yeah.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.940
 - But yeah.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.420
 - Can we just go back to you standing on a banana skin,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.380
 saying, see, I'm not slipping on it.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.780
 - I stood on one, like, literally this week.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.740
 I stood on a banana skin.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.580
 - You, you.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.700
 - I was walking down and I had something squelched

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.540
 in the microphone.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.380
 - You were carrying a paint of glass

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.060
 across the street when you were at this time.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.580
 - I'm not that slippy.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.500
 - It's quite, I have a faint memory.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.220
 The bell is tinkling

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.660
 that banana skins are sort of an accepted code for dog poo.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.140
 But you couldn't show dog poo on film.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.740
 'Cause it was too sort of a bit rude or a bit gross.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.580
 - Right.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.180
 - So you'd sort of every, you know,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.540
 well, because you don't get banana skins

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.380
 just all over the place.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.220
 - You didn't America.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.820
 I think we spoke about this on the podcast.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.460
 In New York, there was a big period

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.260
 where rubbish wasn't being collected.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.140
 - I was okay. - And those guys were everywhere.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.860
 And so it became, and then there were variety acts

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.460
 that would go on stage, specifically slipping on bananas.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.380
 - Was a guy who literally, he would put a banana on the stage

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.980
 and he would walk and then skid all the way across

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.420
 the stage, go off stage, laugh.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.260
 - Brilliant.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.460
 - I remember his name, but yeah.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.380
 - Oh my God, the comedy ice skating awards

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.500
 would be amazing.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.460
 What tricks you could pull on two bananas.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.140
 - Me, YOB, that's where that comes from.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.220
 - So is that two major characters that are called

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.500
 Dagobair in different countries?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.340
 - Yeah.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.180
 - Timmy The Dog.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.020
 - Timmy The Dog and Scrooge McDog.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.980
 - Wow.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.820
 - Interesting.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.980
 - Dogobair, more like?

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.740
 - More like Duckobair.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.940
 - There we go.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.780
 End it.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.140
 - Right, you've had your fill.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.020
 - Randall Cleaver writes,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.420
 "Mine and Laws live in Lexington, Virginia,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.860
 where the Virginia military institute is located

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.340
 in the local town cemetery is Stonewall Jackson's grave."

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.740
 - Oh, cool.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.140
 - Which grave, the...

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.820
 - I presume the full, the three quarter ones.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.060
 - Yeah.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.100
 - One day, one visiting them, I went over to see his grave

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.020
 and I saw what's on the ground surrounding his grave.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:34.300
 - Like a zombie putting his hand out of the grave,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.500
 it was his big hand.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.820
 - Brilliant.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.660
 - Not that.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.500
 - Oh, and all that.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.340
 - Was it the Stonewall magazine, the pro LGBT?

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.100
 - It wasn't Stonewall magazine.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.020
 - Was it a literal Stonewall?

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.060
 - No, very nice.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.220
 - I don't know, I think we said that people believed about him

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.060
 that was not true.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.060
 - Oh, okay.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.460
 - Oh, he always ate lemons.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.700
 - Yes, that's right.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.700
 - Dozens of lemons on the ground surrounding his grave.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.100
 Many of them had writing on them.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.460
 I went over to the museum.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.300
 - Ah, deliberate.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.180
 - And I went to the museum and I talked to the docent there.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.620
 I don't know the word, about the lemons.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.700
 She said that someone saw him eating lemon

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.340
 and it became law.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.940
 And the museum gift shop sells lemon shaped stress balls.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.780
 - Brilliant.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.900
 (laughing)

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.740
 - All right, last one.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.580
 Should we have, I think we've--

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.900
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.260
 - We squeezed this lemon.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.500
 (laughing)

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.860
 - And the pips are squeaking.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.020
 Now this is a great one.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.900
 Martha King writes, "Long time emailer, first time listener."

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.740
 (laughing)

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.980
 - I'm sorry, I've just got that.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.140
 I'm showing you.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.980
 (laughing)

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:35.980
 - That's a good joke.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.820
 - That's a good joke.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.980
 - That's the first time we've ever--

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.820
 (laughing)

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.060
 - That's for you, Martha.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.380
 That's the first time we've ever had that.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.860
 And I've been in the box for about four years,

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.860
 and I've been in the box for about four years.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.860
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.260
 - Oh, I'm going to say something potentially controversial.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.100
 - Yeah.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.300
 - Are we entering spicy meat alley?

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.660
 I don't think of Dan Treiber as a wife guy.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.500
 - Oh.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.380
 - She's flirty, what do you hear?

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.220
 - I see.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.060
 (laughing)

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.740
 - My understanding of the phrase wife guy

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.540
 is as a pejorative for overly performative behavior,

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.020
 specifically straight men who cultivate and profit

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.420
 from a family man image until a cheating scandal

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.580
 inevitably breaks.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.140
 - I think Adam Levine or Ned Fulmer.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:14.980
 - Who's Ned Fulmer?

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.820
 - Who's Ned Fulmer?

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.660
 (laughing)

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.180
 - And if you're Mrs. Fulmer, I'm so sorry.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.420
 (laughing)

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.260
 (laughing)

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.260
 - Ned Fulmer.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.100
 - Who's Ned Fulmer?

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.940
 (laughing)

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.220
 - Adam Levine was here in Maroon 5, possibly.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.420
 - I'm sorry, I don't believe that.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.140
 - Yeah, just while we're on our pop culture references,

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.100
 but yeah, Ned Fulmer.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.340
 - Ned Fulmer, that was very much the, you know,

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.580
 like Chewbacca and then Abraham Lincoln

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.260
 and then Jonathan Larson.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.620
 (laughing)

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.100
 - Ned Fulmer.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.940
 - Ned Fulmer.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:47.340
 - He's from a thing called the Try Guys.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.340
 - A YouTube channel.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.180
 - Okay.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.180
 - I think they're relatively famous.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.020
 - Okay.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.020
 - I think, yeah.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.180
 - Well, sorry Ned.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.020
 Sorry to back Dan, right, Martha,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.820
 but I will not let him continue to give wife guys

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.660
 a good name.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.700
 (laughing)

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.100
 I do agree that Dan is the textbook example

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.020
 of whatever the wholesome version of this is called.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.460
 Maybe just a good husband.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.940
 And I'm obviously delighted that he and Ben found each other.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.660
 - Yeah, just a nice email, isn't it?

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.500
 - A nice email?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.340
 - Yeah.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.340
 So I think, I take that point.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.380
 When we say, a wife guy is often someone who's saying,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.420
 oh look, I love my wife so much.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.860
 I'm great, rather than actually saying,
