1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
 - They don't look at it, but who don't look at it?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,840
 (techno music)

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,620
 - Hi, welcome to Drop us a Line.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,260
 The mailbag special.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,420
 The post-ease sack is bulging.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,060
 Let's empty it.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,260
 All over the desk.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,260
 Was that good?

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,460
 Was it why you were fired for the Royal Mail or something?

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,300
 (laughing)

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,780
 - It was the annual review that you had to give

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,460
 to all the shareholders.

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,340
 And it was just followed this bill.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,140
 (laughing)

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,980
 - I was running the Royal Mail for a while.

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,740
 (laughing)

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,100
 - I love these jokes more.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,060
 Welcome to Drop us a Line.

19
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,700
 Okay, let's start with some brutal takedowns

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,700
 from our audience.

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,540
 - All right.

22
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,380
 - These are good.

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,180
 So Jim Robertson dives in.

24
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,180
 This is something based on our London podcast festival shows.

25
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,820
 Watching the livestream tonight, I noticed a wrong fact

26
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,500
 by James Harkin.

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,340
 - Okay.

28
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,180
 - Outfall.

29
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,020
 (laughing)

30
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,340
 - He stated that facts in Chinawattlitty Chairman who died,

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,380
 when in fact, he was Manchester City Chairman

32
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,180
 who was disgraced, the Leicester City Chairman

33
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,500
 was Vichai's riddener Praba.

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,340
 - Yes, in the helicopter.

35
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,180
 - Accident.

36
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,980
 - But you know what, that is so useful

37
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,980
 because that show hasn't come out yet,

38
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,900
 and I can edit the actual podcast.

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,580
 - That's a great time travel.

40
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,540
 - That's good.

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,100
 We should do all of our shows live,

42
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,660
 so the audience to fact check.

43
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,300
 The audience to fact check it.

44
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
 And then that would,

45
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,220
 but we'll still get nice emails for Drop us a Line.

46
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,060
 But then the actual show that goes out will be accurate.

47
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,900
 Yes.

48
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,500
 - Was it the Osman one that we said that

49
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,300
 or was it the Jamie Maltemann?

50
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,660
 - I'm a friend, I don't know.

51
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,580
 - I'll remember.

52
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,420
 It was about Mrs. Golf.

53
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,260
 - No, it was Jamie.

54
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,100
 - It was Jamie.

55
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,660
 It doesn't go out for weeks.

56
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,060
 - So you've got ages to fix it.

57
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,900
 - Oh, what a treat.

58
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,700
 - Or change history.

59
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,140
 So we've opened up some, so all I have to do

60
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,500
 is get disgraced Manchester City,

61
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,340
 former chairman,

62
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,700
 Thex and Shinnowatra to take over Leicester

63
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,620
 and have a terrible accident.

64
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,980
 - And you've got three weeks to do it.

65
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,580
 - That's a movie.

66
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,660
 - That's a movie.

67
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,060
 So we've really opened up a lot of timelines there, haven't we?

68
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,420
 I'm really don't know what's going on anymore,

69
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,620
 but I'm glad for Jim Robertson's email.

70
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,460
 - Thank you, Jim.

71
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,300
 - Thank you, Jim.

72
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,140
 - Yeah.

73
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,740
 Robin, I'm actually me, which should not be.

74
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,740
 - Is there a surname there?

75
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,620
 I'm thinking Fickie.

76
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,460
 - Do you know what?

77
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,940
 - Robin doesn't give a surname, I believe.

78
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,580
 Technically, Louis doesn't come from Clovis,

79
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,260
 but is a doublet of it,

80
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,620
 meaning they both trace back to the same word Ludoig,

81
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,740
 meaning famous in battle.

82
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
 - Okay, that's good.

83
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,300
 - That's because Andy said that the word Louis,

84
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,620
 at the name Louis, the French king name,

85
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
 came from Clovis.

86
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,460
 You knock off the sea, you get Louis.

87
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,780
 - Yeah, Louis, Louis.

88
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

89
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,820
 - Which I stand by.

90
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,540
 - I don't think that's quite right.

91
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,340
 Is it like saying that you're descended from monkeys

92
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,940
 when actually you and monkeys are descended

93
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,900
 from the same ancestor?

94
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,900
 - Well, Cludoig, does that really sound like Louis?

95
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,060
 I don't think it does.

96
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,500
 So, sorry, Robin, and thank you.

97
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,660
 - Interesting thing.

98
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,620
 How many different names do you think come from Cludoig?

99
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,260
 'Cause I reckon Ludoig does, and I reckon Louis does,

100
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,020
 and I reckon Clovis does.

101
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,860
 Clive.

102
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,020
 - Three.

103
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,860
 - Definitely.

104
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,700
 - Yeah.

105
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,540
 - Definitely.

106
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,540
 - Ludo.

107
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,540
 - Ludo.

108
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
 - David.

109
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,380
 - David.

110
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,220
 - Yeah, probably.

111
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,140
 - David, yeah.

112
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
 - Hugh.

113
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,980
 - Hugh.

114
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,820
 - Cludoig.

115
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,100
 - Yeah, just knock out the elf.

116
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,940
 - Yeah.

117
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
 - Basically, we all have the same name

118
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,940
 if you go back long enough.

119
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,180
 - That's a minute, and it's all this.

120
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,820
 - It's all Cludoig, we're all famous in battle.

121
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,740
 - Cludo-dan-wig.

122
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,580
 - Yeah.

123
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,420
 - Cludo-dan-wig.

124
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,660
 - Dog.

125
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,140
 - Not really a name, but more of a title.

126
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,300
 - Yeah.

127
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
 - My dog.

128
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
 - All right.

129
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,100
 Dana Johnson writes.

130
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,100
 - Oh, this is...

131
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
 - We're getting one each.

132
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
 This is very egalitarian.

133
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
 - Yeah.

134
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
 - This is really nice.

135
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
 Like one chewing each.

136
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,500
 - I mean, you do select the emails.

137
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,700
 It's not as if some bigger force

138
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,140
 has accidentally put one each.

139
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,340
 - Well, no, but I don't, I'm not planning it at that level.

140
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,340
 - Okay.

141
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,940
 - It's a miracle if I get them in the same categories.

142
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
 - Yeah, yeah.

143
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,220
 - It's a miracle all the corrections are in the same page.

144
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,220
 - Yeah.

145
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
 - That's rare.

146
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
 I'm a huge fan, right?

147
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
 It's Dana Johnson.

148
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
 Dana?

149
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,220
 Comes from Cludoig.

150
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
 Of course.

151
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,220
 (laughing)

152
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,500
 - And got livestream tickets for both the live shows

153
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,340
 from the London podcast festival this weekend.

154
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,980
 It was my first time watching a live show of yours,

155
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,540
 and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

156
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,020
 This probably isn't so important,

157
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,820
 but I'm a professional violinist

158
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,020
 based in Northern Norway,

159
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,700
 and I just thought I'd mention

160
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,260
 that the Rachmaninov piece that was quoted in all by myself,

161
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,820
 to your face, was his second piano concerto,

162
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,620
 not his second symphony.

163
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,820
 - Okay, that's gonna be a more difficult edit,

164
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,580
 'cause I'm pretty sure I never said the word concerto.

165
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,580
 I think it was me who said that.

166
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,100
 - I was a U, I'm sorry, I thought it was that,

167
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,860
 'cause it was down the fact.

168
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,540
 So anyways, it's a small detail, but thought I'd share.

169
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
 So thank you, Dana.

170
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,380
 - That's good.

171
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,220
 - Lovely.

172
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,060
 - It's a good book,

173
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,500
 and it's all about how to tell the difference between things.

174
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,420
 So it's like it's an encyclopedia of small differences,

175
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,140
 and one of them is concerto and symphony.

176
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,700
 - So concerto is where you have a main instrument

177
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,180
 who plays the main bit,

178
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,940
 and then you have the orchestra playing the background,

179
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,820
 and you're saying that all by myself was not that?

180
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,420
 - It was Rachmaninov's second piano concerto,

181
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,500
 so that is that. - But Rachmaninov

182
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,540
 does have a second symphony,

183
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,780
 and a symphony is all the orchestra playing together.

184
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,580
 There's no king instrument popping over the others.

185
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,420
 - So there you go.

186
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,260
 - Yeah.

187
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,100
 - That's interesting.

188
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,780
 - Sorry James, you were able to go back in time.

189
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,300
 - It feels like I can't fix that one,

190
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,940
 unless I book out the King's Place Theatre,

191
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,540
 and get find 300 people who will sit there

192
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,820
 to give the same sound effects.

193
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,380
 And I've got three weeks to do it.

194
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,220
 - I actually got it.

195
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,060
 - Yeah.

196
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,140
 - And you're busy with the football thing already.

197
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,020
 It's quite stressful.

198
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,300
 - Oh, dear, interesting.

199
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,380
 - Yeah, we didn't mention on the night, but that song,

200
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,180
 Eric Carmen wrote that song.

201
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,860
 He started, have you listened to the original version?

202
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,700
 - To the rap map enough.

203
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,060
 - No, to the Eric Carmen all by myself.

204
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,340
 Halfway through it, there's this like five minute long solo piece

205
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,380
 that he does on the piano and with guitars and stuff.

206
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,860
 And that's what he started with.

207
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,380
 So he finished the solo to the song,

208
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,820
 and then he was like, okay, now I need to book

209
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,380
 and it with an actual song around it.

210
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,220
 - Interesting.

211
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,660
 - Yeah, he spent months doing that.

212
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,700
 - I think we also didn't mention is that he rips off

213
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,080
 the rap man enough for the...

214
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,260
 - The melody of the main.

215
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,920
 - The melody of the verse, I think.

216
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,820
 And then he rips off his own old song for the chorus.

217
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
 - Yes, that's right.

218
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,580
 - So chorus is identical to a song that he did with his band

219
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,900
 before he became a solo artist.

220
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,740
 - Yes, that's right.

221
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,660
 - Eric and the song.

222
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,940
 - We also didn't mention that Carmen is the name

223
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,460
 of an opera by Beese.

224
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,300
 - Yeah.

225
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,380
 - And that's extra plagiarism by George Carmen

226
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,060
 of another composer.

227
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,900
 - Yeah, right.

228
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,140
 - Yeah.

229
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
 - That's good.

230
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,820
 - This one, I'm sorry.

231
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,100
 - With Eric Cartman from South Park gets his name

232
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,540
 from Eric Carmen from all by myself or not.

233
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,500
 And I couldn't find non-line whether that's true or not.

234
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,340
 - That's such a good call.

235
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,060
 - They both get their names from Fludeauwig

236
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,860
 reading "Favorite Battle" eventually.

237
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,020
 So it doesn't sort of, so yes.

238
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,220
 - I wonder who's had more number one hits.

239
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,180
 'Cause South Park have had quite a few.

240
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,020
 - I've never known what to do.

241
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,860
 - I've never known what to do.

242
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,700
 - I've never known what to do.

243
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
 - Chocolate salty balls.

244
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,380
 It's the biggest I don't think that got to number one.

245
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,260
 - That's technically chef as well, I guess.

246
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,100
 - That's true.

247
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,460
 - You guys have good knowledge of that.

248
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,300
 - Nice, okay.

249
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,140
 - Amazing.

250
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,220
 - Oh, here's, okay, here's a good question, question corner.

251
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,100
 - Okay.

252
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,820
 - Sammy from Vancouver, right?

253
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,220
 - Like most of the people emailing you,

254
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,500
 I'm a huge fan of the podcast.

255
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,820
 That's actually not true, Sammy.

256
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,900
 (laughing)

257
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,180
 It's about 50 spam and indifference corrections.

258
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,900
 But you often bring up weird or cool museums

259
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,740
 that you visited usually on travels.

260
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,180
 I'll be visiting London in December

261
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,780
 and I wonder if you have any fish favorites

262
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,940
 that you'd recommend.

263
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,980
 I've been to the British Museum

264
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,140
 and the National Library.

265
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,940
 I guess Sammy must be British Library.

266
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,140
 But that's it so far.

267
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,060
 - Good question.

268
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,980
 Maybe you've got one and the one

269
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,780
 that you went to near the Thames,

270
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,260
 near the Old Office, do you remember?

271
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,420
 - There's it.

272
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,300
 - Glass Spectacles Library.

273
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,220
 - That one is amazing.

274
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,860
 The British Optical Association Museum,

275
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,300
 but it is appointment only.

276
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,260
 - Well, he's got time.

277
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,380
 - That's true, you've got time to book in.

278
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,220
 It's really cool.

279
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,260
 It's sort of collections of old optical instruments

280
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,020
 and history of glasses and history of contact lenses and all that.

281
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,620
 It's a, yeah.

282
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,420
 So that's a very niche museum.

283
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,860
 - Yeah, so it's good.

284
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,420
 - Gosh, I mean, they're all brilliant as a truth.

285
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,300
 I really love the Museum of Childhood.

286
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,140
 I really love that stuff.

287
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,980
 - Why have you been there?

288
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,100
 - Yeah, I've not been to the National Green, is that?

289
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,820
 - Right, if you've got kids going down the London Museum.

290
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,820
 You've been to dozens of them.

291
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,660
 - I have, yeah.

292
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,780
 I tell you what, this is not a museum

293
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,220
 but it is as such a sort of museum in the wild.

294
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,260
 I used to love going to Crystal Palace

295
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,260
 because there are the oldest examples

296
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
 of what dinosaurs would have looked like

297
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,500
 as part of the park.

298
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,300
 - What they wouldn't have looked like.

299
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,020
 - Well, the idea is what they would have looked like

300
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,420
 and they've got a horribly wrong

301
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,740
 and they look like these goofy creations.

302
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,060
 It'll take you two minutes to see them

303
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,900
 but it was part of the Crystal Palace exhibition

304
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,980
 back in the day.

305
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,220
 It was based off the designs of Richard Owen

306
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,180
 who's the person who coined the word dinosaur.

307
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,140
 So you're seeing the original Jurassic Park effectively.

308
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,980
 - It's very cool.

309
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,820
 It's very cool.

310
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,660
 I'd say that.

311
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,500
 - That is amazing.

312
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,740
 - It'll take a long, old time to get to Crystal Palace,

313
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,580
 doesn't it?

314
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,420
 - Absolutely.

315
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,740
 So it'll be empty.

316
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,020
 (laughing)

317
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,460
 - That's not how time works.

318
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,660
 (laughing)

319
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,380
 It's not like the time takin' to get them.

320
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,220
 - Yeah.

321
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,060
 - Okay.

322
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,620
 - Handy yourself?

323
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,460
 - Have you done one?

324
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,300
 - I've done a museum of chartered.

325
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,700
 - I will say, do you know what?

326
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,260
 It's in it's own Hoban, the John's Zone Museum.

327
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,100
 - Oh yeah.

328
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,700
 - Which is a collection of John's Zone

329
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,420
 who was just this mad collector of everything.

330
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,980
 - And I think his collection form

331
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,580
 the basis of the British Museum, but also his house,

332
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,180
 which is now three houses, not into one.

333
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,060
 It's just an amazing, weird collection of stuff.

334
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,180
 - Can I say a fact about that,

335
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,060
 which might not be true 'cause I'm going off memory.

336
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,820
 But I think he might have been friends with Frederick Chopin

337
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
 or I think might not be Chopin, but he's someone like that.

338
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,660
 - Okay.

339
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,900
 - Came over to London, visited him and then put his cup

340
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,220
 on a place where he shouldn't have put his cup.

341
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,140
 And so John's Zone thought, you know what?

342
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,900
 I can't have all this stuff in my house anymore.

343
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,260
 I need to find some words and put it.

344
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,900
 And so he put it all in the museum instead.

345
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,740
 - Oh wow.

346
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,580
 - That was really good.

347
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,060
 - I might have got everything wrong about that anecdote.

348
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,940
 - No, I think there's, I can't remember it either,

349
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,460
 but I think, yeah, I've heard that story

350
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,780
 or something like it, yeah.

351
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,620
 That's great.

352
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
 - So are you good, Sammy?

353
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,740
 - Happy travels.

354
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,820
 - Can we do this as a new thing?

355
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,700
 If anyone's coming to London and they need some tips,

356
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,140
 maybe next time it'll be a restaurant.

357
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,980
 - Oh yeah.

358
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,060
 - Yeah.

359
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,740
 - Or a brothel.

360
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,140
 (laughing)

361
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,980
 - Who did he point out?

362
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,820
 I wasn't like it.

363
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,060
 - I don't know, it was a warm gesture.

364
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,780
 (laughing)

365
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,740
 - For a bookshop.

366
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,500
 - There's great bookshops.

367
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,340
 - Yeah.

368
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,820
 - Okay.

369
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,740
 - Jamie Lerna Brecher, right?

370
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,580
 - Dan's show, "Big Hands."

371
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,420
 - Oh yeah. - Yeah.

372
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,860
 - Okay, this was your show you pitched.

373
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,340
 - Yes. - "Big Hands."

374
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,180
 - Well, "Packanini", the violinist, apparently,

375
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,860
 also had enormous hands.

376
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,340
 - Yes, that's right.

377
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,260
 - And this often comes up in music classes

378
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,780
 because when you talk about Rachmaninov,

379
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,980
 because both Rachmaninov and Paganini stuff

380
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,340
 is extremely difficult to play.

381
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,740
 - He also sold his soul to the devil Paganini.

382
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,580
 - That's right. - That's right.

383
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,420
 - Yeah.

384
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,620
 - His mum had to release a letter

385
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,420
 like in a newspaper to say,

386
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,580
 "I can tell you that he's definitely my son

387
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,860
 and that his father is his father

388
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,740
 and the devil was not part of our courtship."

389
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,940
 And he was like the original rock star, wasn't he,

390
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,020
 of the-- - Oh, one of them, yeah.

391
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,700
 - It's a few that I'll name like that.

392
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,540
 - Yeah, but he had like merged people with girls

393
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,460
 who go nuts for him and he had these giant fingers.

394
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,300
 - Well, I wonder why the girls might not serve.

395
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,020
 (laughing)

396
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,940
 - No, I mean, I love a bit Paganini, yeah.

397
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,780
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,700
 - I don't really know Paganini's stuff,

399
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,300
 but apparently historians believe Paganini

400
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,740
 likely had "Marfan's Syndrome,"

401
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,420
 or possibly Earl's "Danlos Syndrome,"

402
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,860
 which often causes double joy to this.

403
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,660
 Other notable people with "Marfan's Syndrome,"

404
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,380
 and that's definitely "Big Hands," include.

405
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,340
 (humming)

406
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,460
 - Okay, Abraham Lincoln. - Mm-hmm.

407
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,940
 - Chewbacker. - Peter Mayhew.

408
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,460
 - Who played you right here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

409
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,420
 Jonathan Larson.

410
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,060
 - Who's Jonathan Larson? - Reator of Rent.

411
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
 - The musical. - The musical.

412
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,260
 - Okay. - And it's no.

413
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,500
 Vincent Sheavelli.

414
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,220
 I mean, there's a big drop off in the fame after Chewbacker.

415
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,420
 I wonder who's this?

416
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,100
 From Ghost, tomorrow I never dies,

417
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,620
 and first times at Ridgemont High.

418
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,180
 Other people who may have had "Marfan's,"

419
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,660
 include Shalda Gaulle, Caesar, Jamie.

420
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,460
 You've got to get the order right in terms of fame.

421
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,740
 There's no universe in which Caesar is less famous

422
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,820
 than Jonathan Larson.

423
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,460
 - No, no, but this is now into the may of her.

424
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,700
 - May of her. - That's the top of the may have.

425
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
 - That's true, that's true.

426
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,100
 And King Tutan coming.

427
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
 - Really? - Yep.

428
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,780
 - Really? - So they got may have, may have.

429
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,620
 So they just, they had big fingers, but we don't know.

430
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,260
 Or long fingers, rather than big fingers.

431
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,940
 - I believe so. - Interesting, I believe so.

432
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
 - I've never heard that about Tut.

433
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,260
 - No. - No. - All Caesar.

434
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,540
 - No. - Are any of those people, I'll be honest.

435
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,020
 The only ones I really believe are the ones

436
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,700
 I'd never heard of.

437
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,340
 - Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.

438
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,620
 - Now, Danny Sugar writes.

439
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,460
 - Great name.

440
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,780
 - Coming back to the episode about Jimmy Hendrix,

441
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,020
 opening for the monkeys, fun fact about the monkeys,

442
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,900
 is that monkey, Michael, is he called Nesmith?

443
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,500
 - Nesmith, yeah. - Nesmiths.

444
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,100
 - His mum invented Tipex, is that the facts?

445
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
 - Have you been in the inbox?

446
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,420
 - It's quite a common factoid about it.

447
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,740
 I wasn't on that episode, it was with Nesmith, wasn't it?

448
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,980
 - It was. - Yes, that's right.

449
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,660
 - Oh, Danny, Danny, Danny, you've been harkened.

450
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,940
 Sorry. - What's this?

451
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,340
 - I think we could do this as a section as well

452
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,420
 when people give the facts, you read the first half

453
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,260
 and I tell you what the second half is.

454
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,540
 Having done this job for 20 years.

455
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,340
 - Anyway, Michael Nesmith's mum invented

456
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,460
 a correction fluid and founded liquid paper,

457
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,780
 which later became a large company

458
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,220
 and was sold to Gillette.

459
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,740
 But that's the, that's just dotting the eyes

460
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,860
 and crossing the teeth on that one.

461
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,140
 - It's a good fact, we always like it, yeah.

462
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,620
 - And Danny Sugar adds in,

463
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
 the paper product company, Torque,

464
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,940
 seems to have nothing at all to do with Monkey Peter Torque.

465
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,660
 So it's good to, good that Mr. Bed.

466
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,380
 I'm sick of it in the inbox every week.

467
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,220
 Does he know?

468
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,220
 - That was great. - Yeah.

469
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,060
 There we go.

470
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,900
 - I'm so funny.

471
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,860
 I'd never even heard of that member of the monkeys.

472
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,740
 - No, no. - Torque.

473
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,500
 - All Torque, would be his podcast.

474
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,260
 - Yes. - Torque with Torque.

475
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,100
 - Oh, yes.

476
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,180
 - That would be good.

477
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,020
 - Is he living?

478
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,500
 We don't know.

479
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,220
 - I'd never heard of him until 10 seconds ago.

480
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,340
 I used to watch the monkeys when I was a kid.

481
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,220
 One of my earliest memories is being in hospital

482
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
 'cause I had some adnodes removed

483
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,540
 and watching the monkeys on Saturday.

484
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,380
 - Wow. - Yeah.

485
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,220
 - Good.

486
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,460
 Now let's get into,

487
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,300
 what is it called?

488
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,420
 Is it called the Big Meat?

489
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
 There's one episode each.

490
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,260
 - Spicy Meat?

491
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,980
 - No, no, no, spicy meat is controversy

492
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,820
 in the right environment.

493
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,620
 - You make them up every week, I think.

494
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,340
 - I've got to rigorously maintain

495
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,580
 spreadsheet of these things.

496
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,180
 I've never bring you with me.

497
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,900
 There's often one subject with which dominates the inbox.

498
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,460
 - Okay. - The rodeo clown section.

499
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,300
 - Yeah, yeah.

500
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,260
 - Would you use meat twice for your sections?

501
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,580
 That doesn't feel very-- - Oh, yeah.

502
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,420
 - Spicy meat.

503
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
 You wouldn't have then-- - Yeah, you're right.

504
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,460
 - Maybe you should just call it the rodeo clown section.

505
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,300
 - That's it. - Yeah.

506
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,140
 - I'm writing it down.

507
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,140
 This week's rodeo clown.

508
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,980
 - Yeah.

509
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,140
 - It's a small rodeo clown this week,

510
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,340
 but it's the donut hole.

511
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,540
 - Oh, yeah.

512
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,660
 - So we've just broadcasted an episode

513
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,340
 all about donuts and their holes.

514
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,180
 - Yeah.

515
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,860
 - Is it about the invention or the size or--

516
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,820
 - It's gonna be, my guess is the pirate ship moment

517
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,820
 of where it's supposedly put on the wheel of pirate ship.

518
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,460
 - We've had a few correspondence.

519
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,100
 I've only copied out one of their emails

520
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,020
 'cause it was kind of indicative or representative.

521
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,740
 John G. Erickson said, "I heard James say

522
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,980
 that the nut in donut referred to a small cake."

523
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,820
 - Yeah.

524
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,020
 - I knew that was wrong because I knew, in quotes,

525
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,220
 the correct origin of the word, or so I thought.

526
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,020
 I asked my wife and she knew the same origin that I did.

527
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,580
 Problem is I can't find our version

528
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,180
 anywhere on the internet, so there you go.

529
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,020
 So that's John, giving himself a show and that.

530
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
 - But what's his version?

531
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,940
 - His version. - What are people saying

532
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,180
 they're saying that that's not true?

533
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,420
 - A couple of people have written in saying

534
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,620
 that we don't have to shape like a zero for which

535
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,740
 - Nought is a synonym.

536
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,860
 - Oh yeah, what sounds most likely?

537
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,860
 Me that it's an old word for a cake-like product

538
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,540
 that's like hundreds of years old.

539
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,700
 Or that someone would call it a doughnut.

540
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,380
 - A doughnut, isn't that more satisfying?

541
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,100
 - It's a great coincidence. - It's so John.

542
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,660
 - I mean, to be honest, mine just came from memory,

543
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,340
 so it might not be true either.

544
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,740
 - I'm sure you'll do it. - I can check it.

545
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,260
 - John can't find this on the internet,

546
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,900
 the whole internet, so I think you'll save James.

547
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,740
 Yeah, anyway.

548
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,900
 So that's interesting.

549
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,300
 Paul Hoffman, greetings again, says Paul.

550
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,140
 - I have no idea how fish,

551
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
 I love it when people start with that.

552
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,220
 Could have a whole question.

553
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,180
 - I shouldn't have already questioned, as well.

554
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,420
 On doughnuts, I'm not mentioning the banned fish

555
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,180
 with a pH, but I haven't heard of.

556
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,660
 - They like blur, or?

557
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,620
 - They're less famous than blur, I would say,

558
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,020
 but they're not not famous.

559
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,300
 - Okay, 'cause I'm a rowbacked Paul,

560
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,140
 saying thank you for your email.

561
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,460
 I'd actually never heard of fish,

562
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,380
 and he wrote back saying, well, they're actually incredibly famous.

563
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,420
 - Yeah. - So they're famous, yeah.

564
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,700
 - Then just they're not a racist and blurred.

565
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,340
 - Right, so they famously did a set of 13 shows,

566
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,660
 a Baker's dozen.

567
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,380
 At each of these shows, fish handed out thousands

568
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,780
 of one particular type of doughnut,

569
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,340
 and at least one song they played that night

570
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,180
 was a riff on the type of doughnut.

571
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,940
 - Oh. - Have a go?

572
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,220
 - So go on.

573
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,780
 - Do they have to be songs by the banned fish?

574
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,260
 - No, no, no, no, they played songs from everyone.

575
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,420
 - I don't know. - So, they play

576
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,380
 "Hole Again" by Atomic Kitten.

577
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
 - Got it in one?

578
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,900
 - They play "Hole Again" by Atomic Kitten.

579
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,300
 (laughing)

580
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,340
 - They played "Rigger and Garoses" by "Children."

581
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,460
 - By "Trad."

582
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,940
 So it is strawberry, strawberry doughnuts,

583
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,540
 for strawberry fields. - Oh, that's good.

584
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,260
 Cinnamon doughnuts for cinnamon girl,

585
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,780
 by someone called Neil Young.

586
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,020
 Night 12, they handed out Boston cream doughnuts,

587
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,540
 which was a matter of more than a feeling by Boston

588
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,260
 and sunshine of your love by cream.

589
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,100
 - Wow. - Night 12.

590
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,140
 - So they really committed to the bit.

591
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,180
 - Well, they did 13 nights?

592
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,580
 - I think they possibly could have done more

593
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,380
 than 13 nights at Madison Square Garden,

594
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,060
 if they'd have thought of more puns about doughnuts.

595
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,740
 - Yeah, for sure, that's the reason they only did 13

596
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,900
 as that's the most they could think of.

597
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,740
 - That's probably it.

598
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,140
 - If they'd have thought of "Hole Again"

599
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,940
 right into the kitchen, they might have done 14 nights.

600
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

601
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,420
 - Is it, is it, is it, is it sounds that some?

602
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,980
 - Oh, the gun, no, no.

603
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,060
 - It was "Hole with the Night" or "W", is it?

604
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,420
 - "Hole Again", yeah, with "W".

605
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,500
 - All right, is it your gulfing,

606
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,700
 like pump you up song before gulfing?

607
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
 - But it was number one.

608
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,140
 And he was written by what's the name for the bangles, I think.

609
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,420
 And also it's, they did a cover version

610
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,620
 for the World Cup when "Garret the Southgate",

611
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,700
 they do a "Garret the Southgate" version of it.

612
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,980
 - Mmm, interesting.

613
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,060
 - Gulf, hole?

614
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,780
 - Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

615
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,060
 - This is, there's a lot of pop trivia in this.

616
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,380
 - Yeah, we should do a mashup episode

617
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,060
 but then no such thing as a fish.

618
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,900
 - Brilliant.

619
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,700
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

620
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,460
 Ben Gill says, "My partner's birthday is coming up

621
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,540
 and I'd like to find her an unusual book.

622
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,780
 She's a quantum physicist, a huge reader,

623
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,100
 and of course a big fish fan."

624
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,820
 And we've already made a dent into the fish's books

625
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,940
 and we love the book of the years,

626
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,940
 but I would like to ask for your most loved off-piece

627
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,260
 book recommendations,

628
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,060
 prompted by episode 600 "Donut" book,

629
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,500
 "What are the still readable books you could recommend?"

630
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,340
 - Oh.

631
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,500
 - That is so...

632
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,420
 - 'Cause I had one in my head,

633
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,180
 but I've got a brilliant history of "Darts",

634
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,020
 which is...

635
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,860
 - There we go.

636
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,140
 - Like "Borderline Readable", but it's really good.

637
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,300
 For me, if we're doing non-fiction,

638
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,220
 then "Band Vads" Foley is always my favorite.

639
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,460
 It's a really old book, I can't remember who wrote it now,

640
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,380
 but it's people from history

641
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,020
 who should be more famous than they are.

642
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,500
 - I'm not quite famous at the time,

643
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,580
 but aren't famous anymore.

644
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,820
 - So that was a book that we mentioned very early

645
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,820
 on the podcast, and the earliest of emails would be

646
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,260
 what was that book?

647
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,940
 - The original "Dropper's Align"

648
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,700
 would have just been full of that.

649
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,940
 There's a great book called "Tolstoy's Bicycle",

650
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,780
 which is a sort of QI classic as well.

651
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,580
 It's basically, it's broken up by ages

652
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,260
 and what people had achieved by certain ages.

653
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,660
 It starts like one or two, it's a bit thin.

654
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,980
 But then the early chapter is quite nice.

655
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,580
 - So then you've got Mozart wrote his first

656
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
 little piano piece or whatever.

657
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,420
 - Yeah, yeah.

658
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,260
 - It's really fun.

659
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,460
 It's just a really good encyclopaedic way of breaking up.

660
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,300
 - That's really good.

661
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,140
 - What people have done.

662
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,980
 - I am looking, I'm sorry to be disfigured.

663
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,220
 I'm looking for my favorite one,

664
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,780
 which is not on this bookshelf, which is really annoying.

665
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,620
 No, it's not here.

666
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,140
 I'm looking for Wales' bones of the British Isles.

667
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
 - Oh, yeah.

668
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,980
 - Which is...

669
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,060
 - That's a bit big to take on holiday, isn't it?

670
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,100
 - You look pretty daft at the beach with the 800-page

671
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,540
 giant whale bone in psychopaedia, but it's bloody good.

672
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,620
 - So anyway, so we can come back to that.

673
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
 - Yeah, but those are three.

674
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,100
 - Ben Vars-Folly, Tolstoy's Bicycle,

675
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,500
 - And Wales' bones of the British Isles.

676
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,340
 - There we go.

677
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,180
 - Yeah.

678
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,500
 - Great.

679
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,260
 Oliver Kassel has a suggestion for a section.

680
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,660
 - Ah, thanks with no thanks.

681
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,500
 - Yes.

682
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,060
 - How have you not all come up with a segment

683
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,660
 for a clubfish bonus episode called Go Fish?

684
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,820
 - Well, we play Cards.

685
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,460
 - And then he says, what would it be?

686
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,340
 (laughing)

687
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,340
 - I don't know, Oliver.

688
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,500
 - We could play Go.

689
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,740
 - Yeah, the game of Go.

690
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,900
 - We could play Go.

691
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
 - Yeah.

692
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,580
 - Yeah.

693
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,580
 - What was the question that for the three of us to play?

694
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,420
 - Yeah.

695
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,940
 - Yeah, so it would tie into our knowledge.

696
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,780
 Do you remember we played a game a long time ago?

697
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,620
 It was so fun.

698
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,300
 And I think we literally only played it once,

699
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,540
 where we used to have, in the office, a big...

700
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,780
 You know, those big reams of paper and you'd...

701
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,780
 - A no flip chart.

702
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,860
 - A no flip chart.

703
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,780
 And we used to, so what it was is you would draw the fact,

704
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,020
 and whoever was guess what the fact was as you were drawing.

705
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,500
 It was so much fun.

706
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,340
 That was great.

707
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,420
 - I remember amateuring President Garfield's anus.

708
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,100
 (laughing)

709
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,260
 - You're like, "I saw wrong."

710
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,900
 What have you drawn here?

711
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,380
 - Yeah.

712
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,220
 - God, that's good.

713
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,940
 - That could be a section of the drop us a line,

714
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,780
 you know.

715
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,620
 - That's a really good idea.

716
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,780
 - And this is gonna be Cold Go Fish.

717
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,460
 - Yeah, that was what the, basically this guy's rotten in,

718
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,500
 and then with the idea of a title and nothing else.

719
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,340
 - All right.

720
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,660
 - I don't think you get any credit for all of it.

721
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,300
 If we 50/50 on the royalties, coming your way, buddy.

722
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
 All right.

723
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
 He has a question though.

724
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,140
 - Yeah.

725
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,780
 - And this is a little spicy meat.

726
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,980
 It's slightly spicy meat.

727
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,020
 It's like a pepper army.

728
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,260
 Tell me in secret, I promise I'll keep the secret,

729
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,780
 or maybe just mention it to all fishers,

730
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,620
 or do nothing.

731
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,140
 I don't care.

732
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,300
 Oliver, you're really giving us options here.

733
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,660
 What does the organizational chart at no such thing

734
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,700
 as a fish look like?

735
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,540
 - What do you mean?

736
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,980
 - Why is it just you for Illuminati?

737
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,260
 - Freemasons.

738
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,300
 (laughing)

739
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,140
 - Shut it down.

740
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,980
 - Shut it down.

741
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,420
 And the episode now, that's the four of us,

742
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,940
 'cause that's how we started out and went on.

743
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,260
 We only brought people in if they missed an episode, right?

744
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,100
 - Yeah.

745
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,260
 - That was the idea behind it.

746
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,860
 - But we are also in the Illuminati.

747
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,540
 Sorry, just to like get below that wide open,

748
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
 but we are Freemasons.

749
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,380
 - Yeah, is it?

750
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,580
 - Why have we got this desk here?

751
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,540
 'Cause our trouser legs are rolled up.

752
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
 - Is that Illuminati thing?

753
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,740
 - That's Mason's, isn't it?

754
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,140
 - You roll your trouser legs up.

755
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,980
 - Oh no.

756
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,900
 - You roll one trouser leg up.

757
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,780
 - You two in the first meeting.

758
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,620
 (laughing)

759
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,740
 - It's gonna be so embarrassing

760
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,380
 when I bring you to my Illuminati meeting.

761
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,620
 - I've come with shorts.

762
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,940
 They're both Freemasons rolled up.

763
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,180
 (laughing)

764
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,660
 - What's up, I've never heard that before.

765
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,740
 - Dan, you've written a book

766
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,180
 about weird things people believe,

767
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,340
 but I don't do Freemasons.

768
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,100
 - Oh, no, actually we do get emails

769
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,740
 from Agrived Mason sometimes.

770
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,580
 - Yeah.

771
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,420
 - You mention the Masons.

772
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,260
 - Yeah.

773
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,900
 - They will email it.

774
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,740
 - Yes, they will.

775
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,220
 - And they say we don't do this

776
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,780
 in that weird utray thing.

777
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,900
 - They emailed in because I said

778
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,900
 that they all have Harry Potter like wizard ones

779
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,140
 in their briefcases.

780
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,980
 - I don't know, it was like,

781
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,860
 it's not a wand, it's a staff

782
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
 which we use for our spells.

783
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,980
 (laughing)

784
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,500
 (laughing)

785
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,580
 - Come at me Gandalf, right?

786
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,580
 - Okay, Claire Matthews from Esquimalt,

787
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,660
 which I'm assuming I'm saying correctly.

788
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
 (laughing)

789
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,060
 - On Vancouver Island.

790
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,820
 - It sounds like how you might spell Eskimo.

791
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,020
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

792
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,060
 And maybe it's pronounced like that.

793
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,860
 I just don't know.

794
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,220
 I absolutely loved Dan's comment

795
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,780
 about how King Dagobair was docked by controversy.

796
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,300
 - Oh.

797
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,100
 - We're back into conspiracy territory.

798
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,740
 - Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

799
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,220
 Is this just the dag and dog?

800
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,420
 Is that what she likes?

801
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,820
 - No, no, but because in the French translation

802
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,140
 of Enoch Blighten's famous five series,

803
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,060
 Le Club des Sank, the dog Timmy is called Dagobair.

804
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
 - No.

805
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,020
 - So you were scoring a hoop you didn't even see.

806
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,860
 - Very good.

807
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
 - Yep, that's a lovely fact.

808
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,700
 - I know.

809
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,540
 - Great fact.

811
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,700
 I grew up in France, Le Bonne Rat Dagobair,

812
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,500
 the song is familiar to me,

813
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,860
 but only through the nursery rhyme.

814
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,700
 I'm an interior podcast.

815
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,540
 I didn't know he was a real historical figure.

816
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,380
 - Interesting.

817
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,220
 - Yeah, yeah.

818
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,980
 That is proof that the nursery rhyme exists.

819
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,220
 And she points out that it does not recover his reputation.

820
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,260
 It's making a lot of fun of him and all of that.

821
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,100
 - Right.

822
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,060
 - But he puts his chasers on back to front

823
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,940
 and he gets chased by a rabbit.

824
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,380
 Another amusing thing's happened.

 Dom Paddon writes,

826
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,860
 in the 1990s German extortionist Arne Funk,

827
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,540
 Arne Funker modeled himself on Scrooge McDuck,

828
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,820
 which is Dagobair in German.

829
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,260
 - What, so jacket, no trousers?

830
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,460
 - No, just, what, sorry, I didn't actually understand

831
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,980
 that sentence.

832
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,700
 So it doesn't need a bit of passing, doesn't it?

833
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,300
 - So Dagobair is the German version of Scrooge McDuck?

834
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,620
 - Yeah, in Germany,

835
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,940
 Scrooge McDuck is called Dagobair.

836
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,780
 - Is he?

837
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,620
 Wow.

838
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,460
 - And in the 1990s,

839
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,620
 there was a famous extortionist called Arne Funker,

840
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,260
 Arne Funk, who modeled himself on Dagobair,

841
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,460
 and successfully evaded the police for years.

842
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,020
 - What did he do, like, swim in gold coins or something, maybe?

843
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,420
 I'm trying to think of how you can model yourself

844
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,420
 on Scrooge McDuck.

845
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,260
 - On Scrooge McDuck.

846
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,180
 - 'Cause he doesn't have that very, very clear characteristic.

847
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,140
 - And you're absolutely right.

848
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,860
 But apparently the police resorted to studying

849
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,260
 Donald Duckhart's to see what he would do next.

850
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,860
 And there were people wearing,

851
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,380
 I am Dagobair T-shirts,

852
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,380
 and he was mentioned in rap songs.

853
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,780
 At one point, he evaded capture

854
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,060
 as the policeman chasing him,

855
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,900
 slipped on a dog poo.

856
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,740
 - Interesting.

857
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,900
 You know what?

858
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,180
 I always thought that dog poo's would be a better

859
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,460
 comedic thing than banana skins.

860
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
 'Cause I have stood on banana skins

861
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,260
 and don't think they're very slippy,

862
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,900
 but dog poo is really slippy.

863
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,740
 - Oh yeah.

864
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,020
 - If you stand on a dog poo,

865
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,940
 like I've seen people properly skidding on dog poo.

866
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,780
 - You see?

867
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,780
 - Yeah.

868
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,940
 - But yeah.

869
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,420
 - Can we just go back to you standing on a banana skin,

870
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,380
 saying, see, I'm not slipping on it.

871
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,780
 - I stood on one, like, literally this week.

872
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,740
 I stood on a banana skin.

873
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,580
 - You, you.

874
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,700
 - I was walking down and I had something squelched

875
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,540
 in the microphone.

876
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,380
 - You were carrying a paint of glass

877
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,060
 across the street when you were at this time.

878
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,580
 - I'm not that slippy.

879
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,500
 - It's quite, I have a faint memory.

880
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,220
 The bell is tinkling

881
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,660
 that banana skins are sort of an accepted code for dog poo.

882
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,140
 But you couldn't show dog poo on film.

883
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,740
 'Cause it was too sort of a bit rude or a bit gross.

884
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,580
 - Right.

885
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,180
 - So you'd sort of every, you know,

886
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,540
 well, because you don't get banana skins

887
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,380
 just all over the place.

888
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,220
 - You didn't America.

889
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,820
 I think we spoke about this on the podcast.

890
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,460
 In New York, there was a big period

891
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,260
 where rubbish wasn't being collected.

892
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,140
 - I was okay. - And those guys were everywhere.

893
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,860
 And so it became, and then there were variety acts

894
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,460
 that would go on stage, specifically slipping on bananas.

895
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,380
 - Was a guy who literally, he would put a banana on the stage

896
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,980
 and he would walk and then skid all the way across

897
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,420
 the stage, go off stage, laugh.

898
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,260
 - Brilliant.

899
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,460
 - I remember his name, but yeah.

900
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,380
 - Oh my God, the comedy ice skating awards

901
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,500
 would be amazing.

902
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,460
 What tricks you could pull on two bananas.

903
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,140
 - Me, YOB, that's where that comes from.

904
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,220
 - So is that two major characters that are called

905
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,500
 Dagobair in different countries?

906
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,340
 - Yeah.

907
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,180
 - Timmy The Dog.

908
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,020
 - Timmy The Dog and Scrooge McDog.

909
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,980
 - Wow.

910
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,820
 - Interesting.

911
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,980
 - Dogobair, more like?

912
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,740
 - More like Duckobair.

913
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,940
 - There we go.

914
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,780
 End it.

915
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,140
 - Right, you've had your fill.

916
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,020
 - Randall Cleaver writes,

917
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,420
 "Mine and Laws live in Lexington, Virginia,

918
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,860
 where the Virginia military institute is located

919
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,340
 in the local town cemetery is Stonewall Jackson's grave."

920
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,740
 - Oh, cool.

921
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,140
 - Which grave, the...

922
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,820
 - I presume the full, the three quarter ones.

923
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,060
 - Yeah.

924
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,100
 - One day, one visiting them, I went over to see his grave

925
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,020
 and I saw what's on the ground surrounding his grave.

926
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,300
 - Like a zombie putting his hand out of the grave,

927
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
 it was his big hand.

928
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,820
 - Brilliant.

929
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,660
 - Not that.

930
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
 - Oh, and all that.

931
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,340
 - Was it the Stonewall magazine, the pro LGBT?

932
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,100
 - It wasn't Stonewall magazine.

933
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,020
 - Was it a literal Stonewall?

934
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,060
 - No, very nice.

935
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,220
 - I don't know, I think we said that people believed about him

936
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,060
 that was not true.

937
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
 - Oh, okay.

938
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,460
 - Oh, he always ate lemons.

939
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,700
 - Yes, that's right.

940
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,700
 - Dozens of lemons on the ground surrounding his grave.

941
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,100
 Many of them had writing on them.

942
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,460
 I went over to the museum.

943
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,300
 - Ah, deliberate.

944
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,180
 - And I went to the museum and I talked to the docent there.

945
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,620
 I don't know the word, about the lemons.

946
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,700
 She said that someone saw him eating lemon

947
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,340
 and it became law.

948
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,940
 And the museum gift shop sells lemon shaped stress balls.

949
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,780
 - Brilliant.

950
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,900
 (laughing)

951
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,740
 - All right, last one.

952
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,580
 Should we have, I think we've--

953
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,900
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

954
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,260
 - We squeezed this lemon.

955
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,500
 (laughing)

956
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,860
 - And the pips are squeaking.

957
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,020
 Now this is a great one.

958
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,900
 Martha King writes, "Long time emailer, first time listener."

959
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,740
 (laughing)

960
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,980
 - I'm sorry, I've just got that.

961
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,140
 I'm showing you.

962
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,980
 (laughing)

963
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
 - That's a good joke.

964
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,820
 - That's a good joke.

965
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,980
 - That's the first time we've ever--

966
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,820
 (laughing)

967
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,060
 - That's for you, Martha.

968
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,380
 That's the first time we've ever had that.

969
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,860
 And I've been in the box for about four years,

970
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
 and I've been in the box for about four years.

971
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
 - Yeah, that's great.

972
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,260
 - Oh, I'm going to say something potentially controversial.

973
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,100
 - Yeah.

974
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,300
 - Are we entering spicy meat alley?

975
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,660
 I don't think of Dan Treiber as a wife guy.

976
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,500
 - Oh.

977
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,380
 - She's flirty, what do you hear?

978
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,220
 - I see.

979
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,060
 (laughing)

980
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,740
 - My understanding of the phrase wife guy

981
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,540
 is as a pejorative for overly performative behavior,

982
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,020
 specifically straight men who cultivate and profit

983
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,420
 from a family man image until a cheating scandal

984
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,580
 inevitably breaks.

985
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,140
 - I think Adam Levine or Ned Fulmer.

986
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,980
 - Who's Ned Fulmer?

987
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,820
 - Who's Ned Fulmer?

988
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,660
 (laughing)

989
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,180
 - And if you're Mrs. Fulmer, I'm so sorry.

990
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,420
 (laughing)

991
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,260
 (laughing)

992
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
 - Ned Fulmer.

993
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,100
 - Who's Ned Fulmer?

994
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,940
 (laughing)

995
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,220
 - Adam Levine was here in Maroon 5, possibly.

996
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,420
 - I'm sorry, I don't believe that.

997
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,140
 - Yeah, just while we're on our pop culture references,

998
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,100
 but yeah, Ned Fulmer.

999
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,340
 - Ned Fulmer, that was very much the, you know,

1000
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,580
 like Chewbacca and then Abraham Lincoln

1001
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,260
 and then Jonathan Larson.

1002
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,620
 (laughing)

1003
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,100
 - Ned Fulmer.

1004
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,940
 - Ned Fulmer.

1005
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,340
 - He's from a thing called the Try Guys.

1006
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
 - A YouTube channel.

1007
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,180
 - Okay.

1008
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
 - I think they're relatively famous.

1009
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,020
 - Okay.

1010
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
 - I think, yeah.

1011
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,180
 - Well, sorry Ned.

1012
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,020
 Sorry to back Dan, right, Martha,

1013
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,820
 but I will not let him continue to give wife guys

1014
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,660
 a good name.

1015
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,700
 (laughing)

1016
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,100
 I do agree that Dan is the textbook example

1017
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,020
 of whatever the wholesome version of this is called.

1018
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,460
 Maybe just a good husband.

1019
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,940
 And I'm obviously delighted that he and Ben found each other.

1020
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,660
 - Yeah, just a nice email, isn't it?

1021
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,500
 - A nice email?

1022
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,340
 - Yeah.

1023
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,340
 So I think, I take that point.

1024
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,380
 When we say, a wife guy is often someone who's saying,

1025
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,420
 oh look, I love my wife so much.

1026
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,860
 I'm great, rather than actually saying,

1027
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,260
 I just think my wife's brilliant, she's great.

1028
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,740
 - Oh, you know what I mean, right.

1029
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,900
 - 'Cause I think you do mention a thing a lot,

1030
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,340
 but that's because I think it comes from a genuine place of,

1031
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,340
 - What was anecdotes to tell?

1032
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,180
 - Yeah.

1033
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,020
 - So anecdotes.

1034
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,860
 (laughing)

1035
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
 - So Jenny complies some trying to fill out.

1036
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,700
 - She is.

1037
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,540
 - She's anecdotes central.

1038
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,740
 - She's anecdotes city.

1039
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,580
 - Yeah, you're right.

1040
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
 - She fucks up as much as she does.

1041
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,740
 - Of course she's going to get mentioned.

1042
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
 (laughing)

1043
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:47,540
 (upbeat music)

1044
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,780
 - That is Drop us Alone for another fortnight.

1045
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,020
 Thank you so much for listening.

1046
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,860
 And if you've enjoyed this,

1047
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,540
 there's nothing more for you to do.

1048
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
 - If you haven't enjoyed it,

1049
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,220
 why not write an email to Andy explaining why not?

1050
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,220
 - Anyway, thanks very much.

1051
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,580
 Yes, podcast@coy.com.

1052
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,460
 Keep those emails are coming.

1053
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,620
 Keep 'em rolling in.

1054
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,460
 - Keep 'em drumming in.

1055
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,940
 - Keep 'em drifting in.

1056
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,100
 - Cheers, bye.

1057
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,680
 (upbeat music)

1058
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,260
