00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.920
 Everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Where We Were

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.560
 Chained by someone who a lot of you will be very excited to hear.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.360
 Yes.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.800
 It's the return of Ann Miller.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.840
 The comeback.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.480
 Our colleague Ann joined us for this week's episode.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.240
 It was so nice having her back on.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.800
 She had a classic Ann Fack, which you're about to hear.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.200
 And it was just great. It was a really nice episode.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.080
 I love you to have her back.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.200
 Does she have anything that we can plug at the top of the show this week?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.520
 She does, actually. She's got a book coming

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.760
 in, I think it's coming in a few months time,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.760
 but it's available to pre-order now.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.560
 And it's called Monster Diaries.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.600
 I think there's going to be a few of them.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.720
 I hope so anyway.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.520
 And basically, it's kind of classical stories

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.640
 where there's often a monster.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.840
 Like Greek Mets and stuff.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 Exactly, but from the monster's point of view.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.320
 Oh, very similar.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 So the first one is about the Cyclops,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.080
 but it's the Cyclops getting to tell his side of the story.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.600
 And it's just, it's a lovely idea.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.640
 They're beautifully illustrated.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 I've seen the drawings that have been going into them.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.320
 So that is highly recommended.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.680
 The Monster Diaries.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.800
 By Anne Miller and indeed, if you go to the places where you buy books,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.040
 you'll find all of Anne's other books.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.560
 She's written a whole lot of them.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And one more thing to say before we start.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.480
 Gone.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.600
 Christmas is coming.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.960
 The goose is getting fat.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 Please, but a penny?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480
 In the old man's hat.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.840
 Feels stingy.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 Um, but you might be thinking about what to get your loved ones for Christmas.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.160
 Yeah.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.400
 And you might be thinking, oh, it's so hard

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.160
 to buy a physical object for people.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
 I'm thinking what to buy my wife.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.080
 Well, what she really loves to hear is my voice more and more.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.840
 She doesn't get nearly enough of it.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.320
 Absolutely.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.840
 Well, James, you should buy her access to Club Fish.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.560
 Oh.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.280
 Yeah.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.120
 It's the members club that we have where you can get extra content.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.680
 You can get ad-free episodes of Fish.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.040
 And you can get all sorts of stuff.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.560
 And there are a few different tiers you can do.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.920
 Up to the very top tier where we're going to be doing a quarterly quiz.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 The first of those is coming up soon.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.280
 And it's going to be so much fun on Zoom with all of your members.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 So, uh, it's really fun.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.040
 It's a great present to give someone.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.600
 Because it's an experience.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.320
 Absolutely.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.240
 I'm going to get my wife one straight away.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 I'm going to send that sports car back.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.280
 She'll be delighted.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.480
 [LAUGHS]

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.280
 Excellent.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.760
 James, how do people find out more about this Club Fish place?

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.680
 I would imagine you probably go to patreon.com/nosephix.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.120
 I think you're right.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.680
 You are right.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.480
 That's where you go.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.560
 Patreon.com/nosephix.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.280
 Go and check it out.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.080
 It's so much fun.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.720
 It will make a lovely present for anyone in your life who likes Fish.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.760
 Well, you know what?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.960
 You deserve a present too.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.160
 You sure do.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.440
 Treat yourself.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.080
 All right.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.120
 I think outside, isn't it?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.240
 That's all we have to say.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.520
 Merry Christmas to come.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.480
 On with the podcast.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.280
 On with the show.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.640
 Hello and welcome to another episode.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.840
 A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.000
 from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.080
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.400
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.520
 and Ann Meller.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.960
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Ann.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.680
 After you bake panatoni, you have to hang them upside down

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.840
 like that's.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.240
 So cute.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.640
 I would say this is a vintage Ann Meller fact.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.480
 And that it's interesting, but it's also quite sweet.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.000
 Yeah.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.640
 What a return.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.160
 Yeah.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.320
 What a return.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320
 And Christmas is coming.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.120
 Christmas is coming.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.640
 So why?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.200
 Why do you have to?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.320
 So I got very interested in a big deep dive

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.480
 about how you make traditional panatoni.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.320
 And the result was I became desperate to eat very high quality

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.920
 in the toning.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.320
 How deep is the deep dive on panatoning?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.360
 I'll send you the links.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.480
 Some great articles.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.800
 Basically, traditional panatoni is wildly

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 controversial to make.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.760
 It's a lot of very expensive ingredients,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.080
 sip butter, and eggs and fruit.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.480
 Actually half the volume of panatoni is butter on a proper one.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.640
 That's why it tastes so good.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640
 Oh, there it is.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.720
 So great.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.240
 And it's--

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.600
 This just made me think I've never had a good panatoni,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.840
 because I think of it as being a dry, otherwise--

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.640
 So I did see someone saying that if you need to butter it,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.760
 it's not a traditional one.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.920
 It's also a really lengthy process.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.320
 And at the end, all this care you've

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.680
 made to your panatoni, if you don't flip it upside down

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.720
 really quickly, it's quickly as 20 seconds.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.280
 The dome was up to cave in.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.400
 So the picture I found online, which I love,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.560
 is this big wire rack with panatoni's hanging upside down,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.320
 which suggests if you were to examine,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.600
 as I will do this, Christmas, the bottom of your panatoni.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.440
 And you see little holes where the wires have gone through.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.040
 So they're hanging upside down to cool.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.800
 Or another method is you can pop it upside down

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.680
 in a wicker basket.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.560
 And it's about eight hours of upside down hanging

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.440
 for it to settle.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.160
 Well, that's what I read.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.520
 I've never made a panatoni.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.360
 I've definitely--

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.280
 I wanted to until I read this.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280
 So you've not done this.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.160
 I've decided it was going to take one man was 86.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.760
 I've had been working since he was a child.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.400
 And I can't compete with that, Dan.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.720
 It sounds so hard.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.760
 It sounds so hard.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.920
 When you make some food or make anything in life,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.720
 you don't have to compete with a person who

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.960
 is the absolute best at it.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.560
 But I want to sample this one, not have a very inferior one,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.560
 made by me.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.200
 But you have picked the extreme end of panatoni

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.280
 making in your example.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.000
 It's like saying, I decided not to become a footballer,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.240
 because David Beckham exists.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.040
 Well, exactly.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.760
 I don't play football, Dan.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.440
 Well, she is a QI researcher, and she's the best QI researcher.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.560
 Yes, that's a lot about us, yeah.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.320
 And was this Nicola Fiasconardo?

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320
 I think so.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.640
 So he is a Sicilian master baker.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.800
 And the profile of him started out with saying,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.960
 this is a man who has baked panatoni for not one, not two,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.120
 but three different popes.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.360
 That's just clearly good.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.840
 But we've had quite a few popes.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.360
 We've been through a lot of them here.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.360
 Yeah.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.360
 And what killed them?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.000
 One of them was intering this master panatoni maker.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.880
 And they said, we rang the shop to make sure he would be

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.160
 there ahead of our visit.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.120
 And they said, he is always here.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.040
 Right, lovely.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.640
 But it's amazing.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.320
 So they also have this special yeast.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.560
 And in one bakery, they have been using the same local resource

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.960
 yeast since 1922, has to be fed with flour and water every four

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.760
 hours.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.480
 What?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.240
 Every four hours since 1922.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.280
 I can see why you've now pulled out the pudding involved.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.920
 That must be very strong.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.920
 Well, yeah.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.600
 I mean, Italy's been through a lot of upheaval in the--

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.200
 That's interesting.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.120
 --since 1922, like they've had fascism, they've had the war.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.440
 How long has Italy actually existed?

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.920
 It's 1870s, I think.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.200
 So it's like a lot more than that.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.480
 That yeast is almost as old as Italy.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.440
 That's amazing.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.640
 You, Andy, just mentioned that it possibly took out three

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.080
 popes.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.240
 Yeah, I'd like to roll back from that a bit.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.360
 But what's interesting is it most likely hasn't,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.200
 because God is on the side of the panatoni.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.720
 Right.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.600
 Because we're assuming that God is on the side of those

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600
 popes as well.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.200
 Absolutely.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.760
 They're not still here as I'll have say it.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.040
 I think God is Italian.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.560
 Yeah.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.120
 God is Italian.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.160
 Because the patron saint of choking and sore

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.080
 throats and so on is connected to panatoni.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.600
 San Biagio.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.120
 This is an amazing character.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.920
 St. Blaze.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.640
 St. Blaze for those who speak non-italian.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.560
 Other languages are available.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.520
 But yeah, I mean, interesting character.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.800
 Born in Armenia, lived in the third and fourth centuries.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.080
 And he got beatified and made into a saint

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.160
 because of miracles that were to do largely

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.960
 with saving people from choking.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.800
 At least that was the main one.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.880
 There was a kid that was choking on something.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.040
 And he came, managed to take it out.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.960
 And there was a miracle.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.280
 He convinced a wolf to return a stolen pig.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.800
 That was another reason for him being beatified.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.880
 Returned him to the house, but it was made of straw.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.960
 So it got him blown down.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.360
 When you said patron saint of choking,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.400
 I couldn't quite work out what is more like the patron saint

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.400
 of not choking.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.400
 Sothras.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
 Being saved.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400
 He's also being saved from.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.200
 Just to say as well, he is a patron saint of wolf comas.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.520
 So wolf comas are people who comb sheep.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.440
 And they use really, really long sort of like a head brush.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.560
 But it's like got nails in it.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560
 These wolf coms.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.760
 But he's the patron saint of that.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.000
 And the reason he's the patron saint of wolf comas

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.280
 is because before he was beheaded, he was beaten with wolf coms.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
 Oh no.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280
 Right.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.960
 Sothras, yeah, they're of the patron saint of something that killed them.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.960
 Doesn't seem right.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960
 Doesn't seem right.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.960
 It's not fair.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.080
 I think panatone, you might be a classic Harkin singular plural problem.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.600
 Oh, panatone.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 Panatone E with an eye is the plural.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.320
 And panatone Neh with an E is the singular.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320
 Interesting.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.200
 So should we all be saying, are we saying it wrong?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.000
 Should we be saying, would you like some panatone Neh?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.160
 I would say panatonees does feel weird when you say it.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.880
 They don't usually eat more than they.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.440
 Yeah, no, they'd like stuff at two.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440
 Stop but two.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.440
 Half butter.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.720
 They put it so there's no plural because no one's ever had to panatone.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.440
 It's mentioned in a book by a chef called Friend of the Podcast.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.640
 Bartolomeo Shapi.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.480
 Oh yeah.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480
 Spelt Scappy.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.480
 What's he friend of us for?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.960
 He was Friend of the Podcast.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.840
 He is the one who cooked for many popes

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.360
 and made incredible elaborate dishes and banquets.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.520
 And then a new Pope came in and said,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.000
 "No, I just want a lot of old egg from now on."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And so he kind of lost it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.360
 But he wrote one of the first big cookbooks.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.080
 So it was it was mentioned we think in a book by him.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.360
 But they're all these kind of enriched breads,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.920
 which are fruit and fruit peel and you know, all of this stuff.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.640
 So it's a bit murky where it truly is.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.280
 One of them is the Baba.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.200
 I don't know if you know about Babas.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.800
 You get Babas from Poland and other Slavic countries,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.840
 but I think they probably came from panatonees

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.800
 and then they turn them into Babas.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.720
 But the way that you make them is really regimented.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.920
 It's almost like the Baba is a baby.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.120
 So men are not allowed to enter the kitchen

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.240
 while they're being made.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.600
 Do you have to whisper while you're cooking it

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.240
 in case it starts crying?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.240
 Oh, I guess.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.240
 That's lovely.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.000
 And also you have to leave it to rest on a piece of eye

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.280
 to down before putting it in the oven.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.920
 Outside down a regular way.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.720
 Regular way.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.800
 The advice has changed since the 1960s.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.560
 You used to have to put it upside down.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.240
 But never put it in with the parents.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.840
 Well, do you always put it in with the parents?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.760
 I can't imagine that at a time.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.080
 Do you know what it means, panatone?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.240
 I read one, the etymology that it was invented by a guy

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:13.760
 called Tony.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.880
 I love that so much.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.720
 It's so good.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.920
 I mean, it's anti-tree, right?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.560
 I think it just means big bread.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.600
 Because the One means big as a suffix.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.920
 So it's panne, obviously, at One.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.560
 And I didn't know this.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.320
 You know, in Italian, calzone.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.400
 That is a big legging.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.240
 What?

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.360
 Calzone is a legging.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.560
 What do you mean, legging?

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.560
 Like a legging.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.560
 Like you wear leggings, you know?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.560
 That's tight.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560
 Oh, like a tie.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560
 So calzone is a legging.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.080
 And calzone literally means trousers.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.040
 So when you order a calzone, that's what you're ordering.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.040
 It's a sleeve, basically.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.920
 It's a sleeve for your legs, which is what I call my trousers.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.680
 And it's full of hot, hot meat, as opposed to that.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.080
 Do you know where?

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.560
 Like our legs, yeah.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.960
 And do you know who the best panatone makers in the world are?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.680
 We said that it might be this Italian who's been doing it for 80 years, but not according

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.680
 to the world championships.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680
 Oh.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.200
 There's panatone world championships.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.200
 There are.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.040
 And they won in 2025.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.160
 Which nationality do you think won the prize?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.400
 If you guess it, I will give you £10 million.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400
 Oh.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400
 Oh, we allowed to cheat.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400
 I didn't.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400
 No, cheating.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400
 No, no, no.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400
 Let me qualify the cheating.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400
 I have a fact about panatone eaters, so I'm thinking it might be from that country.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400
 Have a guess.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400
 Peru.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400
 Nope.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400
 Mongolia.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400
 Closer, but no.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400
 Oh.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400
 Mars.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400
 Mars.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400
 Oh, lovely.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.800
 And no, they're from Taiwan.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:41.120
 They won it in 2025, and they won a load of gold medals for the best chocolate one, the best

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.960
 general one, the best gelato panatone.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.480
 But an interesting rule in the panatone championships is if you don't wear a hat, you lose

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.480
 a point.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.520
 And actually, it's anyone in your team.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.360
 If anyone from your team doesn't wear a hat, you lose points for your panatone.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360
 What's the reason?

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.960
 They just have a very specific uniform that you have to wear.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960
 Right.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.080
 It's got very specific, it's black shoes, black trousers, a special jacket that you get

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.320
 given by the organizers, naprin and a hat.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.800
 And if any of them you don't wear, you lose points.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.560
 I did really have to use a proper Italian mother yeast.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560
 To enter.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.040
 And you're not allowed any accoutrements, really.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.880
 You're allowed dried fruits, but you can't put like a kick out on top of something.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.520
 But there is a chocolate round.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520
 Yeah.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.720
 And again, they have very special things that you're allowed to pop up.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.720
 So it's on skill rather than like crazy new flavors.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720
 No kick hats.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
 No milky way.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720
 No crunchies.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.880
 Why do these fun competitions always sound so intense?

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.480
 Like you'd have a hard attack halfway through doing it.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480
 This is serious stuff.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.600
 Also because you've eaten a panatone that's half buffet, probably a preparation.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.360
 Like your doctor will be checking that out.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.320
 But I think they're very strict about it in places like Milan.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.400
 So Milan, according to the Milanese Chamber of Commerce, I believe, they ruled that a traditional

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.480
 panatone has to be 20% salt on it and dried fruit.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480
 Which to be is insane.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.480
 That's insane.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
 It's insane.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480
 I always pick them out.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.360
 Well, you're going to have a, you're going to be doing it a long time by a proper, tried

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360
 one.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 Yeah.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.360
 I don't even like a spotted dick with fruit in it.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360
 Really?

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360
 Yeah.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360
 I hate those dried fruits.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360
 So you've not found a fruit cake?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360
 No.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.360
 Absolutely not.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.360
 And I have to change my office bake now.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.360
 Right, man.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.960
 In this piece about the fiasco narrow factory, they said they used manna as a sweetener.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.200
 I don't know if you guys saw this.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.240
 The food of the gods from their old testament.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.120
 That's why it's expensive because you have to go into the desert for 40 years and eventually

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.520
 you get some of the, well, it's this, it's this resin which you get from ash trees and

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.960
 it's naturally quite sweet.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.600
 And a journalist asked one of the fiasco narrow family, well, this is brilliant, but you've

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.680
 only reduced the sort of like white sugar that you put it in.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.640
 Why don't you just use mana?

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.560
 And she said, we can't just use mana because mana has laxative properties, which applies

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.000
 the existence of a, of an experiment that went disastrous.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.880
 Would you like the forbidden panoramic?

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.720
 Do you reckon that's what happens to the popes?

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720
 Oh, questionably.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720
 Oh, questionably.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720
 That's amazing.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.720
 Yeah.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.200
 But another thing I didn't know about panoramic, so the saint dimensions, saint Viasco, saint

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.840
 blaze, because he saved this child from choking.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.440
 There is a tradition that when you have your christmas panoramic, you save a piece.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.000
 And on February 3rd, saint blaze is feast day.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.280
 You toast it because it'll be stale by that point, you are allowed to butter this way, and

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.280
 then you eat it and there's meant to ward off sore throats for the past.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.280
 Yeah.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.720
 So I was reading more into saint Bajajur.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.960
 And there is this really fun thing, which is, I think I found what was one of the original

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.280
 Heimlich maneuvers from this period.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.520
 So he was 3rd, 4th century.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.080
 This was being practiced in the 6th century, right?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.720
 So what would happen is, if a bone was stuck in your throat, if after initial attempts

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.000
 to get it out, sometimes they would say put a bit of bread in, and so it would go

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.800
 down, it would be pushed down by the bread.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.440
 I think that's still the advice, isn't it?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.440
 Right.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.440
 It's what I do.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.440
 Is it?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.440
 You eat more when you're choking.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440
 Okay.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.440
 If you've got a little bone stuck, you just have a bit of bread, it just sort of envelops

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440
 it and takes it down.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.880
 So you put it in the size of the bone.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880
 It does.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880
 It does.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.040
 But no, that is still what happens if the bread gets stuck, then do you send, you know,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.040
 a curly, oily down there?

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.960
 It's the, yeah, it's the middle-aged man who saw it a bone.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.240
 And then, yeah, if anyone's choking while listening to this, please, please, please look

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240
 up the NHS website.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240
 Don't take my advice.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240
 Yeah.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240
 Absolutely.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240
 That's always worked for me.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240
 Yep.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240
 Well, here's what I'll be doing.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.640
 So if you want to try some six-century advice and the bone's not coming out, what you need

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.560
 to do, and this is a quote, is to go around and face the person who's choking and yell

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:38.120
 at them, come out bone, if you are a bone, or whatever you are, come out like Lazarus

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.840
 at the voice of Christ, come out of the tomb, and Jonah from the belly of the whale.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.040
 And then that will get the bone out of your, yeah.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.040
 Well, if it is a bone.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040
 If it is a bone.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:16:05.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520
 Okay.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.720
 My fact this week is that those giant walking keyboards that Tom Hanks plays in big have existed

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.520
 in India for 500 years.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.520
 Brilliant.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.520
 Very good.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.520
 How did they find it?

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520
 Oh, it's just there.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.400
 It's in a big old temple.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.760
 You can't miss it, really.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.200
 You can't tell when you're watching the film that he's in a 500-year-old Indian temple.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200
 It's really interesting.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.320
 No, he looks like he's in the famous toy shop in New York, FAO Schwartz, doesn't he?

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 Yeah, but that's the magic of film, isn't it?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320
 It's green screen.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 Yeah.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.160
 No, so basically these are musical temples in India, which I read about, and there's lots

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.000
 of them around, especially in South India, and they have various bits of architecture which

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 make music.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.760
 And the one in particular that I'm talking about is called 'Eravatasvara Temple', situated

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.240
 in Dharasaram near Kumbh Bakanam in the Tanjabor district of Tamil Nadu.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.880
 Yeah, okay.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.840
 I was lost until you mentioned the final location.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.000
 Imagine if you imagine India as a giant upside-down triangle.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Yes.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.680
 It's just up a bit, and to the right a bit, of the bottom angle of the triangle.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.680
 I understand.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680
 Okay.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.800
 You took those fences like a pro, that was just like, great.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.280
 I have them very phonetically written out on my paper.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.880
 But this temple, it has a staircase where every time you step on one of the steps, it makes

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.400
 a note, and it makes a note of a scale, which is effectively the same as that.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.360
 So if anyone doesn't know the 1988 film with Tom Hanks, he is a 13-year-old boy who turns

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.840
 into an adult and plays around in toy shops and one of them, the most iconic scene probably

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.680
 he plays one of these giant floor pianos.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680
 Yeah, absolutely brilliant.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680
 Yeah, that's right.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.440
 If I was a monk in one of these temples, what I would do is, I would climb up six of the

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.200
 steps, and I would jump off somehow, and that would irritate all the other monks in

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.200
 the temple, because they'd be waiting for the final.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.200
 So good.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.200
 So good.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.200
 Oh, yes.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.200
 Yeah.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.200
 Well, thank you for going to the bottom.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.200
 Dada.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200
 Dada.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200
 Dada.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200
 Dada.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.080
 Actually, that's not what it would sound like, because they are of the carnatic musical

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:20.280
 scale, they're swarers, so they're not normal sort of ABCDFG notes.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.080
 They are a double harmonic, so that's a scale with a D-flat and an A-flat for music nerds

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.160
 like Anne's husband.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.880
 And so when you play it, if you play that scale, it sounds like you're in a 1980s movie and

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.600
 a snake's about to come out of a basket, so you know that kind of eastern sound.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:44.280
 One way to explain it is, you know, in the song Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, when they go

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:50.480
 "Scaramush, caramush, can you do the Fandango, that Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, is in that kind

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.480
 of scale."

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.480
 Wow.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480
 That explains kind of what it would sound like.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.320
 Did they use the steps to record that, or did they use the steps to do that?

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.320
 They did.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.080
 You know what steps you're going to record on those steps?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.080
 Oh.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080
 I mean, that would be a music video.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080
 Well, be hard to.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.360
 I don't know if you've seen a video or a picture of these steps, but firstly, they're

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.800
 hard to get to, because they're in a cage now.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.080
 So there's this big cage that goes around them and...

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.520
 No, it's John Cage, more like.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.520
 Yeah.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.600
 John Cage and steps together at last, just getting all my modern references in there, you know.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.440
 And yeah, it's an interesting staircase, because it's not a classic staircase.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.280
 The full length of the stairs are the height of a man, the video I watched is a man who's

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.680
 standing on the side of it, and it's quite fun, because he's tapping the side, and you

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.280
 can hear all these notes.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.680
 But yeah, they're very thin in terms of, you've got the staircase itself and the

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.240
 two barriers on the staircase.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.000
 You'd almost have to walk single file with your feet with one front of the other in order

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 to get up.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.800
 But yeah, listening to it is fascinating.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.800
 As you say, very odd scale, because it's the seven notes of classical Indian music.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.480
 They do have other musical temples across India, which I love.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:01.040
 And so there are so much have musical pillars, which ring with different notes when you

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.360
 strike them.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.000
 And there are, I think, some blowing pillars.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.200
 Basically, like a big cot, you just blow into the pillar, and it makes it, it's like an

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:16.000
 all-compire for a, like a conch, so like a recorder, like a recorder, yeah, or trump it,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.960
 or a, we can all name, we can all master it.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.360
 Did you read about the temple in Japan, where it's, it's got 1,000 steps, and step number

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.760
 27 is always wet and mossy, and the other steps are fine.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.760
 And do we know why?

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.560
 The legend is that somebody died there, but they're probably a springer, a natural spring

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.560
 under the step.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.080
 But they're all dry apart from one.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.200
 27 club moss.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.080
 That is a tortured joke.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:49.520
 That's the worst I've ever, oh no, I'm really, it's not even top 100.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.680
 You have to go through about 1,000 steps to get to that joke.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680
 Beautiful.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680
 Beautiful.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680
 There we go.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680
 Big.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680
 The big, the movie.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680
 The big piano.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.680
 Yeah.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.680
 It's a brilliant film.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.680
 I hadn't, so I hadn't seen it for years and years and years.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680
 I watched it last night.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.680
 Oh.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.680
 It's a lucky dog.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.680
 It's so good.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.400
 I think it's slightly problematic, but I think it was probably problematic at the time.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.880
 I think there is, there is a bit with people tend to gloss over.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.800
 The fact that it's a 30 year old boy who then has sex with a full grown woman.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.400
 Or be it in Tom Hanks' body.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.520
 Oh, yeah, that is, that's, that's an interesting psychological question.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.240
 Is it definite or is it implied or is it, I don't know, I don't know, I'll show it as

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240
 it's you.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.440
 But it is a brilliant film though.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.440
 It's really good.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.440
 It is good.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.280
 It might have been known to be problematic at the time.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.240
 Is because there's an actor called Deborah Winger and she was originally considered to be the

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.320
 main actress in this movie.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.600
 She couldn't take the part because she was pregnant, but she knew the director and she

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.360
 said to the director, why don't we switch the gender and have it as a girl who becomes

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:58.560
 big and the director said, well, then you've got a teenage girl having sex with an adult

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.120
 man or be it in your body.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.280
 They realized that that was problematic.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.800
 They didn't make that extra step that it was all problematic, but that was the 80s volume.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
 It was the 80s.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.480
 And so it's got an amazing behind the scenes crew on it.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.880
 So it was co-written by Anne Spielberg, who is Steven Spielberg's sister.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.960
 And Steven Spielberg was originally asked to direct it, wanted to direct it, but then

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.120
 he thought, this will probably take away from my sister's role in it, she'll be shadowed

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120
 by it.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.440
 So it went to Penny Marshall, who's a brilliant director.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.920
 And that scene with the piano was because it existed in that shop you mentioned, FAO Schwartz

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.320
 in America.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.020
 And Spielberg was in there, saw it and immediately ran back saying, we've got to write this into

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.020
 it now.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.020
 This is just going to be a game changer.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.400
 I mean, what a weird insight to think that this is going to make the movie, which it kind

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.240
 of did in terms of its cultural footprint.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240
 Yeah.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.720
 Also with that Anne Spielberg never did anything else, called it sure.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.640
 I am DB, yeah, she's just one or two little things, but nothing you've heard of.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.680
 I guess she was cancelled after the whole 13-year-old boy sleep.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.680
 No, no.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.680
 No.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.680
 No.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.800
 Interestingly about the 13-year-old boy, Tom Hanks really thought, how am I going to act like

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.680
 I'm a 13-year-old boy inside the body of an adult?

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.520
 And one story goes quite a few stories of how it was filmed.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.920
 One story suggests that the little boy, who was actually playing the kid, would do all

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.480
 the scenes that Tom Hanks would watch the scenes with him doing it.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.520
 And then he would emulate what the boy was doing then in the scene just to really get it.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.400
 Something he did with Forest Gump as well, emulated the character of the kid to create the

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.760
 role of Forest Gump, the adult.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.240
 I watched it, like I said last night, and I had read that as well, and you can kind of see

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.920
 if that's true, you can kind of see it.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.200
 Like the one point he sort of dismantles this toy, and he does it in exactly the same way

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200
 a child would do.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.560
 And you think, either he's a brilliant actor or he copied a child, or both.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.320
 How have you seen, so what are my favourite bodies for films?

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320
 Is Jumanji welcome to the jungle?

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320
 How are you seeing Jack Black playing?

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.320
 I have 14-year-old guys.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320
 So good.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320
 They're such solid films.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320
 That's so good.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.560
 A friend of the podcast, Restorby, in that one.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.240
 No one swaps his body, though, do they?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.240
 No.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.440
 No, he's the welcome to Jumanji's character when they arrive in the game.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.040
 I wouldn't want his mind in my body restarting, no, you can't give him coverage.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.640
 Big was the fourth body swap movie released in eight months.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.640
 Oh.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.640
 Isn't that, like...

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.480
 Is that Original Freaky Friday time?

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 It was...

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480
 There were three...

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.080
 The three others that preceded it were called "Like Father Like Son," "Vice Versa," and

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.680
 "18" again.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680
 And just...

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680
 This was this...

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680
 She'd rationally...

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.240
 Like, we think of it as one of the archetypal bodies for movies, along with things like

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.080
 "Freaky Friday" and "13 Going Up 30."

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.080
 But it was...

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.240
 It was just following this very long tradition.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.240
 People like it.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240
 It's often what happens in Hollywood, isn't it?

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.920
 You are Armageddon in "Deep Ed Packed" at the same time.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.240
 There's movies sort of a rhyme.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.640
 Vincent Bugs Life at the same time.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.640
 But I think "Vice Versa" is the...

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.000
 There was a novel called "Vice Versa," and we might have mentioned that on this before.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.600
 I think that's what it was based on.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.880
 Just going back to the keyboard, they play a couple of different songs on there.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.600
 One of them is "Chopsticks."

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.120
 So you know "Chopsticks" is what you'd like...

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.200
 One of the first things you learn as a kid.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.360
 Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.080
 Do you know who wrote "Chopsticks"?

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080
 Oh!

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.080
 It's the one you've never heard of, so...

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:25.440
 Oh, that's... Oh, it was written by Mozart's sister.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440
 What?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.440
 Yep.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.560
 Mozart Allen, his sister, Euphonia Allen, wrote that.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.520
 She's called Euphonia.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.640
 She's named after an instrument.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.040
 Well, she's named after the Greek for "Beautiful Voice."

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.160
 Well, so Euphonia, isn't it?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.240
 And he was named Mozart because their parents was really into music of what his kids could be really musical.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.040
 Are you allowed to do it?

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.720
 I guess it's like getting in early with you.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.760
 It's like calling a child tennis champion, isn't it?

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.640
 It's just kind of how your colors to the math early.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.880
 Well, this was...

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.200
 We're talking 1870s.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.160
 It was quite a long time ago to be given your kids wacky names.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160
 Yeah.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:00.840
 I think...

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.120
 I mean, I say that as a parent of someone with a relatively uncommon name,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.920
 but he was like a famous dance choreographer.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.400
 Decided he wanted his kids to get into music.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.200
 Called his daughter Euphonia, she wrote "Chopsticks."

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.200
 Called his son Mozart, and he went into music production.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.040
 Right.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.040
 Oh, yeah?

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040
 Does she...

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.040
 Is it like Happy Birthday where she's still...

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.040
 It's in copyright.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.040
 It will be out, I guess, by now, but she must have...

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.040
 It's well out of copyright.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.280
 She wrote it when she was like 15 or something.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280
 Right.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280
 Do you...

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.280
 Any of you recognize the name "Berimo Serrachini"?

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280
 Not the way you say it.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.280
 It's nice.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.280
 I've got something written down in my notes.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.280
 "Berimo Serrachini."

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.280
 Ramos Serrachini?

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280
 Yeah.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280
 Maybe Serrachini.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280
 Yeah.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.800
 It could be anything who even knows.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.800
 But he was the inventor of that great piano that we see in big.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.800
 Amazing character.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.760
 He was born in 1935 in Italy.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.040
 He was an inventor ever since a child.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.080
 He had a really interesting moment where he made a kite from a poster of Mussolini when he

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.040
 was a kid, which resulted in a visit from the secret police.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040
 Give him a minute.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.040
 You can't string up Mussolini like that.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040
 That will see.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040
 Yeah.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.400
 They gave him an official warning about anti-fascist activity.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400
 I apologize.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.120
 The people at home couldn't see my nod of approval that I gave to that joke.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.680
 It's not fair, because we take the piss when you do bad ones.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680
 Yeah, it's true.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680
 Yeah, I can't wear snow-winning.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680
 I'll keep doing.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.680
 Yeah.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.680
 Yeah, no.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680
 Amazing inventor.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.680
 He made this piano.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680
 He made lots of different gadgets.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.360
 He made this incredible one, which was a stethoscope, stereosystem.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.320
 So basically, you could dance to the rhythm of your own heartbeat.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.120
 A lot of inventions were to do with touch, body, and voice.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120
 Problem.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120
 Yeah.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.280
 Put in the stethoscope to your heartbeat.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.560
 You're dancing.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.560
 You get a bit more energetic, because you're dancing.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.080
 Your heartbeat gets faster.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.360
 You dance faster.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.520
 You get more energetic.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.160
 Your heart gets faster still.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.160
 What is it, Ed?

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.160
 This thing has killed two popes.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160
 Little nine facts.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.720
 But, Dan, did you say his origin was working where he was between 1965 and 1969?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720
 No, I didn't.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720
 He was a rocket scientist.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.880
 He was working for NASA, working on the reentry systems, their electronics.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.800
 He's really a proper, you know, really skilled engineer.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.640
 He has invented some musical stairs as well, just to bring us back to the temple.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.640
 So, yeah, cool guy.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.640
 Very cool guy.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.640
 If you guys tried the Stinging Lift at the South Park Centre.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.640
 No.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.640
 I have.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.640
 It's so great.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640
 It's awesome.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.640
 It's saying stuff.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640
 But what do you do?

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640
 You just choose your floor.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.640
 Yeah.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.640
 And then it goes up.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640
 It goes up.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.640
 It goes up.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.640
 It goes up.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640
 It goes up.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640
 Level three.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640
 It's so great.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.640
 So it is done by Martin Creed, who won the Turner Prize.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.640
 And it follows the scale.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.640
 And then it sings your floor to you.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640
 So next time you're there.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.640
 What happens if the lift gets stuck?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.600
 Does it have to sustain the note?

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600
 And you just hear it say a breath.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600
 I haven't been stuck in it.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.400
 It's like I'm personally saying.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400
 You just hear it go.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.400
 Oh, my God.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400
 Oh, my God.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.400
 Oh, my God.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.920
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.120
 And that is my fact.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.600
 My fact this week is that three months after Alex Honald became the first person ever to free

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.560
 solo climb El Capitan, his mum became the oldest woman to ever climb it.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560
 This is stunning.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560
 That's amazing.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560
 Yeah.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.560
 It's a cool family.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560
 Yeah.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.560
 So this is Alex Honald.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.560
 This was an Oscar-winning documentary made with National Geographic.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.880
 The New York Times called what he did, one of the greatest athletic feats of any kind ever.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.320
 He free climbed, which means no ropes.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:34.480
 It's just his hands his feet climbing up a 2,900 foot root of a mountain face.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.960
 Like no one had ever done it before.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:42.640
 No one has done it since and this was in 2017, three months later, his mum, not doing a free

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.680
 solo climb, but you can also climb El Capitan via the actual root, which goes through.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.680
 Exactly.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.680
 Made it up herself.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680
 Three months later.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680
 Amazing.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.680
 Become the oldest person.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680
 Yeah.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680
 She's called Didri.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680
 She is incredible.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680
 Didri.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.680
 Volovnik.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680
 Volovnich.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.680
 She's called Didri.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.680
 OK.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.680
 She's stunning.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.920
 She did the lurking fear root to get to the top, because all these roots have different weird

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.920
 names.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.920
 Reassuring names.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920
 I think even the first to climb.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920
 You get to name.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.920
 Yeah, reassuring.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.920
 Exactly.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.320
 And has anyone seen the film?

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.320
 No.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320
 It's seen a trailer.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.840
 It's unbelievably exciting.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.440
 And you sort of know that he doesn't die because they released the film.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440
 Yeah.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440
 But can I ask a question?

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.960
 Are we certain that there wasn't some body swath between Didri and Alex and that he

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.760
 climbed up it in her body?

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.920
 That's a great premise for a film.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.080
 He was there to help her climb up it, I think, when she did.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.720
 So that would have to be her in his body.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.240
 I feel like we're focusing on the wrong thing.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.240
 It's an amazing climb.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.240
 It's an amazing climb.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.000
 El Capitan is this huge, it's like a sheer face of granite.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 I've been there.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Have you?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Yes.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 Did you free climb?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Did you take the lurking fear root?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Did you start?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 No.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.840
 I was a good few meters away from the base.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.200
 We're just far enough back that I could see the whole thing.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.200
 Right.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.200
 It's terrifying.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.200
 It is.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.200
 Absolutely terrifying.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.560
 And even the root that she took is very hard.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.200
 Now what's extraordinary is she did this at age 66, but she only started to learn climbing

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.000
 age 60.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.720
 She taught herself to swim at age 40.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.800
 So this is someone who is quite a late bloomer in general sporting.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.800
 And then she went on to break the record again, breaking her own record, age 70, climbed

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.120
 at a second time, age 70, and she did it with a foot injury as well.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.920
 It's because those whole family is nuts.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.920
 Absolutely nuts.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920
 She's a really impressive woman.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920
 She's run marathon.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.920
 She's conducted orchestras.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.920
 She's been a publisher, you know, professor of five languages.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.200
 And when they climbed El Capitan together the first time, he said, okay, well, we'll do it.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.240
 You know, we'll just go up and down.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.560
 So they took about 19 hours.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.880
 He said, that's a reasonable time.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880
 He did not tell her.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.680
 Normally, people take four days to do this for you say said, right, come on, man, let's

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680
 just...

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680
 We've got a day.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.680
 Yeah.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680
 They're absolutely bananas.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680
 It's amazing.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.080
 She says that when he was a child, he was climbing on pitch appliances before he turned

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080
 to.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.120
 So she knew he was going to become a climber.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.960
 But I would say that's pretty much old kids.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960
 That's true.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960
 Yeah.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.960
 That's true.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.960
 Yeah.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.960
 It's just like climbing on stuff, right?

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.160
 It's a pretty, it's a pretty amazing story.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.320
 And I don't know how much Andy, this is shown in the documentary.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.560
 But he basically had climbed up this route multiple times before, but with ropes.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.200
 So this was the first time he was trying it on his own, and he memorized the entire route.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.160
 He knew exactly where his hand was going at every single point as he was going up.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.560
 And once he finished it, you would think, probably, okay, let's step away now.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.640
 Let's go home and thank our lucky stars that nothing bad happened.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640
 What did he do?

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.040
 Well, because it was a documentary and they needed extra shots.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.080
 He spent five more days recliming certain sections of it so that he could get better drone

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080
 shots.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080
 For pickups.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.720
 Can I just say he does wear sticky shoes?

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.720
 What?

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720
 He wears sticky shoes.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.280
 Well, it's a special kind of sticky rubber that helps you, especially if you can't really

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.040
 get much of a grip with your fingers.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.360
 Because you're basically on with your fingernails.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.320
 It just means that you're not going to, he's not wearing brogues.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.320
 He's not wearing...

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.320
 Right.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.320
 He didn't even do it in brogues.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.120
 He was even a wreck all the time.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.120
 But in my head, he was like, you know Batman from the old 70s shows where he just walks

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.120
 sideways up a wall.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.520
 It just goes horizontal, yeah, it just walks up it.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.520
 Yeah.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.560
 No, you see him in the film, he makes all these notes because you just have to study the route

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.560
 so much.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.640
 And you have to say like, this is good if you've got two fingers and you just need to hold

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.240
 your weight on two fingers while you get your foot across here.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.480
 So it's incredibly detailed them mapping out.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.480
 And it's...

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.480
 It's...

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.440
 You might leave a chalk mark to say like, put hand here.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.080
 It's absolutely terrifying.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080
 And you often...

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.640
 He ends up hanging by one or two fingers above this, this absolutely insane drop.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.640
 And I listen to it, I listen to an interview with him recently because he was talking about

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.640
 his attitude to risk.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.960
 And he says, I actually don't think I am a high risk person.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.760
 He says, I am a low risk person in lots of ways.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.640
 The individual climbing moves I make are very, they're low risk, but they are high consequence.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640
 Yeah.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640
 I see.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.880
 He doesn't seem to feel fit.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880
 No.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.120
 It's like doing Russian roulette with 1,000 chambers and one bullet.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.720
 Like you're probably not going to shoot yourself, but the one in 1,000 chavs of you losing,

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720
 that's it, it's all over.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720
 Yeah.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.440
 He kind of said that actually the most worrying thing when he does these climbs is not

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.680
 the climb itself, but it's all the extra things going on around him.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:35.160
 So while he was climbing El Capitan, there was someone at the top doing a tightrope walk.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.160
 And so there were people yelling to the person doing the tightrope walk and he's like,

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.240
 oh my gosh, really distracting. He says the drones that were coming up to him and filming him

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.960
 sounded like he was being attacked by wasps and he was also going, what if they lose control

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960
 of it?

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.960
 And this blade just comes in.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.960
 It was a big drone.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.920
 So for him, it was all the extra stuff that was quite worrying about the climb.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.600
 Oh, and I love that he listens to music while he's doing it.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.240
 Do you know who he listens to?

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240
 No.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.240
 Can we guess?

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240
 Oh, it's a genre.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.240
 Is it fallen by Alicia Keys?

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.240
 Really?

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.240
 That's band.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240
 That's it.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.240
 It's rock.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240
 Rock.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.240
 Ah.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240
 It's very cool.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.240
 His fingers.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240
 You see a lot of them in the film.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240
 They're just like sausages.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.240
 Are they?

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.240
 They're amazing.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.240
 They're very, very strong.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.240
 Right.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240
 Not exactly like sausages.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.240
 I don't think of sausages as strong.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.800
 Oh, you don't go to the restaurant, so I go to.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.440
 But like, I would thought you might need quite thin fingers like to get into the crevices.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.800
 He does not have the slim fingers of piano player.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.280
 He's got powerful fingers that you can dangle from half an hour at a time.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.280
 Hold the whole man above.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280
 Yeah.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.600
 He said the thing he scared of more was giving a TED Talk about his climb than actually doing

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.000
 the climbing himself.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.320
 I had a look for some other parent and child record breakers.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320
 Oh, right.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.600
 I really enjoyed Charlotte and Nikki Bart, Australian mother and daughter.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.720
 First mother and daughter to climb Everest together in 2008 and being Australian.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.640
 They framed by dragging weights up and down one by beach to replicate sled and stringing

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.640
 ladders across swimming pools and up trees.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.640
 Wow.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.640
 Then they went under loads of other peaks.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.160
 This seems to have felt some filings, I really have adrenaline and stuff in their field.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.160
 I also found the record for the father and son marathon runners and their combined time

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.720
 is pretty respectable for a single person for five hours, which is not bad.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.880
 And the dad was a three minutes faster than his son.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.960
 So did they, they didn't run it together together?

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.960
 They ran at the same time.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.840
 So the son in two hours, 31, dad, two hours, 27.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840
 Right.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.840
 Lovely.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:34.120
 He was a panel like supposedly he has something to do with his amygdala and his brain.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.280
 Did you guys read that?

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280
 No.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:42.040
 So his amygdala, which is the part of your brain, which when you see something scary, it's

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.120
 what makes you run away or makes you fight.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.560
 Apparently, when he sees disturbing images, his amygdala doesn't fire as much as normal people.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:57.040
 And that might be the reason why he's perfectly willing to do these incredibly stupid things.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.480
 I mean, even though he does have sticky shoes, I don't think I would.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.360
 Sticky shoes, I can't believe that.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.120
 James has knocking down the chair.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.120
 He's not trying to.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.120
 He's not trying to hear this.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120
 Yeah.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.800
 And I believe that was part of the documentary.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.920
 I don't remember that scene, Andy, but he goes into an MRI and they show him scary images

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.400
 and it doesn't register.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.400
 Yeah.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.280
 He's living, he's living in his van for the whole thing.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280
 It's really interesting.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.120
 Well, we don't really know what happens when humans amygdala stops working.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.520
 They've done in the 30s.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.080
 They did some experiments on monkeys.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.840
 And they removed the amygdala and the monkey started approaching snakes and like batting them

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.120
 around like sticks and playing with them.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:40.200
 And we do have one patient called patient SM, who had a condition called lipoid protinosis

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.320
 where there were holes in her amygdala.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.400
 And she was like relatively normal, but they did find that on one instance, she walked

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:53.080
 through a park alone at night, was attacked by a man with a knife and then the following

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.960
 day walked again through the same park because her amygdala wasn't working.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.960
 Right.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.120
 He seems very normal when you hear him talk though.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120
 He's a young dad.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.240
 He's got two young kids, so I listened to an interview because he's got his own podcast

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.200
 now since the last few years.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200
 He interviews mountaineers.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200
 Oh my God.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200
 Let's get him on fish.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.200
 Yeah.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.200
 Wouldn't it be wonderful?

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.200
 He's a great speaker.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.040
 And David Lenneman was saying, would you ever consider stopping this now because you're

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040
 a father?

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.840
 And he's like, no, because it's to me, it's calculated risk.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.400
 Can we get him on when I'm not here because I don't want him to like, I was joking about

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400
 the stick and shoes.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.400
 Yeah.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400
 Is it true?

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.360
 You also use chalk on your fingers, because there's another mountain that he freesolved,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.760
 which is called Zion's moonlight buttress.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.640
 And it's a 1,200 foot mountain.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.000
 And when he did it, no one believed him for a few days after it.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.680
 Even though this is, you know, half the size of El Capitan, and do you know why no one believed

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680
 him?

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680
 Rainy.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.680
 Because he's a big old liar.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680
 Okay.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:59.040
 James, give us your holiday dates and we'll make sure Alex can do it.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:04.800
 It was because he, he, he, he ascended it on April the 1st and no one thought that it

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800
 was real.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.080
 And for the days after it was, yeah, they were convinced it was a prank.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.720
 Can I give you some climbing lingo and see if you can guess what I mean?

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720
 Yes, please.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.120
 You're arms are too far back.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120
 That's nice.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120
 Close.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.920
 I'm thinking like bingo wings, which is a phrase for, you know, your arms if they're a bit

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920
 out of shape.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.320
 Is it that your arms are juttering because you're so tired?

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320
 Okay.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320
 Good guess.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.280
 Now, it's a jamming technique where you bend your arm, insert your arm into a crack elbow

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.280
 first.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.120
 And then that sort of jams you so you can climb up the wall.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120
 They are insane.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120
 These people.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120
 They are absolutely insane.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120
 A pindex.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.120
 Oh, I know this one.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.320
 If your span of your arms is longer than you are tall, isn't it?

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.920
 Well, it is, is the ratio of your arms to your, your height.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920
 Yeah.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.440
 So if you have a high a pindex, then you would be as you.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440
 Yeah.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.440
 I've mentioned mine.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.440
 I've got a positive a pindex.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.440
 How do you?

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.960
 My finger tip to finger tip is more than my height.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.960
 Really?

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.960
 Yeah.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960
 Now, that's useful for some climbers.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.960
 Oh, good.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.960
 Hey, go on, Nick.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.960
 And flapper.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:11.480
 It's if you climb, um, but you climb using a elaborate feather boa and string of

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.400
 pearls as you're only in the 20s.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.400
 In the 20s.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400
 Yeah.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400
 It's not that.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.680
 It is when a large chunk of skin is ripped off your body, usually during a dynamic move.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680
 A dynamic move.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.680
 These people are crazy.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.680
 A dynamic move.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.680
 Sliding.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.680
 You do get ripped up, don't you?

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.080
 He wore long trousers and a t-shirt, um, but a lot of people might go topless or they might

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:37.120
 go, um, well, we need to poo when he's trying to get that honey.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.120
 Doesn't.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.120
 That's a great remake.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.120
 I'd love to watch.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.360
 Um, can I give you some, uh, root names?

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.360
 Yes.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.880
 Because if you climb a root first, you often get to name it and there are different rules

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.600
 in different bits of the world about, you know, all of that, like some of them are a bit

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.360
 more stonky and official, but, um, there's the excellent adventure.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.560
 It's a nice, bell and dead reference, um, too big to flail.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.560
 Very good.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.600
 One blunder, and it's six feet under.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.600
 Scar trek.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600
 The next laceration.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600
 I like these.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600
 I like these names.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600
 They're very good.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600
 But no one else does.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600
 No, no, no, no.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600
 They're wonderful.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.960
 Because they're the fun way of saying, you're probably going to die.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960
 Yeah.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.760
 But let's all have a laugh before you do.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.440
 It feels to me like they're adding jeopardy to something that doesn't need it in the first

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440
 place.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.440
 Maybe.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.320
 You know, this thing is obviously very big and scary to climb.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.160
 You don't have to call it L, shit yourself.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.160
 Yes.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.160
 Okay.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.160
 Well, have a guess.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.560
 See if you can guess what's special about the widow's tears root.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.680
 There's a specific clue in that name, widow's tears.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.920
 Well, when they sound, they're allowed to climb it.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.920
 No.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.920
 I know.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.920
 Yeah.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.480
 I read more of the mindset to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.480
 Yeah.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.480
 Much like making panatoni.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480
 I just...

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.480
 Okay.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480
 It's time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480
 Yeah.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.480
 Much like making panatoni.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.480
 I just...

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.480
 Okay.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480
 It is time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480
 Yeah.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480
 Much like making panatoni.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.480
 I just...

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480
 Okay.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480
 It is time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:58.480
 Yeah.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480
 Much like making panatoni.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480
 I just...

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480
 Okay.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:09.440
 It is time for our final fact to the show and that is Andy.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.360
 My fact is, when the post office had a competition to name the post office's new tower, star suggestions

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:22.200
 included, Prince Philip's finger, the eye full tower, monstrosity and spud.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.040
 The name eventually chosen was the post office tower.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.040
 Brilliant.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.040
 Did they...

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.040
 Did they...

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.040
 Was the post office tower one that someone sent in?

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.040
 Do you know?

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.040
 No.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040
 I think it was the...

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.040
 Internally, like the post office of...

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040
 It's just...

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.040
 Because this was a staff competition.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.040
 But there was a 10-hand prize.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.040
 So it was a 10-hand prize?

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.040
 So it was a 10-hand prize?

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040
 Do you know?

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.040
 It probably just went...

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040
 Was plowed back into the system.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040
 I suppose.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.040
 I should tell you where I got this fact.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.040
 There's a really exciting trip I got to do recently.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.720
 I got to go to the BT archive, which is on Holman.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.720
 It's not far from the office and it's a stunning place.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.280
 I just want to give a shout out to the very kind curators there who showed me around.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.280
 It was amazing.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.280
 It showed me the handwritten list of the finalist entries from this competition.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.280
 Wow.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.080
 And for international listeners, the post office tower is this massive great tower in West

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.960
 London and it was the tallest building in Britain for ages and it's all for phone calls

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.360
 and TV channels and communications and all of that.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.160
 And it's got this really interesting history and they had this competition to name it.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.160
 And...

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.160
 Yeah.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.680
 If you've ever been to London, it's that very odd looking, like a big staff.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.680
 Like it's not a building.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.680
 It's not very wide.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.480
 It's very skinny and it's a very iconic thing in London.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.480
 You will have seen it if you...

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480
 Well, I was a kid.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.480
 It was the tallest building in London.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.480
 Was it right?

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.880
 I think, or it had just stopped being, but if you bought a Guinness Book of Records, an old

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.880
 one from a charity shop, it would say that it was the tallest building in London.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.880
 Right.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.480
 And it's just turned 60 this year.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.880
 So yeah, big anniversary.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880
 And that's very cool, Andy.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880
 You got to see that list.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.880
 Oh, it was awesome.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.680
 Did you tell you about the cafe because I'm obsessed with the cafe at the top?

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.480
 Was there a rotating cafe at the top?

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480
 It's crazy.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:02.160
 I'm so sad that you can't go and visit that because I also didn't realise I assumed the whole

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160
 thing rotated.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.440
 But I read that if the waiters didn't, like, if your table would, like, go past and it'd

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.360
 like run off to you or wait for you to come back, like, with your next course, if they

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.360
 got the timings wrong.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360
 Really?

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360
 Yeah.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360
 It took 23 minutes to go round.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.160
 But the central bit, obviously, it doesn't, it can't all rotate.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.160
 I assumed it altered.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.160
 Yeah.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.160
 Well, so your table would go like...

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.880
 I've been to a few of those and they do all rotate.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.880
 Do they?

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880
 Yeah.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.920
 The system in the middle that's turning stuff around is enclosed, right?

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:34.960
 No, here, there is the kitchens and the waiters bit, as you say, Anne, is stationary and

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.160
 the waiter has to carefully step onto the moving bit.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.200
 Yeah, we don't really get rotating restaurants anymore.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.960
 Like, there are very 60s and 70s things built, I think.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:45.960
 There was one in Liverpool.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.960
 I don't know if it's still there.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.640
 I don't think it rotates anymore.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.640
 Okay.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.640
 Yeah, there was one in Hong Kong.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.640
 I used to go to growing up.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.640
 Maybe on a Vienna as well.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.640
 It's like a new effect for the view.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.520
 Yeah, it's a wonderful idea.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.760
 Mentioning the restaurant is really interesting because you would expect, as the post office

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.600
 tower, which had a genuine reason to exist.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.720
 It was helping with communications throughout Britain.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.600
 It was this beacon of communication.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.120
 But very randomly, they did open a restaurant that was available to the public and which was

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.120
 run by Butland.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.120
 I think I heard about Butland.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.120
 Yeah.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.120
 Yeah, so weird.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.160
 And it feels like this was the original London eye because everything was sort of designed

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.160
 to have the...

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.160
 A tourist spot.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.160
 A tourist spot.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.440
 You know, you went in the elevator, which was the fastest in Britain, supposedly at the time.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.440
 You would go up.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.400
 The ushers who would put you in there were termed space flight conductors.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400
 You know, they...

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.240
 And when you go to London eye, it's pretty similar wordage when it was run by B.A.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.400
 You know, that they would use.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.840
 And yeah, about 50,000 people visited it in the first few weeks alone and one and a half

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.280
 million in the first year.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.080
 And one of the people who went there was the Queen.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.840
 Queen Liz for the second who went for dinner with Billy Butland.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840
 Really?

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.520
 Could we say why it was set up?

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.520
 Absolutely.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.520
 I suppose it was Tower.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.520
 Yeah.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.520
 So I didn't know this really.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.680
 But basically, there was this big need for more broadcasting capacity.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.680
 And they had two options.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.440
 They could either do it with underground cables, which would be a lot neater, but would involve

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.400
 a lot more mess putting them in because you basically have to dig up the route into central

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.160
 London or loads of routes into central London, like huge pain to do.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.880
 Or you just use a radio tower that's so tall that the beams don't get interrupted

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880
 by existing buildings.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.280
 And they literally just had to build something higher than they used microwave radio channels.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.280
 That was the big thing.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.200
 So let make people make phone calls, did it?

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.200
 It was phone calls and TV channels, so it could handle 150,000 phone calls simultaneously

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.800
 and 40 TV channels.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.880
 So it was a big improvement on the previous system.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.840
 And it was covered in these big things called microwave horns, which is these huge triangular

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.840
 blocks.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:44.480
 And basically, just to absorb and soak up microwave signals, it's such a cool thing.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.480
 Yeah.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.480
 Love it.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:52.680
 It's called Eric Bedford, who is the chief architect of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:59.240
 And he made it, he said, to be sort of nuclear proof, which kind of got a little test when

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.680
 a bomb went off in the bathroom of the restaurant, which is the reason it's no longer open to

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.680
 the public.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.680
 Wasn't that nuclear bomb?

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.680
 We should say.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680
 We should add that.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680
 Yeah.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680
 That's a good detail to add.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680
 Absolutely.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.680
 Yeah.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.680
 It was a regular bomb.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.680
 No one died.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.000
 Cars and buildings around it had their windows go in.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.240
 And it was the IRA.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.240
 What did it?

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.240
 Apparently.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.240
 The Angry Brigade.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:27.000
 Well, I think we think it was the IRA because it had all the hallmarks of an IRA attack.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.360
 And the IRA also said that they did it.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.800
 But then there was also this group called the Angry Gade, who was like a left wing anarchist

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.800
 group.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.280
 Then they also said they did it.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.720
 But I think the general consensus is that the angry people sort of jumped on the chance

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.360
 of claiming it for themselves.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.040
 It's much easier, isn't it?

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.720
 To claim you've committed a big attack than to actually go to all the hassle of planning

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.720
 and conducting it.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.720
 Yeah.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.480
 You are reliant on other people to do the work for you.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480
 Yeah.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480
 It's not a reliable gig.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480
 No.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.120
 This is why it was an official secret for so long that we're actually was.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.120
 That's also...

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.120
 Would that explain that more?

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.800
 Because that's so fascinating.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.960
 You can't miss this tower.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.960
 Yeah.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960
 It's in Central London.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.160
 It's towering above everything else, yet it didn't officially exist.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160
 Yeah.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.160
 Maybe you saw your trip.

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.160
 I see it debunked a bit.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.240
 I feel like you couldn't put it on an ordinary and sorry map, but you could.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.160
 But I think you weren't supposed to say where it was, but it was really, really big.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.640
 It was definitely up and everywhere.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.320
 It was on some ardent survey maps, but not all of them.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320
 It's really weird.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.320
 Yeah.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.720
 And there was this theory, or there's this long-held thing that you couldn't take a photo

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.120
 of it legally, or you'd be arrested if you took a photo of one of the biggest landmarks

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.960
 in literally the tallest thing in the country.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:40.580
 I think what is true is if you took a photo of it and gave it to an enemy of Britain,

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.580
 you could get done for it.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.580
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.580
 I think that's fair.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.740
 And that's true of anything that's used for communications in the UK.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.180
 Any building that makes stuff for the Navy.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.940
 There's a whole load of list of things that you're just not allowed to take photos of it

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.940
 and give it to Russia.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.940
 So are they?

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940
 Are they like below the Google maps then?

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.940
 I don't know.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.660
 Because I remember when I went to Dartmore years ago, this is in the ordnance of the

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.660
 map.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.660
 This is a big block in the middle, and just say, I don't know.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.660
 But literally the post office had issued stamps of this thing.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.660
 Yeah.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.660
 Well, it was built.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.460
 I mean, it was, it was definitely, yeah, it was built up there.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:15.660
 It was, I think, part of a communications network that was kind of a Cold War thing, which

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.260
 was why Bedford had supposedly designed it to be nuclear bomb proof.

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.860
 I mean, it's clearly not nuclear bomb proof, depending on how close the bomb goes off,

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:22.860
 but whatever.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.260
 But in the event of a nuclear war, I think it would have been part of the backbone system

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.260
 to provide secure communications.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.620
 I don't think it's needed anymore now.

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.620
 I do.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.340
 So you can, if you'd like, take a photo and hand it to Britain's enemies.

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.340
 I like Danza.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.340
 Don't, don't.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.340
 I mean, don't.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.340
 You know.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:42.020
 Danza, yeah, if they had sold it as, like, more as the London Eye, because maybe the London

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.740
 Eye's got a purpose we don't know about.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.740
 Oh, 100%.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.740
 Really?

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.740
 That's such a good point.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.740
 Yeah, obviously.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.740
 Hundie pay.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.740
 Obviously.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.740
 Really?

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.740
 They sold one and a half thousand plastic towers when they first opened in the gift shop

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.740
 in the first few weeks.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.740
 Oh, that makes sense.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:55.740
 This is so cool.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.740
 Yeah, it makes sense.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.740
 Like, what else?

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.740
 Like, if you're going to hide it in plain sight, you have to give it another purpose.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.740
 All of those will have made their way to Moscow for further study.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.740
 I presume.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:03.740
 Like, yeah.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:04.740
 It's a secret.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.740
 Oh, we are selling skill models in the gift shop.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.740
 They've had teams of tiny, tiny, tiny spies looking at those in detail.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:14.140
 It appears that the post office tower was made in Taiwan.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.100
 And the London Eye clearly is designed to come off the central spoke and roll.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.700
 Yeah, it's a giant youth cycle.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.340
 Yeah, it's to get, like, all the most important people in London out.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.940
 Oh, so they each get in a pod.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:26.940
 You dismantle it.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:27.940
 And then it rolls out.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.940
 And then it just rolls down the Thames into the sea.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.940
 Yeah, exactly.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:31.940
 So, yes, really.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.940
 Yes, sorry.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:39.940
 And the final piece of cement on the post office tower was laid by Geoffrey Rippon MP.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.940
 At the top, right at the bottom, at the top.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.940
 I would say unloom to the pod.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:44.940
 Unknown to the pub.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.940
 It's never been on.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.940
 He was our chief negotiator to the EEC in the 1970s.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.940
 So you say, how are you?

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.940
 I mean Britain's not.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:52.940
 We didn't fish.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.940
 We're not negotiating with the EEC.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.940
 We haven't been in that long.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:55.940
 We haven't.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.940
 And the one thing I read about him from his old b*tchery is he had an enduring dislike

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:01.940
 of the d*tch.

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:02.940
 Oh.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:03.940
 Oh.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.940
 That's in the obituary.

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.940
 God, that's really got to be enduring if it's in the obituary.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.940
 It's amazing.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:11.940
 So he was negotiating.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.940
 And everyone had told him that the d*tch loved the British.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.940
 And Charles De Gaulle said, you have a d*tchery always on the British side.

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.940
 But then when they did negotiating, the d*tchery actually quite against the British.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.940
 And he really took that to his grave.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.940
 He really hated the d*tch.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.940
 Wow.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:26.940
 It's just so random.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:27.940
 Gosh.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.940
 Apologies to our d*tch listeners.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.940
 Secret buildings.

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:31.940
 Yeah.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:32.940
 Just as the first of a tower is this big secret thing.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.940
 And I know you're very much into your espionage.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.940
 Not to say too much.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:37.940
 Not to say too much.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:38.940
 Not to say too much.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:39.940
 Not to say too much.

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:40.940
 Not to give too much away.

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:46.940
 But you've had to come from across the river to make the recording.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.940
 And does not show up on any photos, any maps.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.940
 She's just blurred.

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:55.940
 For listeners, Andy was touching his nose suggestively throughout the last two minutes.

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.940
 I think that can be heard.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.940
 I think that can be literally heard.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:06.940
 So Voxel Cross, which is the building, the very famous head of the secret intelligence service.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.940
 The one that's on the South Bank of the Thames.

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.940
 The one that's on the South Bank of the Thames.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.940
 You see it in James Bond?

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.940
 Yeah.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.940
 It's a bit of it gets blown up in that film.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.940
 One of the one of the Daniel Craig ones.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.940
 It's a terrific building.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.940
 It looks really straight.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.940
 Yeah.

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.940
 You know, it looks quite striking.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:23.940
 But I really like this.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.940
 So basically, there were some clues that it was going to be a secret building.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.940
 Because the government bought the site outright for 135 million quid.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.940
 Normally, they would pay in chunks and there would be total accountability and transparency at every stage.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:40.940
 And the government just said, no, we're going to buy this for 130 million quid.

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:41.940
 Right.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.940
 No questions.

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.940
 Go away, please.

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.940
 Yeah, exactly.

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.940
 But the architect was a guy called Terry Farrell.

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.940
 And he just died.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.940
 He did loads of stuff.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.940
 He also did the HQ for ITV's TVAM.

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.940
 So he's done some big gigs.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.940
 Which they built the building, not purpose built.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.940
 And they just said, we'll have this.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:57.940
 This is the crazy thing.

00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:58.940
 Yeah.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.940
 He was basically instructed to build a standard office block, which then was going to get some more of a case.

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.940
 It's like, yeah, it can blast up.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940
 Roll down the tent.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:07.940
 Roll down the tent.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.940
 Yeah, exactly.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:13.940
 The London I will pour at the MI6.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.940
 Pick everyone up.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.940
 That's pod 12.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.940
 No, but he didn't know who he was working for really.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.940
 He knew he was making a government department.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.940
 And he guessed it was going to be the department of the environment.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:28.940
 Which is why, if you look closely, which you're not allowed to do, there are lots of fir tree designs.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.940
 Halfway at the facade of the edge.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.940
 Because he thought it was going to be the environment ministry.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.940
 How presumptuous.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:37.940
 I've been to the to the bottom to the outside of that building.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.940
 It was quite fun when you look for a Wi-Fi.

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:42.940
 It says things like MI6 surveillance van.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:46.940
 And it's obviously local people who live in the area who just name their things.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.940
 Is it?

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:48.940
 Is it double bluff?

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:49.940
 It's a perfect double bluff.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.940
 Is it true?

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.940
 That's true.

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:52.940
 Did you try and connect to the Wi-Fi, Dan?

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.940
 I did.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.940
 Gosh.

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:56.940
 MI6 is going to be absolutely all over you, Dan.

00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:01.940
 Can I see my favourite recent public name suggestions story that I found?

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:02.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.940
 Every year, in the UK, there were issues every year with leaves on the track.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.940
 And the trains can't run.

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.940
 So networked real to combat this.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.940
 Had these special trains.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.940
 And they got a high pressure of water jets.

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.940
 Like, last of all, keep them clean.

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.940
 Keep everything running.

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:18.940
 They held a public list of public suggestions for us to name the new special leaf fighting train.

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.940
 You guys want to guess what they could be called?

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:21.940
 I genuinely love the name that one.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:22.940
 Okay.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:23.940
 I'll tell you some contenders to get you started.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.940
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:25.940
 So contenders who did not win.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:26.940
 Brittany clears.

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.940
 Oh, that's good.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.940
 Um, leaf full weapon.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.940
 Yeah, I like it.

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:33.940
 And it's a bit say yellow anti leaf machinery.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.940
 That was my one I was going to suggest.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.940
 It's massive.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.940
 So that one did not win.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.940
 Um, leaf us alone.

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:40.940
 Yeah, pretty good.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:41.940
 Leaf Ericsson.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.940
 Who's that?

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:48.940
 Me, sure.

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.940
 Why doesn't that win?

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:50.940
 That's crazy.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.940
 Jays, Mr. Dad, like to send it in.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.940
 Leaf, yeah, by 800 years.

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:55.940
 I'm serious.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.940
 Leaf and Skewder.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.940
 I mean, for the podcast, right?

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.940
 Um, chlorophyll, your boots.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.940
 Go on.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.940
 Leafs contain chlorophyll.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.940
 Fill your boots as a phrase.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.940
 Yeah.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.940
 They went with control out the leaf.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:10.940
 That's very good.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.940
 That's what they went with.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.940
 That's good rap.

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:13.940
 That's very good.

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:14.940
 Really like that.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.940
 It's a bit better than chlorophyll.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:19.940
 Yeah.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.940
 Yeah.

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:21.940
 Okay.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.940
 That's it.

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.940
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:24.940
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:35.940

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:38.940
 I'm on Instagram on @Shriberland.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.940
 Andy.

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:40.940
 So at Android 100.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:41.940
 And James.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.940
 Nice.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:43.940
 Graham is no 16 to James Harkin.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.940
 And.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.940
 And.

 And my Insta is @Millabooks.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.940

 And, uh, you can get to us all as well if you want to via podcast@QI.com.

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:56.740
 Why not send us some questions, send us some interesting facts.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.340
 Andy goes through all of these emails.

00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.660
 He cherry picks the best of them.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:04.940
 And they make their way to our special secret bonus episode called Drop Us Align, which

 is part of Club Fish.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.940
 If you're not a Club Fish member, can I recommend checking it out?

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.780
 We have lots of tears on Patreon.

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.980
 There's so many fun things that we're going to be doing with it.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:14.980
 Do check it out.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.980
 It's really fun.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.380
 You can do that by going to know such thing as a fish.com.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.980
 You'll find all of our previous episodes up there as well.

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.740
 Otherwise, just come back next week because we're going to be back here with another episode.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:24.740
 We will see you then.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.740
 Good.

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:25.740
 Bye.
