00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,920
 Everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Where We Were

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,560
 Chained by someone who a lot of you will be very excited to hear.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,360
 Yes.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,800
 It's the return of Ann Miller.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,840
 The comeback.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,480
 Our colleague Ann joined us for this week's episode.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,240
 It was so nice having her back on.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,800
 She had a classic Ann Fack, which you're about to hear.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
 And it was just great. It was a really nice episode.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,080
 I love you to have her back.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,200
 Does she have anything that we can plug at the top of the show this week?

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,520
 She does, actually. She's got a book coming

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,760
 in, I think it's coming in a few months time,

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
 but it's available to pre-order now.

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,560
 And it's called Monster Diaries.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,600
 I think there's going to be a few of them.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,720
 I hope so anyway.

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,520
 And basically, it's kind of classical stories

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,640
 where there's often a monster.

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,840
 Like Greek Mets and stuff.

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
 Exactly, but from the monster's point of view.

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,320
 Oh, very similar.

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
 So the first one is about the Cyclops,

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,080
 but it's the Cyclops getting to tell his side of the story.

26
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,600
 And it's just, it's a lovely idea.

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
 They're beautifully illustrated.

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
 I've seen the drawings that have been going into them.

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
 So that is highly recommended.

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,680
 The Monster Diaries.

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
 By Anne Miller and indeed, if you go to the places where you buy books,

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,040
 you'll find all of Anne's other books.

33
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,560
 She's written a whole lot of them.

34
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,000
 Yes, exactly.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And one more thing to say before we start.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,480
 Gone.

37
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,600
 Christmas is coming.

38
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,960
 The goose is getting fat.

39
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
 Please, but a penny?

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,480
 In the old man's hat.

41
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,840
 Feels stingy.

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
 Um, but you might be thinking about what to get your loved ones for Christmas.

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,160
 Yeah.

44
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,400
 And you might be thinking, oh, it's so hard

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,160
 to buy a physical object for people.

46
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
 I'm thinking what to buy my wife.

47
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,080
 Well, what she really loves to hear is my voice more and more.

48
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,840
 She doesn't get nearly enough of it.

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,320
 Absolutely.

50
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,840
 Well, James, you should buy her access to Club Fish.

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,560
 Oh.

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,280
 Yeah.

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
 It's the members club that we have where you can get extra content.

54
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
 You can get ad-free episodes of Fish.

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
 And you can get all sorts of stuff.

56
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
 And there are a few different tiers you can do.

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,920
 Up to the very top tier where we're going to be doing a quarterly quiz.

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
 The first of those is coming up soon.

59
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,280
 And it's going to be so much fun on Zoom with all of your members.

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
 So, uh, it's really fun.

61
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
 It's a great present to give someone.

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
 Because it's an experience.

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,320
 Absolutely.

64
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
 I'm going to get my wife one straight away.

65
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
 I'm going to send that sports car back.

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
 She'll be delighted.

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,480
 [LAUGHS]

68
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,280
 Excellent.

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,760
 James, how do people find out more about this Club Fish place?

70
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
 I would imagine you probably go to patreon.com/nosephix.

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,120
 I think you're right.

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,680
 You are right.

73
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,480
 That's where you go.

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
 Patreon.com/nosephix.

75
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,280
 Go and check it out.

76
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,080
 It's so much fun.

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
 It will make a lovely present for anyone in your life who likes Fish.

78
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760
 Well, you know what?

79
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,960
 You deserve a present too.

80
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,160
 You sure do.

81
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
 Treat yourself.

82
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,080
 All right.

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,120
 I think outside, isn't it?

84
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
 That's all we have to say.

85
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,520
 Merry Christmas to come.

86
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,480
 On with the podcast.

87
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,280
 On with the show.

88
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

89
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,640
 Hello and welcome to another episode.

90
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,840
 A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
 from the QI offices in Hobern.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

93
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,400
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

94
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
 and Ann Meller.

95
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

96
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

97
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,960
 And in a particular order, here we go.

98
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Ann.

99
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,680
 After you bake panatoni, you have to hang them upside down

100
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,840
 like that's.

101
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,240
 So cute.

102
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,640
 I would say this is a vintage Ann Meller fact.

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
 And that it's interesting, but it's also quite sweet.

104
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,000
 Yeah.

105
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,640
 What a return.

106
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,160
 Yeah.

107
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,320
 What a return.

108
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 And Christmas is coming.

109
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
 Christmas is coming.

110
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,640
 So why?

111
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,200
 Why do you have to?

112
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,320
 So I got very interested in a big deep dive

113
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,480
 about how you make traditional panatoni.

114
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,320
 And the result was I became desperate to eat very high quality

115
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,920
 in the toning.

116
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,320
 How deep is the deep dive on panatoning?

117
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
 I'll send you the links.

118
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,480
 Some great articles.

119
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,800
 Basically, traditional panatoni is wildly

120
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
 controversial to make.

121
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,760
 It's a lot of very expensive ingredients,

122
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,080
 sip butter, and eggs and fruit.

123
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,480
 Actually half the volume of panatoni is butter on a proper one.

124
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,640
 That's why it tastes so good.

125
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
 Oh, there it is.

126
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,720
 So great.

127
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,240
 And it's--

128
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,600
 This just made me think I've never had a good panatoni,

129
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,840
 because I think of it as being a dry, otherwise--

130
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
 So I did see someone saying that if you need to butter it,

131
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,760
 it's not a traditional one.

132
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
 It's also a really lengthy process.

133
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
 And at the end, all this care you've

134
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,680
 made to your panatoni, if you don't flip it upside down

135
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,720
 really quickly, it's quickly as 20 seconds.

136
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,280
 The dome was up to cave in.

137
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,400
 So the picture I found online, which I love,

138
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,560
 is this big wire rack with panatoni's hanging upside down,

139
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,320
 which suggests if you were to examine,

140
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,600
 as I will do this, Christmas, the bottom of your panatoni.

141
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,440
 And you see little holes where the wires have gone through.

142
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,040
 So they're hanging upside down to cool.

143
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,800
 Or another method is you can pop it upside down

144
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
 in a wicker basket.

145
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
 And it's about eight hours of upside down hanging

146
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,440
 for it to settle.

147
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,160
 Well, that's what I read.

148
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,520
 I've never made a panatoni.

149
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,360
 I've definitely--

150
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,280
 I wanted to until I read this.

151
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
 So you've not done this.

152
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,160
 I've decided it was going to take one man was 86.

153
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,760
 I've had been working since he was a child.

154
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,400
 And I can't compete with that, Dan.

155
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,720
 It sounds so hard.

156
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,760
 It sounds so hard.

157
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,920
 When you make some food or make anything in life,

158
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
 you don't have to compete with a person who

159
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,960
 is the absolute best at it.

160
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,560
 But I want to sample this one, not have a very inferior one,

161
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
 made by me.

162
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,200
 But you have picked the extreme end of panatoni

163
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
 making in your example.

164
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,000
 It's like saying, I decided not to become a footballer,

165
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,240
 because David Beckham exists.

166
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,040
 Well, exactly.

167
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
 I don't play football, Dan.

168
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,440
 Well, she is a QI researcher, and she's the best QI researcher.

169
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
 Yes, that's a lot about us, yeah.

170
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,320
 And was this Nicola Fiasconardo?

171
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
 I think so.

172
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,640
 So he is a Sicilian master baker.

173
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,800
 And the profile of him started out with saying,

174
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
 this is a man who has baked panatoni for not one, not two,

175
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,120
 but three different popes.

176
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,360
 That's just clearly good.

177
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,840
 But we've had quite a few popes.

178
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,360
 We've been through a lot of them here.

179
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
 Yeah.

180
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
 And what killed them?

181
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,000
 One of them was intering this master panatoni maker.

182
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,880
 And they said, we rang the shop to make sure he would be

183
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
 there ahead of our visit.

184
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,120
 And they said, he is always here.

185
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,040
 Right, lovely.

186
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,640
 But it's amazing.

187
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,320
 So they also have this special yeast.

188
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,560
 And in one bakery, they have been using the same local resource

189
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,960
 yeast since 1922, has to be fed with flour and water every four

190
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
 hours.

191
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,480
 What?

192
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,240
 Every four hours since 1922.

193
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
 I can see why you've now pulled out the pudding involved.

194
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,920
 That must be very strong.

195
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 Well, yeah.

196
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,600
 I mean, Italy's been through a lot of upheaval in the--

197
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,200
 That's interesting.

198
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,120
 --since 1922, like they've had fascism, they've had the war.

199
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,440
 How long has Italy actually existed?

200
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,920
 It's 1870s, I think.

201
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,200
 So it's like a lot more than that.

202
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,480
 That yeast is almost as old as Italy.

203
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,440
 That's amazing.

204
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,640
 You, Andy, just mentioned that it possibly took out three

205
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,080
 popes.

206
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
 Yeah, I'd like to roll back from that a bit.

207
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,360
 But what's interesting is it most likely hasn't,

208
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,200
 because God is on the side of the panatoni.

209
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,720
 Right.

210
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,600
 Because we're assuming that God is on the side of those

211
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
 popes as well.

212
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,200
 Absolutely.

213
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,760
 They're not still here as I'll have say it.

214
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,040
 I think God is Italian.

215
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,560
 Yeah.

216
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,120
 God is Italian.

217
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,160
 Because the patron saint of choking and sore

218
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,080
 throats and so on is connected to panatoni.

219
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,600
 San Biagio.

220
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,120
 This is an amazing character.

221
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
 St. Blaze.

222
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,640
 St. Blaze for those who speak non-italian.

223
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,560
 Other languages are available.

224
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,520
 But yeah, I mean, interesting character.

225
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,800
 Born in Armenia, lived in the third and fourth centuries.

226
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,080
 And he got beatified and made into a saint

227
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,160
 because of miracles that were to do largely

228
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,960
 with saving people from choking.

229
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,800
 At least that was the main one.

230
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,880
 There was a kid that was choking on something.

231
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,040
 And he came, managed to take it out.

232
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,960
 And there was a miracle.

233
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,280
 He convinced a wolf to return a stolen pig.

234
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,800
 That was another reason for him being beatified.

235
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,880
 Returned him to the house, but it was made of straw.

236
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,960
 So it got him blown down.

237
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,360
 When you said patron saint of choking,

238
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,400
 I couldn't quite work out what is more like the patron saint

239
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 of not choking.

240
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
 Sothras.

241
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
 Being saved.

242
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
 He's also being saved from.

243
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,200
 Just to say as well, he is a patron saint of wolf comas.

244
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,520
 So wolf comas are people who comb sheep.

245
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,440
 And they use really, really long sort of like a head brush.

246
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,560
 But it's like got nails in it.

247
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
 These wolf coms.

248
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,760
 But he's the patron saint of that.

249
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,000
 And the reason he's the patron saint of wolf comas

250
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,280
 is because before he was beheaded, he was beaten with wolf coms.

251
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
 Oh no.

252
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
 Right.

253
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,960
 Sothras, yeah, they're of the patron saint of something that killed them.

254
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
 Doesn't seem right.

255
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
 Doesn't seem right.

256
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
 It's not fair.

257
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,080
 I think panatone, you might be a classic Harkin singular plural problem.

258
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,600
 Oh, panatone.

259
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
 Panatone E with an eye is the plural.

260
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,320
 And panatone Neh with an E is the singular.

261
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 Interesting.

262
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,200
 So should we all be saying, are we saying it wrong?

263
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
 Should we be saying, would you like some panatone Neh?

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,160
 I would say panatonees does feel weird when you say it.

265
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,880
 They don't usually eat more than they.

266
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,440
 Yeah, no, they'd like stuff at two.

267
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
 Stop but two.

268
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
 Half butter.

269
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,720
 They put it so there's no plural because no one's ever had to panatone.

270
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,440
 It's mentioned in a book by a chef called Friend of the Podcast.

271
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,640
 Bartolomeo Shapi.

272
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,480
 Oh yeah.

273
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 Spelt Scappy.

274
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 What's he friend of us for?

275
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,960
 He was Friend of the Podcast.

276
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,840
 He is the one who cooked for many popes

277
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,360
 and made incredible elaborate dishes and banquets.

278
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,520
 And then a new Pope came in and said,

279
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,000
 "No, I just want a lot of old egg from now on."

280
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And so he kind of lost it.

281
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,360
 But he wrote one of the first big cookbooks.

282
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
 So it was it was mentioned we think in a book by him.

283
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,360
 But they're all these kind of enriched breads,

284
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,920
 which are fruit and fruit peel and you know, all of this stuff.

285
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,640
 So it's a bit murky where it truly is.

286
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,280
 One of them is the Baba.

287
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,200
 I don't know if you know about Babas.

288
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,800
 You get Babas from Poland and other Slavic countries,

289
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,840
 but I think they probably came from panatonees

290
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,800
 and then they turn them into Babas.

291
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,720
 But the way that you make them is really regimented.

292
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,920
 It's almost like the Baba is a baby.

293
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,120
 So men are not allowed to enter the kitchen

294
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,240
 while they're being made.

295
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,600
 Do you have to whisper while you're cooking it

296
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,240
 in case it starts crying?

297
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
 Oh, I guess.

298
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
 That's lovely.

299
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,000
 And also you have to leave it to rest on a piece of eye

300
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,280
 to down before putting it in the oven.

301
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,920
 Outside down a regular way.

302
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,720
 Regular way.

303
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
 The advice has changed since the 1960s.

304
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,560
 You used to have to put it upside down.

305
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,240
 But never put it in with the parents.

306
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,840
 Well, do you always put it in with the parents?

307
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,760
 I can't imagine that at a time.

308
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,080
 Do you know what it means, panatone?

309
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,240
 I read one, the etymology that it was invented by a guy

310
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,760
 called Tony.

311
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
 I love that so much.

312
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,720
 It's so good.

313
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,920
 I mean, it's anti-tree, right?

314
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,560
 I think it just means big bread.

315
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,600
 Because the One means big as a suffix.

316
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
 So it's panne, obviously, at One.

317
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,560
 And I didn't know this.

318
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,320
 You know, in Italian, calzone.

319
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200
 Oh, yeah.

320
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
 That is a big legging.

321
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,240
 What?

322
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,360
 Calzone is a legging.

323
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,560
 What do you mean, legging?

324
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 Like a legging.

325
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
 Like you wear leggings, you know?

326
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
 That's tight.

327
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
 Oh, like a tie.

328
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
 So calzone is a legging.

329
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,080
 And calzone literally means trousers.

330
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,040
 So when you order a calzone, that's what you're ordering.

331
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
 It's a sleeve, basically.

332
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,920
 It's a sleeve for your legs, which is what I call my trousers.

333
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,680
 And it's full of hot, hot meat, as opposed to that.

334
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
 Do you know where?

335
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,560
 Like our legs, yeah.

336
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,960
 And do you know who the best panatone makers in the world are?

337
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,680
 We said that it might be this Italian who's been doing it for 80 years, but not according

338
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
 to the world championships.

339
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
 Oh.

340
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
 There's panatone world championships.

341
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
 There are.

342
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,040
 And they won in 2025.

343
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,160
 Which nationality do you think won the prize?

344
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,400
 If you guess it, I will give you £10 million.

345
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
 Oh.

346
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 Oh, we allowed to cheat.

347
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
 I didn't.

348
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
 No, cheating.

349
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 No, no, no.

350
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
 Let me qualify the cheating.

351
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
 I have a fact about panatone eaters, so I'm thinking it might be from that country.

352
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
 Have a guess.

353
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
 Peru.

354
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
 Nope.

355
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
 Mongolia.

356
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
 Closer, but no.

357
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
 Oh.

358
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 Mars.

359
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 Mars.

360
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
 Oh, lovely.

361
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,800
 And no, they're from Taiwan.

362
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,120
 They won it in 2025, and they won a load of gold medals for the best chocolate one, the best

363
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,960
 general one, the best gelato panatone.

364
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,480
 But an interesting rule in the panatone championships is if you don't wear a hat, you lose

365
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 a point.

366
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,520
 And actually, it's anyone in your team.

367
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,360
 If anyone from your team doesn't wear a hat, you lose points for your panatone.

368
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
 What's the reason?

369
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,960
 They just have a very specific uniform that you have to wear.

370
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
 Right.

371
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,080
 It's got very specific, it's black shoes, black trousers, a special jacket that you get

372
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,320
 given by the organizers, naprin and a hat.

373
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800
 And if any of them you don't wear, you lose points.

374
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,560
 I did really have to use a proper Italian mother yeast.

375
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
 Oh, yeah.

376
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
 To enter.

377
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
 And you're not allowed any accoutrements, really.

378
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,880
 You're allowed dried fruits, but you can't put like a kick out on top of something.

379
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,520
 But there is a chocolate round.

380
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
 Yeah.

381
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,720
 And again, they have very special things that you're allowed to pop up.

382
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 So it's on skill rather than like crazy new flavors.

383
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 No kick hats.

384
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
 No milky way.

385
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
 No crunchies.

386
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,880
 Why do these fun competitions always sound so intense?

387
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,480
 Like you'd have a hard attack halfway through doing it.

388
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
 This is serious stuff.

389
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,600
 Also because you've eaten a panatone that's half buffet, probably a preparation.

390
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
 Like your doctor will be checking that out.

391
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,320
 But I think they're very strict about it in places like Milan.

392
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,400
 So Milan, according to the Milanese Chamber of Commerce, I believe, they ruled that a traditional

393
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,480
 panatone has to be 20% salt on it and dried fruit.

394
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
 Which to be is insane.

395
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
 That's insane.

396
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
 It's insane.

397
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
 I always pick them out.

398
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,360
 Well, you're going to have a, you're going to be doing it a long time by a proper, tried

399
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
 one.

400
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 Yeah.

401
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
 I don't even like a spotted dick with fruit in it.

402
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
 Really?

403
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
 Yeah.

404
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 I hate those dried fruits.

405
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
 So you've not found a fruit cake?

406
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
 No.

407
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
 Absolutely not.

408
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
 And I have to change my office bake now.

409
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
 Right, man.

410
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,960
 In this piece about the fiasco narrow factory, they said they used manna as a sweetener.

411
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,200
 I don't know if you guys saw this.

412
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,240
 The food of the gods from their old testament.

413
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,120
 That's why it's expensive because you have to go into the desert for 40 years and eventually

414
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,520
 you get some of the, well, it's this, it's this resin which you get from ash trees and

415
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,960
 it's naturally quite sweet.

416
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,600
 And a journalist asked one of the fiasco narrow family, well, this is brilliant, but you've

417
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,680
 only reduced the sort of like white sugar that you put it in.

418
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,640
 Why don't you just use mana?

419
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,560
 And she said, we can't just use mana because mana has laxative properties, which applies

420
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,000
 the existence of a, of an experiment that went disastrous.

421
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,880
 Would you like the forbidden panoramic?

422
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
 Do you reckon that's what happens to the popes?

423
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
 Oh, questionably.

424
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
 Oh, questionably.

425
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
 That's amazing.

426
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
 Yeah.

427
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,200
 But another thing I didn't know about panoramic, so the saint dimensions, saint Viasco, saint

428
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,840
 blaze, because he saved this child from choking.

429
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,440
 There is a tradition that when you have your christmas panoramic, you save a piece.

430
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,000
 And on February 3rd, saint blaze is feast day.

431
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,280
 You toast it because it'll be stale by that point, you are allowed to butter this way, and

432
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,280
 then you eat it and there's meant to ward off sore throats for the past.

433
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
 Yeah.

434
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,720
 So I was reading more into saint Bajajur.

435
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,960
 And there is this really fun thing, which is, I think I found what was one of the original

436
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,280
 Heimlich maneuvers from this period.

437
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,520
 So he was 3rd, 4th century.

438
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,080
 This was being practiced in the 6th century, right?

439
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,720
 So what would happen is, if a bone was stuck in your throat, if after initial attempts

440
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,000
 to get it out, sometimes they would say put a bit of bread in, and so it would go

441
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,800
 down, it would be pushed down by the bread.

442
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,440
 I think that's still the advice, isn't it?

443
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
 Right.

444
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 It's what I do.

445
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
 Is it?

446
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
 You eat more when you're choking.

447
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
 Okay.

448
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
 If you've got a little bone stuck, you just have a bit of bread, it just sort of envelops

449
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
 it and takes it down.

450
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,880
 So you put it in the size of the bone.

451
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
 It does.

452
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
 It does.

453
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,040
 But no, that is still what happens if the bread gets stuck, then do you send, you know,

454
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
 a curly, oily down there?

455
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,960
 It's the, yeah, it's the middle-aged man who saw it a bone.

456
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,240
 And then, yeah, if anyone's choking while listening to this, please, please, please look

457
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
 up the NHS website.

458
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
 Don't take my advice.

459
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
 Yeah.

460
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
 Absolutely.

461
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
 That's always worked for me.

462
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
 Yep.

463
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
 Well, here's what I'll be doing.

464
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,640
 So if you want to try some six-century advice and the bone's not coming out, what you need

465
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,560
 to do, and this is a quote, is to go around and face the person who's choking and yell

466
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:38,120
 at them, come out bone, if you are a bone, or whatever you are, come out like Lazarus

467
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,840
 at the voice of Christ, come out of the tomb, and Jonah from the belly of the whale.

468
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,040
 And then that will get the bone out of your, yeah.

469
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
 Well, if it is a bone.

470
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
 If it is a bone.

471
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
 Yeah, yeah.

472
00:15:48,040 --> 00:16:05,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

473
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
 Okay.

474
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,720
 My fact this week is that those giant walking keyboards that Tom Hanks plays in big have existed

475
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,520
 in India for 500 years.

476
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
 Brilliant.

477
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
 Very good.

478
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
 How did they find it?

479
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
 Oh, it's just there.

480
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,400
 It's in a big old temple.

481
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,760
 You can't miss it, really.

482
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,200
 You can't tell when you're watching the film that he's in a 500-year-old Indian temple.

483
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 It's really interesting.

484
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,320
 No, he looks like he's in the famous toy shop in New York, FAO Schwartz, doesn't he?

485
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 Yeah, but that's the magic of film, isn't it?

486
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 It's green screen.

487
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 Yeah.

488
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,160
 No, so basically these are musical temples in India, which I read about, and there's lots

489
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,000
 of them around, especially in South India, and they have various bits of architecture which

490
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 make music.

491
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,760
 And the one in particular that I'm talking about is called 'Eravatasvara Temple', situated

492
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,240
 in Dharasaram near Kumbh Bakanam in the Tanjabor district of Tamil Nadu.

493
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,880
 Yeah, okay.

494
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,840
 I was lost until you mentioned the final location.

495
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,000
 Imagine if you imagine India as a giant upside-down triangle.

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Yes.

497
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,680
 It's just up a bit, and to the right a bit, of the bottom angle of the triangle.

498
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
 I understand.

499
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
 Okay.

500
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,800
 You took those fences like a pro, that was just like, great.

501
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,280
 I have them very phonetically written out on my paper.

502
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,880
 But this temple, it has a staircase where every time you step on one of the steps, it makes

503
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,400
 a note, and it makes a note of a scale, which is effectively the same as that.

504
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,360
 So if anyone doesn't know the 1988 film with Tom Hanks, he is a 13-year-old boy who turns

505
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,840
 into an adult and plays around in toy shops and one of them, the most iconic scene probably

506
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,680
 he plays one of these giant floor pianos.

507
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
 Yeah, absolutely brilliant.

508
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
 Yeah, that's right.

509
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,440
 If I was a monk in one of these temples, what I would do is, I would climb up six of the

510
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,200
 steps, and I would jump off somehow, and that would irritate all the other monks in

511
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
 the temple, because they'd be waiting for the final.

512
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 So good.

513
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
 So good.

514
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
 Oh, yes.

515
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
 Yeah.

516
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
 Well, thank you for going to the bottom.

517
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 Dada.

518
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
 Dada.

519
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
 Dada.

520
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
 Dada.

521
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,080
 Actually, that's not what it would sound like, because they are of the carnatic musical

522
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:20,280
 scale, they're swarers, so they're not normal sort of ABCDFG notes.

523
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,080
 They are a double harmonic, so that's a scale with a D-flat and an A-flat for music nerds

524
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,160
 like Anne's husband.

525
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,880
 And so when you play it, if you play that scale, it sounds like you're in a 1980s movie and

526
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,600
 a snake's about to come out of a basket, so you know that kind of eastern sound.

527
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,280
 One way to explain it is, you know, in the song Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, when they go

528
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,480
 "Scaramush, caramush, can you do the Fandango, that Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, is in that kind

529
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
 of scale."

530
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
 Wow.

531
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
 That explains kind of what it would sound like.

532
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,320
 Did they use the steps to record that, or did they use the steps to do that?

533
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
 They did.

534
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,080
 You know what steps you're going to record on those steps?

535
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
 Oh.

536
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
 I mean, that would be a music video.

537
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
 Well, be hard to.

538
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
 I don't know if you've seen a video or a picture of these steps, but firstly, they're

539
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,800
 hard to get to, because they're in a cage now.

540
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,080
 So there's this big cage that goes around them and...

541
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,520
 No, it's John Cage, more like.

542
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
 Oh, yeah.

543
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 Yeah.

544
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,600
 John Cage and steps together at last, just getting all my modern references in there, you know.

545
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,440
 And yeah, it's an interesting staircase, because it's not a classic staircase.

546
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,280
 The full length of the stairs are the height of a man, the video I watched is a man who's

547
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,680
 standing on the side of it, and it's quite fun, because he's tapping the side, and you

548
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,280
 can hear all these notes.

549
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,680
 But yeah, they're very thin in terms of, you've got the staircase itself and the

550
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,240
 two barriers on the staircase.

551
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,000
 You'd almost have to walk single file with your feet with one front of the other in order

552
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 to get up.

553
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
 But yeah, listening to it is fascinating.

554
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,800
 As you say, very odd scale, because it's the seven notes of classical Indian music.

555
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,480
 They do have other musical temples across India, which I love.

556
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,040
 And so there are so much have musical pillars, which ring with different notes when you

557
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,360
 strike them.

558
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,000
 And there are, I think, some blowing pillars.

559
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,200
 Basically, like a big cot, you just blow into the pillar, and it makes it, it's like an

560
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,000
 all-compire for a, like a conch, so like a recorder, like a recorder, yeah, or trump it,

561
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,960
 or a, we can all name, we can all master it.

562
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
 Did you read about the temple in Japan, where it's, it's got 1,000 steps, and step number

563
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,760
 27 is always wet and mossy, and the other steps are fine.

564
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
 And do we know why?

565
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,560
 The legend is that somebody died there, but they're probably a springer, a natural spring

566
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
 under the step.

567
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,080
 But they're all dry apart from one.

568
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,200
 27 club moss.

569
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,080
 That is a tortured joke.

570
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,520
 That's the worst I've ever, oh no, I'm really, it's not even top 100.

571
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,680
 You have to go through about 1,000 steps to get to that joke.

572
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
 Beautiful.

573
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
 Beautiful.

574
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
 There we go.

575
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
 Big.

576
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
 The big, the movie.

577
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
 The big piano.

578
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
 Yeah.

579
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
 It's a brilliant film.

580
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
 Oh, yeah.

581
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
 I hadn't, so I hadn't seen it for years and years and years.

582
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
 I watched it last night.

583
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
 Oh.

584
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
 It's a lucky dog.

585
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
 It's so good.

586
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,400
 I think it's slightly problematic, but I think it was probably problematic at the time.

587
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
 I think there is, there is a bit with people tend to gloss over.

588
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,800
 The fact that it's a 30 year old boy who then has sex with a full grown woman.

589
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
 Or be it in Tom Hanks' body.

590
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,520
 Oh, yeah, that is, that's, that's an interesting psychological question.

591
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,240
 Is it definite or is it implied or is it, I don't know, I don't know, I'll show it as

592
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
 it's you.

593
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,440
 But it is a brilliant film though.

594
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
 It's really good.

595
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
 It is good.

596
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,280
 It might have been known to be problematic at the time.

597
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,240
 Is because there's an actor called Deborah Winger and she was originally considered to be the

598
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,320
 main actress in this movie.

599
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,600
 She couldn't take the part because she was pregnant, but she knew the director and she

600
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,360
 said to the director, why don't we switch the gender and have it as a girl who becomes

601
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,560
 big and the director said, well, then you've got a teenage girl having sex with an adult

602
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,120
 man or be it in your body.

603
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,280
 They realized that that was problematic.

604
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,800
 They didn't make that extra step that it was all problematic, but that was the 80s volume.

605
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 It was the 80s.

606
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,480
 And so it's got an amazing behind the scenes crew on it.

607
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,880
 So it was co-written by Anne Spielberg, who is Steven Spielberg's sister.

608
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,960
 And Steven Spielberg was originally asked to direct it, wanted to direct it, but then

609
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,120
 he thought, this will probably take away from my sister's role in it, she'll be shadowed

610
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
 by it.

611
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,440
 So it went to Penny Marshall, who's a brilliant director.

612
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,920
 And that scene with the piano was because it existed in that shop you mentioned, FAO Schwartz

613
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,320
 in America.

614
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,020
 And Spielberg was in there, saw it and immediately ran back saying, we've got to write this into

615
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
 it now.

616
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
 This is just going to be a game changer.

617
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,400
 I mean, what a weird insight to think that this is going to make the movie, which it kind

618
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,240
 of did in terms of its cultural footprint.

619
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
 Yeah.

620
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,720
 Also with that Anne Spielberg never did anything else, called it sure.

621
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,640
 I am DB, yeah, she's just one or two little things, but nothing you've heard of.

622
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,680
 I guess she was cancelled after the whole 13-year-old boy sleep.

623
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 No, no.

624
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
 No.

625
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
 No.

626
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,800
 Interestingly about the 13-year-old boy, Tom Hanks really thought, how am I going to act like

627
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,680
 I'm a 13-year-old boy inside the body of an adult?

628
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,520
 And one story goes quite a few stories of how it was filmed.

629
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,920
 One story suggests that the little boy, who was actually playing the kid, would do all

630
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,480
 the scenes that Tom Hanks would watch the scenes with him doing it.

631
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,520
 And then he would emulate what the boy was doing then in the scene just to really get it.

632
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,400
 Something he did with Forest Gump as well, emulated the character of the kid to create the

633
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,760
 role of Forest Gump, the adult.

634
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,240
 I watched it, like I said last night, and I had read that as well, and you can kind of see

635
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,920
 if that's true, you can kind of see it.

636
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,200
 Like the one point he sort of dismantles this toy, and he does it in exactly the same way

637
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 a child would do.

638
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,560
 And you think, either he's a brilliant actor or he copied a child, or both.

639
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,320
 How have you seen, so what are my favourite bodies for films?

640
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 Is Jumanji welcome to the jungle?

641
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 How are you seeing Jack Black playing?

642
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 I have 14-year-old guys.

643
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 Oh, yeah.

644
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 So good.

645
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
 They're such solid films.

646
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 That's so good.

647
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,560
 A friend of the podcast, Restorby, in that one.

648
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
 Oh, yeah.

649
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,240
 No one swaps his body, though, do they?

650
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
 No.

651
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,440
 No, he's the welcome to Jumanji's character when they arrive in the game.

652
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,040
 I wouldn't want his mind in my body restarting, no, you can't give him coverage.

653
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,640
 Big was the fourth body swap movie released in eight months.

654
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
 Oh.

655
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
 Isn't that, like...

656
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
 Is that Original Freaky Friday time?

657
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
 It was...

658
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
 There were three...

659
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,080
 The three others that preceded it were called "Like Father Like Son," "Vice Versa," and

660
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,680
 "18" again.

661
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
 And just...

662
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
 This was this...

663
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
 She'd rationally...

664
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
 Like, we think of it as one of the archetypal bodies for movies, along with things like

665
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,080
 "Freaky Friday" and "13 Going Up 30."

666
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
 But it was...

667
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,240
 It was just following this very long tradition.

668
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
 People like it.

669
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
 It's often what happens in Hollywood, isn't it?

670
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,920
 You are Armageddon in "Deep Ed Packed" at the same time.

671
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,240
 There's movies sort of a rhyme.

672
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
 Oh, yeah.

673
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,640
 Vincent Bugs Life at the same time.

674
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
 Yeah, exactly.

675
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
 But I think "Vice Versa" is the...

676
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,000
 There was a novel called "Vice Versa," and we might have mentioned that on this before.

677
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,600
 I think that's what it was based on.

678
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,880
 Just going back to the keyboard, they play a couple of different songs on there.

679
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,600
 One of them is "Chopsticks."

680
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,120
 So you know "Chopsticks" is what you'd like...

681
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,200
 One of the first things you learn as a kid.

682
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,360
 Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

683
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,080
 Do you know who wrote "Chopsticks"?

684
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
 Oh!

685
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
 It's the one you've never heard of, so...

686
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,440
 Oh, that's... Oh, it was written by Mozart's sister.

687
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
 What?

688
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
 Yep.

689
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,560
 Mozart Allen, his sister, Euphonia Allen, wrote that.

690
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,520
 She's called Euphonia.

691
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,640
 She's named after an instrument.

692
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,040
 Well, she's named after the Greek for "Beautiful Voice."

693
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
 Well, so Euphonia, isn't it?

694
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,240
 And he was named Mozart because their parents was really into music of what his kids could be really musical.

696
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
 Are you allowed to do it?

697
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,720
 I guess it's like getting in early with you.

698
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,760
 It's like calling a child tennis champion, isn't it?

699
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,640
 It's just kind of how your colors to the math early.

700
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
 Well, this was...

701
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,200
 We're talking 1870s.

702
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,160
 It was quite a long time ago to be given your kids wacky names.

703
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
 Yeah.

704
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,840
 I think...

705
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,120
 I mean, I say that as a parent of someone with a relatively uncommon name,

706
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,920
 but he was like a famous dance choreographer.

707
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,400
 Decided he wanted his kids to get into music.

708
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
 Called his daughter Euphonia, she wrote "Chopsticks."

709
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,200
 Called his son Mozart, and he went into music production.

710
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
 Right.

711
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
 Oh, yeah?

712
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
 Does she...

713
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
 Is it like Happy Birthday where she's still...

714
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
 It's in copyright.

715
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
 It will be out, I guess, by now, but she must have...

716
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 It's well out of copyright.

717
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,280
 She wrote it when she was like 15 or something.

718
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 Right.

719
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
 Do you...

720
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,280
 Any of you recognize the name "Berimo Serrachini"?

721
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
 Not the way you say it.

722
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
 It's nice.

723
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
 I've got something written down in my notes.

724
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 "Berimo Serrachini."

725
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
 Ramos Serrachini?

726
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
 Yeah.

727
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
 Maybe Serrachini.

728
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 Yeah.

729
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,800
 It could be anything who even knows.

730
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
 But he was the inventor of that great piano that we see in big.

731
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 Amazing character.

732
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,760
 He was born in 1935 in Italy.

733
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,040
 He was an inventor ever since a child.

734
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,080
 He had a really interesting moment where he made a kite from a poster of Mussolini when he

735
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,040
 was a kid, which resulted in a visit from the secret police.

736
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
 Give him a minute.

737
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
 You can't string up Mussolini like that.

738
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
 That will see.

739
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
 Yeah.

740
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,400
 They gave him an official warning about anti-fascist activity.

741
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
 I apologize.

742
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,120
 The people at home couldn't see my nod of approval that I gave to that joke.

743
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,680
 It's not fair, because we take the piss when you do bad ones.

744
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
 Yeah, it's true.

745
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
 Yeah, I can't wear snow-winning.

746
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
 Yeah, yeah.

747
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
 I'll keep doing.

748
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
 Yeah.

749
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
 Yeah, no.

750
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
 Amazing inventor.

751
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
 He made this piano.

752
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
 He made lots of different gadgets.

753
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,360
 He made this incredible one, which was a stethoscope, stereosystem.

754
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,320
 So basically, you could dance to the rhythm of your own heartbeat.

755
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,120
 A lot of inventions were to do with touch, body, and voice.

756
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
 Problem.

757
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
 Yeah.

758
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,280
 Put in the stethoscope to your heartbeat.

759
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,560
 You're dancing.

760
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
 You get a bit more energetic, because you're dancing.

761
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,080
 Your heartbeat gets faster.

762
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,360
 You dance faster.

763
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,520
 You get more energetic.

764
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,160
 Your heart gets faster still.

765
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
 What is it, Ed?

766
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
 This thing has killed two popes.

767
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
 Little nine facts.

768
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,720
 But, Dan, did you say his origin was working where he was between 1965 and 1969?

769
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
 No, I didn't.

770
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
 He was a rocket scientist.

771
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,880
 He was working for NASA, working on the reentry systems, their electronics.

772
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,800
 He's really a proper, you know, really skilled engineer.

773
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,640
 He has invented some musical stairs as well, just to bring us back to the temple.

774
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
 So, yeah, cool guy.

775
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
 Very cool guy.

776
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
 If you guys tried the Stinging Lift at the South Park Centre.

777
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
 No.

778
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 I have.

779
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
 It's so great.

780
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
 It's awesome.

781
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
 It's saying stuff.

782
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
 But what do you do?

783
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
 You just choose your floor.

784
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
 Yeah.

785
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 And then it goes up.

786
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
 It goes up.

787
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
 It goes up.

788
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
 It goes up.

789
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,640
 It goes up.

790
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
 Level three.

791
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
 It's so great.

792
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
 So it is done by Martin Creed, who won the Turner Prize.

793
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
 And it follows the scale.

794
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
 And then it sings your floor to you.

795
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
 So next time you're there.

796
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
 What happens if the lift gets stuck?

797
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,600
 Does it have to sustain the note?

798
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
 And you just hear it say a breath.

799
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
 I haven't been stuck in it.

800
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,400
 It's like I'm personally saying.

801
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
 You just hear it go.

802
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
 Oh, my God.

803
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
 Oh, my God.

804
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
 Oh, my God.

805
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,920
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

806
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,120
 And that is my fact.

807
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,600
 My fact this week is that three months after Alex Honald became the first person ever to free

808
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,560
 solo climb El Capitan, his mum became the oldest woman to ever climb it.

809
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
 This is stunning.

810
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
 That's amazing.

811
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
 Yeah.

812
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
 It's a cool family.

813
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
 Yeah.

814
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
 So this is Alex Honald.

815
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,560
 This was an Oscar-winning documentary made with National Geographic.

816
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,880
 The New York Times called what he did, one of the greatest athletic feats of any kind ever.

817
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,320
 He free climbed, which means no ropes.

818
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,480
 It's just his hands his feet climbing up a 2,900 foot root of a mountain face.

819
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,960
 Like no one had ever done it before.

820
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,640
 No one has done it since and this was in 2017, three months later, his mum, not doing a free

821
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,680
 solo climb, but you can also climb El Capitan via the actual root, which goes through.

822
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
 Exactly.

823
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
 Made it up herself.

824
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
 Three months later.

825
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
 Amazing.

826
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
 Become the oldest person.

827
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
 Yeah.

828
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
 She's called Didri.

829
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
 She is incredible.

830
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
 Didri.

831
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
 Volovnik.

832
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
 Volovnich.

833
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
 She's called Didri.

834
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
 OK.

835
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
 She's stunning.

836
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,920
 She did the lurking fear root to get to the top, because all these roots have different weird

837
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
 names.

838
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
 Reassuring names.

839
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
 I think even the first to climb.

840
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
 You get to name.

841
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
 Yeah, reassuring.

842
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
 Exactly.

843
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,320
 And has anyone seen the film?

844
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
 No.

845
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
 It's seen a trailer.

846
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,840
 It's unbelievably exciting.

847
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,440
 And you sort of know that he doesn't die because they released the film.

848
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
 Yeah.

849
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
 But can I ask a question?

850
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,960
 Are we certain that there wasn't some body swath between Didri and Alex and that he

851
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,760
 climbed up it in her body?

852
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,920
 That's a great premise for a film.

853
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,080
 He was there to help her climb up it, I think, when she did.

854
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,720
 So that would have to be her in his body.

855
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
 I feel like we're focusing on the wrong thing.

856
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
 Yeah, yeah.

857
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
 It's an amazing climb.

858
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
 It's an amazing climb.

859
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,000
 El Capitan is this huge, it's like a sheer face of granite.

860
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I've been there.

861
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Have you?

862
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Yes.

863
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Did you free climb?

864
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Did you take the lurking fear root?

865
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Did you start?

866
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 No.

867
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,840
 I was a good few meters away from the base.

868
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,200
 We're just far enough back that I could see the whole thing.

869
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
 Right.

870
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
 It's terrifying.

871
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
 It is.

872
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 Absolutely terrifying.

873
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,560
 And even the root that she took is very hard.

874
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,200
 Now what's extraordinary is she did this at age 66, but she only started to learn climbing

875
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,000
 age 60.

876
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,720
 She taught herself to swim at age 40.

877
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,800
 So this is someone who is quite a late bloomer in general sporting.

878
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,800
 And then she went on to break the record again, breaking her own record, age 70, climbed

879
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,120
 at a second time, age 70, and she did it with a foot injury as well.

880
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,920
 It's because those whole family is nuts.

881
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
 Absolutely nuts.

882
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
 She's a really impressive woman.

883
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
 She's run marathon.

884
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
 She's conducted orchestras.

885
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,920
 She's been a publisher, you know, professor of five languages.

886
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,200
 And when they climbed El Capitan together the first time, he said, okay, well, we'll do it.

887
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,240
 You know, we'll just go up and down.

888
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,560
 So they took about 19 hours.

889
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,880
 He said, that's a reasonable time.

890
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
 He did not tell her.

891
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,680
 Normally, people take four days to do this for you say said, right, come on, man, let's

892
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
 just...

893
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
 We've got a day.

894
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
 Yeah.

895
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
 They're absolutely bananas.

896
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
 It's amazing.

897
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,080
 She says that when he was a child, he was climbing on pitch appliances before he turned

898
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 to.

899
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,120
 So she knew he was going to become a climber.

900
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,960
 But I would say that's pretty much old kids.

901
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
 That's true.

902
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
 Yeah.

903
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
 That's true.

904
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
 Yeah.

905
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
 It's just like climbing on stuff, right?

906
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,160
 It's a pretty, it's a pretty amazing story.

907
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,320
 And I don't know how much Andy, this is shown in the documentary.

908
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,560
 But he basically had climbed up this route multiple times before, but with ropes.

909
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,200
 So this was the first time he was trying it on his own, and he memorized the entire route.

910
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,160
 He knew exactly where his hand was going at every single point as he was going up.

911
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,560
 And once he finished it, you would think, probably, okay, let's step away now.

912
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,640
 Let's go home and thank our lucky stars that nothing bad happened.

913
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
 What did he do?

914
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,040
 Well, because it was a documentary and they needed extra shots.

915
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,080
 He spent five more days recliming certain sections of it so that he could get better drone

916
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
 shots.

917
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
 For pickups.

918
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,720
 Can I just say he does wear sticky shoes?

919
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
 What?

920
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
 He wears sticky shoes.

921
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,280
 Well, it's a special kind of sticky rubber that helps you, especially if you can't really

922
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,040
 get much of a grip with your fingers.

923
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,360
 Because you're basically on with your fingernails.

924
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,320
 It just means that you're not going to, he's not wearing brogues.

925
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
 He's not wearing...

926
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
 Right.

927
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
 He didn't even do it in brogues.

928
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,120
 He was even a wreck all the time.

929
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,120
 But in my head, he was like, you know Batman from the old 70s shows where he just walks

930
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
 sideways up a wall.

931
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,520
 It just goes horizontal, yeah, it just walks up it.

932
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
 Yeah.

933
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,560
 No, you see him in the film, he makes all these notes because you just have to study the route

934
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
 so much.

935
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,640
 And you have to say like, this is good if you've got two fingers and you just need to hold

936
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,240
 your weight on two fingers while you get your foot across here.

937
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,480
 So it's incredibly detailed them mapping out.

938
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
 And it's...

939
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
 It's...

940
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,440
 You might leave a chalk mark to say like, put hand here.

941
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,080
 It's absolutely terrifying.

942
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
 And you often...

943
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,640
 He ends up hanging by one or two fingers above this, this absolutely insane drop.

944
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
 And I listen to it, I listen to an interview with him recently because he was talking about

945
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,640
 his attitude to risk.

946
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,960
 And he says, I actually don't think I am a high risk person.

947
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,760
 He says, I am a low risk person in lots of ways.

948
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,640
 The individual climbing moves I make are very, they're low risk, but they are high consequence.

949
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
 Yeah.

950
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
 I see.

951
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,880
 He doesn't seem to feel fit.

952
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
 No.

953
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,120
 It's like doing Russian roulette with 1,000 chambers and one bullet.

954
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,720
 Like you're probably not going to shoot yourself, but the one in 1,000 chavs of you losing,

955
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
 that's it, it's all over.

956
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
 Yeah.

957
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
 Yeah, yeah.

958
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,440
 He kind of said that actually the most worrying thing when he does these climbs is not

959
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,680
 the climb itself, but it's all the extra things going on around him.

960
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:35,160
 So while he was climbing El Capitan, there was someone at the top doing a tightrope walk.

961
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,160
 And so there were people yelling to the person doing the tightrope walk and he's like,

962
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,240
 oh my gosh, really distracting. He says the drones that were coming up to him and filming him

963
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,960
 sounded like he was being attacked by wasps and he was also going, what if they lose control

964
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
 of it?

965
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
 And this blade just comes in.

966
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
 It was a big drone.

967
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,920
 So for him, it was all the extra stuff that was quite worrying about the climb.

968
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,600
 Oh, and I love that he listens to music while he's doing it.

969
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,240
 Do you know who he listens to?

970
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
 No.

971
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
 Can we guess?

972
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
 Oh, it's a genre.

973
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
 Is it fallen by Alicia Keys?

974
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
 Really?

975
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
 That's band.

976
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
 That's it.

977
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
 It's rock.

978
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
 Rock.

979
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
 Ah.

980
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
 It's very cool.

981
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
 His fingers.

982
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
 You see a lot of them in the film.

983
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
 They're just like sausages.

984
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
 Are they?

985
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
 They're amazing.

986
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
 They're very, very strong.

987
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
 Right.

988
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
 Not exactly like sausages.

989
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
 I don't think of sausages as strong.

990
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,800
 Oh, you don't go to the restaurant, so I go to.

991
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,440
 But like, I would thought you might need quite thin fingers like to get into the crevices.

992
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,800
 He does not have the slim fingers of piano player.

993
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,280
 He's got powerful fingers that you can dangle from half an hour at a time.

994
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
 Hold the whole man above.

995
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
 Yeah.

996
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,600
 He said the thing he scared of more was giving a TED Talk about his climb than actually doing

997
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,000
 the climbing himself.

998
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,320
 I had a look for some other parent and child record breakers.

999
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
 Oh, right.

1000
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,600
 I really enjoyed Charlotte and Nikki Bart, Australian mother and daughter.

1001
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,720
 First mother and daughter to climb Everest together in 2008 and being Australian.

1002
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,640
 They framed by dragging weights up and down one by beach to replicate sled and stringing

1003
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
 ladders across swimming pools and up trees.

1004
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
 Wow.

1005
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
 Then they went under loads of other peaks.

1006
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,160
 This seems to have felt some filings, I really have adrenaline and stuff in their field.

1007
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,160
 I also found the record for the father and son marathon runners and their combined time

1008
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,720
 is pretty respectable for a single person for five hours, which is not bad.

1009
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,880
 And the dad was a three minutes faster than his son.

1010
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
 So did they, they didn't run it together together?

1011
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
 They ran at the same time.

1012
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,840
 So the son in two hours, 31, dad, two hours, 27.

1013
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
 Right.

1014
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
 Lovely.

1015
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:34,120
 He was a panel like supposedly he has something to do with his amygdala and his brain.

1016
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,280
 Did you guys read that?

1017
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
 No.

1018
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,040
 So his amygdala, which is the part of your brain, which when you see something scary, it's

1019
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,120
 what makes you run away or makes you fight.

1020
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:51,560
 Apparently, when he sees disturbing images, his amygdala doesn't fire as much as normal people.

1021
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,040
 And that might be the reason why he's perfectly willing to do these incredibly stupid things.

1022
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,480
 I mean, even though he does have sticky shoes, I don't think I would.

1023
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,360
 Sticky shoes, I can't believe that.

1024
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,120
 James has knocking down the chair.

1025
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
 He's not trying to.

1026
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
 He's not trying to hear this.

1027
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
 Yeah.

1028
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,800
 And I believe that was part of the documentary.

1029
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,920
 I don't remember that scene, Andy, but he goes into an MRI and they show him scary images

1030
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,400
 and it doesn't register.

1031
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
 Yeah.

1032
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,280
 He's living, he's living in his van for the whole thing.

1033
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
 It's really interesting.

1034
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,120
 Well, we don't really know what happens when humans amygdala stops working.

1035
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,520
 They've done in the 30s.

1036
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,080
 They did some experiments on monkeys.

1037
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,840
 And they removed the amygdala and the monkey started approaching snakes and like batting them

1038
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,120
 around like sticks and playing with them.

1039
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:40,200
 And we do have one patient called patient SM, who had a condition called lipoid protinosis

1040
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,320
 where there were holes in her amygdala.

1041
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,400
 And she was like relatively normal, but they did find that on one instance, she walked

1042
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,080
 through a park alone at night, was attacked by a man with a knife and then the following

1043
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,960
 day walked again through the same park because her amygdala wasn't working.

1044
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
 Right.

1045
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,120
 He seems very normal when you hear him talk though.

1046
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
 He's a young dad.

1047
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,240
 He's got two young kids, so I listened to an interview because he's got his own podcast

1048
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,200
 now since the last few years.

1049
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
 He interviews mountaineers.

1050
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
 Oh my God.

1051
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
 Let's get him on fish.

1052
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
 Yeah.

1053
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
 Wouldn't it be wonderful?

1054
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
 He's a great speaker.

1055
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,040
 And David Lenneman was saying, would you ever consider stopping this now because you're

1056
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
 a father?

1057
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,840
 And he's like, no, because it's to me, it's calculated risk.

1058
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,400
 Can we get him on when I'm not here because I don't want him to like, I was joking about

1059
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
 the stick and shoes.

1060
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
 Yeah.

1061
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
 Is it true?

1062
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,360
 You also use chalk on your fingers, because there's another mountain that he freesolved,

1063
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,760
 which is called Zion's moonlight buttress.

1064
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,640
 And it's a 1,200 foot mountain.

1065
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,000
 And when he did it, no one believed him for a few days after it.

1066
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,680
 Even though this is, you know, half the size of El Capitan, and do you know why no one believed

1067
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,680
 him?

1068
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
 Rainy.

1069
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,680
 Because he's a big old liar.

1070
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
 Okay.

1071
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,040
 James, give us your holiday dates and we'll make sure Alex can do it.

1072
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,800
 It was because he, he, he, he ascended it on April the 1st and no one thought that it

1073
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
 was real.

1074
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,080
 And for the days after it was, yeah, they were convinced it was a prank.

1075
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,720
 Can I give you some climbing lingo and see if you can guess what I mean?

1076
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
 Yes, please.

1077
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,120
 You're arms are too far back.

1078
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
 That's nice.

1079
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
 Close.

1080
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,920
 I'm thinking like bingo wings, which is a phrase for, you know, your arms if they're a bit

1081
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
 out of shape.

1082
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,320
 Is it that your arms are juttering because you're so tired?

1083
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
 Okay.

1084
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
 Good guess.

1085
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,280
 Now, it's a jamming technique where you bend your arm, insert your arm into a crack elbow

1086
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
 first.

1087
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,120
 And then that sort of jams you so you can climb up the wall.

1088
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
 They are insane.

1089
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
 These people.

1090
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
 They are absolutely insane.

1091
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
 A pindex.

1092
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
 Oh, I know this one.

1093
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
 Oh, yeah.

1094
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,320
 If your span of your arms is longer than you are tall, isn't it?

1095
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,920
 Well, it is, is the ratio of your arms to your, your height.

1096
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
 Yeah.

1097
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,440
 So if you have a high a pindex, then you would be as you.

1098
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
 Yeah.

1099
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
 I've mentioned mine.

1100
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
 I've got a positive a pindex.

1101
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
 How do you?

1102
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,960
 My finger tip to finger tip is more than my height.

1103
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
 Really?

1104
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
 Yeah.

1105
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
 Now, that's useful for some climbers.

1106
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
 Oh, good.

1107
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
 Hey, go on, Nick.

1108
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
 And flapper.

1109
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,480
 It's if you climb, um, but you climb using a elaborate feather boa and string of

1110
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,400
 pearls as you're only in the 20s.

1111
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
 In the 20s.

1112
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
 Yeah.

1113
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
 It's not that.

1114
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,680
 It is when a large chunk of skin is ripped off your body, usually during a dynamic move.

1115
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
 A dynamic move.

1116
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
 These people are crazy.

1117
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
 A dynamic move.

1118
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
 Sliding.

1119
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1120
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
 You do get ripped up, don't you?

1121
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,080
 He wore long trousers and a t-shirt, um, but a lot of people might go topless or they might

1122
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:37,120
 go, um, well, we need to poo when he's trying to get that honey.

1123
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
 Doesn't.

1124
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,120
 That's a great remake.

1125
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
 I'd love to watch.

1126
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,360
 Um, can I give you some, uh, root names?

1127
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
 Yes.

1128
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,880
 Because if you climb a root first, you often get to name it and there are different rules

1129
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,600
 in different bits of the world about, you know, all of that, like some of them are a bit

1130
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,360
 more stonky and official, but, um, there's the excellent adventure.

1131
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,560
 It's a nice, bell and dead reference, um, too big to flail.

1132
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
 Very good.

1133
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,600
 One blunder, and it's six feet under.

1134
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
 Scar trek.

1135
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
 The next laceration.

1136
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
 I like these.

1137
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
 I like these names.

1138
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
 They're very good.

1139
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
 But no one else does.

1140
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
 No, no, no, no.

1141
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
 They're wonderful.

1142
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,960
 Because they're the fun way of saying, you're probably going to die.

1143
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
 Yeah.

1144
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,760
 But let's all have a laugh before you do.

1145
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,440
 It feels to me like they're adding jeopardy to something that doesn't need it in the first

1146
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
 place.

1147
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
 Maybe.

1148
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,320
 You know, this thing is obviously very big and scary to climb.

1149
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,160
 You don't have to call it L, shit yourself.

1150
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
 Yes.

1151
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
 Okay.

1152
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
 Well, have a guess.

1153
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,560
 See if you can guess what's special about the widow's tears root.

1154
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,680
 There's a specific clue in that name, widow's tears.

1155
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,920
 Well, when they sound, they're allowed to climb it.

1156
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
 No.

1157
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
 I know.

1158
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
 Yeah.

1159
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,480
 I read more of the mindset to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

1160
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
 Yeah.

1161
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

1162
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
 Much like making panatoni.

1163
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
 I just...

1164
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
 Okay.

1165
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
 It's time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

1166
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
 Yeah.

1167
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

1168
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
 Much like making panatoni.

1169
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
 I just...

1170
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
 Okay.

1171
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
 It is time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

1172
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
 Yeah.

1173
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

1174
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
 Much like making panatoni.

1175
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
 I just...

1176
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
 Okay.

1177
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
 It is time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall.

1178
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,480
 Yeah.

1179
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
 It's not skills that I have myself.

1180
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
 Much like making panatoni.

1181
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
 I just...

1182
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
 Okay.

1183
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,440
 It is time for our final fact to the show and that is Andy.

1184
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,360
 My fact is, when the post office had a competition to name the post office's new tower, star suggestions

1185
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:22,200
 included, Prince Philip's finger, the eye full tower, monstrosity and spud.

1186
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,040
 The name eventually chosen was the post office tower.

1187
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,040
 Brilliant.

1188
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
 Did they...

1189
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
 Did they...

1190
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
 Was the post office tower one that someone sent in?

1191
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
 Do you know?

1192
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
 No.

1193
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
 I think it was the...

1194
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
 Internally, like the post office of...

1195
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,040
 It's just...

1196
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,040
 Because this was a staff competition.

1197
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
 But there was a 10-hand prize.

1198
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,040
 So it was a 10-hand prize?

1199
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
 So it was a 10-hand prize?

1200
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,040
 Do you know?

1201
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
 It probably just went...

1202
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
 Was plowed back into the system.

1203
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
 I suppose.

1204
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 I should tell you where I got this fact.

1205
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
 There's a really exciting trip I got to do recently.

1206
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,720
 I got to go to the BT archive, which is on Holman.

1207
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
 It's not far from the office and it's a stunning place.

1208
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,280
 I just want to give a shout out to the very kind curators there who showed me around.

1209
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
 It was amazing.

1210
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,280
 It showed me the handwritten list of the finalist entries from this competition.

1211
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
 Wow.

1212
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,080
 And for international listeners, the post office tower is this massive great tower in West

1213
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,960
 London and it was the tallest building in Britain for ages and it's all for phone calls

1214
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,360
 and TV channels and communications and all of that.

1215
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,160
 And it's got this really interesting history and they had this competition to name it.

1216
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
 And...

1217
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
 Yeah.

1218
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,680
 If you've ever been to London, it's that very odd looking, like a big staff.

1219
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
 Like it's not a building.

1220
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
 It's not very wide.

1221
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,480
 It's very skinny and it's a very iconic thing in London.

1222
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
 You will have seen it if you...

1223
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
 Well, I was a kid.

1224
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,480
 It was the tallest building in London.

1225
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
 Was it right?

1226
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,880
 I think, or it had just stopped being, but if you bought a Guinness Book of Records, an old

1227
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,880
 one from a charity shop, it would say that it was the tallest building in London.

1228
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
 Right.

1229
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,480
 And it's just turned 60 this year.

1230
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,880
 So yeah, big anniversary.

1231
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,880
 And that's very cool, Andy.

1232
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
 You got to see that list.

1233
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
 Oh, it was awesome.

1234
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
 Did you tell you about the cafe because I'm obsessed with the cafe at the top?

1235
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,480
 Was there a rotating cafe at the top?

1236
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
 It's crazy.

1237
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,160
 I'm so sad that you can't go and visit that because I also didn't realise I assumed the whole

1238
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
 thing rotated.

1239
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,440
 But I read that if the waiters didn't, like, if your table would, like, go past and it'd

1240
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,360
 like run off to you or wait for you to come back, like, with your next course, if they

1241
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
 got the timings wrong.

1242
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
 Really?

1243
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
 Yeah.

1244
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
 It took 23 minutes to go round.

1245
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,160
 But the central bit, obviously, it doesn't, it can't all rotate.

1246
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
 I assumed it altered.

1247
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
 Yeah.

1248
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
 Well, so your table would go like...

1249
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,880
 I've been to a few of those and they do all rotate.

1250
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,880
 Do they?

1251
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,880
 Yeah.

1252
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,920
 The system in the middle that's turning stuff around is enclosed, right?

1253
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,960
 No, here, there is the kitchens and the waiters bit, as you say, Anne, is stationary and

1254
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,160
 the waiter has to carefully step onto the moving bit.

1255
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,200
 Yeah, we don't really get rotating restaurants anymore.

1256
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,960
 Like, there are very 60s and 70s things built, I think.

1257
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
 Oh, yeah.

1258
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
 There was one in Liverpool.

1259
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
 I don't know if it's still there.

1260
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
 I don't think it rotates anymore.

1261
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,640
 Okay.

1262
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
 Yeah, there was one in Hong Kong.

1263
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,640
 I used to go to growing up.

1264
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
 Maybe on a Vienna as well.

1265
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,640
 It's like a new effect for the view.

1266
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,520
 Yeah, it's a wonderful idea.

1267
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,760
 Mentioning the restaurant is really interesting because you would expect, as the post office

1268
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,600
 tower, which had a genuine reason to exist.

1269
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,720
 It was helping with communications throughout Britain.

1270
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,600
 It was this beacon of communication.

1271
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,120
 But very randomly, they did open a restaurant that was available to the public and which was

1272
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
 run by Butland.

1273
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
 Oh, yeah.

1274
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
 I think I heard about Butland.

1275
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
 Yeah.

1276
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,120
 Yeah, so weird.

1277
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,160
 And it feels like this was the original London eye because everything was sort of designed

1278
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
 to have the...

1279
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
 A tourist spot.

1280
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
 A tourist spot.

1281
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,440
 You know, you went in the elevator, which was the fastest in Britain, supposedly at the time.

1282
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,440
 You would go up.

1283
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,400
 The ushers who would put you in there were termed space flight conductors.

1284
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
 You know, they...

1285
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,240
 And when you go to London eye, it's pretty similar wordage when it was run by B.A.

1286
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,400
 You know, that they would use.

1287
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,840
 And yeah, about 50,000 people visited it in the first few weeks alone and one and a half

1288
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,280
 million in the first year.

1289
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,080
 And one of the people who went there was the Queen.

1290
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,840
 Queen Liz for the second who went for dinner with Billy Butland.

1291
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,840
 Really?

1292
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,520
 Could we say why it was set up?

1293
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,520
 Absolutely.

1294
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,520
 I suppose it was Tower.

1295
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,520
 Yeah.

1296
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,520
 So I didn't know this really.

1297
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,680
 But basically, there was this big need for more broadcasting capacity.

1298
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,680
 And they had two options.

1299
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,440
 They could either do it with underground cables, which would be a lot neater, but would involve

1300
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,400
 a lot more mess putting them in because you basically have to dig up the route into central

1301
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,160
 London or loads of routes into central London, like huge pain to do.

1302
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,880
 Or you just use a radio tower that's so tall that the beams don't get interrupted

1303
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
 by existing buildings.

1304
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,280
 And they literally just had to build something higher than they used microwave radio channels.

1305
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
 That was the big thing.

1306
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,200
 So let make people make phone calls, did it?

1307
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,200
 It was phone calls and TV channels, so it could handle 150,000 phone calls simultaneously

1308
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,800
 and 40 TV channels.

1309
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,880
 So it was a big improvement on the previous system.

1310
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,840
 And it was covered in these big things called microwave horns, which is these huge triangular

1311
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
 blocks.

1312
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,480
 And basically, just to absorb and soak up microwave signals, it's such a cool thing.

1313
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,480
 Yeah.

1314
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,480
 Love it.

1315
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,680
 It's called Eric Bedford, who is the chief architect of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works.

1316
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:59,240
 And he made it, he said, to be sort of nuclear proof, which kind of got a little test when

1317
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,680
 a bomb went off in the bathroom of the restaurant, which is the reason it's no longer open to

1318
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,680
 the public.

1319
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,680
 Wasn't that nuclear bomb?

1320
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
 We should say.

1321
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,680
 We should add that.

1322
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,680
 Yeah.

1323
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,680
 That's a good detail to add.

1324
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,680
 Absolutely.

1325
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,680
 Yeah.

1326
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,680
 It was a regular bomb.

1327
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,680
 No one died.

1328
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,000
 Cars and buildings around it had their windows go in.

1329
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,240
 And it was the IRA.

1330
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
 What did it?

1331
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
 Apparently.

1332
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,240
 The Angry Brigade.

1333
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,000
 Well, I think we think it was the IRA because it had all the hallmarks of an IRA attack.

1334
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,360
 And the IRA also said that they did it.

1335
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,800
 But then there was also this group called the Angry Gade, who was like a left wing anarchist

1336
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,800
 group.

1337
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,280
 Then they also said they did it.

1338
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,720
 But I think the general consensus is that the angry people sort of jumped on the chance

1339
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,360
 of claiming it for themselves.

1340
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,040
 It's much easier, isn't it?

1341
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:49,720
 To claim you've committed a big attack than to actually go to all the hassle of planning

1342
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,720
 and conducting it.

1343
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,720
 Yeah.

1344
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,480
 You are reliant on other people to do the work for you.

1345
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
 Yeah.

1346
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
 It's not a reliable gig.

1347
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
 No.

1348
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,120
 This is why it was an official secret for so long that we're actually was.

1349
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
 That's also...

1350
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,120
 Would that explain that more?

1351
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,800
 Because that's so fascinating.

1352
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,960
 You can't miss this tower.

1353
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
 Yeah.

1354
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,960
 It's in Central London.

1355
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,160
 It's towering above everything else, yet it didn't officially exist.

1356
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
 Yeah.

1357
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,160
 Maybe you saw your trip.

1358
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,160
 I see it debunked a bit.

1359
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,240
 I feel like you couldn't put it on an ordinary and sorry map, but you could.

1360
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,160
 But I think you weren't supposed to say where it was, but it was really, really big.

1361
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,640
 It was definitely up and everywhere.

1362
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,320
 It was on some ardent survey maps, but not all of them.

1363
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
 It's really weird.

1364
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,320
 Yeah.

1365
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,720
 And there was this theory, or there's this long-held thing that you couldn't take a photo

1366
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,120
 of it legally, or you'd be arrested if you took a photo of one of the biggest landmarks

1367
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,960
 in literally the tallest thing in the country.

1368
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,580
 I think what is true is if you took a photo of it and gave it to an enemy of Britain,

1369
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,580
 you could get done for it.

1370
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,580
 Oh, yeah.

1371
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,580
 I think that's fair.

1372
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,740
 And that's true of anything that's used for communications in the UK.

1373
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,180
 Any building that makes stuff for the Navy.

1374
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,940
 There's a whole load of list of things that you're just not allowed to take photos of it

1375
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,940
 and give it to Russia.

1376
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,940
 So are they?

1377
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,940
 Are they like below the Google maps then?

1378
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,940
 I don't know.

1379
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,660
 Because I remember when I went to Dartmore years ago, this is in the ordnance of the

1380
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,660
 map.

1381
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,660
 This is a big block in the middle, and just say, I don't know.

1382
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1383
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,660
 But literally the post office had issued stamps of this thing.

1384
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,660
 Yeah.

1385
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,660
 Well, it was built.

1386
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,460
 I mean, it was, it was definitely, yeah, it was built up there.

1387
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:15,660
 It was, I think, part of a communications network that was kind of a Cold War thing, which

1388
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,260
 was why Bedford had supposedly designed it to be nuclear bomb proof.

1389
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,860
 I mean, it's clearly not nuclear bomb proof, depending on how close the bomb goes off,

1390
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,860
 but whatever.

1391
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,260
 But in the event of a nuclear war, I think it would have been part of the backbone system

1392
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,260
 to provide secure communications.

1393
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,620
 I don't think it's needed anymore now.

1394
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,620
 I do.

1395
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,340
 So you can, if you'd like, take a photo and hand it to Britain's enemies.

1396
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,340
 I like Danza.

1397
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,340
 Don't, don't.

1398
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,340
 I mean, don't.

1399
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,340
 You know.

1400
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,020
 Danza, yeah, if they had sold it as, like, more as the London Eye, because maybe the London

1401
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,740
 Eye's got a purpose we don't know about.

1402
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,740
 Oh, 100%.

1403
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,740
 Really?

1404
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,740
 That's such a good point.

1405
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,740
 Yeah, obviously.

1406
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,740
 Hundie pay.

1407
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,740
 Obviously.

1408
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,740
 Really?

1409
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,740
 They sold one and a half thousand plastic towers when they first opened in the gift shop

1410
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,740
 in the first few weeks.

1411
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,740
 Oh, that makes sense.

1412
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
 This is so cool.

1413
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,740
 Yeah, it makes sense.

1414
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,740
 Like, what else?

1415
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,740
 Like, if you're going to hide it in plain sight, you have to give it another purpose.

1416
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,740
 All of those will have made their way to Moscow for further study.

1417
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,740
 I presume.

1418
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,740
 Like, yeah.

1419
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,740
 It's a secret.

1420
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,740
 Oh, we are selling skill models in the gift shop.

1421
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,740
 They've had teams of tiny, tiny, tiny spies looking at those in detail.

1422
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,140
 It appears that the post office tower was made in Taiwan.

1423
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,100
 And the London Eye clearly is designed to come off the central spoke and roll.

1424
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,700
 Yeah, it's a giant youth cycle.

1425
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,340
 Yeah, it's to get, like, all the most important people in London out.

1426
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,940
 Oh, so they each get in a pod.

1427
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,940
 You dismantle it.

1428
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,940
 And then it rolls out.

1429
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,940
 And then it just rolls down the Thames into the sea.

1430
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,940
 Yeah, exactly.

1431
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,940
 So, yes, really.

1432
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,940
 Yes, sorry.

1433
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,940
 And the final piece of cement on the post office tower was laid by Geoffrey Rippon MP.

1434
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,940
 At the top, right at the bottom, at the top.

1435
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,940
 I would say unloom to the pod.

1436
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,940
 Unknown to the pub.

1437
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,940
 It's never been on.

1438
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,940
 He was our chief negotiator to the EEC in the 1970s.

1439
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,940
 So you say, how are you?

1440
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,940
 I mean Britain's not.

1441
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,940
 We didn't fish.

1442
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,940
 We're not negotiating with the EEC.

1443
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,940
 We haven't been in that long.

1444
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,940
 We haven't.

1445
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,940
 And the one thing I read about him from his old b*tchery is he had an enduring dislike

1446
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,940
 of the d*tch.

1447
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,940
 Oh.

1448
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,940
 Oh.

1449
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,940
 That's in the obituary.

1450
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,940
 God, that's really got to be enduring if it's in the obituary.

1451
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,940
 It's amazing.

1452
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,940
 So he was negotiating.

1453
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,940
 And everyone had told him that the d*tch loved the British.

1454
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,940
 And Charles De Gaulle said, you have a d*tchery always on the British side.

1455
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,940
 But then when they did negotiating, the d*tchery actually quite against the British.

1456
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,940
 And he really took that to his grave.

1457
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,940
 He really hated the d*tch.

1458
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,940
 Wow.

1459
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,940
 It's just so random.

1460
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,940
 Gosh.

1461
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,940
 Apologies to our d*tch listeners.

1462
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,940
 Secret buildings.

1463
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,940
 Yeah.

1464
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,940
 Just as the first of a tower is this big secret thing.

1465
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,940
 And I know you're very much into your espionage.

1466
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,940
 Not to say too much.

1467
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,940
 Not to say too much.

1468
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,940
 Not to say too much.

1469
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,940
 Not to say too much.

1470
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,940
 Not to give too much away.

1471
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:46,940
 But you've had to come from across the river to make the recording.

1472
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,940
 And does not show up on any photos, any maps.

1473
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
 She's just blurred.

1474
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,940
 For listeners, Andy was touching his nose suggestively throughout the last two minutes.

1475
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,940
 I think that can be heard.

1476
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,940
 I think that can be literally heard.

1477
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:06,940
 So Voxel Cross, which is the building, the very famous head of the secret intelligence service.

1478
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,940
 The one that's on the South Bank of the Thames.

1479
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,940
 The one that's on the South Bank of the Thames.

1480
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,940
 You see it in James Bond?

1481
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,940
 Yeah.

1482
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,940
 It's a bit of it gets blown up in that film.

1483
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,940
 One of the one of the Daniel Craig ones.

1484
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,940
 It's a terrific building.

1485
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,940
 It looks really straight.

1486
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,940
 Yeah.

1487
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,940
 You know, it looks quite striking.

1488
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,940
 But I really like this.

1489
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,940
 So basically, there were some clues that it was going to be a secret building.

1490
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,940
 Because the government bought the site outright for 135 million quid.

1491
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,940
 Normally, they would pay in chunks and there would be total accountability and transparency at every stage.

1492
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,940
 And the government just said, no, we're going to buy this for 130 million quid.

1493
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,940
 Right.

1494
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,940
 No questions.

1495
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,940
 Go away, please.

1496
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,940
 Yeah, exactly.

1497
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,940
 But the architect was a guy called Terry Farrell.

1498
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,940
 And he just died.

1499
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,940
 He did loads of stuff.

1500
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,940
 He also did the HQ for ITV's TVAM.

1501
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,940
 So he's done some big gigs.

1502
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,940
 Which they built the building, not purpose built.

1503
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,940
 And they just said, we'll have this.

1504
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,940
 This is the crazy thing.

1505
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,940
 Yeah.

1506
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,940
 He was basically instructed to build a standard office block, which then was going to get some more of a case.

1507
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,940
 It's like, yeah, it can blast up.

1508
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,940
 Roll down the tent.

1509
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,940
 Roll down the tent.

1510
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,940
 Yeah, exactly.

1511
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,940
 The London I will pour at the MI6.

1512
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,940
 Pick everyone up.

1513
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,940
 That's pod 12.

1514
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,940
 No, but he didn't know who he was working for really.

1515
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,940
 He knew he was making a government department.

1516
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,940
 And he guessed it was going to be the department of the environment.

1517
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,940
 Which is why, if you look closely, which you're not allowed to do, there are lots of fir tree designs.

1518
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,940
 Halfway at the facade of the edge.

1519
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,940
 Because he thought it was going to be the environment ministry.

1520
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,940
 How presumptuous.

1521
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,940
 I've been to the to the bottom to the outside of that building.

1522
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,940
 It was quite fun when you look for a Wi-Fi.

1523
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,940
 It says things like MI6 surveillance van.

1524
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,940
 And it's obviously local people who live in the area who just name their things.

1525
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,940
 Is it?

1526
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,940
 Is it double bluff?

1527
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,940
 It's a perfect double bluff.

1528
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,940
 Is it true?

1529
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,940
 That's true.

1530
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,940
 Did you try and connect to the Wi-Fi, Dan?

1531
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,940
 I did.

1532
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,940
 Gosh.

1533
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,940
 MI6 is going to be absolutely all over you, Dan.

1534
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:01,940
 Can I see my favourite recent public name suggestions story that I found?

1535
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,940
 Oh, yeah.

1536
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,940
 Every year, in the UK, there were issues every year with leaves on the track.

1537
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,940
 And the trains can't run.

1538
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,940
 So networked real to combat this.

1539
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,940
 Had these special trains.

1540
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,940
 And they got a high pressure of water jets.

1541
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,940
 Like, last of all, keep them clean.

1542
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,940
 Keep everything running.

1543
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,940
 They held a public list of public suggestions for us to name the new special leaf fighting train.

1544
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,940
 You guys want to guess what they could be called?

1545
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,940
 I genuinely love the name that one.

1546
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,940
 Okay.

1547
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,940
 I'll tell you some contenders to get you started.

1548
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,940
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1549
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,940
 So contenders who did not win.

1550
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,940
 Brittany clears.

1551
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,940
 Oh, that's good.

1552
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,940
 Um, leaf full weapon.

1553
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,940
 Yeah, I like it.

1554
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,940
 And it's a bit say yellow anti leaf machinery.

1555
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,940
 That was my one I was going to suggest.

1556
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,940
 It's massive.

1557
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,940
 So that one did not win.

1558
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,940
 Um, leaf us alone.

1559
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,940
 Yeah, pretty good.

1560
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,940
 Leaf Ericsson.

1561
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,940
 Who's that?

1562
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,940
 Me, sure.

1563
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,940
 Why doesn't that win?

1564
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,940
 That's crazy.

1565
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,940
 Jays, Mr. Dad, like to send it in.

1566
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,940
 Leaf, yeah, by 800 years.

1567
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,940
 I'm serious.

1568
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,940
 Leaf and Skewder.

1569
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,940
 I mean, for the podcast, right?

1570
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,940
 Um, chlorophyll, your boots.

1571
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,940
 Go on.

1572
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,940
 Leafs contain chlorophyll.

1573
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,940
 Fill your boots as a phrase.

1574
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,940
 Yeah.

1575
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,940
 They went with control out the leaf.

1576
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,940
 That's very good.

1577
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,940
 That's what they went with.

1578
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,940
 That's good rap.

1579
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,940
 That's very good.

1580
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,940
 Really like that.

1581
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,940
 It's a bit better than chlorophyll.

1582
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,940
 Yeah.

1583
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,940
 Yeah.

1584
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,940
 Okay.

1585
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,940
 That's it.

1586
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,940
 That is all of our facts.

1587
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,940
 Thank you so much for listening.

1588
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:35,940
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said, we are

1589
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,940
 all online.

1590
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,940
 I'm on Instagram on @Shriberland.

1591
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,940
 Andy.

1592
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,940
 So at Android 100.

1593
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,940
 And James.

1594
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,940
 Nice.

1595
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,940
 Graham is no 16 to James Harkin.

1596
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,940
 And.

1597
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,940
 And.

1598
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,940
 And my Insta is @Millabooks.

1599
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,940
 Nice.

1600
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,940
 And, uh, you can get to us all as well if you want to via podcast@QI.com.

1601
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,740
 Why not send us some questions, send us some interesting facts.

1602
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,340
 Andy goes through all of these emails.

1603
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,660
 He cherry picks the best of them.

1604
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,940
 And they make their way to our special secret bonus episode called Drop Us Align, which

1605
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,780
 is part of Club Fish.

1606
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,940
 If you're not a Club Fish member, can I recommend checking it out?

1607
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,780
 We have lots of tears on Patreon.

1608
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,980
 There's so many fun things that we're going to be doing with it.

1609
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,980
 Do check it out.

1610
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,980
 It's really fun.

1611
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,380
 You can do that by going to know such thing as a fish.com.

1612
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,980
 You'll find all of our previous episodes up there as well.

1613
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,740
 Otherwise, just come back next week because we're going to be back here with another episode.

1614
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,740
 We will see you then.

1615
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,740
 Good.

1616
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:25,740
 Bye.
