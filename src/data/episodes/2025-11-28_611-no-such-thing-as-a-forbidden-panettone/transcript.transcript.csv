00:00:02,00:00:05,"Everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Where We Were"
00:00:05,00:00:10,Chained by someone who a lot of you will be very excited to hear.
00:00:10,00:00:11,Yes.
00:00:11,00:00:12,It's the return of Ann Miller.
00:00:12,00:00:13,The comeback.
00:00:13,00:00:16,Our colleague Ann joined us for this week's episode.
00:00:16,00:00:18,It was so nice having her back on.
00:00:18,00:00:20,"She had a classic Ann Fack, which you're about to hear."
00:00:20,00:00:23,And it was just great. It was a really nice episode.
00:00:23,00:00:24,I love you to have her back.
00:00:24,00:00:27,Does she have anything that we can plug at the top of the show this week?
00:00:27,00:00:29,"She does, actually. She's got a book coming"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"in, I think it's coming in a few months time,"
00:00:31,00:00:33,but it's available to pre-order now.
00:00:33,00:00:36,And it's called Monster Diaries.
00:00:36,00:00:37,I think there's going to be a few of them.
00:00:37,00:00:38,I hope so anyway.
00:00:38,00:00:41,"And basically, it's kind of classical stories"
00:00:41,00:00:42,where there's often a monster.
00:00:42,00:00:43,Like Greek Mets and stuff.
00:00:43,00:00:45,"Exactly, but from the monster's point of view."
00:00:45,00:00:46,"Oh, very similar."
00:00:46,00:00:48,"So the first one is about the Cyclops,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,but it's the Cyclops getting to tell his side of the story.
00:00:50,00:00:51,"And it's just, it's a lovely idea."
00:00:51,00:00:52,They're beautifully illustrated.
00:00:52,00:00:54,I've seen the drawings that have been going into them.
00:00:54,00:00:56,So that is highly recommended.
00:00:56,00:00:57,The Monster Diaries.
00:00:57,00:01:00,"By Anne Miller and indeed, if you go to the places where you buy books,"
00:01:00,00:01:03,you'll find all of Anne's other books.
00:01:03,00:01:04,She's written a whole lot of them.
00:01:04,00:01:06,"Yes, exactly."
00:01:06,00:01:08,And one more thing to say before we start.
00:01:08,00:01:08,Gone.
00:01:08,00:01:09,Christmas is coming.
00:01:09,00:01:10,The goose is getting fat.
00:01:10,00:01:12,"Please, but a penny?"
00:01:12,00:01:14,In the old man's hat.
00:01:14,00:01:15,Feels stingy.
00:01:15,00:01:19,"Um, but you might be thinking about what to get your loved ones for Christmas."
00:01:19,00:01:20,Yeah.
00:01:20,00:01:22,"And you might be thinking, oh, it's so hard"
00:01:22,00:01:24,to buy a physical object for people.
00:01:24,00:01:26,I'm thinking what to buy my wife.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"Well, what she really loves to hear is my voice more and more."
00:01:30,00:01:31,She doesn't get nearly enough of it.
00:01:31,00:01:32,Absolutely.
00:01:32,00:01:35,"Well, James, you should buy her access to Club Fish."
00:01:35,00:01:36,Oh.
00:01:36,00:01:37,Yeah.
00:01:37,00:01:41,It's the members club that we have where you can get extra content.
00:01:41,00:01:43,You can get ad-free episodes of Fish.
00:01:43,00:01:45,And you can get all sorts of stuff.
00:01:45,00:01:46,And there are a few different tiers you can do.
00:01:46,00:01:49,Up to the very top tier where we're going to be doing a quarterly quiz.
00:01:49,00:01:51,The first of those is coming up soon.
00:01:51,00:01:55,And it's going to be so much fun on Zoom with all of your members.
00:01:55,00:01:57,"So, uh, it's really fun."
00:01:57,00:01:59,It's a great present to give someone.
00:01:59,00:02:01,Because it's an experience.
00:02:01,00:02:02,Absolutely.
00:02:02,00:02:04,I'm going to get my wife one straight away.
00:02:04,00:02:06,I'm going to send that sports car back.
00:02:06,00:02:07,She'll be delighted.
00:02:07,00:02:08,[LAUGHS]
00:02:08,00:02:09,Excellent.
00:02:09,00:02:11,"James, how do people find out more about this Club Fish place?"
00:02:11,00:02:15,I would imagine you probably go to patreon.com/nosephix.
00:02:15,00:02:17,I think you're right.
00:02:17,00:02:17,You are right.
00:02:17,00:02:18,That's where you go.
00:02:18,00:02:20,Patreon.com/nosephix.
00:02:20,00:02:21,Go and check it out.
00:02:21,00:02:22,It's so much fun.
00:02:22,00:02:24,It will make a lovely present for anyone in your life who likes Fish.
00:02:24,00:02:25,"Well, you know what?"
00:02:25,00:02:26,You deserve a present too.
00:02:26,00:02:28,You sure do.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Treat yourself.
00:02:29,00:02:30,All right.
00:02:30,00:02:31,"I think outside, isn't it?"
00:02:31,00:02:32,That's all we have to say.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Merry Christmas to come.
00:02:33,00:02:34,On with the podcast.
00:02:34,00:02:35,On with the show.
00:02:35,00:02:37,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:02:52,00:02:54,Hello and welcome to another episode.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:02:57,00:03:00,from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:03:00,00:03:01,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:03:01,00:03:04,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:03:04,00:03:05,and Ann Meller.
00:03:05,00:03:08,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:03:08,00:03:10,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:03:10,00:03:13,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:03:13,00:03:17,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Ann."
00:03:17,00:03:20,"After you bake panatoni, you have to hang them upside down"
00:03:20,00:03:22,like that's.
00:03:22,00:03:24,So cute.
00:03:24,00:03:26,I would say this is a vintage Ann Meller fact.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"And that it's interesting, but it's also quite sweet."
00:03:28,00:03:29,Yeah.
00:03:29,00:03:29,What a return.
00:03:29,00:03:30,Yeah.
00:03:30,00:03:31,What a return.
00:03:31,00:03:32,And Christmas is coming.
00:03:32,00:03:33,Christmas is coming.
00:03:33,00:03:33,So why?
00:03:33,00:03:34,Why do you have to?
00:03:34,00:03:36,So I got very interested in a big deep dive
00:03:36,00:03:38,about how you make traditional panatoni.
00:03:38,00:03:42,And the result was I became desperate to eat very high quality
00:03:42,00:03:42,in the toning.
00:03:42,00:03:45,How deep is the deep dive on panatoning?
00:03:45,00:03:46,I'll send you the links.
00:03:46,00:03:47,Some great articles.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"Basically, traditional panatoni is wildly"
00:03:49,00:03:50,controversial to make.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"It's a lot of very expensive ingredients,"
00:03:52,00:03:55,"sip butter, and eggs and fruit."
00:03:55,00:03:58,Actually half the volume of panatoni is butter on a proper one.
00:03:58,00:03:59,That's why it tastes so good.
00:03:59,00:04:00,"Oh, there it is."
00:04:00,00:04:01,So great.
00:04:01,00:04:02,And it's--
00:04:02,00:04:04,"This just made me think I've never had a good panatoni,"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"because I think of it as being a dry, otherwise--"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"So I did see someone saying that if you need to butter it,"
00:04:10,00:04:11,it's not a traditional one.
00:04:11,00:04:13,It's also a really lengthy process.
00:04:13,00:04:16,"And at the end, all this care you've"
00:04:16,00:04:18,"made to your panatoni, if you don't flip it upside down"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"really quickly, it's quickly as 20 seconds."
00:04:20,00:04:22,The dome was up to cave in.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"So the picture I found online, which I love,"
00:04:24,00:04:27,"is this big wire rack with panatoni's hanging upside down,"
00:04:27,00:04:29,"which suggests if you were to examine,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,"as I will do this, Christmas, the bottom of your panatoni."
00:04:31,00:04:34,And you see little holes where the wires have gone through.
00:04:34,00:04:36,So they're hanging upside down to cool.
00:04:36,00:04:38,Or another method is you can pop it upside down
00:04:38,00:04:39,in a wicker basket.
00:04:39,00:04:42,And it's about eight hours of upside down hanging
00:04:42,00:04:43,for it to settle.
00:04:43,00:04:44,"Well, that's what I read."
00:04:44,00:04:45,I've never made a panatoni.
00:04:45,00:04:46,I've definitely--
00:04:46,00:04:47,I wanted to until I read this.
00:04:47,00:04:48,So you've not done this.
00:04:48,00:04:51,I've decided it was going to take one man was 86.
00:04:51,00:04:52,I've had been working since he was a child.
00:04:52,00:04:54,"And I can't compete with that, Dan."
00:04:54,00:04:55,It sounds so hard.
00:04:55,00:04:56,It sounds so hard.
00:04:56,00:04:59,"When you make some food or make anything in life,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,you don't have to compete with a person who
00:05:01,00:05:02,is the absolute best at it.
00:05:02,00:05:05,"But I want to sample this one, not have a very inferior one,"
00:05:05,00:05:06,made by me.
00:05:06,00:05:09,But you have picked the extreme end of panatoni
00:05:09,00:05:10,making in your example.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"It's like saying, I decided not to become a footballer,"
00:05:13,00:05:14,because David Beckham exists.
00:05:14,00:05:15,"Well, exactly."
00:05:15,00:05:16,"I don't play football, Dan."
00:05:16,00:05:19,"Well, she is a QI researcher, and she's the best QI researcher."
00:05:19,00:05:21,"Yes, that's a lot about us, yeah."
00:05:21,00:05:24,And was this Nicola Fiasconardo?
00:05:24,00:05:25,I think so.
00:05:25,00:05:28,So he is a Sicilian master baker.
00:05:28,00:05:32,"And the profile of him started out with saying,"
00:05:32,00:05:36,"this is a man who has baked panatoni for not one, not two,"
00:05:36,00:05:40,but three different popes.
00:05:40,00:05:41,That's just clearly good.
00:05:41,00:05:42,But we've had quite a few popes.
00:05:42,00:05:44,We've been through a lot of them here.
00:05:44,00:05:45,Yeah.
00:05:45,00:05:47,And what killed them?
00:05:47,00:05:51,One of them was intering this master panatoni maker.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"And they said, we rang the shop to make sure he would be"
00:05:53,00:05:55,there ahead of our visit.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"And they said, he is always here."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"Right, lovely."
00:05:58,00:05:58,But it's amazing.
00:05:58,00:06:01,So they also have this special yeast.
00:06:01,00:06:04,"And in one bakery, they have been using the same local resource"
00:06:04,00:06:08,"yeast since 1922, has to be fed with flour and water every four"
00:06:08,00:06:09,hours.
00:06:09,00:06:10,What?
00:06:10,00:06:12,Every four hours since 1922.
00:06:12,00:06:15,I can see why you've now pulled out the pudding involved.
00:06:15,00:06:16,That must be very strong.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Well, yeah."
00:06:17,00:06:19,"I mean, Italy's been through a lot of upheaval in the--"
00:06:19,00:06:20,That's interesting.
00:06:20,00:06:22,"--since 1922, like they've had fascism, they've had the war."
00:06:22,00:06:24,How long has Italy actually existed?
00:06:24,00:06:25,"It's 1870s, I think."
00:06:25,00:06:28,So it's like a lot more than that.
00:06:28,00:06:30,That yeast is almost as old as Italy.
00:06:30,00:06:31,That's amazing.
00:06:31,00:06:34,"You, Andy, just mentioned that it possibly took out three"
00:06:34,00:06:36,popes.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"Yeah, I'd like to roll back from that a bit."
00:06:38,00:06:40,"But what's interesting is it most likely hasn't,"
00:06:40,00:06:43,because God is on the side of the panatoni.
00:06:43,00:06:43,Right.
00:06:43,00:06:46,Because we're assuming that God is on the side of those
00:06:46,00:06:47,popes as well.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Absolutely.
00:06:48,00:06:50,They're not still here as I'll have say it.
00:06:50,00:06:52,I think God is Italian.
00:06:52,00:06:52,Yeah.
00:06:52,00:06:54,God is Italian.
00:06:54,00:06:57,Because the patron saint of choking and sore
00:06:57,00:07:00,throats and so on is connected to panatoni.
00:07:00,00:07:02,San Biagio.
00:07:02,00:07:04,This is an amazing character.
00:07:04,00:07:04,St. Blaze.
00:07:04,00:07:09,St. Blaze for those who speak non-italian.
00:07:09,00:07:11,Other languages are available.
00:07:11,00:07:13,"But yeah, I mean, interesting character."
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Born in Armenia, lived in the third and fourth centuries."
00:07:15,00:07:18,And he got beatified and made into a saint
00:07:18,00:07:21,because of miracles that were to do largely
00:07:21,00:07:22,with saving people from choking.
00:07:22,00:07:23,At least that was the main one.
00:07:23,00:07:25,There was a kid that was choking on something.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"And he came, managed to take it out."
00:07:28,00:07:29,And there was a miracle.
00:07:29,00:07:32,He convinced a wolf to return a stolen pig.
00:07:32,00:07:35,That was another reason for him being beatified.
00:07:35,00:07:37,"Returned him to the house, but it was made of straw."
00:07:37,00:07:39,So it got him blown down.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"When you said patron saint of choking,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,I couldn't quite work out what is more like the patron saint
00:07:43,00:07:44,of not choking.
00:07:44,00:07:45,Sothras.
00:07:45,00:07:46,Being saved.
00:07:46,00:07:47,He's also being saved from.
00:07:47,00:07:51,"Just to say as well, he is a patron saint of wolf comas."
00:07:51,00:07:54,So wolf comas are people who comb sheep.
00:07:54,00:07:58,"And they use really, really long sort of like a head brush."
00:07:58,00:08:00,But it's like got nails in it.
00:08:00,00:08:01,These wolf coms.
00:08:01,00:08:02,But he's the patron saint of that.
00:08:02,00:08:05,And the reason he's the patron saint of wolf comas
00:08:05,00:08:08,"is because before he was beheaded, he was beaten with wolf coms."
00:08:08,00:08:09,Oh no.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Right.
00:08:10,00:08:13,"Sothras, yeah, they're of the patron saint of something that killed them."
00:08:13,00:08:14,Doesn't seem right.
00:08:14,00:08:15,Doesn't seem right.
00:08:15,00:08:16,It's not fair.
00:08:16,00:08:22,"I think panatone, you might be a classic Harkin singular plural problem."
00:08:22,00:08:23,"Oh, panatone."
00:08:23,00:08:26,Panatone E with an eye is the plural.
00:08:26,00:08:30,And panatone Neh with an E is the singular.
00:08:30,00:08:31,Interesting.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"So should we all be saying, are we saying it wrong?"
00:08:33,00:08:36,"Should we be saying, would you like some panatone Neh?"
00:08:36,00:08:39,I would say panatonees does feel weird when you say it.
00:08:39,00:08:40,They don't usually eat more than they.
00:08:40,00:08:42,"Yeah, no, they'd like stuff at two."
00:08:42,00:08:43,Stop but two.
00:08:43,00:08:44,Half butter.
00:08:44,00:08:48,They put it so there's no plural because no one's ever had to panatone.
00:08:48,00:08:52,It's mentioned in a book by a chef called Friend of the Podcast.
00:08:52,00:08:54,Bartolomeo Shapi.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Oh yeah.
00:08:55,00:08:56,Spelt Scappy.
00:08:56,00:08:58,What's he friend of us for?
00:08:58,00:08:59,He was Friend of the Podcast.
00:08:59,00:09:02,He is the one who cooked for many popes
00:09:02,00:09:06,and made incredible elaborate dishes and banquets.
00:09:06,00:09:07,"And then a new Pope came in and said,"
00:09:07,00:09:11,"""No, I just want a lot of old egg from now on."""
00:09:11,00:09:12,And so he kind of lost it.
00:09:12,00:09:13,But he wrote one of the first big cookbooks.
00:09:13,00:09:16,So it was it was mentioned we think in a book by him.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"But they're all these kind of enriched breads,"
00:09:18,00:09:21,"which are fruit and fruit peel and you know, all of this stuff."
00:09:21,00:09:24,So it's a bit murky where it truly is.
00:09:24,00:09:26,One of them is the Baba.
00:09:26,00:09:28,I don't know if you know about Babas.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"You get Babas from Poland and other Slavic countries,"
00:09:30,00:09:33,but I think they probably came from panatonees
00:09:33,00:09:35,and then they turn them into Babas.
00:09:35,00:09:39,But the way that you make them is really regimented.
00:09:39,00:09:41,It's almost like the Baba is a baby.
00:09:41,00:09:44,So men are not allowed to enter the kitchen
00:09:44,00:09:45,while they're being made.
00:09:45,00:09:47,Do you have to whisper while you're cooking it
00:09:47,00:09:49,in case it starts crying?
00:09:49,00:09:50,"Oh, I guess."
00:09:50,00:09:51,That's lovely.
00:09:51,00:09:54,And also you have to leave it to rest on a piece of eye
00:09:54,00:09:56,to down before putting it in the oven.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Outside down a regular way.
00:09:57,00:09:58,Regular way.
00:09:58,00:10:00,The advice has changed since the 1960s.
00:10:00,00:10:03,You used to have to put it upside down.
00:10:03,00:10:05,But never put it in with the parents.
00:10:05,00:10:06,"Well, do you always put it in with the parents?"
00:10:06,00:10:08,I can't imagine that at a time.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"Do you know what it means, panatone?"
00:10:10,00:10:13,"I read one, the etymology that it was invented by a guy"
00:10:13,00:10:13,called Tony.
00:10:13,00:10:14,I love that so much.
00:10:14,00:10:15,It's so good.
00:10:15,00:10:16,"I mean, it's anti-tree, right?"
00:10:16,00:10:18,I think it just means big bread.
00:10:18,00:10:21,Because the One means big as a suffix.
00:10:21,00:10:23,"So it's panne, obviously, at One."
00:10:23,00:10:25,And I didn't know this.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"You know, in Italian, calzone."
00:10:28,00:10:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:29,00:10:31,That is a big legging.
00:10:31,00:10:32,What?
00:10:32,00:10:33,Calzone is a legging.
00:10:33,00:10:34,"What do you mean, legging?"
00:10:34,00:10:35,Like a legging.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"Like you wear leggings, you know?"
00:10:36,00:10:37,That's tight.
00:10:37,00:10:38,"Oh, like a tie."
00:10:38,00:10:39,So calzone is a legging.
00:10:39,00:10:42,And calzone literally means trousers.
00:10:42,00:10:45,"So when you order a calzone, that's what you're ordering."
00:10:45,00:10:46,"It's a sleeve, basically."
00:10:46,00:10:48,"It's a sleeve for your legs, which is what I call my trousers."
00:10:48,00:10:53,"And it's full of hot, hot meat, as opposed to that."
00:10:53,00:10:55,Do you know where?
00:10:55,00:10:56,"Like our legs, yeah."
00:10:56,00:10:59,And do you know who the best panatone makers in the world are?
00:10:59,00:11:03,"We said that it might be this Italian who's been doing it for 80 years, but not according"
00:11:03,00:11:04,to the world championships.
00:11:04,00:11:05,Oh.
00:11:05,00:11:07,There's panatone world championships.
00:11:07,00:11:08,There are.
00:11:08,00:11:10,And they won in 2025.
00:11:10,00:11:13,Which nationality do you think won the prize?
00:11:13,00:11:15,"If you guess it, I will give you £10 million."
00:11:15,00:11:16,Oh.
00:11:16,00:11:17,"Oh, we allowed to cheat."
00:11:17,00:11:18,I didn't.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"No, cheating."
00:11:19,00:11:20,"No, no, no."
00:11:20,00:11:21,Let me qualify the cheating.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"I have a fact about panatone eaters, so I'm thinking it might be from that country."
00:11:23,00:11:24,Have a guess.
00:11:24,00:11:25,Peru.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Nope.
00:11:26,00:11:27,Mongolia.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"Closer, but no."
00:11:28,00:11:29,Oh.
00:11:29,00:11:30,Mars.
00:11:30,00:11:31,Mars.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"Oh, lovely."
00:11:32,00:11:35,"And no, they're from Taiwan."
00:11:35,00:11:41,"They won it in 2025, and they won a load of gold medals for the best chocolate one, the best"
00:11:41,00:11:43,"general one, the best gelato panatone."
00:11:43,00:11:48,"But an interesting rule in the panatone championships is if you don't wear a hat, you lose"
00:11:48,00:11:49,a point.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"And actually, it's anyone in your team."
00:11:51,00:11:55,"If anyone from your team doesn't wear a hat, you lose points for your panatone."
00:11:55,00:11:56,What's the reason?
00:11:56,00:11:58,They just have a very specific uniform that you have to wear.
00:11:58,00:11:59,Right.
00:11:59,00:12:04,"It's got very specific, it's black shoes, black trousers, a special jacket that you get"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"given by the organizers, naprin and a hat."
00:12:06,00:12:08,"And if any of them you don't wear, you lose points."
00:12:08,00:12:12,I did really have to use a proper Italian mother yeast.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:13,00:12:14,To enter.
00:12:14,00:12:17,"And you're not allowed any accoutrements, really."
00:12:17,00:12:20,"You're allowed dried fruits, but you can't put like a kick out on top of something."
00:12:20,00:12:22,But there is a chocolate round.
00:12:22,00:12:23,Yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"And again, they have very special things that you're allowed to pop up."
00:12:25,00:12:27,So it's on skill rather than like crazy new flavors.
00:12:27,00:12:28,No kick hats.
00:12:28,00:12:29,No milky way.
00:12:29,00:12:30,No crunchies.
00:12:30,00:12:34,Why do these fun competitions always sound so intense?
00:12:34,00:12:37,Like you'd have a hard attack halfway through doing it.
00:12:37,00:12:38,This is serious stuff.
00:12:38,00:12:41,"Also because you've eaten a panatone that's half buffet, probably a preparation."
00:12:41,00:12:43,Like your doctor will be checking that out.
00:12:43,00:12:46,But I think they're very strict about it in places like Milan.
00:12:46,00:12:51,"So Milan, according to the Milanese Chamber of Commerce, I believe, they ruled that a traditional"
00:12:51,00:12:54,panatone has to be 20% salt on it and dried fruit.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Which to be is insane.
00:12:55,00:12:56,That's insane.
00:12:56,00:12:57,It's insane.
00:12:57,00:12:58,I always pick them out.
00:12:58,00:13:02,"Well, you're going to have a, you're going to be doing it a long time by a proper, tried"
00:13:02,00:13:03,one.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:06,I don't even like a spotted dick with fruit in it.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Really?
00:13:07,00:13:08,Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:09,I hate those dried fruits.
00:13:09,00:13:10,So you've not found a fruit cake?
00:13:10,00:13:11,No.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Absolutely not.
00:13:12,00:13:13,And I have to change my office bake now.
00:13:13,00:13:14,"Right, man."
00:13:14,00:13:18,"In this piece about the fiasco narrow factory, they said they used manna as a sweetener."
00:13:18,00:13:20,I don't know if you guys saw this.
00:13:20,00:13:23,The food of the gods from their old testament.
00:13:23,00:13:27,That's why it's expensive because you have to go into the desert for 40 years and eventually
00:13:27,00:13:30,"you get some of the, well, it's this, it's this resin which you get from ash trees and"
00:13:30,00:13:32,it's naturally quite sweet.
00:13:32,00:13:37,"And a journalist asked one of the fiasco narrow family, well, this is brilliant, but you've"
00:13:37,00:13:40,only reduced the sort of like white sugar that you put it in.
00:13:40,00:13:42,Why don't you just use mana?
00:13:42,00:13:48,"And she said, we can't just use mana because mana has laxative properties, which applies"
00:13:48,00:13:52,"the existence of a, of an experiment that went disastrous."
00:13:52,00:13:58,Would you like the forbidden panoramic?
00:13:58,00:14:00,Do you reckon that's what happens to the popes?
00:14:00,00:14:01,"Oh, questionably."
00:14:01,00:14:02,"Oh, questionably."
00:14:02,00:14:03,That's amazing.
00:14:03,00:14:04,Yeah.
00:14:04,00:14:10,"But another thing I didn't know about panoramic, so the saint dimensions, saint Viasco, saint"
00:14:10,00:14:12,"blaze, because he saved this child from choking."
00:14:12,00:14:16,"There is a tradition that when you have your christmas panoramic, you save a piece."
00:14:16,00:14:19,"And on February 3rd, saint blaze is feast day."
00:14:19,00:14:22,"You toast it because it'll be stale by that point, you are allowed to butter this way, and"
00:14:22,00:14:25,then you eat it and there's meant to ward off sore throats for the past.
00:14:25,00:14:26,Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:28,So I was reading more into saint Bajajur.
00:14:28,00:14:32,"And there is this really fun thing, which is, I think I found what was one of the original"
00:14:32,00:14:35,Heimlich maneuvers from this period.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"So he was 3rd, 4th century."
00:14:36,00:14:39,"This was being practiced in the 6th century, right?"
00:14:39,00:14:43,"So what would happen is, if a bone was stuck in your throat, if after initial attempts"
00:14:43,00:14:47,"to get it out, sometimes they would say put a bit of bread in, and so it would go"
00:14:47,00:14:48,"down, it would be pushed down by the bread."
00:14:48,00:14:50,"I think that's still the advice, isn't it?"
00:14:50,00:14:51,Right.
00:14:51,00:14:52,It's what I do.
00:14:52,00:14:53,Is it?
00:14:53,00:14:54,You eat more when you're choking.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Okay.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"If you've got a little bone stuck, you just have a bit of bread, it just sort of envelops"
00:14:57,00:14:58,it and takes it down.
00:14:58,00:15:00,So you put it in the size of the bone.
00:15:00,00:15:01,It does.
00:15:01,00:15:02,It does.
00:15:02,00:15:08,"But no, that is still what happens if the bread gets stuck, then do you send, you know,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"a curly, oily down there?"
00:15:10,00:15:12,"It's the, yeah, it's the middle-aged man who saw it a bone."
00:15:12,00:15:16,"And then, yeah, if anyone's choking while listening to this, please, please, please look"
00:15:16,00:15:17,up the NHS website.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Don't take my advice.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Yeah.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Absolutely.
00:15:20,00:15:21,That's always worked for me.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Yep.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Well, here's what I'll be doing."
00:15:23,00:15:26,"So if you want to try some six-century advice and the bone's not coming out, what you need"
00:15:26,00:15:31,"to do, and this is a quote, is to go around and face the person who's choking and yell"
00:15:31,00:15:38,"at them, come out bone, if you are a bone, or whatever you are, come out like Lazarus"
00:15:38,00:15:42,"at the voice of Christ, come out of the tomb, and Jonah from the belly of the whale."
00:15:42,00:15:45,"And then that will get the bone out of your, yeah."
00:15:45,00:15:46,"Well, if it is a bone."
00:15:46,00:15:47,If it is a bone.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:48,00:16:05,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:16:05,00:16:06,Okay.
00:16:06,00:16:11,My fact this week is that those giant walking keyboards that Tom Hanks plays in big have existed
00:16:11,00:16:14,in India for 500 years.
00:16:14,00:16:15,Brilliant.
00:16:15,00:16:16,Very good.
00:16:16,00:16:17,How did they find it?
00:16:17,00:16:18,"Oh, it's just there."
00:16:18,00:16:20,It's in a big old temple.
00:16:20,00:16:21,"You can't miss it, really."
00:16:21,00:16:25,You can't tell when you're watching the film that he's in a 500-year-old Indian temple.
00:16:25,00:16:26,It's really interesting.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"No, he looks like he's in the famous toy shop in New York, FAO Schwartz, doesn't he?"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"Yeah, but that's the magic of film, isn't it?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,It's green screen.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:40,"No, so basically these are musical temples in India, which I read about, and there's lots"
00:16:40,00:16:46,"of them around, especially in South India, and they have various bits of architecture which"
00:16:46,00:16:47,make music.
00:16:47,00:16:53,"And the one in particular that I'm talking about is called 'Eravatasvara Temple', situated"
00:16:53,00:16:59,in Dharasaram near Kumbh Bakanam in the Tanjabor district of Tamil Nadu.
00:16:59,00:17:00,"Yeah, okay."
00:17:00,00:17:03,I was lost until you mentioned the final location.
00:17:03,00:17:08,Imagine if you imagine India as a giant upside-down triangle.
00:17:08,00:17:09,Yes.
00:17:09,00:17:13,"It's just up a bit, and to the right a bit, of the bottom angle of the triangle."
00:17:13,00:17:14,I understand.
00:17:14,00:17:15,Okay.
00:17:15,00:17:19,"You took those fences like a pro, that was just like, great."
00:17:19,00:17:23,I have them very phonetically written out on my paper.
00:17:23,00:17:28,"But this temple, it has a staircase where every time you step on one of the steps, it makes"
00:17:28,00:17:33,"a note, and it makes a note of a scale, which is effectively the same as that."
00:17:33,00:17:39,"So if anyone doesn't know the 1988 film with Tom Hanks, he is a 13-year-old boy who turns"
00:17:39,00:17:44,"into an adult and plays around in toy shops and one of them, the most iconic scene probably"
00:17:44,00:17:47,he plays one of these giant floor pianos.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"Yeah, absolutely brilliant."
00:17:48,00:17:49,"Yeah, that's right."
00:17:49,00:17:52,"If I was a monk in one of these temples, what I would do is, I would climb up six of the"
00:17:52,00:17:56,"steps, and I would jump off somehow, and that would irritate all the other monks in"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"the temple, because they'd be waiting for the final."
00:17:58,00:17:59,So good.
00:17:59,00:18:00,So good.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"Oh, yes."
00:18:01,00:18:02,Yeah.
00:18:02,00:18:05,"Well, thank you for going to the bottom."
00:18:05,00:18:06,Dada.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Dada.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Dada.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Dada.
00:18:09,00:18:12,"Actually, that's not what it would sound like, because they are of the carnatic musical"
00:18:12,00:18:20,"scale, they're swarers, so they're not normal sort of ABCDFG notes."
00:18:20,00:18:26,"They are a double harmonic, so that's a scale with a D-flat and an A-flat for music nerds"
00:18:26,00:18:29,like Anne's husband.
00:18:29,00:18:33,"And so when you play it, if you play that scale, it sounds like you're in a 1980s movie and"
00:18:33,00:18:38,"a snake's about to come out of a basket, so you know that kind of eastern sound."
00:18:38,00:18:44,"One way to explain it is, you know, in the song Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, when they go"
00:18:44,00:18:50,"""Scaramush, caramush, can you do the Fandango, that Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, is in that kind"
00:18:50,00:18:51,"of scale."""
00:18:51,00:18:52,Wow.
00:18:52,00:18:53,That explains kind of what it would sound like.
00:18:53,00:18:56,"Did they use the steps to record that, or did they use the steps to do that?"
00:18:56,00:18:57,They did.
00:18:57,00:18:59,You know what steps you're going to record on those steps?
00:18:59,00:19:00,Oh.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"I mean, that would be a music video."
00:19:01,00:19:02,"Well, be hard to."
00:19:02,00:19:05,"I don't know if you've seen a video or a picture of these steps, but firstly, they're"
00:19:05,00:19:07,"hard to get to, because they're in a cage now."
00:19:07,00:19:11,So there's this big cage that goes around them and...
00:19:11,00:19:12,"No, it's John Cage, more like."
00:19:12,00:19:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:13,00:19:14,Yeah.
00:19:14,00:19:19,"John Cage and steps together at last, just getting all my modern references in there, you know."
00:19:19,00:19:23,"And yeah, it's an interesting staircase, because it's not a classic staircase."
00:19:23,00:19:28,"The full length of the stairs are the height of a man, the video I watched is a man who's"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"standing on the side of it, and it's quite fun, because he's tapping the side, and you"
00:19:31,00:19:33,can hear all these notes.
00:19:33,00:19:37,"But yeah, they're very thin in terms of, you've got the staircase itself and the"
00:19:37,00:19:40,two barriers on the staircase.
00:19:40,00:19:44,You'd almost have to walk single file with your feet with one front of the other in order
00:19:44,00:19:45,to get up.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"But yeah, listening to it is fascinating."
00:19:46,00:19:51,"As you say, very odd scale, because it's the seven notes of classical Indian music."
00:19:51,00:19:55,"They do have other musical temples across India, which I love."
00:19:55,00:20:01,"And so there are so much have musical pillars, which ring with different notes when you"
00:20:01,00:20:03,strike them.
00:20:03,00:20:07,"And there are, I think, some blowing pillars."
00:20:07,00:20:10,"Basically, like a big cot, you just blow into the pillar, and it makes it, it's like an"
00:20:10,00:20:16,"all-compire for a, like a conch, so like a recorder, like a recorder, yeah, or trump it,"
00:20:16,00:20:20,"or a, we can all name, we can all master it."
00:20:20,00:20:25,"Did you read about the temple in Japan, where it's, it's got 1,000 steps, and step number"
00:20:25,00:20:28,"27 is always wet and mossy, and the other steps are fine."
00:20:28,00:20:29,And do we know why?
00:20:29,00:20:35,"The legend is that somebody died there, but they're probably a springer, a natural spring"
00:20:35,00:20:36,under the step.
00:20:36,00:20:38,But they're all dry apart from one.
00:20:38,00:20:41,27 club moss.
00:20:41,00:20:43,That is a tortured joke.
00:20:43,00:20:49,"That's the worst I've ever, oh no, I'm really, it's not even top 100."
00:20:49,00:20:52,"You have to go through about 1,000 steps to get to that joke."
00:20:52,00:20:53,Beautiful.
00:20:53,00:20:54,Beautiful.
00:20:54,00:20:55,There we go.
00:20:55,00:20:56,Big.
00:20:56,00:20:57,"The big, the movie."
00:20:57,00:20:58,The big piano.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Yeah.
00:20:59,00:21:00,It's a brilliant film.
00:21:00,00:21:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:01,00:21:03,"I hadn't, so I hadn't seen it for years and years and years."
00:21:03,00:21:04,I watched it last night.
00:21:04,00:21:05,Oh.
00:21:05,00:21:06,It's a lucky dog.
00:21:06,00:21:07,It's so good.
00:21:07,00:21:12,"I think it's slightly problematic, but I think it was probably problematic at the time."
00:21:12,00:21:14,"I think there is, there is a bit with people tend to gloss over."
00:21:14,00:21:18,The fact that it's a 30 year old boy who then has sex with a full grown woman.
00:21:18,00:21:20,Or be it in Tom Hanks' body.
00:21:20,00:21:24,"Oh, yeah, that is, that's, that's an interesting psychological question."
00:21:24,00:21:28,"Is it definite or is it implied or is it, I don't know, I don't know, I'll show it as"
00:21:28,00:21:29,it's you.
00:21:29,00:21:32,But it is a brilliant film though.
00:21:32,00:21:33,It's really good.
00:21:33,00:21:34,It is good.
00:21:34,00:21:37,It might have been known to be problematic at the time.
00:21:37,00:21:42,Is because there's an actor called Deborah Winger and she was originally considered to be the
00:21:42,00:21:44,main actress in this movie.
00:21:44,00:21:47,"She couldn't take the part because she was pregnant, but she knew the director and she"
00:21:47,00:21:52,"said to the director, why don't we switch the gender and have it as a girl who becomes"
00:21:52,00:21:58,"big and the director said, well, then you've got a teenage girl having sex with an adult"
00:21:58,00:22:02,man or be it in your body.
00:22:02,00:22:04,They realized that that was problematic.
00:22:04,00:22:08,"They didn't make that extra step that it was all problematic, but that was the 80s volume."
00:22:08,00:22:09,It was the 80s.
00:22:09,00:22:13,And so it's got an amazing behind the scenes crew on it.
00:22:13,00:22:18,"So it was co-written by Anne Spielberg, who is Steven Spielberg's sister."
00:22:18,00:22:21,"And Steven Spielberg was originally asked to direct it, wanted to direct it, but then"
00:22:21,00:22:26,"he thought, this will probably take away from my sister's role in it, she'll be shadowed"
00:22:26,00:22:27,by it.
00:22:27,00:22:30,"So it went to Penny Marshall, who's a brilliant director."
00:22:30,00:22:35,"And that scene with the piano was because it existed in that shop you mentioned, FAO Schwartz"
00:22:35,00:22:37,in America.
00:22:37,00:22:41,"And Spielberg was in there, saw it and immediately ran back saying, we've got to write this into"
00:22:41,00:22:42,it now.
00:22:42,00:22:43,This is just going to be a game changer.
00:22:43,00:22:47,"I mean, what a weird insight to think that this is going to make the movie, which it kind"
00:22:47,00:22:51,of did in terms of its cultural footprint.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Yeah.
00:22:52,00:22:56,"Also with that Anne Spielberg never did anything else, called it sure."
00:22:56,00:23:00,"I am DB, yeah, she's just one or two little things, but nothing you've heard of."
00:23:00,00:23:03,I guess she was cancelled after the whole 13-year-old boy sleep.
00:23:03,00:23:04,"No, no."
00:23:04,00:23:06,No.
00:23:06,00:23:07,No.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"Interestingly about the 13-year-old boy, Tom Hanks really thought, how am I going to act like"
00:23:10,00:23:14,I'm a 13-year-old boy inside the body of an adult?
00:23:14,00:23:18,And one story goes quite a few stories of how it was filmed.
00:23:18,00:23:22,"One story suggests that the little boy, who was actually playing the kid, would do all"
00:23:22,00:23:26,the scenes that Tom Hanks would watch the scenes with him doing it.
00:23:26,00:23:30,And then he would emulate what the boy was doing then in the scene just to really get it.
00:23:30,00:23:34,"Something he did with Forest Gump as well, emulated the character of the kid to create the"
00:23:34,00:23:35,"role of Forest Gump, the adult."
00:23:35,00:23:41,"I watched it, like I said last night, and I had read that as well, and you can kind of see"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"if that's true, you can kind of see it."
00:23:43,00:23:48,"Like the one point he sort of dismantles this toy, and he does it in exactly the same way"
00:23:48,00:23:49,a child would do.
00:23:49,00:23:52,"And you think, either he's a brilliant actor or he copied a child, or both."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"How have you seen, so what are my favourite bodies for films?"
00:23:56,00:23:57,Is Jumanji welcome to the jungle?
00:23:57,00:23:58,How are you seeing Jack Black playing?
00:23:58,00:23:59,I have 14-year-old guys.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:00,00:24:01,So good.
00:24:01,00:24:02,They're such solid films.
00:24:02,00:24:03,That's so good.
00:24:03,00:24:06,"A friend of the podcast, Restorby, in that one."
00:24:06,00:24:07,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:07,00:24:09,"No one swaps his body, though, do they?"
00:24:09,00:24:10,No.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"No, he's the welcome to Jumanji's character when they arrive in the game."
00:24:13,00:24:19,"I wouldn't want his mind in my body restarting, no, you can't give him coverage."
00:24:19,00:24:24,Big was the fourth body swap movie released in eight months.
00:24:24,00:24:25,Oh.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"Isn't that, like..."
00:24:26,00:24:28,Is that Original Freaky Friday time?
00:24:28,00:24:29,It was...
00:24:29,00:24:30,There were three...
00:24:30,00:24:35,"The three others that preceded it were called ""Like Father Like Son,"" ""Vice Versa,"" and"
00:24:35,00:24:36,"""18"" again."
00:24:36,00:24:37,And just...
00:24:37,00:24:38,This was this...
00:24:38,00:24:39,She'd rationally...
00:24:39,00:24:42,"Like, we think of it as one of the archetypal bodies for movies, along with things like"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"""Freaky Friday"" and ""13 Going Up 30."""
00:24:44,00:24:45,But it was...
00:24:45,00:24:47,It was just following this very long tradition.
00:24:47,00:24:48,People like it.
00:24:48,00:24:49,"It's often what happens in Hollywood, isn't it?"
00:24:49,00:24:50,"You are Armageddon in ""Deep Ed Packed"" at the same time."
00:24:50,00:24:52,There's movies sort of a rhyme.
00:24:52,00:24:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:53,00:24:55,Vincent Bugs Life at the same time.
00:24:55,00:24:56,"Yeah, exactly."
00:24:56,00:24:57,"But I think ""Vice Versa"" is the..."
00:24:57,00:25:01,"There was a novel called ""Vice Versa,"" and we might have mentioned that on this before."
00:25:01,00:25:02,I think that's what it was based on.
00:25:02,00:25:06,"Just going back to the keyboard, they play a couple of different songs on there."
00:25:06,00:25:08,"One of them is ""Chopsticks."""
00:25:08,00:25:10,"So you know ""Chopsticks"" is what you'd like..."
00:25:10,00:25:12,One of the first things you learn as a kid.
00:25:12,00:25:15,"Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"Do you know who wrote ""Chopsticks""?"
00:25:17,00:25:18,Oh!
00:25:18,00:25:19,"It's the one you've never heard of, so..."
00:25:19,00:25:25,"Oh, that's... Oh, it was written by Mozart's sister."
00:25:25,00:25:26,What?
00:25:26,00:25:27,Yep.
00:25:27,00:25:32,"Mozart Allen, his sister, Euphonia Allen, wrote that."
00:25:32,00:25:33,She's called Euphonia.
00:25:33,00:25:34,She's named after an instrument.
00:25:34,00:25:38,"Well, she's named after the Greek for ""Beautiful Voice."""
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Well, so Euphonia, isn't it?"
00:25:39,00:25:40,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:40,00:25:46,And he was named Mozart because their parents was really into music of what his kids could be really musical.
00:25:46,00:25:47,Are you allowed to do it?
00:25:47,00:25:48,I guess it's like getting in early with you.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"It's like calling a child tennis champion, isn't it?"
00:25:50,00:25:53,It's just kind of how your colors to the math early.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"Well, this was..."
00:25:54,00:25:56,We're talking 1870s.
00:25:56,00:25:59,It was quite a long time ago to be given your kids wacky names.
00:25:59,00:26:00,Yeah.
00:26:00,00:26:00,I think...
00:26:00,00:26:04,"I mean, I say that as a parent of someone with a relatively uncommon name,"
00:26:04,00:26:07,but he was like a famous dance choreographer.
00:26:07,00:26:10,Decided he wanted his kids to get into music.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"Called his daughter Euphonia, she wrote ""Chopsticks."""
00:26:13,00:26:17,"Called his son Mozart, and he went into music production."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Right.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"Oh, yeah?"
00:26:19,00:26:20,Does she...
00:26:20,00:26:22,Is it like Happy Birthday where she's still...
00:26:22,00:26:23,It's in copyright.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"It will be out, I guess, by now, but she must have..."
00:26:25,00:26:26,It's well out of copyright.
00:26:26,00:26:28,She wrote it when she was like 15 or something.
00:26:28,00:26:29,Right.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Do you...
00:26:30,00:26:35,"Any of you recognize the name ""Berimo Serrachini""?"
00:26:35,00:26:36,Not the way you say it.
00:26:36,00:26:37,It's nice.
00:26:37,00:26:39,I've got something written down in my notes.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"""Berimo Serrachini."""
00:26:41,00:26:42,Ramos Serrachini?
00:26:42,00:26:43,Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Maybe Serrachini.
00:26:44,00:26:45,Yeah.
00:26:45,00:26:46,It could be anything who even knows.
00:26:46,00:26:50,But he was the inventor of that great piano that we see in big.
00:26:50,00:26:51,Amazing character.
00:26:51,00:26:53,He was born in 1935 in Italy.
00:26:53,00:26:56,He was an inventor ever since a child.
00:26:56,00:27:00,He had a really interesting moment where he made a kite from a poster of Mussolini when he
00:27:00,00:27:04,"was a kid, which resulted in a visit from the secret police."
00:27:04,00:27:05,Give him a minute.
00:27:05,00:27:07,You can't string up Mussolini like that.
00:27:07,00:27:08,That will see.
00:27:08,00:27:09,Yeah.
00:27:09,00:27:11,They gave him an official warning about anti-fascist activity.
00:27:11,00:27:12,I apologize.
00:27:12,00:27:17,The people at home couldn't see my nod of approval that I gave to that joke.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"It's not fair, because we take the piss when you do bad ones."
00:27:20,00:27:21,"Yeah, it's true."
00:27:21,00:27:22,"Yeah, I can't wear snow-winning."
00:27:22,00:27:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:23,00:27:24,I'll keep doing.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Yeah.
00:27:25,00:27:26,"Yeah, no."
00:27:26,00:27:27,Amazing inventor.
00:27:27,00:27:28,He made this piano.
00:27:28,00:27:29,He made lots of different gadgets.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"He made this incredible one, which was a stethoscope, stereosystem."
00:27:33,00:27:37,"So basically, you could dance to the rhythm of your own heartbeat."
00:27:37,00:27:40,"A lot of inventions were to do with touch, body, and voice."
00:27:40,00:27:41,Problem.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:44,Put in the stethoscope to your heartbeat.
00:27:44,00:27:45,You're dancing.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"You get a bit more energetic, because you're dancing."
00:27:47,00:27:49,Your heartbeat gets faster.
00:27:49,00:27:50,You dance faster.
00:27:50,00:27:51,You get more energetic.
00:27:51,00:27:53,Your heart gets faster still.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"What is it, Ed?"
00:27:54,00:27:55,This thing has killed two popes.
00:27:55,00:27:57,Little nine facts.
00:27:57,00:28:01,"But, Dan, did you say his origin was working where he was between 1965 and 1969?"
00:28:01,00:28:02,"No, I didn't."
00:28:02,00:28:03,He was a rocket scientist.
00:28:03,00:28:07,"He was working for NASA, working on the reentry systems, their electronics."
00:28:07,00:28:11,"He's really a proper, you know, really skilled engineer."
00:28:11,00:28:15,"He has invented some musical stairs as well, just to bring us back to the temple."
00:28:15,00:28:16,"So, yeah, cool guy."
00:28:16,00:28:17,Very cool guy.
00:28:17,00:28:19,If you guys tried the Stinging Lift at the South Park Centre.
00:28:19,00:28:20,No.
00:28:20,00:28:21,I have.
00:28:21,00:28:22,It's so great.
00:28:22,00:28:23,It's awesome.
00:28:23,00:28:24,It's saying stuff.
00:28:24,00:28:25,But what do you do?
00:28:25,00:28:26,You just choose your floor.
00:28:26,00:28:27,Yeah.
00:28:27,00:28:28,And then it goes up.
00:28:28,00:28:29,It goes up.
00:28:29,00:28:30,It goes up.
00:28:30,00:28:31,It goes up.
00:28:31,00:28:32,It goes up.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Level three.
00:28:33,00:28:34,It's so great.
00:28:34,00:28:35,"So it is done by Martin Creed, who won the Turner Prize."
00:28:35,00:28:36,And it follows the scale.
00:28:36,00:28:37,And then it sings your floor to you.
00:28:37,00:28:38,So next time you're there.
00:28:38,00:28:40,What happens if the lift gets stuck?
00:28:40,00:28:42,Does it have to sustain the note?
00:28:42,00:28:43,And you just hear it say a breath.
00:28:43,00:28:44,I haven't been stuck in it.
00:28:44,00:28:46,It's like I'm personally saying.
00:28:46,00:28:47,You just hear it go.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"Oh, my God."
00:28:49,00:28:50,"Oh, my God."
00:28:50,00:28:52,"Oh, my God."
00:28:52,00:28:58,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:28:58,00:29:00,And that is my fact.
00:29:00,00:29:05,My fact this week is that three months after Alex Honald became the first person ever to free
00:29:05,00:29:11,"solo climb El Capitan, his mum became the oldest woman to ever climb it."
00:29:11,00:29:12,This is stunning.
00:29:12,00:29:13,That's amazing.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Yeah.
00:29:14,00:29:15,It's a cool family.
00:29:15,00:29:16,Yeah.
00:29:16,00:29:17,So this is Alex Honald.
00:29:17,00:29:20,This was an Oscar-winning documentary made with National Geographic.
00:29:20,00:29:25,"The New York Times called what he did, one of the greatest athletic feats of any kind ever."
00:29:25,00:29:28,"He free climbed, which means no ropes."
00:29:28,00:29:34,"It's just his hands his feet climbing up a 2,900 foot root of a mountain face."
00:29:34,00:29:35,Like no one had ever done it before.
00:29:35,00:29:42,"No one has done it since and this was in 2017, three months later, his mum, not doing a free"
00:29:42,00:29:47,"solo climb, but you can also climb El Capitan via the actual root, which goes through."
00:29:47,00:29:48,Exactly.
00:29:48,00:29:49,Made it up herself.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Three months later.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Amazing.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Become the oldest person.
00:29:52,00:29:53,Yeah.
00:29:53,00:29:54,She's called Didri.
00:29:54,00:29:55,She is incredible.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Didri.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Volovnik.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Volovnich.
00:29:58,00:29:59,She's called Didri.
00:29:59,00:30:00,OK.
00:30:00,00:30:01,She's stunning.
00:30:01,00:30:06,"She did the lurking fear root to get to the top, because all these roots have different weird"
00:30:06,00:30:07,names.
00:30:07,00:30:08,Reassuring names.
00:30:08,00:30:09,I think even the first to climb.
00:30:09,00:30:10,You get to name.
00:30:10,00:30:11,"Yeah, reassuring."
00:30:11,00:30:12,Exactly.
00:30:12,00:30:14,And has anyone seen the film?
00:30:14,00:30:15,No.
00:30:15,00:30:16,It's seen a trailer.
00:30:16,00:30:17,It's unbelievably exciting.
00:30:17,00:30:21,And you sort of know that he doesn't die because they released the film.
00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
00:30:22,00:30:23,But can I ask a question?
00:30:23,00:30:28,Are we certain that there wasn't some body swath between Didri and Alex and that he
00:30:28,00:30:30,climbed up it in her body?
00:30:30,00:30:33,That's a great premise for a film.
00:30:33,00:30:38,"He was there to help her climb up it, I think, when she did."
00:30:38,00:30:40,So that would have to be her in his body.
00:30:40,00:30:42,I feel like we're focusing on the wrong thing.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"Yeah, yeah."
00:30:43,00:30:44,It's an amazing climb.
00:30:44,00:30:45,It's an amazing climb.
00:30:45,00:30:49,"El Capitan is this huge, it's like a sheer face of granite."
00:30:49,00:30:50,I've been there.
00:30:50,00:30:51,Have you?
00:30:51,00:30:52,Yes.
00:30:52,00:30:53,Did you free climb?
00:30:53,00:30:54,Did you take the lurking fear root?
00:30:54,00:30:55,Did you start?
00:30:55,00:30:56,No.
00:30:56,00:30:57,I was a good few meters away from the base.
00:30:57,00:31:01,We're just far enough back that I could see the whole thing.
00:31:01,00:31:02,Right.
00:31:02,00:31:03,It's terrifying.
00:31:03,00:31:04,It is.
00:31:04,00:31:05,Absolutely terrifying.
00:31:05,00:31:06,And even the root that she took is very hard.
00:31:06,00:31:11,"Now what's extraordinary is she did this at age 66, but she only started to learn climbing"
00:31:11,00:31:13,age 60.
00:31:13,00:31:14,She taught herself to swim at age 40.
00:31:14,00:31:19,So this is someone who is quite a late bloomer in general sporting.
00:31:19,00:31:23,"And then she went on to break the record again, breaking her own record, age 70, climbed"
00:31:23,00:31:28,"at a second time, age 70, and she did it with a foot injury as well."
00:31:28,00:31:29,It's because those whole family is nuts.
00:31:29,00:31:30,Absolutely nuts.
00:31:30,00:31:31,She's a really impressive woman.
00:31:31,00:31:32,She's run marathon.
00:31:32,00:31:33,She's conducted orchestras.
00:31:33,00:31:37,"She's been a publisher, you know, professor of five languages."
00:31:37,00:31:42,"And when they climbed El Capitan together the first time, he said, okay, well, we'll do it."
00:31:42,00:31:43,"You know, we'll just go up and down."
00:31:43,00:31:45,So they took about 19 hours.
00:31:45,00:31:46,"He said, that's a reasonable time."
00:31:46,00:31:47,He did not tell her.
00:31:47,00:31:51,"Normally, people take four days to do this for you say said, right, come on, man, let's"
00:31:51,00:31:52,just...
00:31:52,00:31:53,We've got a day.
00:31:53,00:31:54,Yeah.
00:31:54,00:31:55,They're absolutely bananas.
00:31:55,00:31:56,It's amazing.
00:31:56,00:32:01,"She says that when he was a child, he was climbing on pitch appliances before he turned"
00:32:01,00:32:02,to.
00:32:02,00:32:04,So she knew he was going to become a climber.
00:32:04,00:32:05,But I would say that's pretty much old kids.
00:32:05,00:32:06,That's true.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Yeah.
00:32:07,00:32:08,That's true.
00:32:08,00:32:09,Yeah.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"It's just like climbing on stuff, right?"
00:32:10,00:32:12,"It's a pretty, it's a pretty amazing story."
00:32:12,00:32:15,"And I don't know how much Andy, this is shown in the documentary."
00:32:15,00:32:20,"But he basically had climbed up this route multiple times before, but with ropes."
00:32:20,00:32:25,"So this was the first time he was trying it on his own, and he memorized the entire route."
00:32:25,00:32:30,He knew exactly where his hand was going at every single point as he was going up.
00:32:30,00:32:35,"And once he finished it, you would think, probably, okay, let's step away now."
00:32:35,00:32:38,Let's go home and thank our lucky stars that nothing bad happened.
00:32:38,00:32:39,What did he do?
00:32:39,00:32:42,"Well, because it was a documentary and they needed extra shots."
00:32:42,00:32:46,He spent five more days recliming certain sections of it so that he could get better drone
00:32:46,00:32:47,shots.
00:32:47,00:32:48,For pickups.
00:32:48,00:32:52,Can I just say he does wear sticky shoes?
00:32:52,00:32:53,What?
00:32:53,00:32:54,He wears sticky shoes.
00:32:54,00:32:59,"Well, it's a special kind of sticky rubber that helps you, especially if you can't really"
00:32:59,00:33:01,get much of a grip with your fingers.
00:33:01,00:33:03,Because you're basically on with your fingernails.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"It just means that you're not going to, he's not wearing brogues."
00:33:06,00:33:07,He's not wearing...
00:33:07,00:33:08,Right.
00:33:08,00:33:09,He didn't even do it in brogues.
00:33:09,00:33:11,He was even a wreck all the time.
00:33:11,00:33:16,"But in my head, he was like, you know Batman from the old 70s shows where he just walks"
00:33:16,00:33:17,sideways up a wall.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"It just goes horizontal, yeah, it just walks up it."
00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:23,"No, you see him in the film, he makes all these notes because you just have to study the route"
00:33:23,00:33:24,so much.
00:33:24,00:33:29,"And you have to say like, this is good if you've got two fingers and you just need to hold"
00:33:29,00:33:32,your weight on two fingers while you get your foot across here.
00:33:32,00:33:34,So it's incredibly detailed them mapping out.
00:33:34,00:33:35,And it's...
00:33:35,00:33:36,It's...
00:33:36,00:33:40,"You might leave a chalk mark to say like, put hand here."
00:33:40,00:33:42,It's absolutely terrifying.
00:33:42,00:33:43,And you often...
00:33:43,00:33:48,"He ends up hanging by one or two fingers above this, this absolutely insane drop."
00:33:48,00:33:51,"And I listen to it, I listen to an interview with him recently because he was talking about"
00:33:51,00:33:53,his attitude to risk.
00:33:53,00:33:58,"And he says, I actually don't think I am a high risk person."
00:33:58,00:34:02,"He says, I am a low risk person in lots of ways."
00:34:02,00:34:07,"The individual climbing moves I make are very, they're low risk, but they are high consequence."
00:34:07,00:34:08,Yeah.
00:34:08,00:34:09,I see.
00:34:09,00:34:10,He doesn't seem to feel fit.
00:34:10,00:34:11,No.
00:34:11,00:34:16,"It's like doing Russian roulette with 1,000 chambers and one bullet."
00:34:16,00:34:20,"Like you're probably not going to shoot yourself, but the one in 1,000 chavs of you losing,"
00:34:20,00:34:21,"that's it, it's all over."
00:34:21,00:34:22,Yeah.
00:34:22,00:34:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:34:23,00:34:26,He kind of said that actually the most worrying thing when he does these climbs is not
00:34:26,00:34:29,"the climb itself, but it's all the extra things going on around him."
00:34:29,00:34:35,"So while he was climbing El Capitan, there was someone at the top doing a tightrope walk."
00:34:35,00:34:38,"And so there were people yelling to the person doing the tightrope walk and he's like,"
00:34:38,00:34:42,"oh my gosh, really distracting. He says the drones that were coming up to him and filming him"
00:34:42,00:34:45,"sounded like he was being attacked by wasps and he was also going, what if they lose control"
00:34:45,00:34:46,of it?
00:34:46,00:34:47,And this blade just comes in.
00:34:47,00:34:48,It was a big drone.
00:34:48,00:34:52,"So for him, it was all the extra stuff that was quite worrying about the climb."
00:34:52,00:34:55,"Oh, and I love that he listens to music while he's doing it."
00:34:55,00:34:57,Do you know who he listens to?
00:34:57,00:34:58,No.
00:34:58,00:34:59,Can we guess?
00:34:59,00:35:00,"Oh, it's a genre."
00:35:00,00:35:01,Is it fallen by Alicia Keys?
00:35:01,00:35:02,Really?
00:35:02,00:35:03,That's band.
00:35:03,00:35:04,That's it.
00:35:04,00:35:05,It's rock.
00:35:05,00:35:06,Rock.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Ah.
00:35:07,00:35:08,It's very cool.
00:35:08,00:35:09,His fingers.
00:35:09,00:35:10,You see a lot of them in the film.
00:35:10,00:35:11,They're just like sausages.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Are they?
00:35:12,00:35:13,They're amazing.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"They're very, very strong."
00:35:15,00:35:16,Right.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Not exactly like sausages.
00:35:17,00:35:19,I don't think of sausages as strong.
00:35:19,00:35:21,"Oh, you don't go to the restaurant, so I go to."
00:35:21,00:35:26,"But like, I would thought you might need quite thin fingers like to get into the crevices."
00:35:26,00:35:29,He does not have the slim fingers of piano player.
00:35:29,00:35:33,He's got powerful fingers that you can dangle from half an hour at a time.
00:35:33,00:35:35,Hold the whole man above.
00:35:35,00:35:36,Yeah.
00:35:36,00:35:41,He said the thing he scared of more was giving a TED Talk about his climb than actually doing
00:35:41,00:35:43,the climbing himself.
00:35:43,00:35:46,I had a look for some other parent and child record breakers.
00:35:46,00:35:47,"Oh, right."
00:35:47,00:35:49,"I really enjoyed Charlotte and Nikki Bart, Australian mother and daughter."
00:35:49,00:35:53,First mother and daughter to climb Everest together in 2008 and being Australian.
00:35:53,00:35:57,They framed by dragging weights up and down one by beach to replicate sled and stringing
00:35:57,00:35:59,ladders across swimming pools and up trees.
00:35:59,00:36:00,Wow.
00:36:00,00:36:01,Then they went under loads of other peaks.
00:36:01,00:36:06,"This seems to have felt some filings, I really have adrenaline and stuff in their field."
00:36:06,00:36:11,I also found the record for the father and son marathon runners and their combined time
00:36:11,00:36:15,"is pretty respectable for a single person for five hours, which is not bad."
00:36:15,00:36:18,And the dad was a three minutes faster than his son.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"So did they, they didn't run it together together?"
00:36:20,00:36:21,They ran at the same time.
00:36:21,00:36:25,"So the son in two hours, 31, dad, two hours, 27."
00:36:25,00:36:26,Right.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Lovely.
00:36:27,00:36:34,He was a panel like supposedly he has something to do with his amygdala and his brain.
00:36:34,00:36:35,Did you guys read that?
00:36:35,00:36:36,No.
00:36:36,00:36:42,"So his amygdala, which is the part of your brain, which when you see something scary, it's"
00:36:42,00:36:45,what makes you run away or makes you fight.
00:36:45,00:36:51,"Apparently, when he sees disturbing images, his amygdala doesn't fire as much as normal people."
00:36:51,00:36:57,And that might be the reason why he's perfectly willing to do these incredibly stupid things.
00:36:57,00:37:00,"I mean, even though he does have sticky shoes, I don't think I would."
00:37:00,00:37:02,"Sticky shoes, I can't believe that."
00:37:02,00:37:04,James has knocking down the chair.
00:37:04,00:37:05,He's not trying to.
00:37:05,00:37:06,He's not trying to hear this.
00:37:06,00:37:07,Yeah.
00:37:07,00:37:08,And I believe that was part of the documentary.
00:37:08,00:37:12,"I don't remember that scene, Andy, but he goes into an MRI and they show him scary images"
00:37:12,00:37:14,and it doesn't register.
00:37:14,00:37:15,Yeah.
00:37:15,00:37:17,"He's living, he's living in his van for the whole thing."
00:37:17,00:37:18,It's really interesting.
00:37:18,00:37:22,"Well, we don't really know what happens when humans amygdala stops working."
00:37:22,00:37:23,They've done in the 30s.
00:37:23,00:37:26,They did some experiments on monkeys.
00:37:26,00:37:30,And they removed the amygdala and the monkey started approaching snakes and like batting them
00:37:30,00:37:34,around like sticks and playing with them.
00:37:34,00:37:40,"And we do have one patient called patient SM, who had a condition called lipoid protinosis"
00:37:40,00:37:43,where there were holes in her amygdala.
00:37:43,00:37:48,"And she was like relatively normal, but they did find that on one instance, she walked"
00:37:48,00:37:53,"through a park alone at night, was attacked by a man with a knife and then the following"
00:37:53,00:37:57,day walked again through the same park because her amygdala wasn't working.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Right.
00:37:58,00:38:01,He seems very normal when you hear him talk though.
00:38:01,00:38:02,He's a young dad.
00:38:02,00:38:07,"He's got two young kids, so I listened to an interview because he's got his own podcast"
00:38:07,00:38:09,now since the last few years.
00:38:09,00:38:10,He interviews mountaineers.
00:38:10,00:38:11,Oh my God.
00:38:11,00:38:12,Let's get him on fish.
00:38:12,00:38:13,Yeah.
00:38:13,00:38:14,Wouldn't it be wonderful?
00:38:14,00:38:15,He's a great speaker.
00:38:15,00:38:19,"And David Lenneman was saying, would you ever consider stopping this now because you're"
00:38:19,00:38:20,a father?
00:38:20,00:38:21,"And he's like, no, because it's to me, it's calculated risk."
00:38:21,00:38:26,"Can we get him on when I'm not here because I don't want him to like, I was joking about"
00:38:26,00:38:27,the stick and shoes.
00:38:27,00:38:28,Yeah.
00:38:28,00:38:29,Is it true?
00:38:29,00:38:34,"You also use chalk on your fingers, because there's another mountain that he freesolved,"
00:38:34,00:38:37,which is called Zion's moonlight buttress.
00:38:37,00:38:41,"And it's a 1,200 foot mountain."
00:38:41,00:38:45,"And when he did it, no one believed him for a few days after it."
00:38:45,00:38:49,"Even though this is, you know, half the size of El Capitan, and do you know why no one believed"
00:38:49,00:38:50,him?
00:38:50,00:38:51,Rainy.
00:38:51,00:38:52,Because he's a big old liar.
00:38:52,00:38:53,Okay.
00:38:53,00:38:59,"James, give us your holiday dates and we'll make sure Alex can do it."
00:38:59,00:39:04,"It was because he, he, he, he ascended it on April the 1st and no one thought that it"
00:39:04,00:39:05,was real.
00:39:05,00:39:09,"And for the days after it was, yeah, they were convinced it was a prank."
00:39:09,00:39:12,Can I give you some climbing lingo and see if you can guess what I mean?
00:39:12,00:39:13,"Yes, please."
00:39:13,00:39:16,You're arms are too far back.
00:39:16,00:39:17,That's nice.
00:39:17,00:39:18,Close.
00:39:18,00:39:21,"I'm thinking like bingo wings, which is a phrase for, you know, your arms if they're a bit"
00:39:21,00:39:22,out of shape.
00:39:22,00:39:25,Is it that your arms are juttering because you're so tired?
00:39:25,00:39:26,Okay.
00:39:26,00:39:27,Good guess.
00:39:27,00:39:32,"Now, it's a jamming technique where you bend your arm, insert your arm into a crack elbow"
00:39:32,00:39:33,first.
00:39:33,00:39:36,And then that sort of jams you so you can climb up the wall.
00:39:36,00:39:37,They are insane.
00:39:37,00:39:38,These people.
00:39:38,00:39:39,They are absolutely insane.
00:39:39,00:39:40,A pindex.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"Oh, I know this one."
00:39:41,00:39:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:42,00:39:46,"If your span of your arms is longer than you are tall, isn't it?"
00:39:46,00:39:49,"Well, it is, is the ratio of your arms to your, your height."
00:39:49,00:39:50,Yeah.
00:39:50,00:39:53,"So if you have a high a pindex, then you would be as you."
00:39:53,00:39:54,Yeah.
00:39:54,00:39:55,I've mentioned mine.
00:39:55,00:39:56,I've got a positive a pindex.
00:39:56,00:39:57,How do you?
00:39:57,00:39:58,My finger tip to finger tip is more than my height.
00:39:58,00:39:59,Really?
00:39:59,00:40:00,Yeah.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"Now, that's useful for some climbers."
00:40:01,00:40:02,"Oh, good."
00:40:02,00:40:03,"Hey, go on, Nick."
00:40:03,00:40:04,And flapper.
00:40:04,00:40:11,"It's if you climb, um, but you climb using a elaborate feather boa and string of"
00:40:11,00:40:13,pearls as you're only in the 20s.
00:40:13,00:40:14,In the 20s.
00:40:14,00:40:15,Yeah.
00:40:15,00:40:16,It's not that.
00:40:16,00:40:20,"It is when a large chunk of skin is ripped off your body, usually during a dynamic move."
00:40:20,00:40:21,A dynamic move.
00:40:21,00:40:22,These people are crazy.
00:40:22,00:40:23,A dynamic move.
00:40:23,00:40:24,Sliding.
00:40:24,00:40:25,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:25,00:40:26,"You do get ripped up, don't you?"
00:40:26,00:40:31,"He wore long trousers and a t-shirt, um, but a lot of people might go topless or they might"
00:40:31,00:40:37,"go, um, well, we need to poo when he's trying to get that honey."
00:40:37,00:40:38,Doesn't.
00:40:38,00:40:40,That's a great remake.
00:40:40,00:40:41,I'd love to watch.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"Um, can I give you some, uh, root names?"
00:40:43,00:40:44,Yes.
00:40:44,00:40:46,"Because if you climb a root first, you often get to name it and there are different rules"
00:40:46,00:40:49,"in different bits of the world about, you know, all of that, like some of them are a bit"
00:40:49,00:40:53,"more stonky and official, but, um, there's the excellent adventure."
00:40:53,00:40:56,"It's a nice, bell and dead reference, um, too big to flail."
00:40:56,00:40:57,Very good.
00:40:57,00:41:00,"One blunder, and it's six feet under."
00:41:00,00:41:01,Scar trek.
00:41:01,00:41:02,The next laceration.
00:41:02,00:41:03,I like these.
00:41:03,00:41:04,I like these names.
00:41:04,00:41:05,They're very good.
00:41:05,00:41:06,But no one else does.
00:41:06,00:41:07,"No, no, no, no."
00:41:07,00:41:08,They're wonderful.
00:41:08,00:41:11,"Because they're the fun way of saying, you're probably going to die."
00:41:11,00:41:12,Yeah.
00:41:12,00:41:14,But let's all have a laugh before you do.
00:41:14,00:41:19,It feels to me like they're adding jeopardy to something that doesn't need it in the first
00:41:19,00:41:20,place.
00:41:20,00:41:21,Maybe.
00:41:21,00:41:23,"You know, this thing is obviously very big and scary to climb."
00:41:23,00:41:26,"You don't have to call it L, shit yourself."
00:41:26,00:41:27,Yes.
00:41:27,00:41:28,Okay.
00:41:28,00:41:29,"Well, have a guess."
00:41:29,00:41:31,See if you can guess what's special about the widow's tears root.
00:41:31,00:41:33,"There's a specific clue in that name, widow's tears."
00:41:33,00:41:35,"Well, when they sound, they're allowed to climb it."
00:41:35,00:41:36,No.
00:41:36,00:41:37,I know.
00:41:37,00:41:38,Yeah.
00:41:38,00:41:40,"I read more of the mindset to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall."
00:41:40,00:41:41,Yeah.
00:41:41,00:41:42,It's not skills that I have myself.
00:41:42,00:41:43,Much like making panatoni.
00:41:43,00:41:44,I just...
00:41:44,00:41:45,Okay.
00:41:45,00:41:46,"It's time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall."
00:41:46,00:41:47,Yeah.
00:41:47,00:41:48,It's not skills that I have myself.
00:41:48,00:41:49,Much like making panatoni.
00:41:49,00:41:50,I just...
00:41:50,00:41:51,Okay.
00:41:51,00:41:52,"It is time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall."
00:41:52,00:41:53,Yeah.
00:41:53,00:41:54,It's not skills that I have myself.
00:41:54,00:41:55,Much like making panatoni.
00:41:55,00:41:56,I just...
00:41:56,00:41:57,Okay.
00:41:57,00:41:58,"It is time for our final fact to be like, I will climb that frozen waterfall."
00:41:58,00:41:58,Yeah.
00:41:58,00:41:59,It's not skills that I have myself.
00:41:59,00:42:00,Much like making panatoni.
00:42:00,00:42:01,I just...
00:42:01,00:42:02,Okay.
00:42:03,00:42:09,It is time for our final fact to the show and that is Andy.
00:42:09,00:42:15,"My fact is, when the post office had a competition to name the post office's new tower, star suggestions"
00:42:15,00:42:22,"included, Prince Philip's finger, the eye full tower, monstrosity and spud."
00:42:22,00:42:25,The name eventually chosen was the post office tower.
00:42:25,00:42:26,Brilliant.
00:42:26,00:42:28,Did they...
00:42:28,00:42:29,Did they...
00:42:29,00:42:31,Was the post office tower one that someone sent in?
00:42:31,00:42:32,Do you know?
00:42:32,00:42:33,No.
00:42:33,00:42:34,I think it was the...
00:42:34,00:42:36,"Internally, like the post office of..."
00:42:36,00:42:37,It's just...
00:42:37,00:42:38,Because this was a staff competition.
00:42:38,00:42:39,But there was a 10-hand prize.
00:42:39,00:42:40,So it was a 10-hand prize?
00:42:40,00:42:41,So it was a 10-hand prize?
00:42:41,00:42:42,Do you know?
00:42:42,00:42:43,It probably just went...
00:42:43,00:42:44,Was plowed back into the system.
00:42:44,00:42:45,I suppose.
00:42:45,00:42:47,I should tell you where I got this fact.
00:42:47,00:42:49,There's a really exciting trip I got to do recently.
00:42:49,00:42:52,"I got to go to the BT archive, which is on Holman."
00:42:52,00:42:54,It's not far from the office and it's a stunning place.
00:42:54,00:42:59,I just want to give a shout out to the very kind curators there who showed me around.
00:42:59,00:43:00,It was amazing.
00:43:00,00:43:04,It showed me the handwritten list of the finalist entries from this competition.
00:43:04,00:43:05,Wow.
00:43:05,00:43:10,"And for international listeners, the post office tower is this massive great tower in West"
00:43:10,00:43:14,London and it was the tallest building in Britain for ages and it's all for phone calls
00:43:14,00:43:17,and TV channels and communications and all of that.
00:43:17,00:43:21,And it's got this really interesting history and they had this competition to name it.
00:43:21,00:43:22,And...
00:43:22,00:43:23,Yeah.
00:43:23,00:43:27,"If you've ever been to London, it's that very odd looking, like a big staff."
00:43:27,00:43:28,Like it's not a building.
00:43:28,00:43:29,It's not very wide.
00:43:29,00:43:34,It's very skinny and it's a very iconic thing in London.
00:43:34,00:43:35,You will have seen it if you...
00:43:35,00:43:36,"Well, I was a kid."
00:43:36,00:43:37,It was the tallest building in London.
00:43:37,00:43:38,Was it right?
00:43:38,00:43:42,"I think, or it had just stopped being, but if you bought a Guinness Book of Records, an old"
00:43:42,00:43:45,"one from a charity shop, it would say that it was the tallest building in London."
00:43:45,00:43:46,Right.
00:43:46,00:43:48,And it's just turned 60 this year.
00:43:48,00:43:49,"So yeah, big anniversary."
00:43:49,00:43:50,"And that's very cool, Andy."
00:43:50,00:43:51,You got to see that list.
00:43:51,00:43:52,"Oh, it was awesome."
00:43:52,00:43:55,Did you tell you about the cafe because I'm obsessed with the cafe at the top?
00:43:55,00:43:57,Was there a rotating cafe at the top?
00:43:57,00:43:58,It's crazy.
00:43:58,00:44:02,I'm so sad that you can't go and visit that because I also didn't realise I assumed the whole
00:44:02,00:44:03,thing rotated.
00:44:03,00:44:06,"But I read that if the waiters didn't, like, if your table would, like, go past and it'd"
00:44:06,00:44:09,"like run off to you or wait for you to come back, like, with your next course, if they"
00:44:09,00:44:10,got the timings wrong.
00:44:10,00:44:11,Really?
00:44:11,00:44:12,Yeah.
00:44:12,00:44:13,It took 23 minutes to go round.
00:44:13,00:44:15,"But the central bit, obviously, it doesn't, it can't all rotate."
00:44:15,00:44:16,I assumed it altered.
00:44:16,00:44:17,Yeah.
00:44:17,00:44:19,"Well, so your table would go like..."
00:44:19,00:44:21,I've been to a few of those and they do all rotate.
00:44:21,00:44:22,Do they?
00:44:22,00:44:23,Yeah.
00:44:23,00:44:29,"The system in the middle that's turning stuff around is enclosed, right?"
00:44:29,00:44:34,"No, here, there is the kitchens and the waiters bit, as you say, Anne, is stationary and"
00:44:34,00:44:38,the waiter has to carefully step onto the moving bit.
00:44:38,00:44:41,"Yeah, we don't really get rotating restaurants anymore."
00:44:41,00:44:43,"Like, there are very 60s and 70s things built, I think."
00:44:43,00:44:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:44,00:44:45,There was one in Liverpool.
00:44:45,00:44:46,I don't know if it's still there.
00:44:46,00:44:48,I don't think it rotates anymore.
00:44:48,00:44:49,Okay.
00:44:49,00:44:50,"Yeah, there was one in Hong Kong."
00:44:50,00:44:51,I used to go to growing up.
00:44:51,00:44:53,Maybe on a Vienna as well.
00:44:53,00:44:54,It's like a new effect for the view.
00:44:54,00:44:56,"Yeah, it's a wonderful idea."
00:44:56,00:44:59,"Mentioning the restaurant is really interesting because you would expect, as the post office"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"tower, which had a genuine reason to exist."
00:45:02,00:45:04,It was helping with communications throughout Britain.
00:45:04,00:45:06,It was this beacon of communication.
00:45:06,00:45:11,"But very randomly, they did open a restaurant that was available to the public and which was"
00:45:11,00:45:12,run by Butland.
00:45:12,00:45:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:13,00:45:14,I think I heard about Butland.
00:45:14,00:45:15,Yeah.
00:45:15,00:45:16,"Yeah, so weird."
00:45:16,00:45:20,And it feels like this was the original London eye because everything was sort of designed
00:45:20,00:45:21,to have the...
00:45:21,00:45:22,A tourist spot.
00:45:22,00:45:23,A tourist spot.
00:45:23,00:45:26,"You know, you went in the elevator, which was the fastest in Britain, supposedly at the time."
00:45:26,00:45:27,You would go up.
00:45:27,00:45:31,The ushers who would put you in there were termed space flight conductors.
00:45:31,00:45:32,"You know, they..."
00:45:32,00:45:36,"And when you go to London eye, it's pretty similar wordage when it was run by B.A."
00:45:36,00:45:37,"You know, that they would use."
00:45:37,00:45:41,"And yeah, about 50,000 people visited it in the first few weeks alone and one and a half"
00:45:41,00:45:43,million in the first year.
00:45:43,00:45:46,And one of the people who went there was the Queen.
00:45:46,00:45:48,Queen Liz for the second who went for dinner with Billy Butland.
00:45:48,00:45:49,Really?
00:45:49,00:45:51,Could we say why it was set up?
00:45:51,00:45:52,Absolutely.
00:45:52,00:45:53,I suppose it was Tower.
00:45:53,00:45:54,Yeah.
00:45:54,00:45:55,So I didn't know this really.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"But basically, there was this big need for more broadcasting capacity."
00:45:57,00:45:58,And they had two options.
00:45:58,00:46:02,"They could either do it with underground cables, which would be a lot neater, but would involve"
00:46:02,00:46:06,a lot more mess putting them in because you basically have to dig up the route into central
00:46:06,00:46:10,"London or loads of routes into central London, like huge pain to do."
00:46:10,00:46:15,Or you just use a radio tower that's so tall that the beams don't get interrupted
00:46:15,00:46:16,by existing buildings.
00:46:16,00:46:21,And they literally just had to build something higher than they used microwave radio channels.
00:46:21,00:46:22,That was the big thing.
00:46:22,00:46:24,"So let make people make phone calls, did it?"
00:46:24,00:46:28,"It was phone calls and TV channels, so it could handle 150,000 phone calls simultaneously"
00:46:28,00:46:29,and 40 TV channels.
00:46:29,00:46:32,So it was a big improvement on the previous system.
00:46:32,00:46:37,"And it was covered in these big things called microwave horns, which is these huge triangular"
00:46:37,00:46:38,blocks.
00:46:38,00:46:44,"And basically, just to absorb and soak up microwave signals, it's such a cool thing."
00:46:44,00:46:45,Yeah.
00:46:45,00:46:46,Love it.
00:46:46,00:46:52,"It's called Eric Bedford, who is the chief architect of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works."
00:46:52,00:46:59,"And he made it, he said, to be sort of nuclear proof, which kind of got a little test when"
00:46:59,00:47:03,"a bomb went off in the bathroom of the restaurant, which is the reason it's no longer open to"
00:47:03,00:47:04,the public.
00:47:04,00:47:05,Wasn't that nuclear bomb?
00:47:05,00:47:06,We should say.
00:47:06,00:47:07,We should add that.
00:47:07,00:47:08,Yeah.
00:47:08,00:47:09,That's a good detail to add.
00:47:09,00:47:10,Absolutely.
00:47:10,00:47:11,Yeah.
00:47:11,00:47:12,It was a regular bomb.
00:47:12,00:47:13,No one died.
00:47:13,00:47:17,Cars and buildings around it had their windows go in.
00:47:17,00:47:18,And it was the IRA.
00:47:18,00:47:19,What did it?
00:47:19,00:47:20,Apparently.
00:47:20,00:47:21,The Angry Brigade.
00:47:21,00:47:27,"Well, I think we think it was the IRA because it had all the hallmarks of an IRA attack."
00:47:27,00:47:29,And the IRA also said that they did it.
00:47:29,00:47:33,"But then there was also this group called the Angry Gade, who was like a left wing anarchist"
00:47:33,00:47:34,group.
00:47:34,00:47:36,Then they also said they did it.
00:47:36,00:47:40,But I think the general consensus is that the angry people sort of jumped on the chance
00:47:40,00:47:42,of claiming it for themselves.
00:47:42,00:47:44,"It's much easier, isn't it?"
00:47:44,00:47:49,To claim you've committed a big attack than to actually go to all the hassle of planning
00:47:49,00:47:50,and conducting it.
00:47:50,00:47:51,Yeah.
00:47:51,00:47:54,You are reliant on other people to do the work for you.
00:47:54,00:47:55,Yeah.
00:47:55,00:47:56,It's not a reliable gig.
00:47:56,00:47:57,No.
00:47:57,00:48:00,This is why it was an official secret for so long that we're actually was.
00:48:00,00:48:01,That's also...
00:48:01,00:48:02,Would that explain that more?
00:48:02,00:48:03,Because that's so fascinating.
00:48:03,00:48:04,You can't miss this tower.
00:48:04,00:48:05,Yeah.
00:48:05,00:48:06,It's in Central London.
00:48:06,00:48:10,"It's towering above everything else, yet it didn't officially exist."
00:48:10,00:48:11,Yeah.
00:48:11,00:48:12,Maybe you saw your trip.
00:48:12,00:48:13,I see it debunked a bit.
00:48:13,00:48:16,"I feel like you couldn't put it on an ordinary and sorry map, but you could."
00:48:16,00:48:20,"But I think you weren't supposed to say where it was, but it was really, really big."
00:48:20,00:48:21,It was definitely up and everywhere.
00:48:21,00:48:24,"It was on some ardent survey maps, but not all of them."
00:48:24,00:48:25,It's really weird.
00:48:25,00:48:26,Yeah.
00:48:26,00:48:29,"And there was this theory, or there's this long-held thing that you couldn't take a photo"
00:48:29,00:48:33,"of it legally, or you'd be arrested if you took a photo of one of the biggest landmarks"
00:48:33,00:48:34,in literally the tallest thing in the country.
00:48:34,00:48:40,"I think what is true is if you took a photo of it and gave it to an enemy of Britain,"
00:48:40,00:48:41,you could get done for it.
00:48:41,00:48:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:42,00:48:43,I think that's fair.
00:48:43,00:48:47,And that's true of anything that's used for communications in the UK.
00:48:47,00:48:50,Any building that makes stuff for the Navy.
00:48:50,00:48:53,There's a whole load of list of things that you're just not allowed to take photos of it
00:48:53,00:48:54,and give it to Russia.
00:48:54,00:48:55,So are they?
00:48:55,00:48:56,Are they like below the Google maps then?
00:48:56,00:48:57,I don't know.
00:48:57,00:49:00,"Because I remember when I went to Dartmore years ago, this is in the ordnance of the"
00:49:00,00:49:01,map.
00:49:01,00:49:03,"This is a big block in the middle, and just say, I don't know."
00:49:03,00:49:04,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:49:04,00:49:06,But literally the post office had issued stamps of this thing.
00:49:06,00:49:07,Yeah.
00:49:07,00:49:08,"Well, it was built."
00:49:08,00:49:10,"I mean, it was, it was definitely, yeah, it was built up there."
00:49:10,00:49:15,"It was, I think, part of a communications network that was kind of a Cold War thing, which"
00:49:15,00:49:18,was why Bedford had supposedly designed it to be nuclear bomb proof.
00:49:18,00:49:21,"I mean, it's clearly not nuclear bomb proof, depending on how close the bomb goes off,"
00:49:21,00:49:22,but whatever.
00:49:22,00:49:27,"But in the event of a nuclear war, I think it would have been part of the backbone system"
00:49:27,00:49:29,to provide secure communications.
00:49:29,00:49:30,I don't think it's needed anymore now.
00:49:30,00:49:31,I do.
00:49:31,00:49:33,"So you can, if you'd like, take a photo and hand it to Britain's enemies."
00:49:33,00:49:34,I like Danza.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"Don't, don't."
00:49:35,00:49:36,"I mean, don't."
00:49:36,00:49:37,You know.
00:49:37,00:49:42,"Danza, yeah, if they had sold it as, like, more as the London Eye, because maybe the London"
00:49:42,00:49:43,Eye's got a purpose we don't know about.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"Oh, 100%."
00:49:44,00:49:45,Really?
00:49:45,00:49:46,That's such a good point.
00:49:46,00:49:47,"Yeah, obviously."
00:49:47,00:49:48,Hundie pay.
00:49:48,00:49:49,Obviously.
00:49:49,00:49:50,Really?
00:49:50,00:49:52,They sold one and a half thousand plastic towers when they first opened in the gift shop
00:49:52,00:49:53,in the first few weeks.
00:49:53,00:49:54,"Oh, that makes sense."
00:49:54,00:49:55,This is so cool.
00:49:55,00:49:56,"Yeah, it makes sense."
00:49:56,00:49:57,"Like, what else?"
00:49:57,00:49:58,"Like, if you're going to hide it in plain sight, you have to give it another purpose."
00:49:58,00:50:01,All of those will have made their way to Moscow for further study.
00:50:01,00:50:02,I presume.
00:50:02,00:50:03,"Like, yeah."
00:50:03,00:50:04,It's a secret.
00:50:04,00:50:05,"Oh, we are selling skill models in the gift shop."
00:50:05,00:50:09,"They've had teams of tiny, tiny, tiny spies looking at those in detail."
00:50:09,00:50:14,It appears that the post office tower was made in Taiwan.
00:50:14,00:50:18,And the London Eye clearly is designed to come off the central spoke and roll.
00:50:18,00:50:19,"Yeah, it's a giant youth cycle."
00:50:19,00:50:24,"Yeah, it's to get, like, all the most important people in London out."
00:50:24,00:50:25,"Oh, so they each get in a pod."
00:50:25,00:50:26,You dismantle it.
00:50:26,00:50:27,And then it rolls out.
00:50:27,00:50:29,And then it just rolls down the Thames into the sea.
00:50:29,00:50:30,"Yeah, exactly."
00:50:30,00:50:31,"So, yes, really."
00:50:31,00:50:35,"Yes, sorry."
00:50:35,00:50:39,And the final piece of cement on the post office tower was laid by Geoffrey Rippon MP.
00:50:39,00:50:41,"At the top, right at the bottom, at the top."
00:50:41,00:50:43,I would say unloom to the pod.
00:50:43,00:50:44,Unknown to the pub.
00:50:44,00:50:45,It's never been on.
00:50:45,00:50:49,He was our chief negotiator to the EEC in the 1970s.
00:50:49,00:50:50,"So you say, how are you?"
00:50:50,00:50:51,I mean Britain's not.
00:50:51,00:50:52,We didn't fish.
00:50:52,00:50:53,We're not negotiating with the EEC.
00:50:53,00:50:54,We haven't been in that long.
00:50:54,00:50:55,We haven't.
00:50:55,00:51:00,And the one thing I read about him from his old b*tchery is he had an enduring dislike
00:51:00,00:51:01,of the d*tch.
00:51:01,00:51:02,Oh.
00:51:02,00:51:03,Oh.
00:51:03,00:51:05,That's in the obituary.
00:51:05,00:51:09,"God, that's really got to be enduring if it's in the obituary."
00:51:09,00:51:10,It's amazing.
00:51:10,00:51:11,So he was negotiating.
00:51:11,00:51:13,And everyone had told him that the d*tch loved the British.
00:51:13,00:51:16,"And Charles De Gaulle said, you have a d*tchery always on the British side."
00:51:16,00:51:20,"But then when they did negotiating, the d*tchery actually quite against the British."
00:51:20,00:51:22,And he really took that to his grave.
00:51:22,00:51:24,He really hated the d*tch.
00:51:24,00:51:25,Wow.
00:51:25,00:51:26,It's just so random.
00:51:26,00:51:27,Gosh.
00:51:27,00:51:29,Apologies to our d*tch listeners.
00:51:29,00:51:30,Secret buildings.
00:51:30,00:51:31,Yeah.
00:51:31,00:51:32,Just as the first of a tower is this big secret thing.
00:51:32,00:51:35,And I know you're very much into your espionage.
00:51:35,00:51:36,Not to say too much.
00:51:36,00:51:37,Not to say too much.
00:51:37,00:51:38,Not to say too much.
00:51:38,00:51:39,Not to say too much.
00:51:39,00:51:40,Not to give too much away.
00:51:40,00:51:46,But you've had to come from across the river to make the recording.
00:51:46,00:51:49,"And does not show up on any photos, any maps."
00:51:49,00:51:50,She's just blurred.
00:51:50,00:51:55,"For listeners, Andy was touching his nose suggestively throughout the last two minutes."
00:51:55,00:51:57,I think that can be heard.
00:51:57,00:51:59,I think that can be literally heard.
00:51:59,00:52:06,"So Voxel Cross, which is the building, the very famous head of the secret intelligence service."
00:52:06,00:52:08,The one that's on the South Bank of the Thames.
00:52:08,00:52:10,The one that's on the South Bank of the Thames.
00:52:10,00:52:11,You see it in James Bond?
00:52:11,00:52:12,Yeah.
00:52:12,00:52:15,It's a bit of it gets blown up in that film.
00:52:15,00:52:17,One of the one of the Daniel Craig ones.
00:52:17,00:52:18,It's a terrific building.
00:52:18,00:52:19,It looks really straight.
00:52:19,00:52:20,Yeah.
00:52:20,00:52:22,"You know, it looks quite striking."
00:52:22,00:52:23,But I really like this.
00:52:23,00:52:27,"So basically, there were some clues that it was going to be a secret building."
00:52:27,00:52:32,Because the government bought the site outright for 135 million quid.
00:52:32,00:52:36,"Normally, they would pay in chunks and there would be total accountability and transparency at every stage."
00:52:36,00:52:40,"And the government just said, no, we're going to buy this for 130 million quid."
00:52:40,00:52:41,Right.
00:52:41,00:52:42,No questions.
00:52:42,00:52:43,"Go away, please."
00:52:43,00:52:44,"Yeah, exactly."
00:52:44,00:52:46,But the architect was a guy called Terry Farrell.
00:52:46,00:52:47,And he just died.
00:52:47,00:52:48,He did loads of stuff.
00:52:48,00:52:50,He also did the HQ for ITV's TVAM.
00:52:50,00:52:51,So he's done some big gigs.
00:52:51,00:52:54,"Which they built the building, not purpose built."
00:52:54,00:52:56,"And they just said, we'll have this."
00:52:56,00:52:57,This is the crazy thing.
00:52:57,00:52:58,Yeah.
00:52:58,00:53:03,"He was basically instructed to build a standard office block, which then was going to get some more of a case."
00:53:03,00:53:05,"It's like, yeah, it can blast up."
00:53:05,00:53:06,Roll down the tent.
00:53:06,00:53:07,Roll down the tent.
00:53:07,00:53:08,"Yeah, exactly."
00:53:08,00:53:13,The London I will pour at the MI6.
00:53:13,00:53:14,Pick everyone up.
00:53:14,00:53:15,That's pod 12.
00:53:15,00:53:18,"No, but he didn't know who he was working for really."
00:53:18,00:53:20,He knew he was making a government department.
00:53:20,00:53:23,And he guessed it was going to be the department of the environment.
00:53:23,00:53:28,"Which is why, if you look closely, which you're not allowed to do, there are lots of fir tree designs."
00:53:28,00:53:30,Halfway at the facade of the edge.
00:53:30,00:53:32,Because he thought it was going to be the environment ministry.
00:53:32,00:53:33,How presumptuous.
00:53:33,00:53:37,I've been to the to the bottom to the outside of that building.
00:53:37,00:53:39,It was quite fun when you look for a Wi-Fi.
00:53:39,00:53:42,It says things like MI6 surveillance van.
00:53:42,00:53:46,And it's obviously local people who live in the area who just name their things.
00:53:46,00:53:47,Is it?
00:53:47,00:53:48,Is it double bluff?
00:53:48,00:53:49,It's a perfect double bluff.
00:53:49,00:53:50,Is it true?
00:53:50,00:53:51,That's true.
00:53:51,00:53:52,"Did you try and connect to the Wi-Fi, Dan?"
00:53:52,00:53:53,I did.
00:53:53,00:53:54,Gosh.
00:53:54,00:53:56,"MI6 is going to be absolutely all over you, Dan."
00:53:56,00:54:01,Can I see my favourite recent public name suggestions story that I found?
00:54:01,00:54:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:02,00:54:05,"Every year, in the UK, there were issues every year with leaves on the track."
00:54:05,00:54:07,And the trains can't run.
00:54:07,00:54:08,So networked real to combat this.
00:54:08,00:54:09,Had these special trains.
00:54:09,00:54:11,And they got a high pressure of water jets.
00:54:11,00:54:12,"Like, last of all, keep them clean."
00:54:12,00:54:13,Keep everything running.
00:54:13,00:54:18,They held a public list of public suggestions for us to name the new special leaf fighting train.
00:54:18,00:54:20,You guys want to guess what they could be called?
00:54:20,00:54:21,I genuinely love the name that one.
00:54:21,00:54:22,Okay.
00:54:22,00:54:23,I'll tell you some contenders to get you started.
00:54:23,00:54:24,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:54:24,00:54:25,So contenders who did not win.
00:54:25,00:54:26,Brittany clears.
00:54:26,00:54:27,"Oh, that's good."
00:54:27,00:54:29,"Um, leaf full weapon."
00:54:29,00:54:30,"Yeah, I like it."
00:54:30,00:54:33,And it's a bit say yellow anti leaf machinery.
00:54:33,00:54:35,That was my one I was going to suggest.
00:54:35,00:54:36,It's massive.
00:54:36,00:54:37,So that one did not win.
00:54:37,00:54:39,"Um, leaf us alone."
00:54:39,00:54:40,"Yeah, pretty good."
00:54:40,00:54:41,Leaf Ericsson.
00:54:41,00:54:43,Who's that?
00:54:43,00:54:48,"Me, sure."
00:54:48,00:54:49,Why doesn't that win?
00:54:49,00:54:50,That's crazy.
00:54:50,00:54:52,"Jays, Mr. Dad, like to send it in."
00:54:52,00:54:54,"Leaf, yeah, by 800 years."
00:54:54,00:54:55,I'm serious.
00:54:55,00:54:57,Leaf and Skewder.
00:54:57,00:54:59,"I mean, for the podcast, right?"
00:54:59,00:55:02,"Um, chlorophyll, your boots."
00:55:02,00:55:03,Go on.
00:55:03,00:55:04,Leafs contain chlorophyll.
00:55:04,00:55:05,Fill your boots as a phrase.
00:55:05,00:55:06,Yeah.
00:55:06,00:55:09,They went with control out the leaf.
00:55:09,00:55:10,That's very good.
00:55:10,00:55:11,That's what they went with.
00:55:11,00:55:12,That's good rap.
00:55:12,00:55:13,That's very good.
00:55:13,00:55:14,Really like that.
00:55:14,00:55:18,It's a bit better than chlorophyll.
00:55:18,00:55:19,Yeah.
00:55:19,00:55:20,Yeah.
00:55:20,00:55:21,Okay.
00:55:21,00:55:22,That's it.
00:55:22,00:55:23,That is all of our facts.
