00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,920
 Daniel Shriver is not here this week

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:14,520
 He has gone to a place that shares a name with something you might take to the beach with you

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,640
 And if you listen to the rest of this episode, you'll be able to work that out

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,520
 But anyway, the main thing is that Dan is not here this week

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,040
 And so we needed someone to replace him and who have we got we have the most incredible guest

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,600
 It is comedian Lucy Potter

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,560
 You will absolutely love her on this week's podcast and at the end you're definitely going to want to check out all of her stuff

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,280
 And that would include fingers on buzzers, which is a podcast

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,720
 She does all about quizzing with my good friend and the fixen from the TV show the chase Jenny Ryan

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,520
 Lucy is also got a brand new stand-up show called wake up call

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,360
 She's taken it to the Edinburgh Fringe this year and then she'll be touring the UK in 2023

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,800
 If you want to go and see that and I definitely recommend you do that then go to Lucy Potter dot co dot UK

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 And you can find out more about Lucy

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,320
 Anyway, I'm certain you're gonna really really enjoy this podcast. We had such a good time making it and

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,200
 What else is there to say apart from on with the podcast?

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:39,280
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the qi offices in Covent Garden

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,480
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, and I'm joined this week by James Harkin Anna Tajinsky and special guest

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,080
 It's Lucy Porter and once again

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,560
 We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,880
 We go starting with Lucy my fact is that if you were a baby born in Korea in

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,400
 December 2020 you could be one two or three years old

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,340
 Just take your pick. Yeah multiple choice just be winner. I am very keen on being able to manipulate your age

24
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
 There's so many people in show business are

25
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,200
 And but I had never heard of this until I was watching Ultimate Beast Master, which is my favorite of the

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,720
 competitive obstacle course shows

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:35,240
 It is it's like it's

28
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,040
 yes, it's a big beast and there was a Korean contestant on that and

29
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,080
 Talking about his kid and he went all these two in Korean age and I was like what what is Korean age?

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,840
 And it turns out that in Korea and other parts of East Asia. There is a different numbering system for age

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,220
 So the Korean system, which is when you're born you're a year old

32
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,040
 Right the minute you come out. That's your first birthday

33
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,080
 Which makes sense because your first birthday is your first birthday. So

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
 So then you

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:15,080
 Gain another year every New Year's Day. So effectively what that means is everybody gets a year older on the same day

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,700
 Which I I like the idea of that because I think birthdays are

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,400
 Depressing when you wake up and you're maybe a little bit hungover certainly a bit tired after your birthday and you're another year

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 Older whereas in Korea everybody celebrates on the same, but then it'd be hard to get a table in TGI Fridays

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,040
 Wouldn't it if everyone had a birthday the same day? Yeah, the soul branch

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,200
 Also, you've literally just had to buy everyone Christmas presents and then you have to buy an entire new raft of birthday presents

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
 Oh, yeah, well you'd get two for one wouldn't you? I mean it would be you can shoot it like that

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

43
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,840
 So there's one system where you get a new birthday a new year every New Year's Day

44
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,280
 There's another system which is the New Year birthday where you are no years old when you're born

45
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,800
 You have your first birthday after a year and then you do the thing where you add a year on New Year's Day

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,600
 Or of course, they also use the international system where you just turn one year older on your actual birthday

47
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,960
 So that means you can have three different

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,800
 or ages three different ages

49
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,680
 Did anyone else used to think it was so unfair that people born in a leap year like my granny?

50
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,120
 I remember she was born on 29th Feb and I thought that meant she would live four times longer than the rest

51
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,440
 Because we'd always say, you know, oh Gamma's only 15 years old

52
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,040
 And so interesting then I used to get so annoyed and actually she has not lived it turns out four times longer than everyone

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
 That is a shame. That is a real shame

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,680
 But there was a study wasn't there of three four and five year old children

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,560
 asking them about you know changing your age and birthdays and stuff and

56
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,240
 Quite a large percentage of them thought that when you had a birthday that was when you got older

57
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,400
 And so if you had like three birthday parties in a week, you would gain three years straight away

58
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
 terrifying

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
 Four-year-olds

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,720
 Well the because the Queen to birthday thing I always was when I was a kid

61
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,320
 I was very jealous as you would be and like why do you get two birthdays?

62
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,160
 Because my birthday is the end of January, which is a rubbish time. You should get to choose when your birthday is, shouldn't you?

63
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,520
 Well, the reason apparently the Queen has her

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,520
 Birthday the two birthdays was it was George the second who had a November birthday and he was like well the weather's always miserable

65
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,960
 So I'll move it to

66
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,040
 June or whenever really yeah, but the she actually has loads because she has the official birthday the actual birthday and then

67
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,720
 New Zealand Canada Australia. Yeah, we've done it. We mentioned once James worked out that she's actually 79,000 years old

68
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 She was definitely in the high hundreds

69
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,880
 669

70
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,720
 Was it I think this is what's happened to me is that I've actually I've aged in dog years somehow

71
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 We all consider you royalty

72
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 I think that might have come across

73
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,040
 The grand old dame of it. I've actually had five hundred and eighty six birthdays

74
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,400
 In Korea they even find this confusing don't they to the extent that they are apparently changing it

75
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 Although I don't know if they they will the president elect who I think might be president by the time this podcast goes out

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
 President Yoon

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,040
 He says he plans to abolish it and seventy one percent of Koreans are in favor of abolishing it because they're confused

78
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,680
 And also when you have things like the retirement age sometimes

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,160
 There was a thing with COVID wasn't there where you were getting your injections at a certain age

80
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,960
 But they didn't say whether it was your Korean age or your international age or whatever and so people were kind of gaming the system

81
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,360
 Well, I suppose as well for things like if you're you know on the cusp of being able to drink booze or yeah

82
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,240
 I remember when I was young and I used to I didn't like to lie because I'm very Catholic

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,960
 guilty so if I was asked for my age when I was trying to buy a booze illegally I would say oh well I am in

84
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,240
 My 18th year

85
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,000
 No, of course not because I've sounded like I was a Victorian

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,620
 I am in my 18th year you're either a time javeler or you're in your hundred and fifty

87
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,760
 Well, the other thing for Koreans that is difficult is that you?

88
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,080
 Greet people and talk to people differently depending on their age

89
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,680
 So you do actually need to know how old people are because that will affect how you talk to them

90
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
 So if you're saying happy birthday to someone if they're your age or younger

91
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,280
 You say sang ill took her hey if they're a little bit older than you you say sang ill took her hey you and

92
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,980
 If they're much older than you you say sang ill do okay

93
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,360
 Yeah, yeah, I was so confident at the beginning

94
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,280
 Do you know that's some witch doctor?

95
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:59,000
 I apologize to our Korean listeners, but that itself seems absolutely

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 ripe with the potential for offense because if you're someone's older than you

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,840
 Well here you just get some of the very insulting card and that's how you do

98
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,520
 Horrible card that you see in the shops racks and racks of these cards saying you old bastard

99
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,140
 I always just go for one with a dog on the front or something

100
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:30,800
 Well, it is women overwhelmingly buy greetings cards, don't they but they buy them for men to give so apparently

101
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,160
 It's like I'm gonna make up a statistic because why not like

102
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:45,400
 80% of greetings cards are bought by women so it's women buying really you know cards for their husbands to give to people

103
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,160
 They really don't like but not back to them to give to other other members of the family or friends or whatever

104
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,400
 Go to a shop if you were buying something for your husband to buy for you

105
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,160
 We may have mentioned this before that women buy almost all the candles made on the planet 98% of candles made in the world by women

106
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:16,760
 And is it is it truly so that women buy horrible candles for their husbands to give people you know smelling of burning tires and stuff like that

107
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,520
 The last candle I bought smelled like Jeremy Clarkson's balls

108
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,760
 Yeah, I was like I recognize that smell

109
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
 Yeah

110
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,220
 Yeah, a whole anecdote

111
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:41,760
 United it's a natural partnership

112
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,600
 Anyway, South Korea yeah in 2017 they became the highest life expectancy in the world

113
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,840
 So a girl who was gonna be born let's say in

114
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,480
 2025 or 2030 would expect to live to about 91 we think

115
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 Men probably around 84

116
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,320
 Now the reason I saw in an article that they're living so long possibly kimchi is very good for you

117
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,480
 Another thing they said hypochondria

118
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,120
 Apparently only 35% of Koreans believe they're in good health and so they all go to the doctors a lot

119
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,500
 And apparently that's one reason why they live a long time

120
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,120
 But I also thought that obviously we're adding two years to their age

121
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,800
 Yeah, I mean we have no idea how old these people are. Let's be honest. They are very much

122
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,900
 You know, do you remember we did a story a couple of years ago Doris Day found out that she was two years older than she thought

123
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,160
 she was turning 93 and

124
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,800
 So to sort of celebrate her birthday

125
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,080
 Ohio's office of vital statistics looked into her life and stuff and uncovered some cool stuff about her

126
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,960
 One of the things they uncovered was that she wasn't born in 1924 if she thought she was born in 1922

127
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,960
 So she was 95 in Busan as well, isn't it? She was Korean

128
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:03,460
 You can't tell how so Doris Day couldn't have told how old she was by going in a scanner or something because I was reading about this

129
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,800
 It's so hard to tell how old people are based on their bones

130
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,720
 So there are lots of arenas where it's tested like dental scans and the other thing is wrist bones

131
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,360
 Apparently, this is a way of measuring but it's not very accurate because when do you think you get your adult wrists?

132
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,720
 I thought that I had the I think men get them about 13 or 14

133
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,680
 Just in time. I genuinely thought I had the wrist now that I was born with

134
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,640
 James, you're not Popeye

135
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,920
 Because James got quite powerful wrists, you know, do I yeah, but what I thought so you're born with a wrist

136
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,400
 I mean, you know, I know babies are floppy

137
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,840
 Basically wrists can reach maturity, which is where the bones are fused in a particular way

138
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,960
 As young as the age of 15, but on average it's 17.6 years that you know

139
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,040
 That's the average age that rests mature

140
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,120
 But it completely varies and most children do have adult wrists as it were before they are actually adults

141
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,760
 So that is a bad way of telling what so I didn't actually realize our wrist fused differently as adults to as children

142
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,800
 I assume they were just the same as the rest of us and gradually grew but they transform into grown-up wrists

143
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,500
 Yeah, they do they develop they develop more serious wristwatches. That's the way

144
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,000
 The old Mickey Mouse watch falls off

145
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,720
 Timex or something grows in its place. Yeah, just like bones music like your collarbone for example that that's the last bit

146
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
 Of your body. Yeah

147
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,600
 Interesting, but then also even if you can tell that they're probably over 15 or whatever you can't tell anything beyond that by the wrist

148
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,200
 Can you so everyone's either under 15 to 17 or over 15 to 17 if that's how you're aging people and also you've had to cut off their hand

149
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,680
 This is gonna make getting into nightclubs very

150
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:57,520
 Like with fish you can tell with their ears right they have little otoliths in their ears

151
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,240
 Yeah, and they get an extra, you know, it's like a tree ring

152
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,680
 Yeah, and you can count the rings, but we don't have that. It's what you're saying. That's what I'm saying

153
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,800
 You know happy birthday. Yeah song because I don't know if we mentioned that it was illegal for it

154
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,760
 It wasn't illegal for ages. It was copyrighted for ages. Sorry

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,260
 Yeah, but people in yeah, people in TV shows and films would sing. Yeah, exactly

156
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,440
 Exactly, we're just sort of how it gets on anyway

157
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,040
 It was even illegal to sing it in a made-up language. I like it so much

158
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,680
 There was an episode of Star Trek where they were going to sing a happy birthday in Klingon and they checked it out

159
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,640
 They thought no, we can't do that. Wow thousands of dollars to, you know, water triple who had it

160
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,960
 So they replaced it with for he's a jolly good fellow in Klingon. I

161
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,200
 Read something the other day on Twitter and I think it was Jason Haseley who tweeted this but it could have been Joel Morris

162
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,960
 But they basically said that when you sing happy birthday, the first note you sing is the lowest note you will ever sing

163
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,480
 Yes, and that's really useful to know because when you get to the end

164
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120
 It's too high and you know if you started too high then you can't reach that last note

165
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,960
 But if you know that the first one is the lowest you can start really low

166
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,040
 And by the time you get to the end you'll be able to sing it properly

167
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,200
 I did anyone else genuinely think that James Wendt is the lowest note you'll ever sing

168
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,520
 The only way you can reach those depths

169
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,920
 That is the note that makes people poo themselves

170
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,520
 Scientifically proven it makes for very awkward birthday parties

171
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:36,800
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna

172
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,320
 My fact this week is that in 2018 a new quiz show was launched on

173
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,800
 Chinese prime-time TV where all the answers were about Xi Jinping

174
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,200
 Feels like an easy quiz now the quick fire round

175
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,000
 Or if you're doing blockbusters, which acts

176
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,760
 Like well, he's lived a long time now, I think he's done quite a lot

177
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,440
 So there's a lot of stuff to memorize there

178
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,640
 But yeah, it managed to last for five full episodes of Xi Jinping based trivia. It wasn't it wasn't canceled

179
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,320
 Well, it can't have been cancelled because the ratings were like, I don't think yeah

180
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,440
 Yeah, it wasn't counts that are the questions like which

181
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,120
 Premier from China looks nothing like Winnie the Pooh

182
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,080
 It was quite similar to that

183
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,400
 Some people would say it was embarrassingly brazen

184
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,960
 But so this was on Hunan TV, which is China's most popular TV channel for young people and it's called studying Xi in the new era

185
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
 and it was about

186
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:45,040
 understanding his thought and memorizing bits of his speeches and knowing interesting facts about his life and

187
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,560
 The questions were things like and they all got it right. So I think well, you would wouldn't you?

188
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,280
 You would the ones who got it wrong. We now move to sudden death. I

189
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,000
 Watched a quiz over Christmas and it was a Harry Potter quiz

190
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,280
 And it was loads of teams and they were all massive Harry Potter nerds. No one got a single question wrong in the whole show

191
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,940
 One person would get one question wrong and then that would be the end because no one else would get anything wrong

192
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,220
 Was that close to by Helen Mirren? I don't recall. Yeah, maybe there wasn't sort of Harry Potter tournament

193
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,880
 Because you ask young people about anything they're interested in and they know everything about it

194
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,440
 That's the beauty of being young and having a memory isn't it?

195
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,520
 It's absolutely pointless. It reminds me of when Andy Osho was on mastermind the brilliant comedian Andy Osho

196
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,880
 And her specialist subject was John Humphries who was the host at the time

197
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,040
 Yeah, get in his head. Is there an advantage to getting in his head? I guess so well

198
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,480
 I mean, it's a very strange place to be his head

199
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,400
 I mean, yeah, I did mastermind when he was the host and we had to you know

200
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,600
 You do like the banter and it was a very strange chat

201
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,040
 I mean, we'll come back to that can I ask quickly about the Andy Osho thing when he phrased the questions

202
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,040
 Did he ask about himself in the third person or did he say what a what a color of my pants?

203
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:22,280
 Anyway, so Xi Jinping is I'm sure he's very embarrassed about this program and just can't leave

204
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,720
 They made it about him and it feels dreadful that they've had to do it, but it does feel a bit like a propaganda thing

205
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,600
 But they there's some interesting facts. I learned about him from it

206
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,060
 So he knows the whole of Faustus off by heart because one of the questions was

207
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,680
 At the age of 15 president Xi was sent to become a farmer during that period

208
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,760
 He walked 15 kilometers to borrow a book. What was the name of the book?

209
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,560
 Faustus very strong

210
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,120
 Anna I was reading this this this she quiz was a follow-up to another ideology-based quiz, which was called marks got it right

211
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,520
 Mmm, which had a very ambiguous take actually on Marks's legacy

212
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,380
 We could have called it like top marks or something

213
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:12,480
 The New York Times reported that contestants have nothing to lose but their chains, which is a very good nice. That's funny

214
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
 Yeah, and the winner is everyone

215
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,760
 Forever

216
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,440
 Just in terms of Chinese high-stakes quizzing

217
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,480
 The exam to be in the civil service in Imperial China

218
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,480
 Was even more gruelling than this TV game show

219
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,760
 So you would take bedding a chamber pot in can brushes and spend three days and two nights

220
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,480
 In an exam center

221
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,720
 And if people died the walls were so high that apparently nothing could get in so that there was no possibility of cheating

222
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,400
 And also you'd write your exam paper, and then it would be transcribed by someone else so that there was no chance of somebody

223
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,400
 Seeing your handwriting and recognizing it and if you died you were just bundled up in a sack and tossed over the fence

224
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,880
 I tossed over the wall. Um, is that right? Thanks for playing

225
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:14,520
 School there was always a rumor wasn't there in your GCSE's or whatever that if someone died in your year then everyone would get an A

226
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 Do you remember that? No

227
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,700
 They just told us if someone died they get tossed over the wall

228
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,440
 Yeah, that's more of an incentive isn't it really?

229
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:32,360
 Yeah, it was amazing that thing wasn't it it changed throughout their centuries because these exams they took place throughout all the different

230
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,720
 Chinese eras but at one stage

231
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,080
 They came up with them an exam to do the exam and then when you pass that exam

232
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,800
 You would get to do the main exam and then everyone who did that main exam then would do one final exam

233
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,640
 So you had to do two exams to get to the final exam the emperor themselves would apparently supervise the final exam

234
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,040
 Invigilate yeah, again, that's very scary hearing the clack clack clack

235
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,720
 And no gum

236
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,560
 Apparently the first exam that you would do which was the regional one

237
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,760
 It was so big and so important that all of your family and friends would kind of sit outside because they want to know how you did and

238
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,940
 They would set up like stalls and food stalls and stuff so that they'd be able to see

239
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:28,600
 On communism and quizzing in 1975 on University Challenge

240
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,660
 You'll probably know this Lucy and James about the Manchester University

241
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,840
 Team which was David Aronovich. I didn't know he did this journalist now

242
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,640
 Of course very famous journalist, but he was a socialist student back then and he ended with a team

243
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,560
 It seems to be some kind of accident because they entered intending to take down University Challenge from the inside for its elitism

244
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:56,120
 Okay, and answered sort of Trotsky Engels marks until they got told off for a question. Okay. Well, yes until

245
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,120
 Bambagasco and got really pissed off which of the Kardashians

246
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,380
 Yeah, no footage exists of it sadly. No, but yeah, it's a legendary University Challenge

247
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,200
 And that it's interesting that no footage exists because it's really the fallibility of memory because

248
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,640
 According to David Aronovich, he just said nonsense answers. He remembers it as like he answered like yellow brick road or fluffy hat

249
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:29,160
 I did what the the sort of so-called celebrity one which is much easier

250
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,720
 Yeah, everyone's like, yeah, you want to do the actual University Challenge

251
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,400
 But yeah, no, I and I went to pieces completely me and Rob Rinder judge Rinder

252
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,560
 They're looking like oh, what are we doing?

253
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,120
 But Lucy was yours was a protest about the elitism of University Challenge

254
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,080
 It absolutely was yet one woman protest stage through the medium of looking a bit confused

255
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,440
 He was testing about his wig

256
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,520
 Well, the no footage exists of that but there is footage readily available of the contestant on

257
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,600
 Family Fortunes the UK version of family feud who answered the same thing

258
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,920
 To every single question in the final round. So I'll ask you the question. Yeah, let's see

259
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,760
 So name a food that you would stuff

260
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,400
 Turkey pepper

261
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,880
 Stuff peps looking turkey was my first thought well turkey is your first thought and that was exactly what

262
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,380
 He answered every single question. Oh every question. Yeah

263
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,320
 Was the stuff one the first answer and then he's got stuck on turkey. No was the next one name a country

264
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 Which?

265
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,760
 What do you get if you remove the letter n from the word turn key

266
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:51,680
 Yeah, well what they think happened was, you know, they have a soundproof booth

267
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,500
 And obviously something had gone wrong with the soundproof booth and he had heard

268
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,200
 The guy who went first answered the question name a foodie stuff with chicken

269
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
 He's sort of lost his mind

270
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,400
 And he came out and the first question was name something you'd take to the beach

271
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 Maybe he did maybe him and that turkey had great days down Brighton Beach

272
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,800
 There's a Chinese quiz show at the moment

273
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,800
 Where one of the most recent episodes one of the people in there had to spell the word toad

274
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,120
 and not only did they get it wrong there were three judges and

275
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,240
 They couldn't decide whether or not they'd spelled it, right? Well, hey, there are two ways of spelling toad

276
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,240
 Toad the line toad the car or

277
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:47,160
 Yeah, this is obviously the Chinese characters dictation competition. Oh, sorry. We were in China

278
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:54,320
 Yeah, we're in China and the thing is that the word toad for the animal has 46 different individual strokes

279
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,360
 And so if you want to do it perfectly, it's actually really really difficult a lot of people make mistakes

280
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,920
 And it was a 14-year-old contestant called you shwang and she missed out one little dot

281
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,480
 In the word toad and two of the three judges noticed and then she got kicked out

282
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,240
 So it wasn't done. It's not done verbally. Is it where you have to say a straight line and then a curve

283
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,760
 So you write it down and then the cameras can see it

284
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,060
 But her teammates are there as well and the camera sort of pans to them and they're all kind of drawing it with their finger in

285
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
 The sky, do you know I mean

286
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:44,240
 That's a really crazy format. Yes, spelling bee in China. Yeah, I didn't write how far bees go back generally and they

287
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,120
 I mean they evolved obviously from insects. No, not those kind of bees

288
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,200
 Bees go back over two centuries. I think in America

289
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,520
 I was looking up the earliest mentions of them in the late 18th century

290
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,720
 There are references to things like quilting bees

291
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,960
 That seems to be the earliest kind and bee just meant a gathering of people who were doing something that was kind of useful

292
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,320
 Often for a single person so a quilting bee would be like this person needs a quilt

293
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,820
 Takes months to make a quilt. They're cold now if we get together

294
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,840
 We'll get it done in one day and you'd have a quilting bee

295
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,200
 But the thing I like best is raising bees

296
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,000
 They were for when a new settler came to town and wanted to live there

297
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,280
 And I guess it was in America where lots of new people were turning up a lot

298
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,320
 Then the raising bee was when the village would get together and build them a house

299
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,960
 Rock up and be like, do you mind having a raising bee?

300
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,520
 The barn thing because the film witness with Harrison Ford where he's he's a cop and he's there's a murderer

301
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,080
 And Amish murder has happened and he's in this weird community that he doesn't know anything about and there's a scene where they raise a barn

302
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,240
 Oh, really? Yeah, it's confusing, isn't it? Because rays can mean either lift something up or burn it to the ground

303
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,840
 If you get the wrong memo, yeah

304
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,600
 If you missed the spelling bee last week

305
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,920
 Turn up a bit late

306
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,600
 Well, if you get the wrong end of the stick with spelling bee then you could be very embarrassed because you think you've just got a spell bee

307
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,520
 Which is one of the easiest words to spell. I might have a drinking bee later if anyone's interested

308
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,240
 Let's just apply bee to anything

309
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
 I'm having a crying bee if anyone wants to join in

310
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
 When you were on mastermind Lucy, did you win mastermind?

311
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,200
 I well, I don't like to talk about it, but I have won it twice and I'm the current champion of champions

312
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
 But I don't like to mention it. I wish I hadn't brought that

313
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,060
 What are your special subjects? So I did Steve Martin the first time and then Victoria Wood

314
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,760
 The second time that I did it, but I thought it'd be quite a nice thing to just sit and watch his movies for a couple of days

315
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,560
 Very good because you are a quiz a but you're also a quiz a I would say because the word quiz a the first use of it

316
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,760
 It was someone who tells jokes

317
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,600
 So a quiz used to be a comedian in

318
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,040
 1797 according to the Oxford English Dictionary the word quiz

319
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:02,000
 I've meant someone who does pranks or jokes or whatever and then obviously the word quiz is more more recent than that

320
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,120
 Isn't it for like quizzing? We think it's 20th century

321
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,400
 Well I for years the legendary origin story of the word quiz was that there was the an Irish theatrical impresario

322
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,760
 Who wanted to attract attention so wrote it on walls in Dublin and everyone said oh, what is quiz and

323
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,960
 Complete nonsense, obviously. Yeah, that guy was called Richard Daly and the anecdote the earliest I could find was from

324
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,600
 1835 in the Manchester Times

325
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,420
 But he died in 1813 so it's quite

326
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,700
 Close to him dying that the anecdote was was used, you know quite contemporary or so on it. How have you seen that word?

327
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:47,320
 I was listening to an old episode and I realized that I don't know how to say that word and I think I've said it quite often

328
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,680
 I don't know how to say I'm gonna leave it but Richard Daly's really interesting

329
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,680
 He he went to Trinity College in Dublin when he was 15 and he was a really turbulent student

330
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,620
 He used to get into fights all the time. Apparently he fought 16 duels in the first two years that he was

331
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:12,840
 And then he left Dublin to go and live in London and we're not sure why but one of the rumors was that he killed a billiard table marker

332
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,440
 In a duel and he had to leave and go to London

333
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,000
 That's a person not a thing well it could be a misprint for maker

334
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,220
 But all of the sources say markers so it could be someone who draws the lights on a billiard table all the old crafter dying out

335
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,680
 Wow, but yeah, and then he went to prison

336
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,840
 After he was doing a show and he got in a fight with an audience member

337
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,320
 And when he was in prison, he wrote a lured account of an affair with one of his singers who was called Elizabeth Billington

338
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,880
 and she was amazing she was

339
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,640
 Basically of all the English singers who have ever gone to Italy up to the current day

340
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,640
 She had the best reputation as the best singer from England ever in Italy. Okay until she shagged this guy

341
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,920
 Well, she was you know, she was sometimes known as the Poland Street Mantrap

342
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,560
 Because she had affairs

343
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,280
 The Prince of Wales the Duke of Sussex this person

344
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:21,280
 And this was the woman who shagged the guy who apparently did actually didn't write the word quiz about town. That's why we're talking about her

345
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,000
 Well, I'm delighted to have heard of her. I want to hear her version of happy birthday

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,240
 The Poland Street Mantrap

347
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,000
 I'm gonna go and hang around Poland

348
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,520
 The Poland Street man repellent

349
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
 That's what I want to be

350
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:50,720
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is my fact my fact is that in 1804

351
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,000
 William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy built a hut lined with moss

352
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,280
 Lucy you're familiar with Andy's moss obsession that we're trying to

353
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,480
 Trump down right? I should say this was sent this was sent in

354
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,480
 To me by a guy called Nick Hodder on Twitter. So thank you Nick

355
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,360
 For the moss fact people now send me moss content every week. It's great

356
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:27,440
 He and Dorothy his sister they visited Scotland in the year before 1803 and they saw this hut

357
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,600
 A wooden hut lined with fog, which is what they called moss at the time

358
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,800
 So they were very taken with it and when they got home to the Lake District, they built their own hut

359
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:44,340
 Lined it with moss covered it with henna on the outside and it was destroyed very sadly this important bit of English literary heritage

360
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,040
 By the later owner Thomas De Quincey

361
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,320
 Opium fan and fellow word celeb Thomas De Quincey

362
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,240
 And that anyway, so the good news is that in 2020 200 years after this absolute travesty

363
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,200
 They a new version has been built. Isn't it interesting that the word fog in Scotland means moss. Yes, it is weird

364
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
 It's weird that isn't it apparently

365
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,040
 It used to be a word for grass like long grass and then it became moss because it's like uncamped ground and they both come from an

366
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,480
 Old Scandinavian word meaning wind blown so you kind of get fog blowing over the hills

367
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,840
 And you would also get the wind blown grass, and it comes from an old Norwegian word fucker

368
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,400
 Seamist or light drizzle

369
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,920
 If you trace any etymology back far enough eventually you can find a swear word

370
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:55,520
 So it was worth in Dorothy they were tight, weren't they? They were super tight

371
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,000
 The brother and sister obviously but they didn't grow up together or they grew up in the first bit of their childhood together

372
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,720
 And then both of their parents died very sadly, and they were separated and

373
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,800
 William went to school and Dorothy was sent elsewhere and they reunited in adulthood and they seemed to have been full-on soulmates and

374
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,000
 There are even things like the night before words was wedding to Mary who was his childhood sweetheart

375
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,820
 Oh, I actually think was a friend of Dorothy's the night before his wedding

376
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
 You're not buying anything

377
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:32,060
 Sorry, so he married Mary he married Mary the night before his wedding

378
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:37,400
 Dorothy his sister wore the wedding ring in bed that he was going to give to Mary and then in the morning

379
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:43,340
 William and Dorothy did this ritual where words were sort of knelt beside her and took the ring off her finger and replaced it

380
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,860
 Onto her finger again, so it was a sort of ceremonial marriage to his sister and then went and married Mary

381
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,700
 Ourses and she didn't go to the wedding at Dorothy his sister. She just no no. She didn't attend

382
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,700
 It's it was a what do we know why was it a wasn't invited venue not big enough kind of thing

383
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,700
 You have to draw a line somewhere

384
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,580
 I

385
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:12,780
 Think she just was grieving terribly that this was happening and that this big, you know emotional change was happening in her life

386
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,700
 Who knows but she did have a diary which he read by the way

387
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,900
 Another aspect of their relationship, but when she heard the wedding had happened there were people coming up the driveway to inform her

388
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:29,180
 Oh, yes, they're married now. She wrote I could stand it no longer and threw myself on the bed neither hearing nor seeing anything

389
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,700
 She lived with them for the rest of

390
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:41,820
 Their lives she outlived William then she died then eventually Mary has so when William died with the two women living together

391
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,820
 Yeah, there's a sick

392
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,900
 Isn't it I can have the ring back now Maggie Smith in that

393
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:57,440
 Like remember death becomes her that movie with the golden horn kind of gradually disintegrating

394
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,140
 Yeah, there's like two people who live together, but they're immortal

395
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,300
 Yeah, they hate each other and they start trying to beat each other up because they're immortal

396
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,820
 They just all their bones break and their wrists get all floppy

397
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,820
 Wrists

398
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:21,340
 The subject of the diary and stuff though, but they sort of had joint journals didn't they and they collaborated and I did not know

399
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:29,380
 That the I wandered lonely as a cloud the inspirational walk for that was one that Dorothy and William took together

400
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,380
 Around Oldswater in 1802

401
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,980
 I mean how annoying would it be if you're on a walk with someone it's far as a poem and it's called

402
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,980
 I wandered lonely as a cloud

403
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,260
 It's my sister had stopped to tie her laces

404
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,820
 And it was her because she wrote wrote up the daffodils encounter

405
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,600
 Yes, they did see a load of daffodils on the walk and then

406
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:03,780
 And she was right she used some very evocative language about them they were you know bouncing around and flopping about

407
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
 You know the the waving

408
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,260
 Dancing host and all of that that was some of that language made its way into the poem. So, you know co-writer credit

409
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,220
 Well, I think they were co-writers of lyrical ballads basically there was this amazing kind of threesome

410
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,580
 They had essentially so it was Dorothy and William and Coleridge

411
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:26,500
 they all lived together in Dorset for a while and some summer set and they like you said Lucy they wrote in each other's notebooks and

412
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
 they sort of finish each other's sentences and

413
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,500
 Dorothy would write up this journal of how their walks and the flowers and the clouds and shit

414
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,380
 So I think it was a collaboration lyrical ballads, but

415
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,540
 Wordsworth wouldn't let anyone else have the copyright of it

416
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,980
 So I think even though it's got a bunch of Coleridge in there. It's got five or six Coleridge poems in there

417
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:52,060
 It's an ancient mariner including ancient mariner, which is one of you'd want it's the big one that's the biggie

418
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:57,540
 But like words was such a genius poet and Coleridge was all like words with you're the better one, you know

419
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,100
 I you're the genius you take this so it was

420
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,220
 Well, you first met the Coleridge said he was so excited that he leapt over a fence

421
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:13,700
 Wordsworth is sweet. It's like a real sort of fanboy. It really is. I mean and I

422
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:22,700
 Had only recently got to know anything about Wordsworth and I had thought always the daffodils and it's all very prissy and and

423
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,460
 What a life what a life he had

424
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,220
 illegitimate children

425
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,940
 Revolutionary France

426
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,100
 He he was in Revolutionary France

427
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,020
 father to child and then

428
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,500
 Buggered off and couldn't get back to the child for like ten years or something

429
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:46,220
 The revolution still have it sorry

430
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,140
 So aristocratic that it's a bit of a risk. Yeah, I can't even send any money

431
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,940
 He did send money by the way in case his family listening. Yeah, he did send money

432
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,660
 But yeah, he didn't invite them out of Revolutionary France and they were royalist

433
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:07,380
 So there was probably some tension for interesting which is very bizarre because he was a Revolutionary at least at the start

434
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:14,180
 Like all cool trendy people of the day. Obviously went to France thought these whole ideas of equality and fraternity and liberty

435
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,340
 I love it sounds great met loads of other fellow

436
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,420
 Revolutionary reformists and then got a bit put off by all the mass murder that happened

437
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,740
 And I think he was very good friends with someone who I think he saw get executed

438
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,740
 I think that will put you off sometimes

439
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,140
 Well, it's basically his gap year. He was 22 years old when he went with it

440
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,820
 I mean the thing about was that he lived a very long he lived 80 years at the time 1770 to 1850

441
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:47,420
 So there's a long old life and I think the imagination is of him was quite an old man because he was for you know a while

442
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,420
 When you define older starting well

443
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
 You know one thing Wordsworth couldn't do

444
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,020
 Ride a motorcycle

445
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,100
 Yep

446
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:07,940
 What could we do it is actually the daffodils. He would not have been able. Oh, I know to smell them

447
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,700
 Yeah, no sense of smell. It's a noz mc. I only covered me

448
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,940
 And he had no sense of taste as I think we can tell from the prelude

449
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,580
 Yeah, his nephew Christopher wrote his first ever biography in 1851

450
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:28,080
 So the year after he died and he wrote with regard to fragrance. Mr. Wordsworth spoke from the testimony of others

451
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:34,780
 He himself had no sense of smell. God, that's awful as someone who's so infatuated with the countryside and nature and all of that

452
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,660
 How travel although duffels don't really smell. Do they yeah, do they yeah, I don't like the smell of daffodils actually

453
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:48,100
 Big ol smell. Yeah, you're right. Sorry. There's more very strong of urine. So I've tried

454
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:55,100
 That's probably why he wrote that he wrote this amazing poem about daffodils and everyone else. Just like I think not the ones that smell

455
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,060
 You say you love to be very old

456
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,380
 But a lot of people would say should have died younger

457
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:11,260
 should have copped it earlier because he got quite crap later on in life according to I suppose most literary critics and

458
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,260
 Even he when he was asked to be poet laureate when he was 73

459
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,980
 Said look, I don't think I'm good enough. I haven't written anything decent for years

460
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,300
 And he never published anything as poet laureate. Did he?

461
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,140
 When he was asked to be poet laureate, he said no at the start

462
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,480
 But then Robert Peele said well the Queen really wants you to be poet laureate and you don't have to do any work

463
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,860
 So would you like reconsider him? Oh, right fine

464
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:42,460
 But he was really famous at that time wasn't he and there's a bit where his wife was writing about when he was 77 years old

465
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,020
 She's writing a letter to someone and in the letter

466
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,180
 She says I'm looking up and a group of young tourists are standing before the window

467
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,300
 So they're just people looking in his window and just going oh look there. He is

468
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,360
 And apparently he was reading the newspaper and every time he lifted his head from the newspaper all the tourists would bow to him. Oh

469
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,260
 Amazing, I think they would put you off your work. That's why newspaper

470
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,980
 But he also always wore shades as well when he got older seriously

471
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:21,660
 Yeah, because he had very inflamed eyes and so he wore dark glasses to stop the light from getting in

472
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,460
 I mean he couldn't smell and then couldn't see anything because of his shades

473
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,940
 Eventually would have been an entirely tactile based poet

474
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:36,400
 He got quite reactionary as well. He did the old classic. This is why better to die young

475
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
 He went from being cool

476
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,500
 Revolutionary reformist and thinking things like he was sort of pop

477
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,340
 He was essential to the founding of the national trust because he really believed in land being shared by everyone

478
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,980
 Everyone should have access and should get outside and experience nature the working classes should be you know

479
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,100
 It should be brought up to the Lake District and show now lovely the rivers are or whatever

480
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:03,660
 How come I went to let a national trust property the other day and it was four o'clock on a Sunday and he said sorry we're closed

481
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,660
 Yes, sorry about that. They're not saying true to the spirit of words with

482
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:16,300
 But well, he went off the idea anyway on his later life because he a became very pro the death penalty wrote poems in favor of the death penalty

483
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,540
 Few poems in favor of the death

484
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:28,600
 Yeah, death penalty found in a poet you don't you don't see them often in one person. What was it called? Do you know?

485
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,900
 Yes, it was cool

486
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,940
 Noose on the loose

487
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,860
 It was called sonnets upon the punishment of death

488
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,060
 Wow

489
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:46,020
 And he didn't like it actually it turned out when the trains got up and running and people did start getting the train up to

490
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,780
 The Lake District from sort of Manchester and stuff and disturbing his peace and quietude

491
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,380
 Turn into a miserable old goat

492
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,720
 really

493
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,980
 I suppose people standing outside your window. You'd be like, I don't want more of them coming up to stand and look at me

494
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,420
 I'll read the paper and fair enough. I think the death penalty for people who stare

495
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,900
 You drop a guillotine from your window

496
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,980
 Porta's Britain is gonna be

497
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:25,660
 There'll be quiz shows about me on television

498
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,060
 That's the main thing that I'm looking for

499
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:38,060
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James

500
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,580
 Okay

501
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,380
 My fact this week is that we know of five people who have died in the Queen Vic in EastEnders

502
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,660
 Although one of them was murdered

503
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,220
 120 years before the TV show began

504
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,100
 Wasn't it they were they were stabbed to death full staring at

505
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:02,540
 Lucy has been in EastEnders, right? I have

506
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,900
 Yes

507
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,060
 Didn't get murdered in the Queen Vic. So I

508
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:14,060
 Had a very small part as a woman called Rita who was the love interest of a character called Mitch

509
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,460
 So for our overseas listeners EastEnders is a beloved

510
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:23,700
 soap opera and if you get a part in EastEnders, it is absolutely mandatory for everyone, you know

511
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,860
 To then talk at you in a cockney accent

512
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:35,740
 Above the door Frank

513
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,620
 Yeah, but I didn't get to go inside the Queen Vic

514
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,620
 So maybe I was lucky given that it's obviously where all of your

515
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:47,240
 All of your scenes outdoors. No, I was in the laundrette, which is another

516
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,840
 Iconic location

517
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,700
 But I don't know if I've been killed off because they don't tell you obviously when you go into EastEnders

518
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,880
 they're not allowed to tell you anything about what's going on and

519
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,640
 Especially when I was in it, there was a big murder storyline which has now been resolved

520
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,920
 But they bumped up their murder count because there was a man called gray who was murdering loads of people

521
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,440
 And so I got the script and they were like well

522
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,520
 You can't tell anyone what happens because not my bit was like the little comic relief nonsense

523
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,560
 But this big storyline was being resolved and in fact when I got onto the set

524
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
 I was in the laundrette and this murderer

525
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:30,560
 Came in and it was his last day and I was like oh because he was the most hated man in Britain

526
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,720
 And he came in and it was his last day

527
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,880
 So he did this lovely speech about how wonderful it is and I've had such a wonderful time

528
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,040
 And it was like seeing I don't know Fred West or Ted Bundy

529
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
 Well, it's all been a marvellous luck

530
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:51,180
 Was that in the last four or five years then that was in the last year so because yeah, because I know

531
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,560
 EastEnders wasn't very murdery for a while. It was always the Coronation Street

532
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,360
 I think was the most murdery and then Holly Oaks

533
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,400
 Holly Oaks took over

534
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,760
 I've got friend who's in Holly Oaks and during COVID she had to do some kissing scenes

535
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:16,280
 But she couldn't do it because obviously you weren't allowed to go near and so her partner had to come on and be her

536
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,200
 Love interest, but you only kind of saw his shoulder the whole time. He's a singer in a band

537
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,960
 He's got long hair very skinny guy and her partner was this kind of hunky Asian bloke

538
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,840
 Amazing bit of camera work

539
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
 Needle-to-thread

540
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:46,880
 When I was filming it was like you couldn't that you had to stand and shout across the laundry at each other

541
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,960
 It's a noisy working environment

542
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,360
 Did you have to do the tennis ball on a stick thing what's that any standards during COVID?

543
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,240
 They had I watched a sort of little documentary on all the tricks they had to do

544
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,560
 And one of them was whenever you see anyone in a close-up scene with someone else in EastEnders during COVID

545
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,800
 They were talking to an empty space, but they would put a little tennis ball at the top of a pole

546
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,800
 Which was where you were supposed to look to see their eyes

547
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,280
 So if they're sobbing or lunging or chassing it's always engaging with the tennis ball

548
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,280
 So those two person shots where you see their face, but the other person's back of their head

549
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,040
 The reverse or they did it in plates. So they did it

550
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,640
 Um, they'd filmed one person a bit like how they did the parent trap

551
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,040
 Um

552
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,440
 I mean they could have used it to make someone their own twin for a while if you're going to do it that way

553
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,440
 Yeah, they could have done like is it eddie murphy in that movie not he prefers the two the clumps. Yeah. Yeah

554
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,440
 Or in kind hearts and coronets would probably be a better

555
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,480
 Everyone's film Mitchell film it should have had a completely film Mitchell episode EastEnders

556
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,960
 Where he played all the roles

557
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,080
 I haven't really explained the fact have I no sorry that I should very very quickly

558
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,240
 so, um, they

559
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:08,120
 Um, in night in February 2020 one character called Sharon Mitchell decided to tell a story

560
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,440
 Sorry, the tennis with which you said one of the seminal EastEnders characters names. Is that sorry

561
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,000
 She's one of the five biggest characters in it

562
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,840
 I'm so sorry Dean. I mean she's brilliant. Oh, is it? Yeah

563
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,280
 Well by my accent, you could probably tell I'm a coronation street guy

564
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:29,960
 Uh, anyway, so Sharon Mitchell talked about mr. And mrs. Bagstock who were the original landlord and landlady of the queen Vic

565
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:37,960
 And apparently back in the 1860s when the fictional queen Vic was first built

566
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,400
 And these this landlord killed his landlady by drowning her in the bath

567
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,600
 Uh, and maybe that's why they've had so much bad luck in Elba Square

568
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,480
 It's a haunted pub effectively

569
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,320
 Yeah, I tried to see if there was a such person as mr. Bagstock

570
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,400
 Uh in London, but bag stock doesn't appear to even be a name

571
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,280
 It's in Dombie and Sons, but I think it's just a made-up Dickens name. Oh, that's quite it. That's a nice literary pedigree though

572
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,080
 For this random bit of queen Vic trivia. That's great. Um, so one thing

573
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:17,400
 That the the EastEnders hasn't come on with William Wordsworth. Oh, yeah, they can't smell. They can't

574
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,560
 Nobody can smell. Yeah, it's a death penalty. Yeah

575
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,920
 Um, they daffodils

576
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,800
 Oh, so there are some daffodils in albert square

577
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,280
 But wordsworth wouldn't have been able to smell these ones for a very good reason, which is that they're fake

578
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,520
 Oh, and the reason that they're fake daffodils. I'm probably

579
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:43,640
 Good filming reasons for that, but also they film is it about six weeks in advance you film the episodes about six weeks later

580
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,120
 So they they make it look like springs

581
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,520
 Even though it's still winter

582
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,760
 Right, so that's that's their way of doing it. It's basically a time portal and then at the other end of the year

583
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,920
 They obviously they have to shave the trees

584
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:02,440
 No, that's I'm joking. That's that's not real because I was thinking the very first lines of the first episode of EastEnders

585
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,120
 Was dirty dan walks in and he goes sticks in here. Oh, yeah

586
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,120
 So it might have been sticks of weed here from all those daffodils

587
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,440
 Definitely real

588
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,560
 Dirty daff

589
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:19,480
 Well, didn't he get killed by someone was holding a bunch of flowers the first time he wasn't actually dead

590
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:25,640
 But someone was holding a bunch of daffodils and they shot them shot him through it. So come on. I love it. It's all tying together

591
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,800
 My god

592
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
 David Lynch isn't it?

593
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,040
 We've broken EastEnders wide open

594
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:38,360
 Um, so the person behind EastEnders was Julia, one called Julia Smith who when she was

595
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,960
 Advertising for jobs said only EastEnders need apply

596
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,560
 So it was all real people from the East End of London at first who were on it

597
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,920
 And they weren't actually calling EastEnders at the time. They were calling it East 8

598
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,440
 And she wrote that they called it East 8 referred to it as East 8 when they were working on the show before it came out

599
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,160
 And then she realized a bunch of her friends were saying what's this estate program? You've got when it's not coming out

600
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,120
 And it's just is the word estate, but it could have been called other working titles square dance

601
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,240
 Yeah around the houses, which isn't another show

602
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,840
 That's quite a good title round the houses. It sounds like a much more huggable. I think there are fewer murders in round

603
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,200
 Yeah, that's the level 76.com. Is that that's that's the terry and june style

604
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,240
 Oh, Reg Cox is fine. He was just pretending to prank

605
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,480
 um

606
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,480
 On the subject of the script security

607
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,960
 Because you know it's set in wallford, right? So this was the fictional play save created

608
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,480
 so when my husband was in EastEnders a few years ago and the

609
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,760
 Uh, it was christmas day episode which again, you know, they don't want anything to get out about the christmas episode

610
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,760
 So they have this ridiculous procedure where they send you a script

611
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:51,480
 But they won't send the password to unlock that script to the same email that they've sent the script to because obviously that might get hacked

612
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,720
 So what they do then is they

613
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:00,200
 Phone you and then they give you another special code which sort of unlocks something else. Anyway, it's it's like a seven stage

614
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
 You'd be easier to get the nuclear code

615
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,360
 To get into an EastEnders script, but what really made me laugh when my husband did it was

616
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,920
 They went through all of this and he was he had to be by the phone at a certain time take the phone call

617
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,160
 And he answered the phone went uh, uh, and then started typing it in and the password was wallford

618
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,640
 And then I did it recently and they have changed it because

619
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,280
 I tell everyone I knew about that but the a was a four, wasn't it? So no

620
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:33,000
 Yeah, impenetrable levels. Wow. Walford probably named after walford road, which is in dolston

621
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,720
 because one of the other co-creator with

622
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,560
 julia smith julia smith was tony holland

623
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:45,960
 And he lived in dolston or nearby and he probably saw walford road and gave it that name

624
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,280
 He based albert square on a place called facet square in dolston

625
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,720
 Which I went to yesterday had a cycle round

626
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,200
 Very nice and the nearest pub to facet square is called the victoria

627
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,480
 Which i'm fairly certain must be where he got the idea for the queen vic name at least

628
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:10,360
 Because it's got it it's licensed in 1848. So it's a very very old pub. Anyway, I went there last night and

629
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,640
 You discovered you were your own father

630
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:21,960
 The whole place burned down. I was so hoping for that kind of thing. But basically it's the

631
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,840
 Abstriest place you can possibly imagine instead of like light fixtures

632
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,280
 It has upside down plant pots with trees coming out of it and it sells four different types of kombucha

633
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,840
 But it's

634
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:42,520
 Kind of IPA and and read my book doc coffee wouldn't have approved of all of this would I mean everybody does complain

635
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,160
 About the fact that east enders is now set in an area of london where nobody who's in it could afford to live

636
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,560
 You know, it would all be merchant bankers and hedge fund managers or podcasters

637
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:58,280
 Your podcast is doing well. Just me not most podcasters, but yeah the um, but off-com

638
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:04,360
 I was reading all the off-com complaints about east enders and uh one complaint was people saying that

639
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,320
 Uh, people spend too much time in the cafe

640
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:15,560
 Someone had calculated how much the characters would spend if they were buying the amount of drinks and snacks because of course

641
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,560
 They're always eating and drinking. Yeah, but have you seen how many times Peggy Mitchell said it's on the ass

642
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,360
 It's on the ass. That's true. That's how it would have gone under. Yes. Very good. They're almost off re-drinking

643
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,840
 I was reading some of the other complaints actually

644
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:33,160
 And there was one saying that people were throwing the cigarette butts on the ground and if they did that

645
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,720
 Why did they not get a fixed penalty notice for doing it?

646
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:42,200
 You can be yeah, you can be having an affair with your brother's sister's

647
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,160
 cat

648
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,160
 But the unrealistic thing is

649
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,000
 Um, something else realistic is um, Barbara Windsor's life

650
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,440
 It was thought that her life was quite true to the what seems like a very unrealistic east ender's life

651
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,920
 So she was she was quite

652
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,560
 In the gang world really. Yeah 70s 80s

653
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,400
 She went out with Ronnie Cray. Hold on. Who was the not mad one? She went out with Reggie Cray

654
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,800
 Ronnie was the really mad one, wasn't he? I mean, it's like it's like the williams sisters. They're both good at tennis

655
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,600
 She went out with the equivalent of venus williams, I suppose in Cray brothers

656
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,560
 And she was married

657
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:32,120
 She was married to another guy called Ronnie knight who was another gangster really the venus williams of the underworld

658
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,600
 That's amazing. He'd have been so flattered. I think both be flattered by that

659
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,080
 No, ladies and gentlemen, please give your applause to the Ronnie Cray

660
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,880
 Oh

661
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:53,400
 So she married a Ronnie Ronnie knight

662
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,240
 Who was another kind of gangster and Ronnie knight's brother?

663
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,800
 I ended up reading his Wikipedia page basically his brother

664
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,200
 His brother's killer and the man who killed his brother's killer were all murdered

665
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:10,360
 That's a trait. That's a trailer for murders. Sorry. So sorry. So Ronnie knight Barbara Windsor's husband was

666
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,880
 His brother was murdered

667
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,120
 Okay, and then his brother's killer was murdered

668
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,240
 And then his brother's killer's killer was murdered

669
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:25,080
 It's an endless trail of murder and I'm still picturing it in the world of tennis and it's becoming

670
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:30,520
 I mean in the word of gangsters, it's not as implausible. This is we're still in the group stages

671
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,320
 And did de Barbara Windsor kill all of those?

672
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,560
 Turns out yes

673
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:44,040
 Well, actually her husband Ronnie knight probably did kill his brother's killer because he admitted to it in his autobiography later

674
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:49,400
 But he'd already been tried for it and exonerated. So under double jeopardy. They couldn't get him in your face

675
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,160
 There is a thing about so Lucy you said about

676
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,120
 The murder stats way higher in east enders

677
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:03,880
 I think so in east enders, it's about a hundred. You're about a hundred times as likely to be murdered in east enders as you are in Britain

678
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,160
 Um, but there is good. There's a concomitant bit of good news. Which is that

679
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:15,080
 Um residents of wallford are much more romantically faithful than real people. Oh really? Yeah

680
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,960
 Both of these things are only good news and bad news if you live in the world of east enders

681
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:25,080
 They are not in the real world bad news for all of us except me. So I just need to be in full time

682
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,320
 So on the show, it's a

683
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,240
 Tiny percentage two percent of female and 1.7 percent of male characters having a fair each year

684
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,600
 Is that right? I always thought they were all having affairs in east enders. Me too. I would have thought

685
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,880
 So this is a study from 2003. So maybe they've sexed it up since then

686
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:45,160
 But that's way lower than the stats from 2003 for men and women in the uk having affairs

687
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,440
 Also, this was the other finding the men of albert square

688
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,400
 Also less likely to visit a prostitute

689
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:58,760
 That's good. Just 0.18 percent of them are knocking on that door. Good on them. Yeah

690
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,600
 Well, again, you see I should I should be suggesting this to the storyline as I should say I could I mean become a sex worker

691
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,840
 Make the show more realistic. I could be the man trap of wallford

692
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:17,640
 Okay, that's it that's all of our facts

693
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,080
