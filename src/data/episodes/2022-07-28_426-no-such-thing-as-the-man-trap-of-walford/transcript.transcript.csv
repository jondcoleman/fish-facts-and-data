00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish"
00:00:03,00:00:06,Daniel Shriver is not here this week

00:00:14,00:00:17,"And if you listen to the rest of this episode, you'll be able to work that out"
00:00:17,00:00:21,"But anyway, the main thing is that Dan is not here this week"
00:00:21,00:00:28,And so we needed someone to replace him and who have we got we have the most incredible guest
00:00:28,00:00:30,It is comedian Lucy Potter

00:01:06,00:01:12,"Anyway, I'm certain you're gonna really really enjoy this podcast. We had such a good time making it and"
00:01:12,00:01:16,What else is there to say apart from on with the podcast?
00:01:16,00:01:39,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the qi offices in Covent Garden
00:01:39,00:01:45,"My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, and I'm joined this week by James Harkin Anna Tajinsky and special guest"
00:01:45,00:01:48,It's Lucy Porter and once again
00:01:48,00:01:54,We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here
00:01:54,00:02:01,We go starting with Lucy my fact is that if you were a baby born in Korea in
00:02:01,00:02:07,December 2020 you could be one two or three years old
00:02:10,00:02:17,Just take your pick. Yeah multiple choice just be winner. I am very keen on being able to manipulate your age
00:02:17,00:02:19,There's so many people in show business are
00:02:19,00:02:25,"And but I had never heard of this until I was watching Ultimate Beast Master, which is my favorite of the"
00:02:25,00:02:27,competitive obstacle course shows
00:02:27,00:02:35,It is it's like it's
00:02:35,00:02:39,"yes, it's a big beast and there was a Korean contestant on that and"
00:02:39,00:02:45,Talking about his kid and he went all these two in Korean age and I was like what what is Korean age?
00:02:45,00:02:51,And it turns out that in Korea and other parts of East Asia. There is a different numbering system for age
00:02:51,00:02:57,"So the Korean system, which is when you're born you're a year old"
00:02:57,00:03:00,Right the minute you come out. That's your first birthday
00:03:00,00:03:04,Which makes sense because your first birthday is your first birthday. So
00:03:04,00:03:06,So then you
00:03:06,00:03:15,Gain another year every New Year's Day. So effectively what that means is everybody gets a year older on the same day
00:03:15,00:03:19,Which I I like the idea of that because I think birthdays are
00:03:19,00:03:26,Depressing when you wake up and you're maybe a little bit hungover certainly a bit tired after your birthday and you're another year
00:03:26,00:03:32,"Older whereas in Korea everybody celebrates on the same, but then it'd be hard to get a table in TGI Fridays"
00:03:32,00:03:36,"Wouldn't it if everyone had a birthday the same day? Yeah, the soul branch"
00:03:36,00:03:43,"Also, you've literally just had to buy everyone Christmas presents and then you have to buy an entire new raft of birthday presents"
00:03:43,00:03:47,"Oh, yeah, well you'd get two for one wouldn't you? I mean it would be you can shoot it like that"
00:03:47,00:03:47,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
00:03:47,00:03:52,So there's one system where you get a new birthday a new year every New Year's Day
00:03:52,00:03:58,There's another system which is the New Year birthday where you are no years old when you're born
00:03:58,00:04:02,You have your first birthday after a year and then you do the thing where you add a year on New Year's Day
00:04:02,00:04:09,"Or of course, they also use the international system where you just turn one year older on your actual birthday"
00:04:09,00:04:12,So that means you can have three different
00:04:12,00:04:15,or ages three different ages
00:04:15,00:04:20,Did anyone else used to think it was so unfair that people born in a leap year like my granny?
00:04:20,00:04:25,I remember she was born on 29th Feb and I thought that meant she would live four times longer than the rest
00:04:25,00:04:29,"Because we'd always say, you know, oh Gamma's only 15 years old"
00:04:29,00:04:37,And so interesting then I used to get so annoyed and actually she has not lived it turns out four times longer than everyone
00:04:37,00:04:39,That is a shame. That is a real shame
00:04:39,00:04:43,But there was a study wasn't there of three four and five year old children
00:04:43,00:04:48,asking them about you know changing your age and birthdays and stuff and
00:04:48,00:04:54,Quite a large percentage of them thought that when you had a birthday that was when you got older
00:04:54,00:04:59,"And so if you had like three birthday parties in a week, you would gain three years straight away"
00:04:59,00:05:01,terrifying
00:05:01,00:05:03,Four-year-olds
00:05:03,00:05:09,Well the because the Queen to birthday thing I always was when I was a kid
00:05:09,00:05:14,I was very jealous as you would be and like why do you get two birthdays?
00:05:14,00:05:19,"Because my birthday is the end of January, which is a rubbish time. You should get to choose when your birthday is, shouldn't you?"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"Well, the reason apparently the Queen has her"
00:05:22,00:05:28,Birthday the two birthdays was it was George the second who had a November birthday and he was like well the weather's always miserable
00:05:28,00:05:30,So I'll move it to
00:05:30,00:05:38,"June or whenever really yeah, but the she actually has loads because she has the official birthday the actual birthday and then"
00:05:38,00:05:44,"New Zealand Canada Australia. Yeah, we've done it. We mentioned once James worked out that she's actually 79,000 years old"
00:05:47,00:05:49,She was definitely in the high hundreds
00:05:49,00:05:51,669
00:05:51,00:05:56,Was it I think this is what's happened to me is that I've actually I've aged in dog years somehow
00:05:56,00:05:59,We all consider you royalty
00:05:59,00:06:01,I think that might have come across
00:06:01,00:06:06,The grand old dame of it. I've actually had five hundred and eighty six birthdays
00:06:06,00:06:12,In Korea they even find this confusing don't they to the extent that they are apparently changing it
00:06:12,00:06:17,Although I don't know if they they will the president elect who I think might be president by the time this podcast goes out
00:06:18,00:06:19,President Yoon
00:06:19,00:06:26,He says he plans to abolish it and seventy one percent of Koreans are in favor of abolishing it because they're confused
00:06:26,00:06:29,And also when you have things like the retirement age sometimes
00:06:29,00:06:34,There was a thing with COVID wasn't there where you were getting your injections at a certain age
00:06:34,00:06:40,But they didn't say whether it was your Korean age or your international age or whatever and so people were kind of gaming the system
00:06:40,00:06:47,"Well, I suppose as well for things like if you're you know on the cusp of being able to drink booze or yeah"
00:06:47,00:06:52,I remember when I was young and I used to I didn't like to lie because I'm very Catholic
00:06:52,00:06:59,guilty so if I was asked for my age when I was trying to buy a booze illegally I would say oh well I am in
00:06:59,00:07:02,My 18th year
00:07:02,00:07:09,"No, of course not because I've sounded like I was a Victorian"
00:07:09,00:07:14,I am in my 18th year you're either a time javeler or you're in your hundred and fifty
00:07:16,00:07:19,"Well, the other thing for Koreans that is difficult is that you?"
00:07:19,00:07:23,Greet people and talk to people differently depending on their age
00:07:23,00:07:27,So you do actually need to know how old people are because that will affect how you talk to them
00:07:27,00:07:32,So if you're saying happy birthday to someone if they're your age or younger
00:07:32,00:07:39,You say sang ill took her hey if they're a little bit older than you you say sang ill took her hey you and
00:07:39,00:07:43,If they're much older than you you say sang ill do okay
00:07:44,00:07:47,"Yeah, yeah, I was so confident at the beginning"
00:07:47,00:07:50,Do you know that's some witch doctor?
00:07:50,00:07:59,"I apologize to our Korean listeners, but that itself seems absolutely"
00:07:59,00:08:05,ripe with the potential for offense because if you're someone's older than you
00:08:05,00:08:09,Well here you just get some of the very insulting card and that's how you do
00:08:10,00:08:15,Horrible card that you see in the shops racks and racks of these cards saying you old bastard
00:08:15,00:08:22,I always just go for one with a dog on the front or something
00:08:22,00:08:30,"Well, it is women overwhelmingly buy greetings cards, don't they but they buy them for men to give so apparently"
00:08:30,00:08:35,It's like I'm gonna make up a statistic because why not like
00:08:37,00:08:45,80% of greetings cards are bought by women so it's women buying really you know cards for their husbands to give to people
00:08:45,00:08:49,They really don't like but not back to them to give to other other members of the family or friends or whatever
00:08:49,00:08:54,Go to a shop if you were buying something for your husband to buy for you
00:09:01,00:09:08,We may have mentioned this before that women buy almost all the candles made on the planet 98% of candles made in the world by women
00:09:08,00:09:16,And is it is it truly so that women buy horrible candles for their husbands to give people you know smelling of burning tires and stuff like that
00:09:16,00:09:20,The last candle I bought smelled like Jeremy Clarkson's balls
00:09:20,00:09:27,"Yeah, I was like I recognize that smell"
00:09:27,00:09:29,Yeah
00:09:29,00:09:33,"Yeah, a whole anecdote"
00:09:33,00:09:41,United it's a natural partnership
00:09:41,00:09:49,"Anyway, South Korea yeah in 2017 they became the highest life expectancy in the world"
00:09:49,00:09:53,So a girl who was gonna be born let's say in
00:09:54,00:09:58,2025 or 2030 would expect to live to about 91 we think
00:09:58,00:10:01,Men probably around 84
00:10:01,00:10:07,Now the reason I saw in an article that they're living so long possibly kimchi is very good for you
00:10:07,00:10:12,Another thing they said hypochondria
00:10:12,00:10:19,Apparently only 35% of Koreans believe they're in good health and so they all go to the doctors a lot
00:10:19,00:10:21,And apparently that's one reason why they live a long time
00:10:21,00:10:25,But I also thought that obviously we're adding two years to their age
00:10:25,00:10:29,"Yeah, I mean we have no idea how old these people are. Let's be honest. They are very much"
00:10:29,00:10:35,"You know, do you remember we did a story a couple of years ago Doris Day found out that she was two years older than she thought"
00:10:35,00:10:38,she was turning 93 and
00:10:38,00:10:40,So to sort of celebrate her birthday
00:10:40,00:10:45,Ohio's office of vital statistics looked into her life and stuff and uncovered some cool stuff about her
00:10:45,00:10:49,One of the things they uncovered was that she wasn't born in 1924 if she thought she was born in 1922
00:10:50,00:10:54,"So she was 95 in Busan as well, isn't it? She was Korean"
00:10:54,00:11:03,You can't tell how so Doris Day couldn't have told how old she was by going in a scanner or something because I was reading about this
00:11:03,00:11:06,It's so hard to tell how old people are based on their bones
00:11:06,00:11:12,So there are lots of arenas where it's tested like dental scans and the other thing is wrist bones
00:11:12,00:11:18,"Apparently, this is a way of measuring but it's not very accurate because when do you think you get your adult wrists?"
00:11:19,00:11:23,I thought that I had the I think men get them about 13 or 14
00:11:23,00:11:28,Just in time. I genuinely thought I had the wrist now that I was born with
00:11:28,00:11:31,"James, you're not Popeye"
00:11:31,00:11:37,"Because James got quite powerful wrists, you know, do I yeah, but what I thought so you're born with a wrist"
00:11:37,00:11:40,"I mean, you know, I know babies are floppy"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"Basically wrists can reach maturity, which is where the bones are fused in a particular way"
00:11:50,00:11:56,"As young as the age of 15, but on average it's 17.6 years that you know"
00:11:56,00:11:59,That's the average age that rests mature
00:11:59,00:12:04,But it completely varies and most children do have adult wrists as it were before they are actually adults
00:12:04,00:12:09,So that is a bad way of telling what so I didn't actually realize our wrist fused differently as adults to as children
00:12:09,00:12:14,I assume they were just the same as the rest of us and gradually grew but they transform into grown-up wrists
00:12:15,00:12:19,"Yeah, they do they develop they develop more serious wristwatches. That's the way"
00:12:19,00:12:23,The old Mickey Mouse watch falls off
00:12:23,00:12:30,"Timex or something grows in its place. Yeah, just like bones music like your collarbone for example that that's the last bit"
00:12:30,00:12:32,Of your body. Yeah
00:12:32,00:12:38,"Interesting, but then also even if you can tell that they're probably over 15 or whatever you can't tell anything beyond that by the wrist"
00:12:38,00:12:45,Can you so everyone's either under 15 to 17 or over 15 to 17 if that's how you're aging people and also you've had to cut off their hand
00:12:45,00:12:48,This is gonna make getting into nightclubs very
00:12:48,00:12:57,Like with fish you can tell with their ears right they have little otoliths in their ears
00:12:57,00:13:01,"Yeah, and they get an extra, you know, it's like a tree ring"
00:13:01,00:13:05,"Yeah, and you can count the rings, but we don't have that. It's what you're saying. That's what I'm saying"
00:13:05,00:13:11,You know happy birthday. Yeah song because I don't know if we mentioned that it was illegal for it
00:13:11,00:13:14,It wasn't illegal for ages. It was copyrighted for ages. Sorry
00:13:15,00:13:19,"Yeah, but people in yeah, people in TV shows and films would sing. Yeah, exactly"
00:13:19,00:13:23,"Exactly, we're just sort of how it gets on anyway"
00:13:23,00:13:28,It was even illegal to sing it in a made-up language. I like it so much
00:13:28,00:13:34,There was an episode of Star Trek where they were going to sing a happy birthday in Klingon and they checked it out
00:13:34,00:13:38,"They thought no, we can't do that. Wow thousands of dollars to, you know, water triple who had it"
00:13:38,00:13:41,So they replaced it with for he's a jolly good fellow in Klingon. I
00:13:43,00:13:50,Read something the other day on Twitter and I think it was Jason Haseley who tweeted this but it could have been Joel Morris
00:13:50,00:13:56,"But they basically said that when you sing happy birthday, the first note you sing is the lowest note you will ever sing"
00:13:56,00:14:00,"Yes, and that's really useful to know because when you get to the end"
00:14:00,00:14:05,It's too high and you know if you started too high then you can't reach that last note
00:14:05,00:14:07,But if you know that the first one is the lowest you can start really low
00:14:07,00:14:12,And by the time you get to the end you'll be able to sing it properly
00:14:12,00:14:16,I did anyone else genuinely think that James Wendt is the lowest note you'll ever sing
00:14:16,00:14:19,The only way you can reach those depths
00:14:19,00:14:22,That is the note that makes people poo themselves
00:14:22,00:14:27,Scientifically proven it makes for very awkward birthday parties
00:14:27,00:14:36,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna"
00:14:36,00:14:41,My fact this week is that in 2018 a new quiz show was launched on
00:14:41,00:14:45,Chinese prime-time TV where all the answers were about Xi Jinping
00:14:45,00:14:52,Feels like an easy quiz now the quick fire round
00:14:52,00:14:57,"Or if you're doing blockbusters, which acts"
00:14:57,00:15:03,"Like well, he's lived a long time now, I think he's done quite a lot"
00:15:03,00:15:06,So there's a lot of stuff to memorize there
00:15:06,00:15:12,"But yeah, it managed to last for five full episodes of Xi Jinping based trivia. It wasn't it wasn't canceled"
00:15:12,00:15:16,"Well, it can't have been cancelled because the ratings were like, I don't think yeah"
00:15:16,00:15:18,"Yeah, it wasn't counts that are the questions like which"
00:15:18,00:15:22,Premier from China looks nothing like Winnie the Pooh
00:15:22,00:15:26,It was quite similar to that
00:15:26,00:15:28,Some people would say it was embarrassingly brazen
00:15:28,00:15:35,"But so this was on Hunan TV, which is China's most popular TV channel for young people and it's called studying Xi in the new era"
00:15:35,00:15:37,and it was about
00:15:37,00:15:45,understanding his thought and memorizing bits of his speeches and knowing interesting facts about his life and
00:15:45,00:15:50,"The questions were things like and they all got it right. So I think well, you would wouldn't you?"
00:15:50,00:15:56,You would the ones who got it wrong. We now move to sudden death. I
00:15:56,00:16:02,Watched a quiz over Christmas and it was a Harry Potter quiz
00:16:02,00:16:08,And it was loads of teams and they were all massive Harry Potter nerds. No one got a single question wrong in the whole show
00:16:08,00:16:12,One person would get one question wrong and then that would be the end because no one else would get anything wrong
00:16:12,00:16:19,"Was that close to by Helen Mirren? I don't recall. Yeah, maybe there wasn't sort of Harry Potter tournament"
00:16:19,00:16:23,Because you ask young people about anything they're interested in and they know everything about it
00:16:23,00:16:26,That's the beauty of being young and having a memory isn't it?
00:16:28,00:16:34,It's absolutely pointless. It reminds me of when Andy Osho was on mastermind the brilliant comedian Andy Osho
00:16:34,00:16:37,And her specialist subject was John Humphries who was the host at the time
00:16:37,00:16:44,"Yeah, get in his head. Is there an advantage to getting in his head? I guess so well"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"I mean, it's a very strange place to be his head"
00:16:46,00:16:51,"I mean, yeah, I did mastermind when he was the host and we had to you know"
00:16:51,00:16:54,You do like the banter and it was a very strange chat
00:16:57,00:17:02,"I mean, we'll come back to that can I ask quickly about the Andy Osho thing when he phrased the questions"
00:17:02,00:17:07,Did he ask about himself in the third person or did he say what a what a color of my pants?
00:17:07,00:17:22,"Anyway, so Xi Jinping is I'm sure he's very embarrassed about this program and just can't leave"
00:17:22,00:17:28,"They made it about him and it feels dreadful that they've had to do it, but it does feel a bit like a propaganda thing"
00:17:28,00:17:32,But they there's some interesting facts. I learned about him from it
00:17:32,00:17:37,So he knows the whole of Faustus off by heart because one of the questions was
00:17:37,00:17:41,At the age of 15 president Xi was sent to become a farmer during that period
00:17:41,00:17:45,He walked 15 kilometers to borrow a book. What was the name of the book?
00:17:45,00:17:48,Faustus very strong
00:17:50,00:17:57,"Anna I was reading this this this she quiz was a follow-up to another ideology-based quiz, which was called marks got it right"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"Mmm, which had a very ambiguous take actually on Marks's legacy"
00:18:00,00:18:04,We could have called it like top marks or something
00:18:04,00:18:12,"The New York Times reported that contestants have nothing to lose but their chains, which is a very good nice. That's funny"
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Yeah, and the winner is everyone"
00:18:14,00:18:18,Forever
00:18:18,00:18:24,Just in terms of Chinese high-stakes quizzing
00:18:24,00:18:29,The exam to be in the civil service in Imperial China
00:18:29,00:18:33,Was even more gruelling than this TV game show
00:18:33,00:18:38,So you would take bedding a chamber pot in can brushes and spend three days and two nights
00:18:38,00:18:41,In an exam center
00:18:41,00:18:48,And if people died the walls were so high that apparently nothing could get in so that there was no possibility of cheating
00:18:49,00:18:55,"And also you'd write your exam paper, and then it would be transcribed by someone else so that there was no chance of somebody"
00:18:55,00:19:02,Seeing your handwriting and recognizing it and if you died you were just bundled up in a sack and tossed over the fence
00:19:02,00:19:05,"I tossed over the wall. Um, is that right? Thanks for playing"
00:19:05,00:19:14,School there was always a rumor wasn't there in your GCSE's or whatever that if someone died in your year then everyone would get an A
00:19:14,00:19:16,Do you remember that? No
00:19:17,00:19:19,They just told us if someone died they get tossed over the wall
00:19:19,00:19:23,"Yeah, that's more of an incentive isn't it really?"
00:19:23,00:19:32,"Yeah, it was amazing that thing wasn't it it changed throughout their centuries because these exams they took place throughout all the different"
00:19:32,00:19:34,Chinese eras but at one stage
00:19:34,00:19:40,They came up with them an exam to do the exam and then when you pass that exam
00:19:40,00:19:45,You would get to do the main exam and then everyone who did that main exam then would do one final exam
00:19:45,00:19:52,So you had to do two exams to get to the final exam the emperor themselves would apparently supervise the final exam
00:19:52,00:19:57,"Invigilate yeah, again, that's very scary hearing the clack clack clack"
00:19:57,00:20:01,And no gum
00:20:01,00:20:05,Apparently the first exam that you would do which was the regional one
00:20:05,00:20:11,It was so big and so important that all of your family and friends would kind of sit outside because they want to know how you did and
00:20:11,00:20:15,They would set up like stalls and food stalls and stuff so that they'd be able to see
00:20:15,00:20:28,On communism and quizzing in 1975 on University Challenge
00:20:28,00:20:32,You'll probably know this Lucy and James about the Manchester University
00:20:32,00:20:36,Team which was David Aronovich. I didn't know he did this journalist now
00:20:36,00:20:41,"Of course very famous journalist, but he was a socialist student back then and he ended with a team"
00:20:41,00:20:48,It seems to be some kind of accident because they entered intending to take down University Challenge from the inside for its elitism
00:20:48,00:20:56,"Okay, and answered sort of Trotsky Engels marks until they got told off for a question. Okay. Well, yes until"
00:20:56,00:21:00,Bambagasco and got really pissed off which of the Kardashians
00:21:01,00:21:07,"Yeah, no footage exists of it sadly. No, but yeah, it's a legendary University Challenge"
00:21:07,00:21:12,And that it's interesting that no footage exists because it's really the fallibility of memory because
00:21:12,00:21:18,"According to David Aronovich, he just said nonsense answers. He remembers it as like he answered like yellow brick road or fluffy hat"
00:21:18,00:21:29,I did what the the sort of so-called celebrity one which is much easier
00:21:29,00:21:33,"Yeah, everyone's like, yeah, you want to do the actual University Challenge"
00:21:33,00:21:37,"But yeah, no, I and I went to pieces completely me and Rob Rinder judge Rinder"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"They're looking like oh, what are we doing?"
00:21:40,00:21:44,But Lucy was yours was a protest about the elitism of University Challenge
00:21:44,00:21:50,It absolutely was yet one woman protest stage through the medium of looking a bit confused
00:21:50,00:21:53,He was testing about his wig
00:21:56,00:22:03,"Well, the no footage exists of that but there is footage readily available of the contestant on"
00:22:03,00:22:09,Family Fortunes the UK version of family feud who answered the same thing
00:22:09,00:22:15,"To every single question in the final round. So I'll ask you the question. Yeah, let's see"
00:22:15,00:22:18,So name a food that you would stuff
00:22:18,00:22:21,Turkey pepper
00:22:21,00:22:26,Stuff peps looking turkey was my first thought well turkey is your first thought and that was exactly what
00:22:26,00:22:30,He answered every single question. Oh every question. Yeah
00:22:30,00:22:36,Was the stuff one the first answer and then he's got stuck on turkey. No was the next one name a country
00:22:36,00:22:38,Which?
00:22:38,00:22:42,What do you get if you remove the letter n from the word turn key
00:22:42,00:22:51,"Yeah, well what they think happened was, you know, they have a soundproof booth"
00:22:51,00:22:55,And obviously something had gone wrong with the soundproof booth and he had heard
00:22:55,00:23:00,The guy who went first answered the question name a foodie stuff with chicken
00:23:00,00:23:02,He's sort of lost his mind
00:23:02,00:23:06,And he came out and the first question was name something you'd take to the beach
00:23:06,00:23:15,Maybe he did maybe him and that turkey had great days down Brighton Beach
00:23:15,00:23:18,There's a Chinese quiz show at the moment
00:23:18,00:23:24,Where one of the most recent episodes one of the people in there had to spell the word toad
00:23:25,00:23:29,and not only did they get it wrong there were three judges and
00:23:29,00:23:34,"They couldn't decide whether or not they'd spelled it, right? Well, hey, there are two ways of spelling toad"
00:23:34,00:23:39,Toad the line toad the car or
00:23:39,00:23:47,"Yeah, this is obviously the Chinese characters dictation competition. Oh, sorry. We were in China"
00:23:47,00:23:54,"Yeah, we're in China and the thing is that the word toad for the animal has 46 different individual strokes"
00:23:54,00:23:59,"And so if you want to do it perfectly, it's actually really really difficult a lot of people make mistakes"
00:23:59,00:24:05,And it was a 14-year-old contestant called you shwang and she missed out one little dot
00:24:05,00:24:11,In the word toad and two of the three judges noticed and then she got kicked out
00:24:11,00:24:16,So it wasn't done. It's not done verbally. Is it where you have to say a straight line and then a curve
00:24:21,00:24:24,So you write it down and then the cameras can see it
00:24:24,00:24:31,But her teammates are there as well and the camera sort of pans to them and they're all kind of drawing it with their finger in
00:24:31,00:24:33,"The sky, do you know I mean"
00:24:33,00:24:44,"That's a really crazy format. Yes, spelling bee in China. Yeah, I didn't write how far bees go back generally and they"
00:24:44,00:24:49,"I mean they evolved obviously from insects. No, not those kind of bees"
00:24:49,00:24:53,Bees go back over two centuries. I think in America
00:24:53,00:24:56,I was looking up the earliest mentions of them in the late 18th century
00:24:56,00:24:58,There are references to things like quilting bees
00:24:58,00:25:04,That seems to be the earliest kind and bee just meant a gathering of people who were doing something that was kind of useful
00:25:04,00:25:09,Often for a single person so a quilting bee would be like this person needs a quilt
00:25:09,00:25:12,Takes months to make a quilt. They're cold now if we get together
00:25:12,00:25:15,We'll get it done in one day and you'd have a quilting bee
00:25:16,00:25:19,But the thing I like best is raising bees
00:25:19,00:25:24,They were for when a new settler came to town and wanted to live there
00:25:24,00:25:27,And I guess it was in America where lots of new people were turning up a lot
00:25:27,00:25:30,Then the raising bee was when the village would get together and build them a house
00:25:30,00:25:33,"Rock up and be like, do you mind having a raising bee?"
00:25:33,00:25:40,The barn thing because the film witness with Harrison Ford where he's he's a cop and he's there's a murderer
00:25:40,00:25:46,And Amish murder has happened and he's in this weird community that he doesn't know anything about and there's a scene where they raise a barn
00:25:46,00:25:51,"Oh, really? Yeah, it's confusing, isn't it? Because rays can mean either lift something up or burn it to the ground"
00:25:51,00:25:53,"If you get the wrong memo, yeah"
00:25:53,00:25:56,If you missed the spelling bee last week
00:25:56,00:25:58,Turn up a bit late
00:25:58,00:26:04,"Well, if you get the wrong end of the stick with spelling bee then you could be very embarrassed because you think you've just got a spell bee"
00:26:04,00:26:09,Which is one of the easiest words to spell. I might have a drinking bee later if anyone's interested
00:26:09,00:26:12,Let's just apply bee to anything
00:26:12,00:26:15,I'm having a crying bee if anyone wants to join in
00:26:16,00:26:19,"When you were on mastermind Lucy, did you win mastermind?"
00:26:19,00:26:25,"I well, I don't like to talk about it, but I have won it twice and I'm the current champion of champions"
00:26:25,00:26:27,But I don't like to mention it. I wish I hadn't brought that
00:26:27,00:26:34,What are your special subjects? So I did Steve Martin the first time and then Victoria Wood
00:26:34,00:26:38,"The second time that I did it, but I thought it'd be quite a nice thing to just sit and watch his movies for a couple of days"
00:26:40,00:26:47,Very good because you are a quiz a but you're also a quiz a I would say because the word quiz a the first use of it
00:26:47,00:26:49,It was someone who tells jokes
00:26:49,00:26:52,So a quiz used to be a comedian in
00:26:52,00:26:56,1797 according to the Oxford English Dictionary the word quiz
00:26:56,00:27:02,I've meant someone who does pranks or jokes or whatever and then obviously the word quiz is more more recent than that
00:27:02,00:27:05,Isn't it for like quizzing? We think it's 20th century
00:27:05,00:27:12,Well I for years the legendary origin story of the word quiz was that there was the an Irish theatrical impresario
00:27:12,00:27:18,"Who wanted to attract attention so wrote it on walls in Dublin and everyone said oh, what is quiz and"
00:27:18,00:27:25,"Complete nonsense, obviously. Yeah, that guy was called Richard Daly and the anecdote the earliest I could find was from"
00:27:25,00:27:28,1835 in the Manchester Times
00:27:28,00:27:31,But he died in 1813 so it's quite
00:27:32,00:27:38,"Close to him dying that the anecdote was was used, you know quite contemporary or so on it. How have you seen that word?"
00:27:38,00:27:47,I was listening to an old episode and I realized that I don't know how to say that word and I think I've said it quite often
00:27:47,00:27:51,I don't know how to say I'm gonna leave it but Richard Daly's really interesting
00:27:51,00:27:57,He he went to Trinity College in Dublin when he was 15 and he was a really turbulent student
00:27:57,00:28:03,He used to get into fights all the time. Apparently he fought 16 duels in the first two years that he was
00:28:03,00:28:12,And then he left Dublin to go and live in London and we're not sure why but one of the rumors was that he killed a billiard table marker
00:28:12,00:28:16,In a duel and he had to leave and go to London
00:28:16,00:28:22,That's a person not a thing well it could be a misprint for maker
00:28:22,00:28:28,But all of the sources say markers so it could be someone who draws the lights on a billiard table all the old crafter dying out
00:28:28,00:28:32,"Wow, but yeah, and then he went to prison"
00:28:32,00:28:37,After he was doing a show and he got in a fight with an audience member
00:28:37,00:28:45,"And when he was in prison, he wrote a lured account of an affair with one of his singers who was called Elizabeth Billington"
00:28:45,00:28:47,and she was amazing she was
00:28:48,00:28:53,Basically of all the English singers who have ever gone to Italy up to the current day
00:28:53,00:28:59,She had the best reputation as the best singer from England ever in Italy. Okay until she shagged this guy
00:28:59,00:29:04,"Well, she was you know, she was sometimes known as the Poland Street Mantrap"
00:29:04,00:29:07,Because she had affairs
00:29:07,00:29:12,The Prince of Wales the Duke of Sussex this person
00:29:12,00:29:21,And this was the woman who shagged the guy who apparently did actually didn't write the word quiz about town. That's why we're talking about her
00:29:21,00:29:28,"Well, I'm delighted to have heard of her. I want to hear her version of happy birthday"
00:29:28,00:29:32,The Poland Street Mantrap
00:29:32,00:29:35,I'm gonna go and hang around Poland
00:29:35,00:29:39,The Poland Street man repellent
00:29:40,00:29:42,That's what I want to be
00:29:42,00:29:50,"Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is my fact my fact is that in 1804"
00:29:50,00:29:55,William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy built a hut lined with moss
00:29:55,00:30:02,Lucy you're familiar with Andy's moss obsession that we're trying to
00:30:02,00:30:09,Trump down right? I should say this was sent this was sent in
00:30:09,00:30:13,To me by a guy called Nick Hodder on Twitter. So thank you Nick
00:30:13,00:30:18,For the moss fact people now send me moss content every week. It's great
00:30:18,00:30:27,He and Dorothy his sister they visited Scotland in the year before 1803 and they saw this hut
00:30:27,00:30:30,"A wooden hut lined with fog, which is what they called moss at the time"
00:30:30,00:30:35,"So they were very taken with it and when they got home to the Lake District, they built their own hut"
00:30:35,00:30:44,Lined it with moss covered it with henna on the outside and it was destroyed very sadly this important bit of English literary heritage
00:30:44,00:30:47,By the later owner Thomas De Quincey
00:30:47,00:30:52,Opium fan and fellow word celeb Thomas De Quincey
00:31:00,00:31:05,"And that anyway, so the good news is that in 2020 200 years after this absolute travesty"
00:31:05,00:31:11,"They a new version has been built. Isn't it interesting that the word fog in Scotland means moss. Yes, it is weird"
00:31:11,00:31:13,It's weird that isn't it apparently
00:31:13,00:31:20,It used to be a word for grass like long grass and then it became moss because it's like uncamped ground and they both come from an
00:31:20,00:31:26,Old Scandinavian word meaning wind blown so you kind of get fog blowing over the hills
00:31:26,00:31:31,"And you would also get the wind blown grass, and it comes from an old Norwegian word fucker"
00:31:31,00:31:36,Seamist or light drizzle
00:31:36,00:31:40,If you trace any etymology back far enough eventually you can find a swear word
00:31:40,00:31:55,"So it was worth in Dorothy they were tight, weren't they? They were super tight"
00:31:56,00:32:02,The brother and sister obviously but they didn't grow up together or they grew up in the first bit of their childhood together
00:32:02,00:32:06,"And then both of their parents died very sadly, and they were separated and"
00:32:06,00:32:13,William went to school and Dorothy was sent elsewhere and they reunited in adulthood and they seemed to have been full-on soulmates and
00:32:13,00:32:19,There are even things like the night before words was wedding to Mary who was his childhood sweetheart
00:32:19,00:32:21,"Oh, I actually think was a friend of Dorothy's the night before his wedding"
00:32:22,00:32:24,You're not buying anything
00:32:24,00:32:32,"Sorry, so he married Mary he married Mary the night before his wedding"
00:32:32,00:32:37,Dorothy his sister wore the wedding ring in bed that he was going to give to Mary and then in the morning
00:32:37,00:32:43,William and Dorothy did this ritual where words were sort of knelt beside her and took the ring off her finger and replaced it
00:32:43,00:32:47,"Onto her finger again, so it was a sort of ceremonial marriage to his sister and then went and married Mary"
00:32:48,00:32:53,Ourses and she didn't go to the wedding at Dorothy his sister. She just no no. She didn't attend
00:32:53,00:32:59,It's it was a what do we know why was it a wasn't invited venue not big enough kind of thing
00:32:59,00:33:03,You have to draw a line somewhere
00:33:03,00:33:06,I
00:33:06,00:33:12,"Think she just was grieving terribly that this was happening and that this big, you know emotional change was happening in her life"
00:33:12,00:33:15,Who knows but she did have a diary which he read by the way
00:33:16,00:33:22,"Another aspect of their relationship, but when she heard the wedding had happened there were people coming up the driveway to inform her"
00:33:22,00:33:29,"Oh, yes, they're married now. She wrote I could stand it no longer and threw myself on the bed neither hearing nor seeing anything"
00:33:29,00:33:32,She lived with them for the rest of
00:33:32,00:33:41,Their lives she outlived William then she died then eventually Mary has so when William died with the two women living together
00:33:41,00:33:43,"Yeah, there's a sick"
00:33:43,00:33:49,Isn't it I can have the ring back now Maggie Smith in that
00:33:49,00:33:57,Like remember death becomes her that movie with the golden horn kind of gradually disintegrating
00:33:57,00:34:01,"Yeah, there's like two people who live together, but they're immortal"
00:34:01,00:34:05,"Yeah, they hate each other and they start trying to beat each other up because they're immortal"
00:34:05,00:34:08,They just all their bones break and their wrists get all floppy
00:34:09,00:34:11,Wrists
00:34:11,00:34:21,"The subject of the diary and stuff though, but they sort of had joint journals didn't they and they collaborated and I did not know"
00:34:21,00:34:29,That the I wandered lonely as a cloud the inspirational walk for that was one that Dorothy and William took together
00:34:29,00:34:32,Around Oldswater in 1802
00:34:32,00:34:37,I mean how annoying would it be if you're on a walk with someone it's far as a poem and it's called
00:34:37,00:34:39,I wandered lonely as a cloud
00:34:39,00:34:45,It's my sister had stopped to tie her laces
00:34:45,00:34:51,And it was her because she wrote wrote up the daffodils encounter
00:34:51,00:34:55,"Yes, they did see a load of daffodils on the walk and then"
00:34:55,00:35:03,And she was right she used some very evocative language about them they were you know bouncing around and flopping about
00:35:06,00:35:08,You know the the waving
00:35:08,00:35:13,"Dancing host and all of that that was some of that language made its way into the poem. So, you know co-writer credit"
00:35:13,00:35:18,"Well, I think they were co-writers of lyrical ballads basically there was this amazing kind of threesome"
00:35:18,00:35:20,They had essentially so it was Dorothy and William and Coleridge
00:35:20,00:35:26,they all lived together in Dorset for a while and some summer set and they like you said Lucy they wrote in each other's notebooks and
00:35:26,00:35:28,they sort of finish each other's sentences and
00:35:28,00:35:33,Dorothy would write up this journal of how their walks and the flowers and the clouds and shit
00:35:33,00:35:36,"So I think it was a collaboration lyrical ballads, but"
00:35:36,00:35:40,Wordsworth wouldn't let anyone else have the copyright of it
00:35:40,00:35:45,So I think even though it's got a bunch of Coleridge in there. It's got five or six Coleridge poems in there
00:35:45,00:35:52,"It's an ancient mariner including ancient mariner, which is one of you'd want it's the big one that's the biggie"
00:35:52,00:35:57,"But like words was such a genius poet and Coleridge was all like words with you're the better one, you know"
00:35:57,00:36:00,I you're the genius you take this so it was
00:36:00,00:36:05,"Well, you first met the Coleridge said he was so excited that he leapt over a fence"
00:36:05,00:36:13,Wordsworth is sweet. It's like a real sort of fanboy. It really is. I mean and I
00:36:13,00:36:22,Had only recently got to know anything about Wordsworth and I had thought always the daffodils and it's all very prissy and and
00:36:22,00:36:26,What a life what a life he had
00:36:26,00:36:29,illegitimate children
00:36:29,00:36:31,Revolutionary France
00:36:31,00:36:34,He he was in Revolutionary France
00:36:34,00:36:37,father to child and then
00:36:37,00:36:40,Buggered off and couldn't get back to the child for like ten years or something
00:36:40,00:36:46,The revolution still have it sorry
00:36:46,00:36:51,"So aristocratic that it's a bit of a risk. Yeah, I can't even send any money"
00:36:51,00:36:56,"He did send money by the way in case his family listening. Yeah, he did send money"
00:36:57,00:37:01,"But yeah, he didn't invite them out of Revolutionary France and they were royalist"
00:37:01,00:37:07,So there was probably some tension for interesting which is very bizarre because he was a Revolutionary at least at the start
00:37:07,00:37:14,Like all cool trendy people of the day. Obviously went to France thought these whole ideas of equality and fraternity and liberty
00:37:14,00:37:17,I love it sounds great met loads of other fellow
00:37:17,00:37:23,Revolutionary reformists and then got a bit put off by all the mass murder that happened
00:37:24,00:37:28,And I think he was very good friends with someone who I think he saw get executed
00:37:28,00:37:30,I think that will put you off sometimes
00:37:30,00:37:35,"Well, it's basically his gap year. He was 22 years old when he went with it"
00:37:35,00:37:39,I mean the thing about was that he lived a very long he lived 80 years at the time 1770 to 1850
00:37:39,00:37:47,So there's a long old life and I think the imagination is of him was quite an old man because he was for you know a while
00:37:47,00:37:50,When you define older starting well
00:37:53,00:37:55,You know one thing Wordsworth couldn't do
00:37:55,00:37:59,Ride a motorcycle
00:37:59,00:38:01,Yep
00:38:01,00:38:07,"What could we do it is actually the daffodils. He would not have been able. Oh, I know to smell them"
00:38:07,00:38:11,"Yeah, no sense of smell. It's a noz mc. I only covered me"
00:38:11,00:38:16,And he had no sense of taste as I think we can tell from the prelude
00:38:16,00:38:22,"Yeah, his nephew Christopher wrote his first ever biography in 1851"
00:38:22,00:38:28,So the year after he died and he wrote with regard to fragrance. Mr. Wordsworth spoke from the testimony of others
00:38:28,00:38:34,"He himself had no sense of smell. God, that's awful as someone who's so infatuated with the countryside and nature and all of that"
00:38:34,00:38:40,"How travel although duffels don't really smell. Do they yeah, do they yeah, I don't like the smell of daffodils actually"
00:38:40,00:38:48,"Big ol smell. Yeah, you're right. Sorry. There's more very strong of urine. So I've tried"
00:38:49,00:38:55,That's probably why he wrote that he wrote this amazing poem about daffodils and everyone else. Just like I think not the ones that smell
00:38:55,00:39:00,You say you love to be very old
00:39:00,00:39:03,But a lot of people would say should have died younger
00:39:03,00:39:11,should have copped it earlier because he got quite crap later on in life according to I suppose most literary critics and
00:39:11,00:39:15,Even he when he was asked to be poet laureate when he was 73
00:39:15,00:39:18,"Said look, I don't think I'm good enough. I haven't written anything decent for years"
00:39:18,00:39:22,And he never published anything as poet laureate. Did he?
00:39:22,00:39:26,"When he was asked to be poet laureate, he said no at the start"
00:39:26,00:39:31,But then Robert Peele said well the Queen really wants you to be poet laureate and you don't have to do any work
00:39:31,00:39:34,"So would you like reconsider him? Oh, right fine"
00:39:34,00:39:42,But he was really famous at that time wasn't he and there's a bit where his wife was writing about when he was 77 years old
00:39:42,00:39:45,She's writing a letter to someone and in the letter
00:39:45,00:39:49,She says I'm looking up and a group of young tourists are standing before the window
00:39:49,00:39:53,So they're just people looking in his window and just going oh look there. He is
00:39:53,00:39:59,And apparently he was reading the newspaper and every time he lifted his head from the newspaper all the tourists would bow to him. Oh
00:39:59,00:40:04,"Amazing, I think they would put you off your work. That's why newspaper"
00:40:09,00:40:14,But he also always wore shades as well when he got older seriously
00:40:14,00:40:21,"Yeah, because he had very inflamed eyes and so he wore dark glasses to stop the light from getting in"
00:40:21,00:40:24,I mean he couldn't smell and then couldn't see anything because of his shades
00:40:24,00:40:27,Eventually would have been an entirely tactile based poet
00:40:27,00:40:36,He got quite reactionary as well. He did the old classic. This is why better to die young
00:40:37,00:40:39,He went from being cool
00:40:39,00:40:43,Revolutionary reformist and thinking things like he was sort of pop
00:40:43,00:40:49,He was essential to the founding of the national trust because he really believed in land being shared by everyone
00:40:49,00:40:53,Everyone should have access and should get outside and experience nature the working classes should be you know
00:40:53,00:40:57,It should be brought up to the Lake District and show now lovely the rivers are or whatever
00:40:57,00:41:03,How come I went to let a national trust property the other day and it was four o'clock on a Sunday and he said sorry we're closed
00:41:04,00:41:07,"Yes, sorry about that. They're not saying true to the spirit of words with"
00:41:07,00:41:16,"But well, he went off the idea anyway on his later life because he a became very pro the death penalty wrote poems in favor of the death penalty"
00:41:16,00:41:21,Few poems in favor of the death
00:41:21,00:41:28,"Yeah, death penalty found in a poet you don't you don't see them often in one person. What was it called? Do you know?"
00:41:28,00:41:30,"Yes, it was cool"
00:41:30,00:41:33,Noose on the loose
00:41:34,00:41:36,It was called sonnets upon the punishment of death
00:41:36,00:41:39,Wow
00:41:39,00:41:46,And he didn't like it actually it turned out when the trains got up and running and people did start getting the train up to
00:41:46,00:41:50,The Lake District from sort of Manchester and stuff and disturbing his peace and quietude
00:41:50,00:41:53,Turn into a miserable old goat
00:41:53,00:41:55,really
00:41:55,00:42:00,"I suppose people standing outside your window. You'd be like, I don't want more of them coming up to stand and look at me"
00:42:00,00:42:06,I'll read the paper and fair enough. I think the death penalty for people who stare
00:42:06,00:42:12,You drop a guillotine from your window
00:42:12,00:42:15,Porta's Britain is gonna be
00:42:15,00:42:25,There'll be quiz shows about me on television
00:42:25,00:42:28,That's the main thing that I'm looking for
00:42:28,00:42:38,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James"
00:42:38,00:42:38,Okay
00:42:38,00:42:44,My fact this week is that we know of five people who have died in the Queen Vic in EastEnders
00:42:44,00:42:46,Although one of them was murdered
00:42:46,00:42:49,120 years before the TV show began
00:42:52,00:42:55,Wasn't it they were they were stabbed to death full staring at
00:42:55,00:43:02,"Lucy has been in EastEnders, right? I have"
00:43:02,00:43:05,Yes
00:43:05,00:43:09,Didn't get murdered in the Queen Vic. So I
00:43:09,00:43:14,Had a very small part as a woman called Rita who was the love interest of a character called Mitch
00:43:14,00:43:17,So for our overseas listeners EastEnders is a beloved
00:43:17,00:43:23,"soap opera and if you get a part in EastEnders, it is absolutely mandatory for everyone, you know"
00:43:23,00:43:25,To then talk at you in a cockney accent
00:43:25,00:43:35,Above the door Frank
00:43:35,00:43:39,"Yeah, but I didn't get to go inside the Queen Vic"
00:43:39,00:43:42,So maybe I was lucky given that it's obviously where all of your
00:43:42,00:43:47,"All of your scenes outdoors. No, I was in the laundrette, which is another"
00:43:48,00:43:49,Iconic location
00:43:49,00:43:55,But I don't know if I've been killed off because they don't tell you obviously when you go into EastEnders
00:43:55,00:43:58,they're not allowed to tell you anything about what's going on and
00:43:58,00:44:03,"Especially when I was in it, there was a big murder storyline which has now been resolved"
00:44:03,00:44:08,But they bumped up their murder count because there was a man called gray who was murdering loads of people
00:44:08,00:44:12,And so I got the script and they were like well
00:44:12,00:44:17,You can't tell anyone what happens because not my bit was like the little comic relief nonsense
00:44:17,00:44:23,But this big storyline was being resolved and in fact when I got onto the set
00:44:23,00:44:25,I was in the laundrette and this murderer
00:44:25,00:44:30,Came in and it was his last day and I was like oh because he was the most hated man in Britain
00:44:30,00:44:32,And he came in and it was his last day
00:44:32,00:44:35,So he did this lovely speech about how wonderful it is and I've had such a wonderful time
00:44:35,00:44:39,And it was like seeing I don't know Fred West or Ted Bundy
00:44:40,00:44:42,"Well, it's all been a marvellous luck"
00:44:42,00:44:51,"Was that in the last four or five years then that was in the last year so because yeah, because I know"
00:44:51,00:44:56,EastEnders wasn't very murdery for a while. It was always the Coronation Street
00:44:56,00:44:59,I think was the most murdery and then Holly Oaks
00:44:59,00:45:02,Holly Oaks took over
00:45:02,00:45:07,I've got friend who's in Holly Oaks and during COVID she had to do some kissing scenes
00:45:08,00:45:16,But she couldn't do it because obviously you weren't allowed to go near and so her partner had to come on and be her
00:45:16,00:45:21,"Love interest, but you only kind of saw his shoulder the whole time. He's a singer in a band"
00:45:21,00:45:26,He's got long hair very skinny guy and her partner was this kind of hunky Asian bloke
00:45:26,00:45:31,Amazing bit of camera work
00:45:32,00:45:34,Needle-to-thread
00:45:34,00:45:46,When I was filming it was like you couldn't that you had to stand and shout across the laundry at each other
00:45:46,00:45:52,It's a noisy working environment
00:45:52,00:46:00,Did you have to do the tennis ball on a stick thing what's that any standards during COVID?
00:46:00,00:46:03,They had I watched a sort of little documentary on all the tricks they had to do
00:46:03,00:46:07,And one of them was whenever you see anyone in a close-up scene with someone else in EastEnders during COVID
00:46:07,00:46:11,"They were talking to an empty space, but they would put a little tennis ball at the top of a pole"
00:46:11,00:46:13,Which was where you were supposed to look to see their eyes
00:46:13,00:46:18,So if they're sobbing or lunging or chassing it's always engaging with the tennis ball
00:46:18,00:46:22,"So those two person shots where you see their face, but the other person's back of their head"
00:46:22,00:46:26,The reverse or they did it in plates. So they did it
00:46:26,00:46:29,"Um, they'd filmed one person a bit like how they did the parent trap"
00:46:30,00:46:32,Um
00:46:32,00:46:36,I mean they could have used it to make someone their own twin for a while if you're going to do it that way
00:46:36,00:46:42,"Yeah, they could have done like is it eddie murphy in that movie not he prefers the two the clumps. Yeah. Yeah"
00:46:42,00:46:46,Or in kind hearts and coronets would probably be a better
00:46:46,00:46:51,Everyone's film Mitchell film it should have had a completely film Mitchell episode EastEnders
00:46:51,00:46:53,Where he played all the roles
00:46:53,00:46:59,I haven't really explained the fact have I no sorry that I should very very quickly
00:46:59,00:47:01,"so, um, they"
00:47:01,00:47:08,"Um, in night in February 2020 one character called Sharon Mitchell decided to tell a story"
00:47:08,00:47:12,"Sorry, the tennis with which you said one of the seminal EastEnders characters names. Is that sorry"
00:47:12,00:47:15,She's one of the five biggest characters in it
00:47:15,00:47:18,"I'm so sorry Dean. I mean she's brilliant. Oh, is it? Yeah"
00:47:18,00:47:22,"Well by my accent, you could probably tell I'm a coronation street guy"
00:47:23,00:47:29,"Uh, anyway, so Sharon Mitchell talked about mr. And mrs. Bagstock who were the original landlord and landlady of the queen Vic"
00:47:29,00:47:37,And apparently back in the 1860s when the fictional queen Vic was first built
00:47:37,00:47:43,And these this landlord killed his landlady by drowning her in the bath
00:47:43,00:47:48,"Uh, and maybe that's why they've had so much bad luck in Elba Square"
00:47:48,00:47:51,It's a haunted pub effectively
00:47:51,00:47:55,"Yeah, I tried to see if there was a such person as mr. Bagstock"
00:47:55,00:47:59,"Uh in London, but bag stock doesn't appear to even be a name"
00:47:59,00:48:06,"It's in Dombie and Sons, but I think it's just a made-up Dickens name. Oh, that's quite it. That's a nice literary pedigree though"
00:48:06,00:48:11,"For this random bit of queen Vic trivia. That's great. Um, so one thing"
00:48:11,00:48:17,"That the the EastEnders hasn't come on with William Wordsworth. Oh, yeah, they can't smell. They can't"
00:48:18,00:48:21,"Nobody can smell. Yeah, it's a death penalty. Yeah"
00:48:21,00:48:24,"Um, they daffodils"
00:48:24,00:48:27,"Oh, so there are some daffodils in albert square"
00:48:27,00:48:32,"But wordsworth wouldn't have been able to smell these ones for a very good reason, which is that they're fake"
00:48:32,00:48:36,"Oh, and the reason that they're fake daffodils. I'm probably"
00:48:36,00:48:43,"Good filming reasons for that, but also they film is it about six weeks in advance you film the episodes about six weeks later"
00:48:43,00:48:46,So they they make it look like springs
00:48:46,00:48:48,Even though it's still winter
00:48:48,00:48:52,"Right, so that's that's their way of doing it. It's basically a time portal and then at the other end of the year"
00:48:52,00:48:54,They obviously they have to shave the trees
00:48:54,00:49:02,"No, that's I'm joking. That's that's not real because I was thinking the very first lines of the first episode of EastEnders"
00:49:02,00:49:06,"Was dirty dan walks in and he goes sticks in here. Oh, yeah"
00:49:06,00:49:10,So it might have been sticks of weed here from all those daffodils
00:49:10,00:49:12,Definitely real
00:49:12,00:49:13,Dirty daff
00:49:13,00:49:19,"Well, didn't he get killed by someone was holding a bunch of flowers the first time he wasn't actually dead"
00:49:19,00:49:25,But someone was holding a bunch of daffodils and they shot them shot him through it. So come on. I love it. It's all tying together
00:49:25,00:49:27,My god
00:49:27,00:49:29,David Lynch isn't it?
00:49:29,00:49:32,We've broken EastEnders wide open
00:49:32,00:49:38,"Um, so the person behind EastEnders was Julia, one called Julia Smith who when she was"
00:49:39,00:49:41,Advertising for jobs said only EastEnders need apply
00:49:41,00:49:45,So it was all real people from the East End of London at first who were on it
00:49:45,00:49:48,And they weren't actually calling EastEnders at the time. They were calling it East 8
00:49:48,00:49:54,And she wrote that they called it East 8 referred to it as East 8 when they were working on the show before it came out
00:49:54,00:49:59,And then she realized a bunch of her friends were saying what's this estate program? You've got when it's not coming out
00:49:59,00:50:04,"And it's just is the word estate, but it could have been called other working titles square dance"
00:50:04,00:50:07,"Yeah around the houses, which isn't another show"
00:50:07,00:50:12,That's quite a good title round the houses. It sounds like a much more huggable. I think there are fewer murders in round
00:50:12,00:50:18,"Yeah, that's the level 76.com. Is that that's that's the terry and june style"
00:50:18,00:50:23,"Oh, Reg Cox is fine. He was just pretending to prank"
00:50:23,00:50:25,um
00:50:25,00:50:27,On the subject of the script security
00:50:27,00:50:31,"Because you know it's set in wallford, right? So this was the fictional play save created"
00:50:31,00:50:35,so when my husband was in EastEnders a few years ago and the
00:50:36,00:50:40,"Uh, it was christmas day episode which again, you know, they don't want anything to get out about the christmas episode"
00:50:40,00:50:44,So they have this ridiculous procedure where they send you a script
00:50:44,00:50:51,But they won't send the password to unlock that script to the same email that they've sent the script to because obviously that might get hacked
00:50:51,00:50:53,So what they do then is they
00:50:53,00:51:00,"Phone you and then they give you another special code which sort of unlocks something else. Anyway, it's it's like a seven stage"
00:51:00,00:51:02,You'd be easier to get the nuclear code
00:51:02,00:51:06,"To get into an EastEnders script, but what really made me laugh when my husband did it was"
00:51:06,00:51:10,They went through all of this and he was he had to be by the phone at a certain time take the phone call
00:51:10,00:51:15,"And he answered the phone went uh, uh, and then started typing it in and the password was wallford"
00:51:15,00:51:21,And then I did it recently and they have changed it because
00:51:21,00:51:26,"I tell everyone I knew about that but the a was a four, wasn't it? So no"
00:51:27,00:51:33,"Yeah, impenetrable levels. Wow. Walford probably named after walford road, which is in dolston"
00:51:33,00:51:35,because one of the other co-creator with
00:51:35,00:51:39,julia smith julia smith was tony holland
00:51:39,00:51:45,And he lived in dolston or nearby and he probably saw walford road and gave it that name
00:51:45,00:51:50,He based albert square on a place called facet square in dolston
00:51:50,00:51:53,Which I went to yesterday had a cycle round
00:51:54,00:51:58,Very nice and the nearest pub to facet square is called the victoria
00:51:58,00:52:03,Which i'm fairly certain must be where he got the idea for the queen vic name at least
00:52:03,00:52:10,"Because it's got it it's licensed in 1848. So it's a very very old pub. Anyway, I went there last night and"
00:52:10,00:52:15,You discovered you were your own father
00:52:15,00:52:21,The whole place burned down. I was so hoping for that kind of thing. But basically it's the
00:52:22,00:52:26,Abstriest place you can possibly imagine instead of like light fixtures
00:52:26,00:52:32,It has upside down plant pots with trees coming out of it and it sells four different types of kombucha
00:52:32,00:52:34,But it's
00:52:34,00:52:42,Kind of IPA and and read my book doc coffee wouldn't have approved of all of this would I mean everybody does complain
00:52:42,00:52:47,About the fact that east enders is now set in an area of london where nobody who's in it could afford to live
00:52:47,00:52:51,"You know, it would all be merchant bankers and hedge fund managers or podcasters"
00:52:52,00:52:58,"Your podcast is doing well. Just me not most podcasters, but yeah the um, but off-com"
00:52:58,00:53:04,I was reading all the off-com complaints about east enders and uh one complaint was people saying that
00:53:04,00:53:07,"Uh, people spend too much time in the cafe"
00:53:07,00:53:15,Someone had calculated how much the characters would spend if they were buying the amount of drinks and snacks because of course
00:53:15,00:53:19,"They're always eating and drinking. Yeah, but have you seen how many times Peggy Mitchell said it's on the ass"
00:53:19,00:53:24,It's on the ass. That's true. That's how it would have gone under. Yes. Very good. They're almost off re-drinking
00:53:24,00:53:26,I was reading some of the other complaints actually
00:53:26,00:53:33,And there was one saying that people were throwing the cigarette butts on the ground and if they did that
00:53:33,00:53:35,Why did they not get a fixed penalty notice for doing it?
00:53:35,00:53:42,"You can be yeah, you can be having an affair with your brother's sister's"
00:53:42,00:53:45,cat
00:53:45,00:53:47,But the unrealistic thing is
00:53:47,00:53:51,"Um, something else realistic is um, Barbara Windsor's life"
00:53:51,00:53:56,It was thought that her life was quite true to the what seems like a very unrealistic east ender's life
00:53:56,00:53:58,So she was she was quite
00:53:58,00:54:03,In the gang world really. Yeah 70s 80s
00:54:03,00:54:07,She went out with Ronnie Cray. Hold on. Who was the not mad one? She went out with Reggie Cray
00:54:07,00:54:11,"Ronnie was the really mad one, wasn't he? I mean, it's like it's like the williams sisters. They're both good at tennis"
00:54:16,00:54:20,"She went out with the equivalent of venus williams, I suppose in Cray brothers"
00:54:20,00:54:25,And she was married
00:54:25,00:54:32,She was married to another guy called Ronnie knight who was another gangster really the venus williams of the underworld
00:54:32,00:54:38,That's amazing. He'd have been so flattered. I think both be flattered by that
00:54:38,00:54:43,"No, ladies and gentlemen, please give your applause to the Ronnie Cray"
00:54:43,00:54:45,Oh
00:54:45,00:54:53,So she married a Ronnie Ronnie knight
00:54:53,00:54:57,Who was another kind of gangster and Ronnie knight's brother?
00:54:57,00:54:59,I ended up reading his Wikipedia page basically his brother
00:54:59,00:55:04,His brother's killer and the man who killed his brother's killer were all murdered
00:55:04,00:55:10,That's a trait. That's a trailer for murders. Sorry. So sorry. So Ronnie knight Barbara Windsor's husband was
00:55:11,00:55:13,His brother was murdered
00:55:13,00:55:16,"Okay, and then his brother's killer was murdered"
00:55:16,00:55:19,And then his brother's killer's killer was murdered
00:55:19,00:55:25,It's an endless trail of murder and I'm still picturing it in the world of tennis and it's becoming
00:55:25,00:55:30,"I mean in the word of gangsters, it's not as implausible. This is we're still in the group stages"
00:55:30,00:55:35,And did de Barbara Windsor kill all of those?
00:55:35,00:55:37,Turns out yes
00:55:37,00:55:44,"Well, actually her husband Ronnie knight probably did kill his brother's killer because he admitted to it in his autobiography later"
00:55:44,00:55:49,But he'd already been tried for it and exonerated. So under double jeopardy. They couldn't get him in your face
00:55:49,00:55:53,There is a thing about so Lucy you said about
00:55:53,00:55:58,The murder stats way higher in east enders
00:55:58,00:56:03,"I think so in east enders, it's about a hundred. You're about a hundred times as likely to be murdered in east enders as you are in Britain"
00:56:04,00:56:09,"Um, but there is good. There's a concomitant bit of good news. Which is that"
00:56:09,00:56:15,Um residents of wallford are much more romantically faithful than real people. Oh really? Yeah
00:56:15,00:56:19,Both of these things are only good news and bad news if you live in the world of east enders
00:56:19,00:56:25,They are not in the real world bad news for all of us except me. So I just need to be in full time
00:56:25,00:56:27,"So on the show, it's a"
00:56:27,00:56:31,Tiny percentage two percent of female and 1.7 percent of male characters having a fair each year
00:56:31,00:56:34,Is that right? I always thought they were all having affairs in east enders. Me too. I would have thought
00:56:34,00:56:37,So this is a study from 2003. So maybe they've sexed it up since then
00:56:37,00:56:45,But that's way lower than the stats from 2003 for men and women in the uk having affairs
00:56:45,00:56:48,"Also, this was the other finding the men of albert square"
00:56:48,00:56:51,Also less likely to visit a prostitute
00:56:51,00:56:58,That's good. Just 0.18 percent of them are knocking on that door. Good on them. Yeah
00:56:58,00:57:04,"Well, again, you see I should I should be suggesting this to the storyline as I should say I could I mean become a sex worker"
00:57:04,00:57:08,Make the show more realistic. I could be the man trap of wallford
00:57:08,00:57:17,"Okay, that's it that's all of our facts"
