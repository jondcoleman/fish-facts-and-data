00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 [Bell]

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 [Bell]

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 [Applause]

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 [Applause]

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Welcome to another episode

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 in Central London, my name is Dad Shriver

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 and Anne Chazinski

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 and in no particular order

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 here we go

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 starting with you, Andy Murray

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 My thing this week is that

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 when you have a tattoo lasered off

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 you end up pooing it out

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 [Laughter]

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 So that happens

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Does it still have the same design on the floor?

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 [Laughter]

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So yeah, this happens

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So when you have a tattoo

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 it goes into the middle layer of the skin

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 which is called the dermis

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 and when it's lasered off

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 the beams of like they heat up the ink

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and it breaks down into tiny particles

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 and those go into the bloodstream

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 and then they are excreted via the liver

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 and the digestive system

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 and that's how they get out of you

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I just think that's amazing

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That says something about how little you want the tattoo anymore

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 doesn't it?

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So do you know what tattoos are made out of

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 like the ink? Do you know where that comes from?

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Okay, well there was a lady on Facebook

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 who got a tattoo

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 a vegan on her inner lip

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 and then her friends pointed out

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 that actually most black ink of tattoos

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 is made from burnt animal bones

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 [Laughter]

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Oh god

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 she's going to see that every time she looks in the mirror

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Every time she eats anything

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Yeah, that's the worst part

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You can get vegan tattoos

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 but they're very rare

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Indeed, right

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 The oldest tattoo we know of is on a lip, isn't it?

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 A tattoo of a thin pencil moustache

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 [Laughter]

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 tattooed onto the upper lip

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 of a 7,000 year old mummy

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 from Chile

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 What, like a little French kind of

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I'm not sure if it has the gap down the middle

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 that a pencil moustache is supposed to have

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Do they have to have the gap down the middle?

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 No, I'm not sure

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I think somebody's never been able to grow a moustache

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I don't know, damn

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It's not a moustache

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Yeah, my grandmother has tattooed eyebrows

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It's a huge heart

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 [Laughter]

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Does she, like, permanently look surprised?

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I don't know where her

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 original eyebrows went though

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 That's what I don't know

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Did she poo them out?

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I do think you're going to say a grandmother had a thin pencil moustache

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 [Laughter]

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Kind of a cruising to share

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So the thing on tattoos being quite sort of

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 the stereotype of them being for sailors

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 or for criminals

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 or whatever it is

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 The headline tattoos are not just for sailors anymore

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 has appeared in print every decade

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 since the mid 19th century

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Every decade, there's the rash of articles

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 saying they've entered the mainstream

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 So today more teachers

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 have their members of the armed forces

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 By 14% to 9%

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But it used to be like 90% of sailors had tattoos

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Wasn't it?

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Something like that

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 The 19th century probably

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 One thing that it was good for was

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 it meant that you could identify a sailor who had drowned

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 because you'd be able to identify them by their tattoos

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 and they were actually used

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 in that way

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So you could tell that he had a tattoo that said

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 "I have drowned"

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 He has a lot of tattoos

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 The first one says "help"

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 The third one says "bubbubble"

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And the other thing that they thought the sailors

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 is if you had hold tattooed on your knuckles on one hand

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 and fast on the other hand

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 then it would help you hold on to ropes better

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Well we, you could stop drowning

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 as a sailor apparently

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 was to have a pig tattooed on your knee

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and then a cock

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 as in a wrist, a tattooed on your right leg somewhere

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 and they had the saying

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 that was "pig on the knee"

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 "save it see a cock on the right never lose a fight"

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 So this is what those animals can swim

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 or fight very well

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Speaking of cocks and tattoos

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Yeah God

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Sometimes when I want to find out some facts for this show

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I'll go back to the old QI topboards

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 and see what I wrote in the past

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 and I touched the tattoos

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 and I found something that Dan posted in 2005

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 and this is what he said

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 He said "I was told today

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 that if a man was to have a tattoo done on his penis

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 then he was entitled to three tattoos

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 for the rest of his life

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 from anywhere in the world

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 in any tattooing power

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 No questions asked

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 This is what used to pass the QI research back in the day

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 So I have a confession

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It's not just my grandmother with a tattoo

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Well I had a look

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 and there are one or two tattoo parlors

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 that will claim that they will do that

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 whether they will or not

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I don't know but it's not everyone in the world all the time

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It's a very difficult thing to Google by the way

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 But very easy to Google, it's very difficult to forget

150
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I shouldn't have gotten Google images really for that

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But I found a story about a 21-year-old from Iran

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 who paid a tattoo artist to put the letter "M" for his girlfriend's last name

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 and the Persian phrase for "Good luck with your journeys"

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 on his penis

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 and he fell pain for eight days

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 and then his penis became permanently semi erect

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 so he couldn't get it to go down

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 He lived with it

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 and he didn't know what to do

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 He just became permanently semi erect

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 so he couldn't get it to go down

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 He lived with it for three months before getting medical help

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 and doctors tried shunting the penis

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 to drain excess blood

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Not sure what shunting

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And then it didn't work

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 and so the patient decided

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 he was fine with the condition

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 and declined further treatment

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Wow

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 So they were quite a high society thing

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 weren't they in the 19th century

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 and at the turn of so

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 in about 1900

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 New York newspaper estimator

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 that 75% of society ladies in New York had tattoos

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 75%

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 What kind of tattoos? Like practical ones

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 or

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 practical tattoos

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Don't back away

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Step up

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 You get medical tattoos

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 and we think that some of the oldest tattoos ever

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 which are 5,000 years old

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 the 3,000 BC we found bodies

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 where there's a body in the house

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 which has tattoos over his joints

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 and they looked at the skeleton

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 and he had osteoarthritis in those joints

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So it's like a kind of

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 That's what I meant by it actually

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 because the mercury astronauts are apparently as well

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 No, no, no, but I looked into

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 whether or not astronauts had any tattoos

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 You're like I'm saying a lot of things

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 that it's just me agreeing with

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 mercury astronauts

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 They would have them

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 in just like sensor locations

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 basically for whenever they had to monitor their health

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 so they knew where they were

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Kind of like putting a bit of tape on the ground

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 as a mark for an actor

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 There was a guy who's arrested

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 by Canada's border services agency

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 with the letters H-A-T-E

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 on his knuckles

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 and he claimed that it stood far

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 through eternity

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 That's very good

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Quick thinking

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 One moment used to an internet translation to

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 translate "I Love David" into Hebrew

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 She later discovered

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 she inadvertently had the phrase

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 "Babylon is the world's leading dictionary

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 and translation software"

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 on her back

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Forever

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 But she doesn't have a free account with Babylon forever

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 David Beckham has

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Victoria Beckham's name miss belt

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 tattooed on his body in Hindi

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Oh dear

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Samantha Cameron has a tattoo

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Yeah, she's cooler than all of us

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Hello, Dan's grandmother

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Sorry

230
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Is it a practical tattoo?

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It's a dolphin on her ankle

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Is that practical?

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Yeah, that's cool

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Was that just a holiday that she took once

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 To a dolphin area?

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 To a dolphin area

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Oh, just you go into that and you get a tattoo

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 No, I don't mean it's like

239
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Is anyone going to camera it?

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 No, I'll go

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Quick tattoo that dolphin

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 So I can live this memory forever

243
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 There's an American guy

244
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 who has over a thousand tattoos

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 based on Disney characters

246
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 including all 101 and 101 Dalmatians

247
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Which I don't

248
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 There must be tiny though

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 with the Dalmatians

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Well, obviously none of his life's size

251
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 But I mean

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 How many, to buy the single

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 The area of a body by a thousand is not much room you've got

254
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Yeah, so I mean I think it is to scale

255
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 But it is scaled down

256
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And he has a system

257
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 So he has all the evil characters

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 are below his knees

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 All the undersea characters are below his belly

260
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 So I don't know

261
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 But then all the evil characters are under the sea

262
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So I don't know how he works that out

263
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Wow

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Anyway, he gets copyrighted by a Disney

265
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Like Disney's allowed him to do it

266
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Oh really? He's the only person

267
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Why is it illegal to do a Disney tattoo?

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I think when you've got that many of them

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 What would they do?

270
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Make you put it out? Oh yeah

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So if anyone has anything more than they want to add

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 On mistakes in tattoos

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 John Caru, who's a footballer? Yeah, John Caru

275
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 John Caru, he got a tattoo saying

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He wanted to say my life, my rules

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 So he got Mavie Meeregler

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 But he got the accent wrong on regular

279
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 He got an acute accent instead of a grave one

280
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Which translates as my life, my menstruation

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 (Laughter)

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Okay, it's time for our second fact of the evening

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And that fact is Chazinski's

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Yeah, my fact is that the man who invented the airship

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Used to hold dinner parties with ten-foot-high chairs

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 So that his guests could experience the joy of flight

287
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 (Laughter)

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 This guy is amazing, presenting like Alberto Santos-Dumel

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And first of all, he decided to have hanging from the ceiling

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Which he could understand was more reminiscent of flight

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But one of his first dinner parties

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 He put all his guests hanging from the ceiling

293
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And the ceiling collapsed

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So he's...

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 (Laughter)

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 So after all the funerals of the previous guests

297
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Weirdly, no one wanted to come to the next party

298
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And the TV was fine

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So the wake will be at mine, I've organised a nice dinner

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 (Laughter)

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Wow

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Yeah, he was great

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 He was an inventor, he grew up on a plantation in Brazil

304
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And he invented a toy motor powered functioning aeroplane

305
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Which was quite a long time before

306
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 He invented in the late 19th century

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And then he moved to Paris and became a celebrity

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Because he invented the airship

309
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Which attracted attention

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And used to invite celebrities and royalty to his house

311
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And have these wacky dinner parties

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And they'd have to mount their seats on ladders

313
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 (Laughter)

314
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Yeah, he was so famous in his time

315
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 At the time said, "When the names of all those

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Who have occupied outstanding positions in the world

317
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Have been forgotten

318
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 There will be a name which will remain in our memory

319
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 That of Santos Dumont

320
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 (Laughter)

321
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 He does sound like an amazing guy

322
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He sounds unbelievable, actually

323
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 As in, he had his own airship in Paris

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 When no one else had any means of flight

325
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He was just flying around the streets of Paris

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 He would just stop at a cafe

327
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Tether it

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And then go down to the cafe

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And say, "Well, so you like that, and fly off

330
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It is in the late 19th century, early 20th century

331
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 He just did it

332
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 What was he tethering to

333
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 All right, rooftops

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Yeah, it wasn't huge, when you look at photos of it

335
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 It's not a massive airship

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It's like the size of the one and one or the hoodie

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 There was one man airship, I think, a personal airship

338
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 He would go past ladies bedrooms

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And they would throw their underwear out of the window

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 (Laughter)

341
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That's how famous he was

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 He was also super generous

343
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So he was responsible for the first woman ever to take flight

344
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Because there was a princess

345
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 She was a princess of some foreign country

346
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Came to visit Paris, took an interest in his airship

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Said, "Wouldn't mine go up one of those?"

348
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And he taught her to fly one

349
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And then he had her flying one through the streets of Paris

350
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And he cycled blue shouting her instructions

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And she did so

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And this was the first woman to fly

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Wow, I actually, it sounds way worse to think of mentoring their underwear

354
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 At her

355
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Oh, Jesus!

356
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 He invented other things as well

357
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I know the 10th of a chair, no one talks about it

358
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 No one mentions the 10th of a chair

359
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 We've all got one

360
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And we've all got the motorised skis to get him back up and mounted

361
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Really? And he invented it a sling shot

362
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Which would throw life belts out from sinking ships

363
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 So that everyone could have a life belt

364
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 He also invented a racing airship

365
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Which was similar to his airship

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 But he never raced it because he had no one to race against

367
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 (Laughter)

368
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 That is so sad

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 He could have just made two, couldn't he?

370
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Can I bring it to dinner parties very quickly?

371
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I just want to talk about my favourite dinner party host

372
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 From History, which is William Buckland

373
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 He's a very exciting character

374
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 He studied fossils and he was a geologist

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 But he also went on this massive mission

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 To eat every single thing in the animal kingdom

377
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 He was just like "I need to have everything his favourite"

378
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 So if you went to his house for dinner

379
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 You would end up having things like Elephant's trunk

380
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Or mice on toast was his favourite thing

381
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And he knew food so like he knew animal food

382
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Everything about them so well

383
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 That he was once invited to go to this church

384
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Where they thought a saint's blood was on the ground of this church

385
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And he came over there

386
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And he had a look at it and he was like

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Because it was just his patch on the ground of the heart's the saint's blood

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 He leaned down, he licked it

389
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And he came back up and went

390
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 "I was about urine"

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 He just knew

392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But also the worst guest to have at a dinner party in that respect

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Because he went to this party which was Lord Harcourt

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 His the Archbishop of York

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And at the dinner, Harcourt was like

396
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 "I've got this amazing relic that I want to show you all

397
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And he brought out what was the heart of Louis XVI in a box

398
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And within seconds Bucklinges grabbed it and he ate it"

399
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 But you say worse than he has ever

400
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Very few dinner hosts bring the heart of a dead king

401
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 To the table

402
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I would say worse than a host ever

403
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Okay, here's another dinner party thing

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Though a christening of Louis XIV's grandson

405
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 He created a cake

406
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Sorry, there was a great chef called Antoine Karam

407
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Who created a cake

408
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And the cake was made out of own paste

409
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Pastry and clockwork

410
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And I loved clockwork

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I love it so much

412
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And it's so hard to get these days in paste trees

413
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Every Greg's I go into

414
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And they had clockwork

415
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Because this cake on top of it had a baby juke

416
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Entering the world through a marzipan vagina

417
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 That is quite a centipede system

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 So it was him

419
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It was celebrating him

420
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 The child, yeah. It was a model of his mother

421
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Giving birth to him

422
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Yes, through a marzipan with clockwork

423
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Don't get thy Greg's to you

424
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 No, no, wow

425
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I was reading that back in the day

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 When furniture was just suddenly being

427
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Introduced to the idea of us having it in our homes and stuff

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Wait, wait, wait

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I know, so very excited

430
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 When furniture was being introduced

431
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 To the idea

432
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Of having it in our homes

433
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 It was a short for furniture

434
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It wasn't domesticated until the 1500s

435
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 The beautiful days when

436
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 You know, freestanding shazes

437
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Were just roamed the belt

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Oh, come on

439
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 There are a wild chair these days

440
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 There are only

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 400 Louis Catoll's tables left in the wild

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Sorry, sorry don't come

443
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I know that was my fact

444
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Apparently when we started introducing furniture

445
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Like covers would just be put in the middle of the room

446
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 As opposed to against the wall now

447
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And dinner tables

448
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 We didn't used to have legs to dinner tables

449
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 You would have people come and sit

450
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 If you were having a party

451
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 There would be a big board like this that you would bring out

452
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And you would put it on your legs

453
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 So they would just be sat on your legs

454
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And that's why apparently there were boards

455
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And you would be a border

456
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And apparently borders who stay in your house

457
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 That would hold the table up

458
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Yeah, you'd hold the table up with your legs

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I read this in Bill Bryson's book at home

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 He used to say that carpets

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Before we used to walk on them you just have them on your wall

462
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And you'd go, "It's my carpet"

463
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And if you had a special guest

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And you'd take it down from the wall

465
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And you'd put it for them to walk on

466
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And chairs used to be against the walls

467
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You would have chairs against the walls

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Because at night when you didn't have electricity

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 You would not trip over stuff in the middle of your room

470
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But if you had chairs all over the shop

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 You should be asleep

472
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 They would get up halfway through the night wouldn't they?

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Because people used to sleep in two different sections

474
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And they'd get up and have sex

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Or give it a crossword

476
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 You're very comfortable, aren't you?

477
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Oh, we're going to have to move on

478
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Should we move on as anyone got anything else?

479
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 I quite like the inactivity chair

480
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Which has recently been invented

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Which is a chair with only two legs

482
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And it is basically so that you live in fear while you sit on it

483
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And constantly be doing a balancing act

484
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And I think the idea is that you can exercise

485
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 While also being seated but it sounds awful

486
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Anyway, invest in one if you're looking to improve your health

487
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 I always think I'm not afraid enough when I'm sitting down

488
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Stop the podcast

489
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 We have an emergency announcement to make

490
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And this is it

491
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, I've no such thing as a fish

492
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Was produced with the help of Squarespace

493
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Which is that award-winning website builder

494
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000

 Okay, back to the podcast

502
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Okay, time for fact number three, that is my fact

503
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 My fact this week is that a new scientific study has concluded

504
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 That there are too many scientific studies

505
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 It's basically the study was saying that it's doing a thing now

506
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Where so many studies are coming out in science

507
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 That it's diminishing the attention that gets given to a actual good study

508
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Because it's drawing headlines away from them

509
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And studies are going so sort of minute into these little...

510
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 I don't know, like

511
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 There's great ones that we've read in the past

512
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 That we've talked about in the office and stuff

513
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 A study that showed that the fish herring

514
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 That they fought

515
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 To communicate with each other

516
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 That's how they talk

517
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And that's a study and that might get in the way of say

518
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Yeah, but that could be a good study

519
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Because like you might want to know if there's a lot

520
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 So I think it was in Scandinavia somewhere

521
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 They heard a lot of like bubbles underneath the sea

522
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And they thought it might have been like a Russian submarine or something like that

523
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But it turned out to be herring communicating by farting to each other

524
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And if you hadn't done the study you wouldn't know that that was a thing

525
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 So probably saved World War II

526
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Russia and the whole world

527
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Okay, so that was a bad example

528
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Right

529
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 There are lots of studies that seem to be taking attention away

530
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So it's the idea that we forget as well

531
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Yes, so we might have cracked everything five years ago

532
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But just not noticed at the time

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And now we're carrying on and on with more studies

534
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And now we're carrying on and on with more studies

535
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And we do study some of our relevance

536
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I'm not we personally

537
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But the Royal Society of Chemistry

538
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Last year published 11 steps on how to make the perfect cup of tea

539
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Which definitively determined after releasing this paper

540
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That you are supposed to put the milk in first

541
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 To avoid de-napturation of the milk

542
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 We actually have big arguments in the queue

543
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I'm facing our hearts to make tea

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And I can sense a lot of anger

545
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Oh my god, that was the British League ever

546
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 There was a palpable...

547
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 It wasn't a hiss

548
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 It was an intake of bread, isn't it?

549
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I think we all felt that

550
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 So I am with the bread intake

551
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Because I obviously think that was a travesty

552
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 So just to dress you got the milk in first

553
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 But that is what they say, that's the safer way to do it

554
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 It's also explained in this study

555
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Three more tea deaths in World War II

556
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So the single most downloaded paper in the history of the journal

557
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Is it PLOS?

558
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Mets and PLOS?

559
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Is the 2005 paper

560
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Why most published research findings are false?

561
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 That's quite good, isn't it?

562
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 So there's a guy who's written a lot of studies about falsehoods in science

563
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And his name is John Ioanidis

564
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And as a boy, he was already doing research on research

565
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 As it were, he was doing meta-research

566
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And when he was a child, he came up with a love numbers system

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 To work out how affectionate he was about his own family

568
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And he said, "My mother was getting a thousand and twenty four point four two

569
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 My grandmother, 173.73

570
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It's not amazing

571
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Yeah, he said basically that all the statistics in all these papers are a bit dubious

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 But then a lot of people who said actually his statistics are a bit dubious as well

573
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 So yeah, controversial

574
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 It is certainly, sorry, I assume he was talking about publication bias

575
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So the publication bias is a major problem in scientific studies, isn't it?

576
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Because the only positive results tend to be published

577
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And about 90% of studies that are done actually yield negative results

578
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Which aren't as headline-grabbing

579
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And there are journals now which are like the journal of negative results

580
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Which is just people who have done experiments and gone

581
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 We found nothing

582
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Nothing has been achieved here

583
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And there's also a guy called Mark Shrym at Harvard who wanted to see how easy it would be to get something published

584
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And so he published an article

585
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And he made one up using randomtextgenerator.com

586
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And the article was called "Cuckoo for Coco Puffs"

587
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And it was by Pinkerton A. LeBrain and Orson Wells

588
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And he submitted it to 37 journals over two weeks and it was accepted by 17 of them

589
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Wow!

590
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Pinkerton A. LeBrain

591
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 It's an ominative determinism isn't it? Cause you know you have a name like LeBrain

592
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 You're going to be a scientist

593
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 There's a journal called Brain, isn't it? Do you remember that?

594
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 There's a journal called Brain and there's a guy who used to be the head of Brain who was called Head

595
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And we had it was

596
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And then he left Brain

597
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And then when he left being the head of Brain, Head was replaced as the head of Brain by a guy called Brain

598
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 There's a website called "Retraction Watch" which is fun because they pay attention to people quietly retracting their research when it turns out to be wrong

599
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Oh wow

600
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 That is done

601
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Yeah, it was set up by these two journalists called Ivan Oranski and Adam Marcus and their absolute heroes

602
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And the top one or two retraction holders are both anesthesiologists for what it's worth

603
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 One scientist in Japan who has had to retract 183 papers out of 212

604
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Oh wow, so publishing him is so much

605
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But his name is Captain Orson, it's the way it's used

606
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 It must be right

607
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So I went on to DailyMail.co.uk and searched for according to a recent study

608
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 If there weren't two then he wouldn't be

609
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And here were the first five things I found

610
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And even sharks can be shy according to a new study

611
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 We have covered on the podcast that sharks can have friends

612
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 So that's not...

613
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 That's not gonna be a shy shot

614
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And study reveals the tactics we use to avoid being head on the low

615
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Oh, that's great

616
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Any test for them? Any test? They only read the headlines so...

617
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Another one was bump in the night, send in the wife

618
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 One in five men pretend to be asleep when hearing a possible intruder

619
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Fortunately, it's always always furniture

620
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 But they haven't placed safely by the wall

621
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 We're gonna have to be born

622
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 We're gonna have to be born

623
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Okay, one more thing, I look to other things that there's too many of

624
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And there was a study done

625
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 It said three quarters of viewers of television have cited confusion over the proliferation of choice

626
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 As the reason they miss shows

627
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 As in there's so many channels they always miss TV shows

628
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It's just flicking desperately between them and they can't find the right one

629
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 So I had a look at all the different channels on my TV system on Sky

630
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And I found one which I'd never seen before

631
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It's pavershoes.tv

632
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And it's Sky Channel 669

633
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And their programs include

634
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Sensational sandals

635
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Or pretty impumps

636
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And classic clogs

637
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Sounds like the best shot I've ever done

638
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 You know I'm a Q-I on this

639
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 That's great

640
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 That's 669

641
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Put it in the UK at 667

642
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 That's a shoe size trophy

643
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 All right, we're gonna have to move on to our final facts

644
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 How did the shoe material go on?

645
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 (Laughter)

646
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Typical final fact of the evening that is James

647
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Okay, my fact is that you should never pick up a desert tortoise

648
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 If you do, it can pee itself to death

649
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 (Laughter)

650
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Yeah, so what they do is they store urine in the bladder

651
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Which they can then draw upon because they live in the desert

652
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 So they need as much water as they can get

653
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And if you pick them up, they can get so scared

654
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 That they will evacuate their bladder

655
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 As they wet themselves

656
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And then they can die of dehydration

657
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Because they keep

658
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Something like 40% of their body mass

659
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Is kept as the urine

660
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 That then translates into a sort of like rehydrated water

661
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Not rehydrated

662
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 It's really really diluted I think

663
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 So it's not too acidic or it doesn't damage them

664
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 But it's just a way that something can live in the desert

665
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 But obviously then they don't expect people to just come and pick them up

666
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And then they die

667
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 But yeah, desert tortoises, pretty cool

668
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 They live around the Las Vegas area, around the bladder, around that

669
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 They dig basins to catch rainwater

670
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Another way they get water

671
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And they always know where they are

672
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Whatever it looks like, it's gonna rain

673
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 They're always found next to these places

674
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 That they've dug waiting for the water to come

675
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 So they can immediately drink it

676
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And weirdly, this is really strange

677
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Humans are not so likely to die

678
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 When they're in the children or teenagers

679
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Or whatever and you get more likely to die as you get older

680
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 But weirdly, desert tortoises

681
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 They are less likely to die

682
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 As the time goes on

683
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 The older they get, the less likely they are to die

684
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Yeah, so that's why they live for so long

685
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 That's true of these places

686
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 One was so old, I read this in

687
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Apparently there's a bit of contention about whether or not this is true or not

688
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 But one of Dara...

689
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 What we do is we'll cut that out

690
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And put it at the start of every fight

691
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Basically there was a tortoise called Harriet

692
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Which belonged to Charles Darwin

693
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 So the contentionist bit is did that belong to Charles Darwin

694
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 They're not fully sure

695
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 But Harriet had a bit of a travelled life after Darwin

696
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Or whoever got her

697
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Ended up in Australia Zoo

698
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And ended up being looked after by Steve Irwin

699
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 So Steve Irwin and Charles Darwin

700
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Are connected within one lifetime

701
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Wow, yeah that is pretty good

702
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 There was a tortoise called

703
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 There was a tortoise called Adweiter

704
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Who lived to the age of 255

705
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And that meant that this tortoise was born before the USA existed

706
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And the death was announced on CNN

707
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Wow

708
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 So there's some quite good footage of

709
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 A tortoise is living each other's buns like dogs

710
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Because they secrete pheromones from like the Chloacher of that area

711
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And there's quite good footage of a female tortoise

712
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Crawling over a lettuce

713
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And then secreasing her scent as she goes

714
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And then a male tortoise really enthusiastically trying to have sex with the lettuce

715
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Because we see

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Wow

717
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Lettuce was used to... they did think it was an aphrodisiap

718
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Didn't they? In ancient Egypt

719
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Tortuses and people did yeah

720
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 It's because they used to grow quite tall

721
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 They used to have wild lettuce

722
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Which was really tall

723
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And it wasn't like a normal boring modern lettuce

724
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 It was quite exciting

725
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And it's secrete in a white sap

726
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 It's secrete in a white sap

727
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And it tasted peppery and it was, yeah

728
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And it was a stem and it's secrete, you know

729
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Lettuce used to be better

730
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Apparently tortoises can use touch screen

731
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Technology now

732
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 They could touch things

733
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Because no, because they found

734
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 They found that tortoises are actually a lot more clever than they believe them to be originally

735
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 For example, in mazes, they're fantastic in mazes

736
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 They can remember multiple destinations in one single route

737
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Which often rats can't do

738
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And now they're teaching them to use touch screen technology to

739
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 To create spotify lists

740
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 To create spotify lists

741
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 To create music

742
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Because they've got great taste of music

743
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Captain Orson published in his recent paper

744
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 I haven't seen the retraction list, I don't know if it was in that

745
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 But he, so if they need more food

746
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And they give them grapes and apples and stuff

747
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 They press the right button

748
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 That highlights itself

749
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 So they go into a card of

750
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And just

751
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Wild lettuce

752
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Wild lettuce

753
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Oh, by the way

754
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Apparently, so I've always been confused

755
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Between what a tortoise and a turtle is

756
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Oh yeah

757
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And so I'm just going to say in case

758
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Everyone here doesn't know the difference

759
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 But a tortoise has feet

760
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And a turtle has flippers

761
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 So now we know

762
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 That's a very good wave

763
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I thought they should have been called ninja tortoises

764
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Because they have feet

765
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Oh yeah

766
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 God, I think you've redeemed yourself with your eyes

767
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 What was amazing about that was it took ages for everyone to go

768
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 It's dumb, is it?

769
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Definitely sound it

770
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 So on ways of staying hydrated in the desert

771
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Where there's no water and no rain

772
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 There are lots of very cool ways of doing it

773
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 So there are some beetles

774
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Which when night is just turning it today

775
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 They stand very still and they let fog condense on their bodies

776
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And then they can drink it because it slowly coalesces onto them

777
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And then they have enough water

778
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 To get them through the day

779
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And then the beetles

780
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Is fogstown beetles

781
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Someone thought that was the best name on that day that they could come up with

782
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Every time you see animals and their names

783
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's always like

784
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 There's a tortoise called the big headed tortoise

785
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Like that was a fairies in all creative metres

786
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Well he told me it was the best tortoise ever

787
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Some other tortoise names while we're here

788
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 The pancake tortoise

789
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 The geometric tortoise

790
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 The impressed tortoise

791
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Who hangs around with the big head tortoise I guess

792
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And this guy I really like him

793
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 The wolf volcano giant tortoise

794
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 It just sounds like the four best things

795
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Yeah

796
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 He's got a really good PR manager

797
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Other ways of

798
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 So other desert animals that have like good ways of storing their water

799
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 So road runners urinate out their eyes

800
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 What?

801
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Like they cannot see that in the cartoon

802
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 It's how they excrete their salt

803
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Because you use up a lot of water

804
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 You lose a lot of water when you urinate

805
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 So they just lose it through their eyes

806
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Also mountain goats you've got to be really careful now

807
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Apparently in there is mountain goats like in North America

808
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Because they really like human urine

809
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Because they realise they don't have a natural salt

810
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 A natural thing they eat that provides them with their salt

811
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But they have worked out that mountain is

812
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 We and that has salt in it

813
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And so they will spot human

814
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Mountain ears and follow them until they go to take away

815
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And then they will sometimes

816
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 More of them

817
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And attempt to eat drinks there

818
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Oh god

819
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Excretion, yeah you've got to look out

820
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Where do they more?

821
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 No I don't know where

822
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Don't turtles pee through their mouth

823
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Sometimes pee through their mouth

824
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And there are some uh the Fitzroy River turtle

825
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Breeze through his amus

826
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 It's a really cool turtle

827
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 It's Australian I think and um yeah it is

828
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 It's in the Fitzroy River

829
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And it lives in water which has a lot of oxygen in it

830
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And um it's uh it's clowical orifice

831
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Goes two thirds of the way along it

832
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And it gets 68% of his oxygen through his bottom

833
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Wow

834
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Did you know a tart ice was once the fastest animal in the world

835
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 No it wasn't

836
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 He really was

837
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Are you talking I can I guess

838
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Would you tell it?

839
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 No is it the space thing?

840
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 It is the space thing

841
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 It looks like we're gonna big edit turtles in the room

842
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 I'm very close

843
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 This was in 1968

844
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 And the um Soviet sent out a spaceship with um

845
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 From Kazakhstan with a tortoise on it

846
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And it was the first animal in deep space

847
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 And it travelled around the moon before returning to earth

848
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Seven days later so for that shot about the time

849
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 It was the fastest animal in the world

850
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 There were also wine flies, mealworms

851
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And a few other things but that was the main one

852
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 That was the headline grabber wasn't it?

853
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 No mealworms

854
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I was there too

855
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 But they were the first life forms as well

856
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 To get around to the moon

857
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 So your fact was about things wetting themselves in a way

858
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And we don't know why

859
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 There's no evolutionary reason why a lot of animals wet themselves

860
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 When they're afraid and it's really weird

861
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 But when they're being chased by lions

862
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Not reasonable

863
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Well one theory is that it might like send the lions off

864
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Because they have to send somewhere else

865
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 I think that's one theory

866
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 But don't they surely they chase the scent until they reach the bottom

867
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 So you pee and then the lion will stop and go

868
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Oh there's a smell of gazelle pee there

869
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 And then I mean that's just one theory

870
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 What is with humans when you get shocked I think is

871
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Like somehow your brain gets overridden by the shock

872
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And normally your brain is like you always want to pee

873
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And your brain is saying no don't pee on stage

874
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 But you're shocked so much that you end up wetting yourself

875
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 It's weird there's a bit of the brain called the pontine micurition centre

876
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Which is constantly saying let's go let's do it

877
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Really yeah when you're bladder is full

878
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 It makes the decision to empty the bladder

879
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And then but the prefrontal cortex always overrides the desire

880
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 But when you get really really really stressed

881
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 The limbic system overrides the prefrontal cortex

882
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And so the signals get confused

883
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And then you know it's like

884
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 It's all cold and you're ashamed

885
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 But we don't know why

886
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 It's long to stand off with

887
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 And we're going to have to wrap up

888
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Okay well I think

889
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Okay so there was a guy whose taught us had a swollen penis

890
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And he didn't have the money to pay for the operation

891
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And so he went on to one of these kickstart style things

892
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And he needed 200 pounds

893
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 And he reached his target in less than 24 hours

894
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 And he went over he went up to 555 pounds

895
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 And he ended up to 555 pounds in the end people like really club together

896
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 And paid for it

897
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And when you gave your money you could put a little note about what you wanted to say

898
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And one person said

899
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 "I hope he gets the report done soon

900
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 I know what it's like having it in large penis"

901
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 That is not so nice

902
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 But at least he gave some money

903
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 So we have that totals doing well

904
