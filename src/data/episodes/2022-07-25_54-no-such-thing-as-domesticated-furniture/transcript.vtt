00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 [Bell]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [Bell]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [Applause]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 [Applause]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 [Applause]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 [Applause]

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 [Bell]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Welcome to another episode

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 in Central London, my name is Dad Shriver

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 and Anne Chazinski

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 and in no particular order

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 here we go

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 starting with you, Andy Murray

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 My thing this week is that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 when you have a tattoo lasered off

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 you end up pooing it out

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 [Laughter]

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 So that happens

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Does it still have the same design on the floor?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 [Laughter]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 So yeah, this happens

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 So when you have a tattoo

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 it goes into the middle layer of the skin

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 which is called the dermis

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 and when it's lasered off

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 the beams of like they heat up the ink

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 and it breaks down into tiny particles

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 and those go into the bloodstream

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 and then they are excreted via the liver

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and the digestive system

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 and that's how they get out of you

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 I just think that's amazing

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 That says something about how little you want the tattoo anymore

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 doesn't it?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 So do you know what tattoos are made out of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 like the ink? Do you know where that comes from?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Okay, well there was a lady on Facebook

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 who got a tattoo

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 a vegan on her inner lip

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 and then her friends pointed out

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 that actually most black ink of tattoos

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 is made from burnt animal bones

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 [Laughter]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Oh god

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 she's going to see that every time she looks in the mirror

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Every time she eats anything

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Yeah, that's the worst part

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 You can get vegan tattoos

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 but they're very rare

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Indeed, right

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 The oldest tattoo we know of is on a lip, isn't it?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 A tattoo of a thin pencil moustache

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 [Laughter]

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 tattooed onto the upper lip

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 of a 7,000 year old mummy

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 from Chile

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 What, like a little French kind of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 I'm not sure if it has the gap down the middle

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 that a pencil moustache is supposed to have

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Do they have to have the gap down the middle?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 No, I'm not sure

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 I think somebody's never been able to grow a moustache

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 I don't know, damn

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 It's not a moustache

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Yeah, my grandmother has tattooed eyebrows

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 It's a huge heart

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 [Laughter]

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Does she, like, permanently look surprised?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I don't know where her

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 original eyebrows went though

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 That's what I don't know

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Did she poo them out?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 I do think you're going to say a grandmother had a thin pencil moustache

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 [Laughter]

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Kind of a cruising to share

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 So the thing on tattoos being quite sort of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 the stereotype of them being for sailors

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 or for criminals

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 or whatever it is

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 The headline tattoos are not just for sailors anymore

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 has appeared in print every decade

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 since the mid 19th century

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Every decade, there's the rash of articles

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 saying they've entered the mainstream

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 So today more teachers

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 have their members of the armed forces

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 By 14% to 9%

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 But it used to be like 90% of sailors had tattoos

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Wasn't it?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Something like that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 The 19th century probably

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 One thing that it was good for was

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 it meant that you could identify a sailor who had drowned

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 because you'd be able to identify them by their tattoos

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 and they were actually used

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 in that way

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 So you could tell that he had a tattoo that said

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 "I have drowned"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 He has a lot of tattoos

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 The first one says "help"

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 The third one says "bubbubble"

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And the other thing that they thought the sailors

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 is if you had hold tattooed on your knuckles on one hand

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 and fast on the other hand

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 then it would help you hold on to ropes better

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Well we, you could stop drowning

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 as a sailor apparently

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 was to have a pig tattooed on your knee

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 and then a cock

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 as in a wrist, a tattooed on your right leg somewhere

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 and they had the saying

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 that was "pig on the knee"

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 "save it see a cock on the right never lose a fight"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 So this is what those animals can swim

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 or fight very well

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Speaking of cocks and tattoos

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Yeah God

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Sometimes when I want to find out some facts for this show

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 I'll go back to the old QI topboards

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 and see what I wrote in the past

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 and I touched the tattoos

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 and I found something that Dan posted in 2005

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 and this is what he said

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 He said "I was told today

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 that if a man was to have a tattoo done on his penis

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 then he was entitled to three tattoos

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 for the rest of his life

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 from anywhere in the world

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 in any tattooing power

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 No questions asked

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 This is what used to pass the QI research back in the day

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 So I have a confession

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 It's not just my grandmother with a tattoo

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Well I had a look

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 and there are one or two tattoo parlors

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 that will claim that they will do that

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 whether they will or not

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 I don't know but it's not everyone in the world all the time

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 It's a very difficult thing to Google by the way

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 But very easy to Google, it's very difficult to forget

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 I shouldn't have gotten Google images really for that

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 But I found a story about a 21-year-old from Iran

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 who paid a tattoo artist to put the letter "M" for his girlfriend's last name

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 and the Persian phrase for "Good luck with your journeys"

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 on his penis

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 and he fell pain for eight days

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 and then his penis became permanently semi erect

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 so he couldn't get it to go down

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 He lived with it

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 and he didn't know what to do

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 He just became permanently semi erect

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 so he couldn't get it to go down

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 He lived with it for three months before getting medical help

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 and doctors tried shunting the penis

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 to drain excess blood

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Not sure what shunting

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And then it didn't work

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 and so the patient decided

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 he was fine with the condition

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 and declined further treatment

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Wow

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 So they were quite a high society thing

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 weren't they in the 19th century

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 and at the turn of so

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 in about 1900

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 New York newspaper estimator

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 that 75% of society ladies in New York had tattoos

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 75%

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 What kind of tattoos? Like practical ones

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 or

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 practical tattoos

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Don't back away

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Step up

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 You get medical tattoos

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 and we think that some of the oldest tattoos ever

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 which are 5,000 years old

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 the 3,000 BC we found bodies

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 where there's a body in the house

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 which has tattoos over his joints

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 and they looked at the skeleton

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 and he had osteoarthritis in those joints

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 So it's like a kind of

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 That's what I meant by it actually

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 because the mercury astronauts are apparently as well

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 No, no, no, but I looked into

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 whether or not astronauts had any tattoos

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 You're like I'm saying a lot of things

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 that it's just me agreeing with

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 mercury astronauts

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 They would have them

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 in just like sensor locations

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 basically for whenever they had to monitor their health

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 so they knew where they were

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Kind of like putting a bit of tape on the ground

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 as a mark for an actor

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 There was a guy who's arrested

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 by Canada's border services agency

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 with the letters H-A-T-E

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 on his knuckles

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 and he claimed that it stood far

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 through eternity

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 That's very good

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Quick thinking

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 One moment used to an internet translation to

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 translate "I Love David" into Hebrew

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 She later discovered

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 she inadvertently had the phrase

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 "Babylon is the world's leading dictionary

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 and translation software"

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 on her back

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Forever

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 But she doesn't have a free account with Babylon forever

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 David Beckham has

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Victoria Beckham's name miss belt

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 tattooed on his body in Hindi

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Oh dear

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Samantha Cameron has a tattoo

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Yeah, she's cooler than all of us

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Hello, Dan's grandmother

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Sorry

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Is it a practical tattoo?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 It's a dolphin on her ankle

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Is that practical?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Yeah, that's cool

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Was that just a holiday that she took once

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 To a dolphin area?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 To a dolphin area

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Oh, just you go into that and you get a tattoo

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 No, I don't mean it's like

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Is anyone going to camera it?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 No, I'll go

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Quick tattoo that dolphin

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So I can live this memory forever

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 There's an American guy

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 who has over a thousand tattoos

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 based on Disney characters

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 including all 101 and 101 Dalmatians

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Which I don't

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 There must be tiny though

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 with the Dalmatians

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Well, obviously none of his life's size

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 But I mean

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 How many, to buy the single

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 The area of a body by a thousand is not much room you've got

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Yeah, so I mean I think it is to scale

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 But it is scaled down

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And he has a system

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 So he has all the evil characters

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 are below his knees

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 All the undersea characters are below his belly

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 So I don't know

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 But then all the evil characters are under the sea

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 So I don't know how he works that out

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Wow

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Anyway, he gets copyrighted by a Disney

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Like Disney's allowed him to do it

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Oh really? He's the only person

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Why is it illegal to do a Disney tattoo?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 I think when you've got that many of them

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 What would they do?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Make you put it out? Oh yeah

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 So if anyone has anything more than they want to add

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 On mistakes in tattoos

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 John Caru, who's a footballer? Yeah, John Caru

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 John Caru, he got a tattoo saying

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 He wanted to say my life, my rules

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 So he got Mavie Meeregler

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 But he got the accent wrong on regular

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 He got an acute accent instead of a grave one

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Which translates as my life, my menstruation

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 (Laughter)

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Okay, it's time for our second fact of the evening

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 And that fact is Chazinski's

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Yeah, my fact is that the man who invented the airship

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Used to hold dinner parties with ten-foot-high chairs

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So that his guests could experience the joy of flight

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 (Laughter)

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 This guy is amazing, presenting like Alberto Santos-Dumel

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And first of all, he decided to have hanging from the ceiling

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Which he could understand was more reminiscent of flight

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 But one of his first dinner parties

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 He put all his guests hanging from the ceiling

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And the ceiling collapsed

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 So he's...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 (Laughter)

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 So after all the funerals of the previous guests

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Weirdly, no one wanted to come to the next party

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 And the TV was fine

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 So the wake will be at mine, I've organised a nice dinner

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 (Laughter)

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Wow

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Yeah, he was great

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 He was an inventor, he grew up on a plantation in Brazil

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 And he invented a toy motor powered functioning aeroplane

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Which was quite a long time before

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 He invented in the late 19th century

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And then he moved to Paris and became a celebrity

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Because he invented the airship

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Which attracted attention

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And used to invite celebrities and royalty to his house

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 And have these wacky dinner parties

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And they'd have to mount their seats on ladders

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 (Laughter)

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Yeah, he was so famous in his time

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 At the time said, "When the names of all those

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Who have occupied outstanding positions in the world

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Have been forgotten

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 There will be a name which will remain in our memory

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 That of Santos Dumont

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 (Laughter)

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 He does sound like an amazing guy

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 He sounds unbelievable, actually

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 As in, he had his own airship in Paris

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 When no one else had any means of flight

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 He was just flying around the streets of Paris

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 He would just stop at a cafe

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Tether it

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 And then go down to the cafe

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 And say, "Well, so you like that, and fly off

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 It is in the late 19th century, early 20th century

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 He just did it

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 What was he tethering to

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 All right, rooftops

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Yeah, it wasn't huge, when you look at photos of it

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 It's not a massive airship

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 It's like the size of the one and one or the hoodie

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 There was one man airship, I think, a personal airship

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 He would go past ladies bedrooms

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And they would throw their underwear out of the window

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 (Laughter)

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 That's how famous he was

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 He was also super generous

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 So he was responsible for the first woman ever to take flight

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Because there was a princess

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 She was a princess of some foreign country

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Came to visit Paris, took an interest in his airship

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Said, "Wouldn't mine go up one of those?"

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And he taught her to fly one

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 And then he had her flying one through the streets of Paris

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 And he cycled blue shouting her instructions

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 And she did so

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 And this was the first woman to fly

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Wow, I actually, it sounds way worse to think of mentoring their underwear

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 At her

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Oh, Jesus!

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 He invented other things as well

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 I know the 10th of a chair, no one talks about it

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 No one mentions the 10th of a chair

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 We've all got one

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 And we've all got the motorised skis to get him back up and mounted

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Really? And he invented it a sling shot

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Which would throw life belts out from sinking ships

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 So that everyone could have a life belt

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 He also invented a racing airship

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Which was similar to his airship

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 But he never raced it because he had no one to race against

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 (Laughter)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 That is so sad

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 He could have just made two, couldn't he?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Can I bring it to dinner parties very quickly?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 I just want to talk about my favourite dinner party host

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 From History, which is William Buckland

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 He's a very exciting character

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 He studied fossils and he was a geologist

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 But he also went on this massive mission

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 To eat every single thing in the animal kingdom

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 He was just like "I need to have everything his favourite"

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 So if you went to his house for dinner

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 You would end up having things like Elephant's trunk

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Or mice on toast was his favourite thing

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And he knew food so like he knew animal food

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Everything about them so well

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 That he was once invited to go to this church

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Where they thought a saint's blood was on the ground of this church

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 And he came over there

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And he had a look at it and he was like

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Because it was just his patch on the ground of the heart's the saint's blood

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 He leaned down, he licked it

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 And he came back up and went

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 "I was about urine"

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 He just knew

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 But also the worst guest to have at a dinner party in that respect

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Because he went to this party which was Lord Harcourt

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 His the Archbishop of York

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 And at the dinner, Harcourt was like

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 "I've got this amazing relic that I want to show you all

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And he brought out what was the heart of Louis XVI in a box

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And within seconds Bucklinges grabbed it and he ate it"

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 But you say worse than he has ever

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Very few dinner hosts bring the heart of a dead king

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 To the table

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 I would say worse than a host ever

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Okay, here's another dinner party thing

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Though a christening of Louis XIV's grandson

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 He created a cake

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Sorry, there was a great chef called Antoine Karam

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Who created a cake

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 And the cake was made out of own paste

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Pastry and clockwork

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 And I loved clockwork

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 I love it so much

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 And it's so hard to get these days in paste trees

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Every Greg's I go into

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And they had clockwork

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Because this cake on top of it had a baby juke

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Entering the world through a marzipan vagina

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 That is quite a centipede system

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 So it was him

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 It was celebrating him

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 The child, yeah. It was a model of his mother

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Giving birth to him

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Yes, through a marzipan with clockwork

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Don't get thy Greg's to you

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 No, no, wow

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 I was reading that back in the day

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 When furniture was just suddenly being

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Introduced to the idea of us having it in our homes and stuff

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Wait, wait, wait

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 I know, so very excited

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 When furniture was being introduced

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 To the idea

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Of having it in our homes

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 It was a short for furniture

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 It wasn't domesticated until the 1500s

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 The beautiful days when

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 You know, freestanding shazes

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Were just roamed the belt

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Oh, come on

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 There are a wild chair these days

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 There are only

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 400 Louis Catoll's tables left in the wild

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Sorry, sorry don't come

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 I know that was my fact

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Apparently when we started introducing furniture

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Like covers would just be put in the middle of the room

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 As opposed to against the wall now

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And dinner tables

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 We didn't used to have legs to dinner tables

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 You would have people come and sit

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 If you were having a party

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 There would be a big board like this that you would bring out

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And you would put it on your legs

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So they would just be sat on your legs

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And that's why apparently there were boards

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 And you would be a border

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 And apparently borders who stay in your house

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 That would hold the table up

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Yeah, you'd hold the table up with your legs

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 I read this in Bill Bryson's book at home

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 He used to say that carpets

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Before we used to walk on them you just have them on your wall

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 And you'd go, "It's my carpet"

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And if you had a special guest

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And you'd take it down from the wall

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 And you'd put it for them to walk on

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 And chairs used to be against the walls

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 You would have chairs against the walls

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Because at night when you didn't have electricity

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 You would not trip over stuff in the middle of your room

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 But if you had chairs all over the shop

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 You should be asleep

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 They would get up halfway through the night wouldn't they?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Because people used to sleep in two different sections

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And they'd get up and have sex

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Or give it a crossword

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 You're very comfortable, aren't you?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Oh, we're going to have to move on

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Should we move on as anyone got anything else?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 I quite like the inactivity chair

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Which has recently been invented

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Which is a chair with only two legs

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And it is basically so that you live in fear while you sit on it

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And constantly be doing a balancing act

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 And I think the idea is that you can exercise

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 While also being seated but it sounds awful

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Anyway, invest in one if you're looking to improve your health

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 I always think I'm not afraid enough when I'm sitting down

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Stop the podcast

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 We have an emergency announcement to make

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 And this is it

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, I've no such thing as a fish

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Was produced with the help of Squarespace

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Which is that award-winning website builder

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 That has 24/7 support, e-commerce, beautiful templates

 It just makes it really easy to tell your story

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 However tedious, that story may be

 Okay, back to the podcast

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Okay, time for fact number three, that is my fact

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 My fact this week is that a new scientific study has concluded

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 That there are too many scientific studies

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 It's basically the study was saying that it's doing a thing now

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Where so many studies are coming out in science

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 That it's diminishing the attention that gets given to a actual good study

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Because it's drawing headlines away from them

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 And studies are going so sort of minute into these little...

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 I don't know, like

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 There's great ones that we've read in the past

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 That we've talked about in the office and stuff

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 A study that showed that the fish herring

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 That they fought

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 To communicate with each other

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 That's how they talk

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 And that's a study and that might get in the way of say

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Yeah, but that could be a good study

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Because like you might want to know if there's a lot

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So I think it was in Scandinavia somewhere

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 They heard a lot of like bubbles underneath the sea

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And they thought it might have been like a Russian submarine or something like that

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 But it turned out to be herring communicating by farting to each other

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And if you hadn't done the study you wouldn't know that that was a thing

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 So probably saved World War II

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Russia and the whole world

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Okay, so that was a bad example

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Right

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 There are lots of studies that seem to be taking attention away

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 So it's the idea that we forget as well

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Yes, so we might have cracked everything five years ago

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 But just not noticed at the time

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 And now we're carrying on and on with more studies

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And now we're carrying on and on with more studies

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 And we do study some of our relevance

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 I'm not we personally

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 But the Royal Society of Chemistry

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Last year published 11 steps on how to make the perfect cup of tea

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Which definitively determined after releasing this paper

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 That you are supposed to put the milk in first

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 To avoid de-napturation of the milk

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 We actually have big arguments in the queue

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 I'm facing our hearts to make tea

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And I can sense a lot of anger

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Oh my god, that was the British League ever

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 There was a palpable...

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 It wasn't a hiss

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 It was an intake of bread, isn't it?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 I think we all felt that

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 So I am with the bread intake

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Because I obviously think that was a travesty

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 So just to dress you got the milk in first

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 But that is what they say, that's the safer way to do it

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 It's also explained in this study

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Three more tea deaths in World War II

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 So the single most downloaded paper in the history of the journal

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Is it PLOS?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Mets and PLOS?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Is the 2005 paper

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Why most published research findings are false?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 That's quite good, isn't it?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 So there's a guy who's written a lot of studies about falsehoods in science

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 And his name is John Ioanidis

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And as a boy, he was already doing research on research

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 As it were, he was doing meta-research

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 And when he was a child, he came up with a love numbers system

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 To work out how affectionate he was about his own family

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 And he said, "My mother was getting a thousand and twenty four point four two

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 My grandmother, 173.73

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 It's not amazing

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Yeah, he said basically that all the statistics in all these papers are a bit dubious

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 But then a lot of people who said actually his statistics are a bit dubious as well

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 So yeah, controversial

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 It is certainly, sorry, I assume he was talking about publication bias

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 So the publication bias is a major problem in scientific studies, isn't it?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Because the only positive results tend to be published

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And about 90% of studies that are done actually yield negative results

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Which aren't as headline-grabbing

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And there are journals now which are like the journal of negative results

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Which is just people who have done experiments and gone

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 We found nothing

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Nothing has been achieved here

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 And there's also a guy called Mark Shrym at Harvard who wanted to see how easy it would be to get something published

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 And so he published an article

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 And he made one up using randomtextgenerator.com

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 And the article was called "Cuckoo for Coco Puffs"

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 And it was by Pinkerton A. LeBrain and Orson Wells

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 And he submitted it to 37 journals over two weeks and it was accepted by 17 of them

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Wow!

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Pinkerton A. LeBrain

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 It's an ominative determinism isn't it? Cause you know you have a name like LeBrain

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 You're going to be a scientist

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 There's a journal called Brain, isn't it? Do you remember that?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 There's a journal called Brain and there's a guy who used to be the head of Brain who was called Head

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 And we had it was

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 And then he left Brain

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And then when he left being the head of Brain, Head was replaced as the head of Brain by a guy called Brain

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 There's a website called "Retraction Watch" which is fun because they pay attention to people quietly retracting their research when it turns out to be wrong

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Oh wow

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 That is done

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Yeah, it was set up by these two journalists called Ivan Oranski and Adam Marcus and their absolute heroes

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 And the top one or two retraction holders are both anesthesiologists for what it's worth

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 One scientist in Japan who has had to retract 183 papers out of 212

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Oh wow, so publishing him is so much

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 But his name is Captain Orson, it's the way it's used

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 It must be right

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 So I went on to DailyMail.co.uk and searched for according to a recent study

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 If there weren't two then he wouldn't be

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 And here were the first five things I found

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 And even sharks can be shy according to a new study

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 We have covered on the podcast that sharks can have friends

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So that's not...

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 That's not gonna be a shy shot

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 And study reveals the tactics we use to avoid being head on the low

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Oh, that's great

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Any test for them? Any test? They only read the headlines so...

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Another one was bump in the night, send in the wife

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 One in five men pretend to be asleep when hearing a possible intruder

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Fortunately, it's always always furniture

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 But they haven't placed safely by the wall

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 We're gonna have to be born

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 We're gonna have to be born

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Okay, one more thing, I look to other things that there's too many of

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 And there was a study done

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 It said three quarters of viewers of television have cited confusion over the proliferation of choice

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 As the reason they miss shows

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 As in there's so many channels they always miss TV shows

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 It's just flicking desperately between them and they can't find the right one

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 So I had a look at all the different channels on my TV system on Sky

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 And I found one which I'd never seen before

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 It's pavershoes.tv

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 And it's Sky Channel 669

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 And their programs include

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Sensational sandals

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Or pretty impumps

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And classic clogs

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Sounds like the best shot I've ever done

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 You know I'm a Q-I on this

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 That's great

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 That's 669

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Put it in the UK at 667

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 That's a shoe size trophy

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 All right, we're gonna have to move on to our final facts

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 How did the shoe material go on?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 (Laughter)

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Typical final fact of the evening that is James

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Okay, my fact is that you should never pick up a desert tortoise

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 If you do, it can pee itself to death

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 (Laughter)

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Yeah, so what they do is they store urine in the bladder

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Which they can then draw upon because they live in the desert

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So they need as much water as they can get

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And if you pick them up, they can get so scared

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 That they will evacuate their bladder

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 As they wet themselves

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 And then they can die of dehydration

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Because they keep

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Something like 40% of their body mass

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Is kept as the urine

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 That then translates into a sort of like rehydrated water

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Not rehydrated

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 It's really really diluted I think

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 So it's not too acidic or it doesn't damage them

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 But it's just a way that something can live in the desert

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 But obviously then they don't expect people to just come and pick them up

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 And then they die

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 But yeah, desert tortoises, pretty cool

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 They live around the Las Vegas area, around the bladder, around that

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 They dig basins to catch rainwater

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Another way they get water

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 And they always know where they are

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Whatever it looks like, it's gonna rain

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 They're always found next to these places

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 That they've dug waiting for the water to come

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 So they can immediately drink it

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And weirdly, this is really strange

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Humans are not so likely to die

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 When they're in the children or teenagers

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Or whatever and you get more likely to die as you get older

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 But weirdly, desert tortoises

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 They are less likely to die

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 As the time goes on

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 The older they get, the less likely they are to die

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Yeah, so that's why they live for so long

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 That's true of these places

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 One was so old, I read this in

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Apparently there's a bit of contention about whether or not this is true or not

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 But one of Dara...

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 What we do is we'll cut that out

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 And put it at the start of every fight

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Basically there was a tortoise called Harriet

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Which belonged to Charles Darwin

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 So the contentionist bit is did that belong to Charles Darwin

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 They're not fully sure

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 But Harriet had a bit of a travelled life after Darwin

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Or whoever got her

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Ended up in Australia Zoo

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 And ended up being looked after by Steve Irwin

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 So Steve Irwin and Charles Darwin

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Are connected within one lifetime

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Wow, yeah that is pretty good

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 There was a tortoise called

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 There was a tortoise called Adweiter

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Who lived to the age of 255

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 And that meant that this tortoise was born before the USA existed

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 And the death was announced on CNN

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Wow

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 So there's some quite good footage of

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 A tortoise is living each other's buns like dogs

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Because they secrete pheromones from like the Chloacher of that area

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And there's quite good footage of a female tortoise

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Crawling over a lettuce

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And then secreasing her scent as she goes

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 And then a male tortoise really enthusiastically trying to have sex with the lettuce

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Because we see

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Wow

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Lettuce was used to... they did think it was an aphrodisiap

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Didn't they? In ancient Egypt

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Tortuses and people did yeah

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 It's because they used to grow quite tall

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 They used to have wild lettuce

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Which was really tall

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 And it wasn't like a normal boring modern lettuce

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 It was quite exciting

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And it's secrete in a white sap

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 It's secrete in a white sap

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And it tasted peppery and it was, yeah

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 And it was a stem and it's secrete, you know

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Lettuce used to be better

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Apparently tortoises can use touch screen

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Technology now

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 They could touch things

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Because no, because they found

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 They found that tortoises are actually a lot more clever than they believe them to be originally

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 For example, in mazes, they're fantastic in mazes

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 They can remember multiple destinations in one single route

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Which often rats can't do

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 And now they're teaching them to use touch screen technology to

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 To create spotify lists

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 To create spotify lists

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 To create music

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Because they've got great taste of music

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Captain Orson published in his recent paper

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 I haven't seen the retraction list, I don't know if it was in that

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 But he, so if they need more food

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 And they give them grapes and apples and stuff

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 They press the right button

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 That highlights itself

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 So they go into a card of

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 And just

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Wild lettuce

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Wild lettuce

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Oh, by the way

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Apparently, so I've always been confused

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Between what a tortoise and a turtle is

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Oh yeah

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 And so I'm just going to say in case

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Everyone here doesn't know the difference

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 But a tortoise has feet

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 And a turtle has flippers

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 So now we know

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 That's a very good wave

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 I thought they should have been called ninja tortoises

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Because they have feet

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Oh yeah

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 God, I think you've redeemed yourself with your eyes

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 What was amazing about that was it took ages for everyone to go

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 It's dumb, is it?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Definitely sound it

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 So on ways of staying hydrated in the desert

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Where there's no water and no rain

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 There are lots of very cool ways of doing it

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 So there are some beetles

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Which when night is just turning it today

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 They stand very still and they let fog condense on their bodies

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And then they can drink it because it slowly coalesces onto them

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 And then they have enough water

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 To get them through the day

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 And then the beetles

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Is fogstown beetles

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Someone thought that was the best name on that day that they could come up with

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Every time you see animals and their names

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 It's always like

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 There's a tortoise called the big headed tortoise

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Like that was a fairies in all creative metres

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Well he told me it was the best tortoise ever

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Some other tortoise names while we're here

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 The pancake tortoise

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 The geometric tortoise

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 The impressed tortoise

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Who hangs around with the big head tortoise I guess

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 And this guy I really like him

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 The wolf volcano giant tortoise

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 It just sounds like the four best things

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Yeah

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 He's got a really good PR manager

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Other ways of

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 So other desert animals that have like good ways of storing their water

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 So road runners urinate out their eyes

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 What?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Like they cannot see that in the cartoon

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 It's how they excrete their salt

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Because you use up a lot of water

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 You lose a lot of water when you urinate

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 So they just lose it through their eyes

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Also mountain goats you've got to be really careful now

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Apparently in there is mountain goats like in North America

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Because they really like human urine

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 Because they realise they don't have a natural salt

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 A natural thing they eat that provides them with their salt

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 But they have worked out that mountain is

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 We and that has salt in it

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And so they will spot human

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Mountain ears and follow them until they go to take away

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 And then they will sometimes

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 More of them

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 And attempt to eat drinks there

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Oh god

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Excretion, yeah you've got to look out

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Where do they more?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 No I don't know where

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Don't turtles pee through their mouth

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Sometimes pee through their mouth

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And there are some uh the Fitzroy River turtle

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Breeze through his amus

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 It's a really cool turtle

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 It's Australian I think and um yeah it is

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 It's in the Fitzroy River

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 And it lives in water which has a lot of oxygen in it

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 And um it's uh it's clowical orifice

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Goes two thirds of the way along it

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 And it gets 68% of his oxygen through his bottom

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Wow

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Did you know a tart ice was once the fastest animal in the world

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 No it wasn't

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 He really was

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Are you talking I can I guess

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Would you tell it?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 No is it the space thing?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 It is the space thing

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 It looks like we're gonna big edit turtles in the room

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 I'm very close

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 This was in 1968

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 And the um Soviet sent out a spaceship with um

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 From Kazakhstan with a tortoise on it

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 And it was the first animal in deep space

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 And it travelled around the moon before returning to earth

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Seven days later so for that shot about the time

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 It was the fastest animal in the world

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 There were also wine flies, mealworms

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 And a few other things but that was the main one

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 That was the headline grabber wasn't it?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 No mealworms

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 I was there too

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 But they were the first life forms as well

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 To get around to the moon

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 So your fact was about things wetting themselves in a way

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 And we don't know why

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 There's no evolutionary reason why a lot of animals wet themselves

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 When they're afraid and it's really weird

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 But when they're being chased by lions

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Not reasonable

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Well one theory is that it might like send the lions off

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Because they have to send somewhere else

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 I think that's one theory

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 But don't they surely they chase the scent until they reach the bottom

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 So you pee and then the lion will stop and go

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Oh there's a smell of gazelle pee there

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 And then I mean that's just one theory

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 What is with humans when you get shocked I think is

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Like somehow your brain gets overridden by the shock

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 And normally your brain is like you always want to pee

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 And your brain is saying no don't pee on stage

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 But you're shocked so much that you end up wetting yourself

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 It's weird there's a bit of the brain called the pontine micurition centre

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Which is constantly saying let's go let's do it

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 Really yeah when you're bladder is full

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 It makes the decision to empty the bladder

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 And then but the prefrontal cortex always overrides the desire

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 But when you get really really really stressed

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 The limbic system overrides the prefrontal cortex

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 And so the signals get confused

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 And then you know it's like

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 It's all cold and you're ashamed

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 But we don't know why

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 It's long to stand off with

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 And we're going to have to wrap up

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Okay well I think

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Okay so there was a guy whose taught us had a swollen penis

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 And he didn't have the money to pay for the operation

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 And so he went on to one of these kickstart style things

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 And he needed 200 pounds

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 And he reached his target in less than 24 hours

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 And he went over he went up to 555 pounds

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 And he ended up to 555 pounds in the end people like really club together

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 And paid for it

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 And when you gave your money you could put a little note about what you wanted to say

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 And one person said

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 "I hope he gets the report done soon

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 I know what it's like having it in large penis"

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 That is not so nice

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 But at least he gave some money

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 So we have that totals doing well

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 And we're going to have to wrap up

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 So that's it that's all of our facts

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
