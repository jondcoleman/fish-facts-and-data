00:00:22,00:00:24,Welcome to another episode
00:00:24,00:00:26,"No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:26,00:00:28,This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre
00:00:28,00:00:30,"in Central London, my name is Dad Shriver"
00:00:30,00:00:32,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray"
00:00:32,00:00:34,and Anne Chazinski
00:00:34,00:00:36,and once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:36,00:00:38,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:38,00:00:40,and in no particular order
00:00:40,00:00:42,here we go
00:00:42,00:00:44,"starting with you, Andy Murray"
00:00:44,00:00:46,My thing this week is that
00:00:46,00:00:48,when you have a tattoo lasered off
00:00:48,00:00:50,you end up pooing it out
00:00:50,00:00:54,[Laughter]
00:00:54,00:00:56,So that happens
00:00:56,00:00:58,Does it still have the same design on the floor?
00:00:58,00:01:00,[Laughter]
00:01:00,00:01:02,"So yeah, this happens"
00:01:02,00:01:04,So when you have a tattoo
00:01:04,00:01:06,it goes into the middle layer of the skin
00:01:06,00:01:08,which is called the dermis
00:01:08,00:01:10,and when it's lasered off
00:01:10,00:01:12,the beams of like they heat up the ink
00:01:12,00:01:14,and it breaks down into tiny particles
00:01:14,00:01:16,and those go into the bloodstream
00:01:16,00:01:18,and then they are excreted via the liver
00:01:18,00:01:20,and the digestive system
00:01:20,00:01:22,and that's how they get out of you
00:01:22,00:01:24,I just think that's amazing
00:01:24,00:01:26,That says something about how little you want the tattoo anymore
00:01:26,00:01:28,doesn't it?
00:01:28,00:01:30,So do you know what tattoos are made out of
00:01:30,00:01:32,like the ink? Do you know where that comes from?
00:01:32,00:01:34,"Okay, well there was a lady on Facebook"
00:01:34,00:01:36,who got a tattoo
00:01:36,00:01:38,a vegan on her inner lip
00:01:38,00:01:40,and then her friends pointed out
00:01:40,00:01:42,that actually most black ink of tattoos
00:01:42,00:01:44,is made from burnt animal bones
00:01:44,00:01:46,[Laughter]
00:01:46,00:01:48,Oh god
00:01:48,00:01:50,she's going to see that every time she looks in the mirror
00:01:50,00:01:52,Every time she eats anything
00:01:52,00:01:54,"Yeah, that's the worst part"
00:01:54,00:01:56,You can get vegan tattoos
00:01:56,00:01:58,but they're very rare
00:01:58,00:02:00,"Indeed, right"
00:02:00,00:02:02,"The oldest tattoo we know of is on a lip, isn't it?"
00:02:02,00:02:06,A tattoo of a thin pencil moustache
00:02:06,00:02:08,[Laughter]
00:02:08,00:02:10,tattooed onto the upper lip
00:02:10,00:02:12,"of a 7,000 year old mummy"
00:02:12,00:02:14,from Chile
00:02:14,00:02:16,"What, like a little French kind of"
00:02:16,00:02:18,I'm not sure if it has the gap down the middle
00:02:18,00:02:20,that a pencil moustache is supposed to have
00:02:20,00:02:22,Do they have to have the gap down the middle?
00:02:22,00:02:24,"No, I'm not sure"
00:02:24,00:02:28,I think somebody's never been able to grow a moustache
00:02:28,00:02:30,"I don't know, damn"
00:02:30,00:02:32,It's not a moustache
00:02:32,00:02:34,"Yeah, my grandmother has tattooed eyebrows"
00:02:34,00:02:36,It's a huge heart
00:02:36,00:02:38,[Laughter]
00:02:38,00:02:40,"Does she, like, permanently look surprised?"
00:02:40,00:02:42,I don't know where her
00:02:42,00:02:44,original eyebrows went though
00:02:44,00:02:46,That's what I don't know
00:02:46,00:02:48,Did she poo them out?
00:02:48,00:02:50,I do think you're going to say a grandmother had a thin pencil moustache
00:02:50,00:02:52,[Laughter]
00:02:52,00:02:54,Kind of a cruising to share
00:02:54,00:02:56,So the thing on tattoos being quite sort of
00:02:56,00:02:58,the stereotype of them being for sailors
00:02:58,00:03:00,or for criminals
00:03:00,00:03:02,or whatever it is
00:03:02,00:03:04,The headline tattoos are not just for sailors anymore
00:03:04,00:03:06,has appeared in print every decade
00:03:06,00:03:08,since the mid 19th century
00:03:08,00:03:10,"Every decade, there's the rash of articles"
00:03:10,00:03:12,saying they've entered the mainstream
00:03:12,00:03:14,So today more teachers
00:03:14,00:03:16,have their members of the armed forces
00:03:16,00:03:18,By 14% to 9%
00:03:18,00:03:20,But it used to be like 90% of sailors had tattoos
00:03:20,00:03:22,Wasn't it?
00:03:22,00:03:24,Something like that
00:03:24,00:03:26,The 19th century probably
00:03:26,00:03:28,One thing that it was good for was
00:03:28,00:03:30,it meant that you could identify a sailor who had drowned
00:03:30,00:03:32,because you'd be able to identify them by their tattoos
00:03:32,00:03:34,and they were actually used
00:03:34,00:03:36,in that way
00:03:36,00:03:38,So you could tell that he had a tattoo that said
00:03:38,00:03:40,"""I have drowned"""
00:03:40,00:03:42,He has a lot of tattoos
00:03:42,00:03:44,"The first one says ""help"""
00:03:44,00:03:48,"The third one says ""bubbubble"""
00:03:48,00:03:50,And the other thing that they thought the sailors
00:03:50,00:03:52,is if you had hold tattooed on your knuckles on one hand
00:03:52,00:03:54,and fast on the other hand
00:03:54,00:03:56,then it would help you hold on to ropes better
00:03:56,00:03:58,"Well we, you could stop drowning"
00:03:58,00:04:00,as a sailor apparently
00:04:00,00:04:02,was to have a pig tattooed on your knee
00:04:02,00:04:04,and then a cock
00:04:04,00:04:06,"as in a wrist, a tattooed on your right leg somewhere"
00:04:06,00:04:08,and they had the saying
00:04:08,00:04:10,"that was ""pig on the knee"""
00:04:10,00:04:12,"""save it see a cock on the right never lose a fight"""
00:04:12,00:04:14,So this is what those animals can swim
00:04:14,00:04:16,or fight very well
00:04:16,00:04:18,Speaking of cocks and tattoos
00:04:18,00:04:20,Yeah God
00:04:20,00:04:24,Sometimes when I want to find out some facts for this show
00:04:24,00:04:26,I'll go back to the old QI topboards
00:04:26,00:04:28,and see what I wrote in the past
00:04:28,00:04:30,and I touched the tattoos
00:04:30,00:04:32,and I found something that Dan posted in 2005
00:04:32,00:04:34,and this is what he said
00:04:34,00:04:36,"He said ""I was told today"
00:04:36,00:04:38,that if a man was to have a tattoo done on his penis
00:04:38,00:04:40,then he was entitled to three tattoos
00:04:40,00:04:42,for the rest of his life
00:04:42,00:04:44,from anywhere in the world
00:04:44,00:04:46,in any tattooing power
00:04:46,00:04:48,No questions asked
00:04:48,00:04:52,This is what used to pass the QI research back in the day
00:04:52,00:04:54,So I have a confession
00:04:54,00:04:56,It's not just my grandmother with a tattoo
00:04:56,00:04:58,Well I had a look
00:04:58,00:05:00,and there are one or two tattoo parlors
00:05:00,00:05:02,that will claim that they will do that
00:05:02,00:05:04,whether they will or not
00:05:04,00:05:06,I don't know but it's not everyone in the world all the time
00:05:06,00:05:08,It's a very difficult thing to Google by the way
00:05:08,00:05:10,"But very easy to Google, it's very difficult to forget"
00:05:10,00:05:12,I shouldn't have gotten Google images really for that
00:05:12,00:05:14,But I found a story about a 21-year-old from Iran
00:05:14,00:05:18,"who paid a tattoo artist to put the letter ""M"" for his girlfriend's last name"
00:05:18,00:05:20,"and the Persian phrase for ""Good luck with your journeys"""
00:05:20,00:05:22,on his penis
00:05:22,00:05:24,and he fell pain for eight days
00:05:24,00:05:28,and then his penis became permanently semi erect
00:05:28,00:05:30,so he couldn't get it to go down
00:05:30,00:05:32,He lived with it
00:05:32,00:05:34,and he didn't know what to do
00:05:34,00:05:38,He just became permanently semi erect
00:05:38,00:05:40,so he couldn't get it to go down
00:05:40,00:05:42,He lived with it for three months before getting medical help
00:05:42,00:05:44,and doctors tried shunting the penis
00:05:44,00:05:46,to drain excess blood
00:05:46,00:05:48,Not sure what shunting
00:05:48,00:05:50,And then it didn't work
00:05:50,00:05:52,and so the patient decided
00:05:52,00:05:54,he was fine with the condition
00:05:54,00:05:56,and declined further treatment
00:05:56,00:05:58,Wow
00:05:58,00:06:00,So they were quite a high society thing
00:06:00,00:06:02,weren't they in the 19th century
00:06:02,00:06:04,and at the turn of so
00:06:04,00:06:06,in about 1900
00:06:06,00:06:08,New York newspaper estimator
00:06:08,00:06:12,that 75% of society ladies in New York had tattoos
00:06:12,00:06:14,75%
00:06:14,00:06:16,What kind of tattoos? Like practical ones
00:06:16,00:06:18,or
00:06:18,00:06:20,practical tattoos
00:06:20,00:06:22,Don't back away
00:06:22,00:06:24,Step up
00:06:24,00:06:26,You get medical tattoos
00:06:26,00:06:28,and we think that some of the oldest tattoos ever
00:06:28,00:06:30,"which are 5,000 years old"
00:06:30,00:06:32,"the 3,000 BC we found bodies"
00:06:32,00:06:34,where there's a body in the house
00:06:34,00:06:36,which has tattoos over his joints
00:06:36,00:06:38,and they looked at the skeleton
00:06:38,00:06:40,and he had osteoarthritis in those joints
00:06:40,00:06:50,So it's like a kind of
00:06:50,00:06:52,That's what I meant by it actually
00:06:52,00:06:54,because the mercury astronauts are apparently as well
00:06:54,00:06:56,"No, no, no, but I looked into"
00:06:56,00:06:58,whether or not astronauts had any tattoos
00:06:58,00:07:00,You're like I'm saying a lot of things
00:07:00,00:07:02,that it's just me agreeing with
00:07:02,00:07:04,mercury astronauts
00:07:04,00:07:06,They would have them
00:07:06,00:07:08,in just like sensor locations
00:07:08,00:07:10,basically for whenever they had to monitor their health
00:07:10,00:07:12,so they knew where they were
00:07:12,00:07:14,Kind of like putting a bit of tape on the ground
00:07:14,00:07:16,as a mark for an actor
00:07:16,00:07:18,There was a guy who's arrested
00:07:18,00:07:20,by Canada's border services agency
00:07:20,00:07:22,with the letters H-A-T-E
00:07:22,00:07:24,on his knuckles
00:07:24,00:07:26,and he claimed that it stood far
00:07:26,00:07:28,through eternity
00:07:28,00:07:32,That's very good
00:07:32,00:07:34,Quick thinking
00:07:34,00:07:36,One moment used to an internet translation to
00:07:36,00:07:38,"translate ""I Love David"" into Hebrew"
00:07:38,00:07:40,She later discovered
00:07:40,00:07:42,she inadvertently had the phrase
00:07:42,00:07:44,"""Babylon is the world's leading dictionary"
00:07:44,00:07:46,"and translation software"""
00:07:46,00:07:48,on her back
00:07:48,00:07:50,Forever
00:07:54,00:07:58,But she doesn't have a free account with Babylon forever
00:07:58,00:08:02,David Beckham has
00:08:02,00:08:04,Victoria Beckham's name miss belt
00:08:04,00:08:06,tattooed on his body in Hindi
00:08:06,00:08:08,Oh dear
00:08:08,00:08:10,Samantha Cameron has a tattoo
00:08:10,00:08:12,"Yeah, she's cooler than all of us"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"Hello, Dan's grandmother"
00:08:14,00:08:16,Sorry
00:08:16,00:08:18,Is it a practical tattoo?
00:08:18,00:08:20,It's a dolphin on her ankle
00:08:20,00:08:22,Is that practical?
00:08:22,00:08:24,"Yeah, that's cool"
00:08:24,00:08:26,Was that just a holiday that she took once
00:08:26,00:08:28,To a dolphin area?
00:08:28,00:08:30,To a dolphin area
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Oh, just you go into that and you get a tattoo"
00:08:32,00:08:34,"No, I don't mean it's like"
00:08:34,00:08:36,Is anyone going to camera it?
00:08:36,00:08:36,"No, I'll go"
00:08:36,00:08:38,Quick tattoo that dolphin
00:08:38,00:08:40,So I can live this memory forever
00:08:40,00:08:44,There's an American guy
00:08:44,00:08:46,who has over a thousand tattoos
00:08:46,00:08:48,based on Disney characters
00:08:48,00:08:50,including all 101 and 101 Dalmatians
00:08:50,00:08:52,Which I don't
00:08:52,00:08:54,There must be tiny though
00:08:54,00:08:56,with the Dalmatians
00:08:56,00:08:58,"Well, obviously none of his life's size"
00:08:58,00:09:00,But I mean
00:09:00,00:09:02,"How many, to buy the single"
00:09:02,00:09:04,The area of a body by a thousand is not much room you've got
00:09:04,00:09:06,"Yeah, so I mean I think it is to scale"
00:09:06,00:09:08,But it is scaled down
00:09:08,00:09:10,And he has a system
00:09:10,00:09:12,So he has all the evil characters
00:09:12,00:09:14,are below his knees
00:09:14,00:09:16,All the undersea characters are below his belly
00:09:16,00:09:18,So I don't know
00:09:18,00:09:20,But then all the evil characters are under the sea
00:09:20,00:09:22,So I don't know how he works that out
00:09:22,00:09:24,Wow
00:09:24,00:09:26,"Anyway, he gets copyrighted by a Disney"
00:09:26,00:09:28,Like Disney's allowed him to do it
00:09:28,00:09:30,Oh really? He's the only person
00:09:30,00:09:32,Why is it illegal to do a Disney tattoo?
00:09:32,00:09:34,I think when you've got that many of them
00:09:34,00:09:36,What would they do?
00:09:36,00:09:38,Make you put it out? Oh yeah
00:09:38,00:09:40,We're going to have to move on to our next fact
00:09:40,00:09:42,So if anyone has anything more than they want to add
00:09:42,00:09:44,On mistakes in tattoos
00:09:44,00:09:48,"John Caru, who's a footballer? Yeah, John Caru"
00:09:48,00:09:50,"John Caru, he got a tattoo saying"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"He wanted to say my life, my rules"
00:09:52,00:09:54,So he got Mavie Meeregler
00:09:54,00:09:56,But he got the accent wrong on regular
00:09:56,00:09:58,He got an acute accent instead of a grave one
00:09:58,00:10:02,"Which translates as my life, my menstruation"
00:10:02,00:10:10,(Laughter)
00:10:10,00:10:12,"Okay, it's time for our second fact of the evening"
00:10:12,00:10:14,And that fact is Chazinski's
00:10:14,00:10:18,"Yeah, my fact is that the man who invented the airship"
00:10:18,00:10:22,Used to hold dinner parties with ten-foot-high chairs
00:10:22,00:10:26,So that his guests could experience the joy of flight
00:10:26,00:10:28,(Laughter)
00:10:28,00:10:30,"This guy is amazing, presenting like Alberto Santos-Dumel"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"And first of all, he decided to have hanging from the ceiling"
00:10:32,00:10:34,Which he could understand was more reminiscent of flight
00:10:34,00:10:36,But one of his first dinner parties
00:10:36,00:10:38,He put all his guests hanging from the ceiling
00:10:38,00:10:40,And the ceiling collapsed
00:10:40,00:10:42,So he's...
00:10:42,00:10:44,(Laughter)
00:10:44,00:10:46,So after all the funerals of the previous guests
00:10:46,00:10:48,"Weirdly, no one wanted to come to the next party"
00:10:48,00:10:50,And the TV was fine
00:10:50,00:10:52,"So the wake will be at mine, I've organised a nice dinner"
00:10:52,00:10:54,(Laughter)
00:10:54,00:10:56,Wow
00:10:56,00:10:58,"Yeah, he was great"
00:10:58,00:11:02,"He was an inventor, he grew up on a plantation in Brazil"
00:11:02,00:11:06,And he invented a toy motor powered functioning aeroplane
00:11:06,00:11:08,Which was quite a long time before
00:11:08,00:11:10,He invented in the late 19th century
00:11:10,00:11:12,And then he moved to Paris and became a celebrity
00:11:12,00:11:14,Because he invented the airship
00:11:14,00:11:16,Which attracted attention
00:11:16,00:11:18,And used to invite celebrities and royalty to his house
00:11:18,00:11:20,And have these wacky dinner parties
00:11:20,00:11:22,And they'd have to mount their seats on ladders
00:11:22,00:11:24,(Laughter)
00:11:24,00:11:26,"Yeah, he was so famous in his time"
00:11:26,00:11:28,"At the time said, ""When the names of all those"
00:11:28,00:11:30,Who have occupied outstanding positions in the world
00:11:30,00:11:32,Have been forgotten
00:11:32,00:11:34,There will be a name which will remain in our memory
00:11:34,00:11:36,That of Santos Dumont
00:11:36,00:11:38,(Laughter)
00:11:38,00:11:40,He does sound like an amazing guy
00:11:40,00:11:42,"He sounds unbelievable, actually"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"As in, he had his own airship in Paris"
00:11:44,00:11:46,When no one else had any means of flight
00:11:46,00:11:48,He was just flying around the streets of Paris
00:11:48,00:11:50,He would just stop at a cafe
00:11:50,00:11:52,Tether it
00:11:52,00:11:54,And then go down to the cafe
00:11:54,00:11:56,"And say, ""Well, so you like that, and fly off"
00:11:56,00:11:58,"It is in the late 19th century, early 20th century"
00:11:58,00:12:00,He just did it
00:12:00,00:12:02,What was he tethering to
00:12:02,00:12:04,"All right, rooftops"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"Yeah, it wasn't huge, when you look at photos of it"
00:12:06,00:12:08,It's not a massive airship
00:12:08,00:12:10,It's like the size of the one and one or the hoodie
00:12:10,00:12:12,"There was one man airship, I think, a personal airship"
00:12:12,00:12:14,He would go past ladies bedrooms
00:12:14,00:12:16,And they would throw their underwear out of the window
00:12:16,00:12:18,(Laughter)
00:12:18,00:12:20,That's how famous he was
00:12:20,00:12:22,He was also super generous
00:12:22,00:12:26,So he was responsible for the first woman ever to take flight
00:12:26,00:12:28,Because there was a princess
00:12:28,00:12:30,She was a princess of some foreign country
00:12:30,00:12:32,"Came to visit Paris, took an interest in his airship"
00:12:32,00:12:34,"Said, ""Wouldn't mine go up one of those?"""
00:12:34,00:12:36,And he taught her to fly one
00:12:36,00:12:38,And then he had her flying one through the streets of Paris
00:12:38,00:12:40,And he cycled blue shouting her instructions
00:12:40,00:12:42,And she did so
00:12:42,00:12:44,And this was the first woman to fly
00:12:44,00:12:48,"Wow, I actually, it sounds way worse to think of mentoring their underwear"
00:12:48,00:12:50,At her
00:12:50,00:12:52,"Oh, Jesus!"
00:12:52,00:12:54,He invented other things as well
00:12:54,00:12:56,"I know the 10th of a chair, no one talks about it"
00:12:56,00:12:58,No one mentions the 10th of a chair
00:12:58,00:13:00,We've all got one
00:13:00,00:13:04,And we've all got the motorised skis to get him back up and mounted
00:13:04,00:13:06,Really? And he invented it a sling shot
00:13:06,00:13:08,Which would throw life belts out from sinking ships
00:13:08,00:13:10,So that everyone could have a life belt
00:13:10,00:13:12,He also invented a racing airship
00:13:12,00:13:14,Which was similar to his airship
00:13:14,00:13:16,But he never raced it because he had no one to race against
00:13:16,00:13:18,(Laughter)
00:13:18,00:13:20,That is so sad
00:13:20,00:13:22,"He could have just made two, couldn't he?"
00:13:22,00:13:24,Can I bring it to dinner parties very quickly?
00:13:24,00:13:26,I just want to talk about my favourite dinner party host
00:13:26,00:13:28,"From History, which is William Buckland"
00:13:28,00:13:30,He's a very exciting character
00:13:30,00:13:32,He studied fossils and he was a geologist
00:13:32,00:13:34,But he also went on this massive mission
00:13:34,00:13:36,To eat every single thing in the animal kingdom
00:13:36,00:13:38,"He was just like ""I need to have everything his favourite"""
00:13:38,00:13:40,So if you went to his house for dinner
00:13:40,00:13:42,You would end up having things like Elephant's trunk
00:13:42,00:13:44,Or mice on toast was his favourite thing
00:13:44,00:13:48,And he knew food so like he knew animal food
00:13:48,00:13:50,Everything about them so well
00:13:50,00:13:52,That he was once invited to go to this church
00:13:52,00:13:56,Where they thought a saint's blood was on the ground of this church
00:13:56,00:13:58,And he came over there
00:13:58,00:14:00,And he had a look at it and he was like
00:14:00,00:14:02,Because it was just his patch on the ground of the heart's the saint's blood
00:14:02,00:14:04,"He leaned down, he licked it"
00:14:04,00:14:06,And he came back up and went
00:14:06,00:14:08,"""I was about urine"""
00:14:08,00:14:10,He just knew
00:14:10,00:14:12,But also the worst guest to have at a dinner party in that respect
00:14:12,00:14:14,Because he went to this party which was Lord Harcourt
00:14:14,00:14:16,His the Archbishop of York
00:14:16,00:14:18,"And at the dinner, Harcourt was like"
00:14:18,00:14:20,"""I've got this amazing relic that I want to show you all"
00:14:20,00:14:24,And he brought out what was the heart of Louis XVI in a box
00:14:24,00:14:26,"And within seconds Bucklinges grabbed it and he ate it"""
00:14:26,00:14:28,But you say worse than he has ever
00:14:28,00:14:32,Very few dinner hosts bring the heart of a dead king
00:14:32,00:14:34,To the table
00:14:34,00:14:36,I would say worse than a host ever
00:14:36,00:14:38,"Okay, here's another dinner party thing"
00:14:38,00:14:40,Though a christening of Louis XIV's grandson
00:14:40,00:14:42,He created a cake
00:14:42,00:14:46,"Sorry, there was a great chef called Antoine Karam"
00:14:46,00:14:48,Who created a cake
00:14:48,00:14:50,And the cake was made out of own paste
00:14:50,00:14:52,Pastry and clockwork
00:14:52,00:14:54,And I loved clockwork
00:14:54,00:14:56,I love it so much
00:14:56,00:14:58,And it's so hard to get these days in paste trees
00:14:58,00:15:00,Every Greg's I go into
00:15:00,00:15:02,And they had clockwork
00:15:02,00:15:06,Because this cake on top of it had a baby juke
00:15:06,00:15:10,Entering the world through a marzipan vagina
00:15:10,00:15:14,That is quite a centipede system
00:15:14,00:15:16,So it was him
00:15:16,00:15:18,It was celebrating him
00:15:18,00:15:22,"The child, yeah. It was a model of his mother"
00:15:22,00:15:24,Giving birth to him
00:15:24,00:15:26,"Yes, through a marzipan with clockwork"
00:15:26,00:15:28,Don't get thy Greg's to you
00:15:28,00:15:30,"No, no, wow"
00:15:30,00:15:32,I was reading that back in the day
00:15:32,00:15:34,When furniture was just suddenly being
00:15:34,00:15:36,Introduced to the idea of us having it in our homes and stuff
00:15:36,00:15:38,"Wait, wait, wait"
00:15:38,00:15:40,"I know, so very excited"
00:15:40,00:15:42,When furniture was being introduced
00:15:42,00:15:44,To the idea
00:15:44,00:15:46,Of having it in our homes
00:15:46,00:15:48,It was a short for furniture
00:15:48,00:15:50,It wasn't domesticated until the 1500s
00:15:50,00:15:52,The beautiful days when
00:15:52,00:15:54,"You know, freestanding shazes"
00:15:54,00:15:56,Were just roamed the belt
00:15:56,00:16:00,"Oh, come on"
00:16:00,00:16:02,There are a wild chair these days
00:16:02,00:16:04,There are only
00:16:04,00:16:06,400 Louis Catoll's tables left in the wild
00:16:06,00:16:12,"Sorry, sorry don't come"
00:16:12,00:16:14,I know that was my fact
00:16:14,00:16:18,Apparently when we started introducing furniture
00:16:18,00:16:20,Like covers would just be put in the middle of the room
00:16:20,00:16:22,As opposed to against the wall now
00:16:22,00:16:24,And dinner tables
00:16:24,00:16:26,We didn't used to have legs to dinner tables
00:16:26,00:16:28,You would have people come and sit
00:16:28,00:16:30,If you were having a party
00:16:30,00:16:32,There would be a big board like this that you would bring out
00:16:32,00:16:34,And you would put it on your legs
00:16:34,00:16:36,So they would just be sat on your legs
00:16:36,00:16:38,And that's why apparently there were boards
00:16:38,00:16:40,And you would be a border
00:16:40,00:16:42,And apparently borders who stay in your house
00:16:42,00:16:44,That would hold the table up
00:16:44,00:16:46,"Yeah, you'd hold the table up with your legs"
00:16:46,00:16:48,I read this in Bill Bryson's book at home
00:16:48,00:16:50,He used to say that carpets
00:16:50,00:16:52,Before we used to walk on them you just have them on your wall
00:16:52,00:16:54,"And you'd go, ""It's my carpet"""
00:16:54,00:16:56,And if you had a special guest
00:16:56,00:16:58,And you'd take it down from the wall
00:16:58,00:17:00,And you'd put it for them to walk on
00:17:00,00:17:02,And chairs used to be against the walls
00:17:02,00:17:04,You would have chairs against the walls
00:17:04,00:17:06,Because at night when you didn't have electricity
00:17:06,00:17:08,You would not trip over stuff in the middle of your room
00:17:08,00:17:10,But if you had chairs all over the shop
00:17:10,00:17:12,You should be asleep
00:17:12,00:17:14,They would get up halfway through the night wouldn't they?
00:17:14,00:17:18,Because people used to sleep in two different sections
00:17:18,00:17:20,And they'd get up and have sex
00:17:20,00:17:22,Or give it a crossword
00:17:22,00:17:24,"You're very comfortable, aren't you?"
00:17:24,00:17:30,"Oh, we're going to have to move on"
00:17:30,00:17:32,Should we move on as anyone got anything else?
00:17:32,00:17:34,I quite like the inactivity chair
00:17:34,00:17:36,Which has recently been invented
00:17:36,00:17:38,Which is a chair with only two legs
00:17:38,00:17:42,And it is basically so that you live in fear while you sit on it
00:17:42,00:17:46,And constantly be doing a balancing act
00:17:46,00:17:48,And I think the idea is that you can exercise
00:17:48,00:17:50,While also being seated but it sounds awful
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Anyway, invest in one if you're looking to improve your health"
00:17:52,00:17:54,I always think I'm not afraid enough when I'm sitting down
00:17:54,00:18:02,Stop the podcast
00:18:02,00:18:04,We have an emergency announcement to make

00:18:28,00:18:30,"Okay, back to the podcast"
00:18:32,00:18:36,"Okay, time for fact number three, that is my fact"
00:18:36,00:18:40,My fact this week is that a new scientific study has concluded
00:18:40,00:18:44,That there are too many scientific studies
00:18:44,00:18:48,It's basically the study was saying that it's doing a thing now
00:18:48,00:18:50,Where so many studies are coming out in science
00:18:50,00:18:56,That it's diminishing the attention that gets given to a actual good study
00:18:56,00:18:58,Because it's drawing headlines away from them
00:18:58,00:19:02,And studies are going so sort of minute into these little...
00:19:02,00:19:04,"I don't know, like"
00:19:04,00:19:06,There's great ones that we've read in the past
00:19:06,00:19:08,That we've talked about in the office and stuff
00:19:08,00:19:10,A study that showed that the fish herring
00:19:10,00:19:12,That they fought
00:19:12,00:19:14,To communicate with each other
00:19:14,00:19:16,That's how they talk
00:19:16,00:19:18,And that's a study and that might get in the way of say
00:19:18,00:19:20,"Yeah, but that could be a good study"
00:19:20,00:19:22,Because like you might want to know if there's a lot
00:19:22,00:19:24,So I think it was in Scandinavia somewhere
00:19:24,00:19:26,They heard a lot of like bubbles underneath the sea
00:19:26,00:19:30,And they thought it might have been like a Russian submarine or something like that
00:19:30,00:19:34,But it turned out to be herring communicating by farting to each other
00:19:34,00:19:36,And if you hadn't done the study you wouldn't know that that was a thing
00:19:36,00:19:38,So probably saved World War II
00:19:38,00:19:40,Russia and the whole world
00:19:40,00:19:42,"Okay, so that was a bad example"
00:19:42,00:19:44,Right
00:19:44,00:19:46,There are lots of studies that seem to be taking attention away
00:19:46,00:19:48,So it's the idea that we forget as well
00:19:48,00:19:50,"Yes, so we might have cracked everything five years ago"
00:19:50,00:19:52,But just not noticed at the time
00:19:52,00:19:54,And now we're carrying on and on with more studies
00:19:54,00:19:56,And now we're carrying on and on with more studies
00:19:56,00:19:58,And we do study some of our relevance
00:19:58,00:20:00,I'm not we personally
00:20:00,00:20:02,But the Royal Society of Chemistry
00:20:02,00:20:04,Last year published 11 steps on how to make the perfect cup of tea
00:20:04,00:20:08,Which definitively determined after releasing this paper
00:20:08,00:20:10,That you are supposed to put the milk in first
00:20:10,00:20:14,To avoid de-napturation of the milk
00:20:14,00:20:16,We actually have big arguments in the queue
00:20:16,00:20:18,I'm facing our hearts to make tea
00:20:18,00:20:20,And I can sense a lot of anger
00:20:20,00:20:24,"Oh my god, that was the British League ever"
00:20:24,00:20:26,There was a palpable...
00:20:26,00:20:28,It wasn't a hiss
00:20:28,00:20:30,"It was an intake of bread, isn't it?"
00:20:30,00:20:32,I think we all felt that
00:20:32,00:20:36,So I am with the bread intake
00:20:36,00:20:38,Because I obviously think that was a travesty
00:20:38,00:20:40,So just to dress you got the milk in first
00:20:40,00:20:42,"But that is what they say, that's the safer way to do it"
00:20:42,00:20:44,It's also explained in this study
00:20:44,00:20:48,Three more tea deaths in World War II
00:20:48,00:20:52,So the single most downloaded paper in the history of the journal
00:20:52,00:20:54,Is it PLOS?
00:20:54,00:20:56,Mets and PLOS?
00:20:56,00:20:58,Is the 2005 paper
00:20:58,00:21:00,Why most published research findings are false?
00:21:00,00:21:02,"That's quite good, isn't it?"
00:21:02,00:21:06,So there's a guy who's written a lot of studies about falsehoods in science
00:21:06,00:21:08,And his name is John Ioanidis
00:21:08,00:21:12,"And as a boy, he was already doing research on research"
00:21:12,00:21:14,"As it were, he was doing meta-research"
00:21:14,00:21:16,"And when he was a child, he came up with a love numbers system"
00:21:16,00:21:20,To work out how affectionate he was about his own family
00:21:20,00:21:24,"And he said, ""My mother was getting a thousand and twenty four point four two"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"My grandmother, 173.73"
00:21:26,00:21:28,It's not amazing
00:21:28,00:21:32,"Yeah, he said basically that all the statistics in all these papers are a bit dubious"
00:21:32,00:21:36,But then a lot of people who said actually his statistics are a bit dubious as well
00:21:36,00:21:40,"So yeah, controversial"
00:21:40,00:21:48,"It is certainly, sorry, I assume he was talking about publication bias"
00:21:48,00:21:52,"So the publication bias is a major problem in scientific studies, isn't it?"
00:21:52,00:21:54,Because the only positive results tend to be published
00:21:54,00:21:58,And about 90% of studies that are done actually yield negative results
00:21:58,00:22:00,Which aren't as headline-grabbing
00:22:00,00:22:02,And there are journals now which are like the journal of negative results
00:22:02,00:22:04,Which is just people who have done experiments and gone
00:22:04,00:22:06,We found nothing
00:22:06,00:22:08,Nothing has been achieved here
00:22:08,00:22:16,And there's also a guy called Mark Shrym at Harvard who wanted to see how easy it would be to get something published
00:22:16,00:22:18,And so he published an article
00:22:18,00:22:22,And he made one up using randomtextgenerator.com
00:22:22,00:22:26,"And the article was called ""Cuckoo for Coco Puffs"""
00:22:26,00:22:32,And it was by Pinkerton A. LeBrain and Orson Wells
00:22:32,00:22:36,And he submitted it to 37 journals over two weeks and it was accepted by 17 of them
00:22:36,00:22:38,Wow!
00:22:38,00:22:40,Pinkerton A. LeBrain
00:22:40,00:22:46,It's an ominative determinism isn't it? Cause you know you have a name like LeBrain
00:22:46,00:22:48,You're going to be a scientist
00:22:48,00:22:52,"There's a journal called Brain, isn't it? Do you remember that?"
00:22:52,00:22:56,There's a journal called Brain and there's a guy who used to be the head of Brain who was called Head
00:22:56,00:22:58,And we had it was
00:22:58,00:23:00,And then he left Brain
00:23:00,00:23:04,"And then when he left being the head of Brain, Head was replaced as the head of Brain by a guy called Brain"
00:23:04,00:23:16,"There's a website called ""Retraction Watch"" which is fun because they pay attention to people quietly retracting their research when it turns out to be wrong"
00:23:16,00:23:18,Oh wow
00:23:18,00:23:20,That is done
00:23:20,00:23:26,"Yeah, it was set up by these two journalists called Ivan Oranski and Adam Marcus and their absolute heroes"
00:23:26,00:23:32,And the top one or two retraction holders are both anesthesiologists for what it's worth
00:23:32,00:23:40,One scientist in Japan who has had to retract 183 papers out of 212
00:23:40,00:23:44,"Oh wow, so publishing him is so much"
00:23:44,00:23:48,"But his name is Captain Orson, it's the way it's used"
00:23:48,00:23:50,It must be right
00:23:50,00:23:56,So I went on to DailyMail.co.uk and searched for according to a recent study
00:23:56,00:24:00,If there weren't two then he wouldn't be
00:24:00,00:24:02,And here were the first five things I found
00:24:02,00:24:06,And even sharks can be shy according to a new study
00:24:06,00:24:10,We have covered on the podcast that sharks can have friends
00:24:10,00:24:12,So that's not...
00:24:12,00:24:14,That's not gonna be a shy shot
00:24:14,00:24:18,And study reveals the tactics we use to avoid being head on the low
00:24:18,00:24:20,"Oh, that's great"
00:24:20,00:24:28,Any test for them? Any test? They only read the headlines so...
00:24:28,00:24:32,"Another one was bump in the night, send in the wife"
00:24:32,00:24:36,One in five men pretend to be asleep when hearing a possible intruder
00:24:36,00:24:42,"Fortunately, it's always always furniture"
00:24:42,00:24:46,But they haven't placed safely by the wall
00:24:46,00:24:48,We're gonna have to be born
00:24:48,00:24:50,We're gonna have to be born
00:24:50,00:24:54,"Okay, one more thing, I look to other things that there's too many of"
00:24:54,00:24:56,And there was a study done
00:24:56,00:25:02,It said three quarters of viewers of television have cited confusion over the proliferation of choice
00:25:02,00:25:04,As the reason they miss shows
00:25:04,00:25:08,As in there's so many channels they always miss TV shows
00:25:08,00:25:12,It's just flicking desperately between them and they can't find the right one
00:25:12,00:25:16,So I had a look at all the different channels on my TV system on Sky
00:25:16,00:25:18,And I found one which I'd never seen before
00:25:18,00:25:20,It's pavershoes.tv
00:25:20,00:25:24,And it's Sky Channel 669
00:25:24,00:25:26,And their programs include
00:25:26,00:25:28,Sensational sandals
00:25:28,00:25:30,Or pretty impumps
00:25:30,00:25:32,And classic clogs
00:25:32,00:25:36,Sounds like the best shot I've ever done
00:25:36,00:25:38,You know I'm a Q-I on this
00:25:38,00:25:38,That's great
00:25:38,00:25:40,That's 669
00:25:40,00:25:44,Put it in the UK at 667
00:25:44,00:25:46,That's a shoe size trophy
00:25:46,00:25:54,"All right, we're gonna have to move on to our final facts"
00:25:54,00:25:58,How did the shoe material go on?
00:25:58,00:26:02,(Laughter)
00:26:02,00:26:06,Typical final fact of the evening that is James
00:26:06,00:26:10,"Okay, my fact is that you should never pick up a desert tortoise"
00:26:10,00:26:12,"If you do, it can pee itself to death"
00:26:12,00:26:14,(Laughter)
00:26:14,00:26:18,"Yeah, so what they do is they store urine in the bladder"
00:26:18,00:26:20,Which they can then draw upon because they live in the desert
00:26:20,00:26:22,So they need as much water as they can get
00:26:22,00:26:24,"And if you pick them up, they can get so scared"
00:26:24,00:26:26,That they will evacuate their bladder
00:26:26,00:26:28,As they wet themselves
00:26:28,00:26:30,And then they can die of dehydration
00:26:30,00:26:32,Because they keep
00:26:32,00:26:34,Something like 40% of their body mass
00:26:34,00:26:36,Is kept as the urine
00:26:36,00:26:40,That then translates into a sort of like rehydrated water
00:26:40,00:26:42,Not rehydrated
00:26:42,00:26:44,It's really really diluted I think
00:26:44,00:26:48,So it's not too acidic or it doesn't damage them
00:26:48,00:26:50,But it's just a way that something can live in the desert
00:26:50,00:26:54,But obviously then they don't expect people to just come and pick them up
00:26:54,00:26:56,And then they die
00:26:56,00:26:58,"But yeah, desert tortoises, pretty cool"
00:26:58,00:27:02,"They live around the Las Vegas area, around the bladder, around that"
00:27:02,00:27:04,They dig basins to catch rainwater
00:27:04,00:27:06,Another way they get water
00:27:06,00:27:08,And they always know where they are
00:27:08,00:27:10,"Whatever it looks like, it's gonna rain"
00:27:10,00:27:12,They're always found next to these places
00:27:12,00:27:14,That they've dug waiting for the water to come
00:27:14,00:27:16,So they can immediately drink it
00:27:16,00:27:18,"And weirdly, this is really strange"
00:27:18,00:27:20,Humans are not so likely to die
00:27:20,00:27:24,When they're in the children or teenagers
00:27:24,00:27:26,Or whatever and you get more likely to die as you get older
00:27:26,00:27:28,"But weirdly, desert tortoises"
00:27:28,00:27:30,They are less likely to die
00:27:30,00:27:32,As the time goes on
00:27:32,00:27:34,"The older they get, the less likely they are to die"
00:27:34,00:27:36,"Yeah, so that's why they live for so long"
00:27:36,00:27:38,That's true of these places
00:27:38,00:27:40,"One was so old, I read this in"
00:27:40,00:27:44,Apparently there's a bit of contention about whether or not this is true or not
00:27:44,00:27:46,But one of Dara...
00:27:46,00:27:50,What we do is we'll cut that out
00:27:50,00:27:52,And put it at the start of every fight
00:27:52,00:27:56,Basically there was a tortoise called Harriet
00:27:56,00:27:58,Which belonged to Charles Darwin
00:27:58,00:28:00,So the contentionist bit is did that belong to Charles Darwin
00:28:00,00:28:02,They're not fully sure
00:28:02,00:28:04,But Harriet had a bit of a travelled life after Darwin
00:28:04,00:28:06,Or whoever got her
00:28:06,00:28:08,Ended up in Australia Zoo
00:28:08,00:28:10,And ended up being looked after by Steve Irwin
00:28:10,00:28:12,So Steve Irwin and Charles Darwin
00:28:12,00:28:14,Are connected within one lifetime
00:28:14,00:28:16,"Wow, yeah that is pretty good"
00:28:16,00:28:18,There was a tortoise called
00:28:18,00:28:20,There was a tortoise called Adweiter
00:28:20,00:28:24,Who lived to the age of 255
00:28:24,00:28:28,And that meant that this tortoise was born before the USA existed
00:28:28,00:28:30,And the death was announced on CNN
00:28:30,00:28:32,Wow
00:28:32,00:28:34,So there's some quite good footage of
00:28:34,00:28:36,A tortoise is living each other's buns like dogs
00:28:36,00:28:40,Because they secrete pheromones from like the Chloacher of that area
00:28:40,00:28:44,And there's quite good footage of a female tortoise
00:28:44,00:28:46,Crawling over a lettuce
00:28:46,00:28:48,And then secreasing her scent as she goes
00:28:48,00:28:52,And then a male tortoise really enthusiastically trying to have sex with the lettuce
00:28:52,00:28:54,Because we see
00:28:54,00:28:56,Wow
00:28:56,00:28:58,Lettuce was used to... they did think it was an aphrodisiap
00:28:58,00:29:00,Didn't they? In ancient Egypt
00:29:00,00:29:02,Tortuses and people did yeah
00:29:02,00:29:04,It's because they used to grow quite tall
00:29:04,00:29:06,They used to have wild lettuce
00:29:06,00:29:08,Which was really tall
00:29:08,00:29:10,And it wasn't like a normal boring modern lettuce
00:29:10,00:29:12,It was quite exciting
00:29:12,00:29:14,And it's secrete in a white sap
00:29:14,00:29:16,It's secrete in a white sap
00:29:16,00:29:18,"And it tasted peppery and it was, yeah"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"And it was a stem and it's secrete, you know"
00:29:20,00:29:22,Lettuce used to be better
00:29:22,00:29:24,Apparently tortoises can use touch screen
00:29:24,00:29:26,Technology now
00:29:26,00:29:28,They could touch things
00:29:28,00:29:30,"Because no, because they found"
00:29:30,00:29:34,They found that tortoises are actually a lot more clever than they believe them to be originally
00:29:34,00:29:36,"For example, in mazes, they're fantastic in mazes"
00:29:36,00:29:40,They can remember multiple destinations in one single route
00:29:40,00:29:42,Which often rats can't do
00:29:42,00:29:44,And now they're teaching them to use touch screen technology to
00:29:44,00:29:48,To create spotify lists
00:29:48,00:29:50,To create spotify lists
00:29:50,00:29:52,To create music
00:29:52,00:29:54,Because they've got great taste of music
00:29:54,00:29:58,Captain Orson published in his recent paper
00:29:58,00:30:00,"I haven't seen the retraction list, I don't know if it was in that"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"But he, so if they need more food"
00:30:02,00:30:04,And they give them grapes and apples and stuff
00:30:04,00:30:06,They press the right button
00:30:06,00:30:08,That highlights itself
00:30:08,00:30:10,So they go into a card of
00:30:10,00:30:10,And just
00:30:10,00:30:12,Wild lettuce
00:30:12,00:30:14,Wild lettuce
00:30:14,00:30:16,"Oh, by the way"
00:30:16,00:30:18,"Apparently, so I've always been confused"
00:30:18,00:30:20,Between what a tortoise and a turtle is
00:30:20,00:30:20,Oh yeah
00:30:20,00:30:22,And so I'm just going to say in case
00:30:22,00:30:24,Everyone here doesn't know the difference
00:30:24,00:30:26,But a tortoise has feet
00:30:26,00:30:28,And a turtle has flippers
00:30:28,00:30:30,So now we know
00:30:30,00:30:32,That's a very good wave
00:30:32,00:30:34,I thought they should have been called ninja tortoises
00:30:34,00:30:36,Because they have feet
00:30:36,00:30:38,Oh yeah
00:30:38,00:30:42,"God, I think you've redeemed yourself with your eyes"
00:30:42,00:30:50,What was amazing about that was it took ages for everyone to go
00:30:50,00:30:52,"It's dumb, is it?"
00:30:52,00:30:54,Definitely sound it
00:30:54,00:30:58,So on ways of staying hydrated in the desert
00:30:58,00:31:00,Where there's no water and no rain
00:31:00,00:31:02,There are lots of very cool ways of doing it
00:31:02,00:31:04,So there are some beetles
00:31:04,00:31:08,Which when night is just turning it today
00:31:08,00:31:12,They stand very still and they let fog condense on their bodies
00:31:12,00:31:14,And then they can drink it because it slowly coalesces onto them
00:31:14,00:31:16,And then they have enough water
00:31:16,00:31:18,To get them through the day
00:31:18,00:31:20,And then the beetles
00:31:20,00:31:22,Is fogstown beetles
00:31:22,00:31:26,Someone thought that was the best name on that day that they could come up with
00:31:26,00:31:28,Every time you see animals and their names
00:31:28,00:31:30,It's always like
00:31:30,00:31:34,There's a tortoise called the big headed tortoise
00:31:34,00:31:36,Like that was a fairies in all creative metres
00:31:36,00:31:40,Well he told me it was the best tortoise ever
00:31:40,00:31:44,Some other tortoise names while we're here
00:31:44,00:31:46,The pancake tortoise
00:31:46,00:31:48,The geometric tortoise
00:31:48,00:31:50,The impressed tortoise
00:31:50,00:31:54,Who hangs around with the big head tortoise I guess
00:31:54,00:31:58,And this guy I really like him
00:31:58,00:32:02,The wolf volcano giant tortoise
00:32:02,00:32:04,It just sounds like the four best things
00:32:04,00:32:06,Yeah
00:32:06,00:32:08,He's got a really good PR manager
00:32:08,00:32:10,Other ways of
00:32:10,00:32:14,So other desert animals that have like good ways of storing their water
00:32:14,00:32:16,So road runners urinate out their eyes
00:32:16,00:32:18,What?
00:32:18,00:32:20,Like they cannot see that in the cartoon
00:32:20,00:32:24,It's how they excrete their salt
00:32:24,00:32:26,Because you use up a lot of water
00:32:26,00:32:28,You lose a lot of water when you urinate
00:32:28,00:32:30,So they just lose it through their eyes
00:32:30,00:32:32,Also mountain goats you've got to be really careful now
00:32:32,00:32:34,Apparently in there is mountain goats like in North America
00:32:34,00:32:36,Because they really like human urine
00:32:36,00:32:38,Because they realise they don't have a natural salt
00:32:38,00:32:40,A natural thing they eat that provides them with their salt
00:32:40,00:32:42,But they have worked out that mountain is
00:32:42,00:32:44,We and that has salt in it
00:32:44,00:32:46,And so they will spot human
00:32:46,00:32:48,Mountain ears and follow them until they go to take away
00:32:48,00:32:50,And then they will sometimes
00:32:50,00:32:52,More of them
00:32:52,00:32:54,And attempt to eat drinks there
00:32:54,00:32:56,Oh god
00:32:56,00:32:58,"Excretion, yeah you've got to look out"
00:32:58,00:33:00,Where do they more?
00:33:00,00:33:02,No I don't know where
00:33:02,00:33:04,Don't turtles pee through their mouth
00:33:04,00:33:06,Sometimes pee through their mouth
00:33:06,00:33:08,And there are some uh the Fitzroy River turtle
00:33:08,00:33:10,Breeze through his amus
00:33:10,00:33:12,It's a really cool turtle
00:33:12,00:33:14,It's Australian I think and um yeah it is
00:33:14,00:33:16,It's in the Fitzroy River
00:33:16,00:33:18,And it lives in water which has a lot of oxygen in it
00:33:18,00:33:22,And um it's uh it's clowical orifice
00:33:22,00:33:24,Goes two thirds of the way along it
00:33:24,00:33:26,And it gets 68% of his oxygen through his bottom
00:33:26,00:33:28,Wow
00:33:28,00:33:32,Did you know a tart ice was once the fastest animal in the world
00:33:32,00:33:34,No it wasn't
00:33:34,00:33:36,He really was
00:33:36,00:33:38,Are you talking I can I guess
00:33:38,00:33:40,Would you tell it?
00:33:40,00:33:42,No is it the space thing?
00:33:42,00:33:44,It is the space thing
00:33:44,00:33:46,It looks like we're gonna big edit turtles in the room
00:33:46,00:33:50,I'm very close
00:33:50,00:33:52,This was in 1968
00:33:52,00:33:56,And the um Soviet sent out a spaceship with um
00:33:56,00:33:58,From Kazakhstan with a tortoise on it
00:33:58,00:34:00,And it was the first animal in deep space
00:34:00,00:34:04,And it travelled around the moon before returning to earth
00:34:04,00:34:06,Seven days later so for that shot about the time
00:34:06,00:34:08,It was the fastest animal in the world
00:34:08,00:34:10,"There were also wine flies, mealworms"
00:34:10,00:34:12,And a few other things but that was the main one
00:34:12,00:34:14,That was the headline grabber wasn't it?
00:34:14,00:34:16,No mealworms
00:34:16,00:34:18,I was there too
00:34:18,00:34:20,But they were the first life forms as well
00:34:20,00:34:22,To get around to the moon
00:34:22,00:34:28,So your fact was about things wetting themselves in a way
00:34:28,00:34:30,And we don't know why
00:34:30,00:34:32,There's no evolutionary reason why a lot of animals wet themselves
00:34:32,00:34:34,When they're afraid and it's really weird
00:34:34,00:34:36,But when they're being chased by lions
00:34:36,00:34:38,Not reasonable
00:34:38,00:34:40,Well one theory is that it might like send the lions off
00:34:40,00:34:42,Because they have to send somewhere else
00:34:42,00:34:44,I think that's one theory
00:34:44,00:34:46,But don't they surely they chase the scent until they reach the bottom
00:34:46,00:34:48,So you pee and then the lion will stop and go
00:34:48,00:34:50,Oh there's a smell of gazelle pee there
00:34:50,00:34:52,And then I mean that's just one theory
00:34:52,00:34:54,What is with humans when you get shocked I think is
00:34:54,00:34:58,Like somehow your brain gets overridden by the shock
00:34:58,00:35:00,And normally your brain is like you always want to pee
00:35:00,00:35:02,And your brain is saying no don't pee on stage
00:35:02,00:35:06,But you're shocked so much that you end up wetting yourself
00:35:06,00:35:10,It's weird there's a bit of the brain called the pontine micurition centre
00:35:10,00:35:14,Which is constantly saying let's go let's do it
00:35:14,00:35:16,Really yeah when you're bladder is full
00:35:16,00:35:18,It makes the decision to empty the bladder
00:35:18,00:35:22,And then but the prefrontal cortex always overrides the desire
00:35:22,00:35:24,But when you get really really really stressed
00:35:24,00:35:26,The limbic system overrides the prefrontal cortex
00:35:26,00:35:28,And so the signals get confused
00:35:28,00:35:30,And then you know it's like
00:35:30,00:35:32,It's all cold and you're ashamed
00:35:32,00:35:34,But we don't know why
00:35:34,00:35:36,It's long to stand off with
00:35:36,00:35:38,And we're going to have to wrap up
00:35:38,00:35:40,Okay well I think
00:35:40,00:35:44,Okay so there was a guy whose taught us had a swollen penis
00:35:44,00:35:48,And he didn't have the money to pay for the operation
00:35:48,00:35:50,And so he went on to one of these kickstart style things
00:35:50,00:35:52,And he needed 200 pounds
00:35:52,00:35:56,And he reached his target in less than 24 hours
00:35:56,00:35:58,And he went over he went up to 555 pounds
00:35:58,00:36:02,And he ended up to 555 pounds in the end people like really club together
00:36:02,00:36:04,And paid for it
00:36:04,00:36:08,And when you gave your money you could put a little note about what you wanted to say
00:36:08,00:36:10,And one person said
00:36:10,00:36:12,"""I hope he gets the report done soon"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"I know what it's like having it in large penis"""
00:36:14,00:36:22,That is not so nice
00:36:22,00:36:24,But at least he gave some money
00:36:24,00:36:28,So we have that totals doing well
00:36:28,00:36:30,And we're going to have to wrap up
00:36:30,00:36:32,So that's it that's all of our facts
00:36:32,00:36:34,Thanks so much for being here
