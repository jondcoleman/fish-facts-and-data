 Welcome to another episode
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast
 This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre
 in Central London, my name is Dad Shriver
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray
 and Anne Chazinski
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
 and in no particular order
 here we go
 starting with you, Andy Murray
 My thing this week is that
 when you have a tattoo lasered off
 you end up pooing it out
 [Laughter]
 So that happens
 Does it still have the same design on the floor?
 [Laughter]
 So yeah, this happens
 So when you have a tattoo
 it goes into the middle layer of the skin
 which is called the dermis
 and when it's lasered off
 the beams of like they heat up the ink
 and it breaks down into tiny particles
 and those go into the bloodstream
 and then they are excreted via the liver
 and the digestive system
 and that's how they get out of you
 I just think that's amazing
 That says something about how little you want the tattoo anymore
 doesn't it?
 So do you know what tattoos are made out of
 like the ink? Do you know where that comes from?
 Okay, well there was a lady on Facebook
 who got a tattoo
 a vegan on her inner lip
 and then her friends pointed out
 that actually most black ink of tattoos
 is made from burnt animal bones
 [Laughter]
 Oh god
 she's going to see that every time she looks in the mirror
 Every time she eats anything
 Yeah, that's the worst part
 You can get vegan tattoos
 but they're very rare
 Indeed, right
 The oldest tattoo we know of is on a lip, isn't it?
 A tattoo of a thin pencil moustache
 [Laughter]
 tattooed onto the upper lip
 of a 7,000 year old mummy
 from Chile
 What, like a little French kind of
 I'm not sure if it has the gap down the middle
 that a pencil moustache is supposed to have
 Do they have to have the gap down the middle?
 No, I'm not sure
 I think somebody's never been able to grow a moustache
 I don't know, damn
 It's not a moustache
 Yeah, my grandmother has tattooed eyebrows
 It's a huge heart
 [Laughter]
 Does she, like, permanently look surprised?
 I don't know where her
 original eyebrows went though
 That's what I don't know
 Did she poo them out?
 I do think you're going to say a grandmother had a thin pencil moustache
 [Laughter]
 Kind of a cruising to share
 So the thing on tattoos being quite sort of
 the stereotype of them being for sailors
 or for criminals
 or whatever it is
 The headline tattoos are not just for sailors anymore
 has appeared in print every decade
 since the mid 19th century
 Every decade, there's the rash of articles
 saying they've entered the mainstream
 So today more teachers
 have their members of the armed forces
 By 14% to 9%
 But it used to be like 90% of sailors had tattoos
 Wasn't it?
 Something like that
 The 19th century probably
 One thing that it was good for was
 it meant that you could identify a sailor who had drowned
 because you'd be able to identify them by their tattoos
 and they were actually used
 in that way
 So you could tell that he had a tattoo that said
 "I have drowned"
 He has a lot of tattoos
 The first one says "help"
 The third one says "bubbubble"
 And the other thing that they thought the sailors
 is if you had hold tattooed on your knuckles on one hand
 and fast on the other hand
 then it would help you hold on to ropes better
 Well we, you could stop drowning
 as a sailor apparently
 was to have a pig tattooed on your knee
 and then a cock
 as in a wrist, a tattooed on your right leg somewhere
 and they had the saying
 that was "pig on the knee"
 "save it see a cock on the right never lose a fight"
 So this is what those animals can swim
 or fight very well
 Speaking of cocks and tattoos
 Yeah God
 Sometimes when I want to find out some facts for this show
 I'll go back to the old QI topboards
 and see what I wrote in the past
 and I touched the tattoos
 and I found something that Dan posted in 2005
 and this is what he said
 He said "I was told today
 that if a man was to have a tattoo done on his penis
 then he was entitled to three tattoos
 for the rest of his life
 from anywhere in the world
 in any tattooing power
 No questions asked
 This is what used to pass the QI research back in the day
 So I have a confession
 It's not just my grandmother with a tattoo
 Well I had a look
 and there are one or two tattoo parlors
 that will claim that they will do that
 whether they will or not
 I don't know but it's not everyone in the world all the time
 It's a very difficult thing to Google by the way
 But very easy to Google, it's very difficult to forget
 I shouldn't have gotten Google images really for that
 But I found a story about a 21-year-old from Iran
 who paid a tattoo artist to put the letter "M" for his girlfriend's last name
 and the Persian phrase for "Good luck with your journeys"
 on his penis
 and he fell pain for eight days
 and then his penis became permanently semi erect
 so he couldn't get it to go down
 He lived with it
 and he didn't know what to do
 He just became permanently semi erect
 so he couldn't get it to go down
 He lived with it for three months before getting medical help
 and doctors tried shunting the penis
 to drain excess blood
 Not sure what shunting
 And then it didn't work
 and so the patient decided
 he was fine with the condition
 and declined further treatment
 Wow
 So they were quite a high society thing
 weren't they in the 19th century
 and at the turn of so
 in about 1900
 New York newspaper estimator
 that 75% of society ladies in New York had tattoos
 75%
 What kind of tattoos? Like practical ones
 or
 practical tattoos
 Don't back away
 Step up
 You get medical tattoos
 and we think that some of the oldest tattoos ever
 which are 5,000 years old
 the 3,000 BC we found bodies
 where there's a body in the house
 which has tattoos over his joints
 and they looked at the skeleton
 and he had osteoarthritis in those joints
 So it's like a kind of
 That's what I meant by it actually
 because the mercury astronauts are apparently as well
 No, no, no, but I looked into
 whether or not astronauts had any tattoos
 You're like I'm saying a lot of things
 that it's just me agreeing with
 mercury astronauts
 They would have them
 in just like sensor locations
 basically for whenever they had to monitor their health
 so they knew where they were
 Kind of like putting a bit of tape on the ground
 as a mark for an actor
 There was a guy who's arrested
 by Canada's border services agency
 with the letters H-A-T-E
 on his knuckles
 and he claimed that it stood far
 through eternity
 That's very good
 Quick thinking
 One moment used to an internet translation to
 translate "I Love David" into Hebrew
 She later discovered
 she inadvertently had the phrase
 "Babylon is the world's leading dictionary
 and translation software"
 on her back
 Forever
 But she doesn't have a free account with Babylon forever
 David Beckham has
 Victoria Beckham's name miss belt
 tattooed on his body in Hindi
 Oh dear
 Samantha Cameron has a tattoo
 Yeah, she's cooler than all of us
 Hello, Dan's grandmother
 Sorry
 Is it a practical tattoo?
 It's a dolphin on her ankle
 Is that practical?
 Yeah, that's cool
 Was that just a holiday that she took once
 To a dolphin area?
 To a dolphin area
 Oh, just you go into that and you get a tattoo
 No, I don't mean it's like
 Is anyone going to camera it?
 No, I'll go
 Quick tattoo that dolphin
 So I can live this memory forever
 There's an American guy
 who has over a thousand tattoos
 based on Disney characters
 including all 101 and 101 Dalmatians
 Which I don't
 There must be tiny though
 with the Dalmatians
 Well, obviously none of his life's size
 But I mean
 How many, to buy the single
 The area of a body by a thousand is not much room you've got
 Yeah, so I mean I think it is to scale
 But it is scaled down
 And he has a system
 So he has all the evil characters
 are below his knees
 All the undersea characters are below his belly
 So I don't know
 But then all the evil characters are under the sea
 So I don't know how he works that out
 Wow
 Anyway, he gets copyrighted by a Disney
 Like Disney's allowed him to do it
 Oh really? He's the only person
 Why is it illegal to do a Disney tattoo?
 I think when you've got that many of them
 What would they do?
 Make you put it out? Oh yeah
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact
 So if anyone has anything more than they want to add
 On mistakes in tattoos
 John Caru, who's a footballer? Yeah, John Caru
 John Caru, he got a tattoo saying
 He wanted to say my life, my rules
 So he got Mavie Meeregler
 But he got the accent wrong on regular
 He got an acute accent instead of a grave one
 Which translates as my life, my menstruation
 (Laughter)
 Okay, it's time for our second fact of the evening
 And that fact is Chazinski's
 Yeah, my fact is that the man who invented the airship
 Used to hold dinner parties with ten-foot-high chairs
 So that his guests could experience the joy of flight
 (Laughter)
 This guy is amazing, presenting like Alberto Santos-Dumel
 And first of all, he decided to have hanging from the ceiling
 Which he could understand was more reminiscent of flight
 But one of his first dinner parties
 He put all his guests hanging from the ceiling
 And the ceiling collapsed
 So he's...
 (Laughter)
 So after all the funerals of the previous guests
 Weirdly, no one wanted to come to the next party
 And the TV was fine
 So the wake will be at mine, I've organised a nice dinner
 (Laughter)
 Wow
 Yeah, he was great
 He was an inventor, he grew up on a plantation in Brazil
 And he invented a toy motor powered functioning aeroplane
 Which was quite a long time before
 He invented in the late 19th century
 And then he moved to Paris and became a celebrity
 Because he invented the airship
 Which attracted attention
 And used to invite celebrities and royalty to his house
 And have these wacky dinner parties
 And they'd have to mount their seats on ladders
 (Laughter)
 Yeah, he was so famous in his time
 At the time said, "When the names of all those
 Who have occupied outstanding positions in the world
 Have been forgotten
 There will be a name which will remain in our memory
 That of Santos Dumont
 (Laughter)
 He does sound like an amazing guy
 He sounds unbelievable, actually
 As in, he had his own airship in Paris
 When no one else had any means of flight
 He was just flying around the streets of Paris
 He would just stop at a cafe
 Tether it
 And then go down to the cafe
 And say, "Well, so you like that, and fly off
 It is in the late 19th century, early 20th century
 He just did it
 What was he tethering to
 All right, rooftops
 Yeah, it wasn't huge, when you look at photos of it
 It's not a massive airship
 It's like the size of the one and one or the hoodie
 There was one man airship, I think, a personal airship
 He would go past ladies bedrooms
 And they would throw their underwear out of the window
 (Laughter)
 That's how famous he was
 He was also super generous
 So he was responsible for the first woman ever to take flight
 Because there was a princess
 She was a princess of some foreign country
 Came to visit Paris, took an interest in his airship
 Said, "Wouldn't mine go up one of those?"
 And he taught her to fly one
 And then he had her flying one through the streets of Paris
 And he cycled blue shouting her instructions
 And she did so
 And this was the first woman to fly
 Wow, I actually, it sounds way worse to think of mentoring their underwear
 At her
 Oh, Jesus!
 He invented other things as well
 I know the 10th of a chair, no one talks about it
 No one mentions the 10th of a chair
 We've all got one
 And we've all got the motorised skis to get him back up and mounted
 Really? And he invented it a sling shot
 Which would throw life belts out from sinking ships
 So that everyone could have a life belt
 He also invented a racing airship
 Which was similar to his airship
 But he never raced it because he had no one to race against
 (Laughter)
 That is so sad
 He could have just made two, couldn't he?
 Can I bring it to dinner parties very quickly?
 I just want to talk about my favourite dinner party host
 From History, which is William Buckland
 He's a very exciting character
 He studied fossils and he was a geologist
 But he also went on this massive mission
 To eat every single thing in the animal kingdom
 He was just like "I need to have everything his favourite"
 So if you went to his house for dinner
 You would end up having things like Elephant's trunk
 Or mice on toast was his favourite thing
 And he knew food so like he knew animal food
 Everything about them so well
 That he was once invited to go to this church
 Where they thought a saint's blood was on the ground of this church
 And he came over there
 And he had a look at it and he was like
 Because it was just his patch on the ground of the heart's the saint's blood
 He leaned down, he licked it
 And he came back up and went
 "I was about urine"
 He just knew
 But also the worst guest to have at a dinner party in that respect
 Because he went to this party which was Lord Harcourt
 His the Archbishop of York
 And at the dinner, Harcourt was like
 "I've got this amazing relic that I want to show you all
 And he brought out what was the heart of Louis XVI in a box
 And within seconds Bucklinges grabbed it and he ate it"
 But you say worse than he has ever
 Very few dinner hosts bring the heart of a dead king
 To the table
 I would say worse than a host ever
 Okay, here's another dinner party thing
 Though a christening of Louis XIV's grandson
 He created a cake
 Sorry, there was a great chef called Antoine Karam
 Who created a cake
 And the cake was made out of own paste
 Pastry and clockwork
 And I loved clockwork
 I love it so much
 And it's so hard to get these days in paste trees
 Every Greg's I go into
 And they had clockwork
 Because this cake on top of it had a baby juke
 Entering the world through a marzipan vagina
 That is quite a centipede system
 So it was him
 It was celebrating him
 The child, yeah. It was a model of his mother
 Giving birth to him
 Yes, through a marzipan with clockwork
 Don't get thy Greg's to you
 No, no, wow
 I was reading that back in the day
 When furniture was just suddenly being
 Introduced to the idea of us having it in our homes and stuff
 Wait, wait, wait
 I know, so very excited
 When furniture was being introduced
 To the idea
 Of having it in our homes
 It was a short for furniture
 It wasn't domesticated until the 1500s
 The beautiful days when
 You know, freestanding shazes
 Were just roamed the belt
 Oh, come on
 There are a wild chair these days
 There are only
 400 Louis Catoll's tables left in the wild
 Sorry, sorry don't come
 I know that was my fact
 Apparently when we started introducing furniture
 Like covers would just be put in the middle of the room
 As opposed to against the wall now
 And dinner tables
 We didn't used to have legs to dinner tables
 You would have people come and sit
 If you were having a party
 There would be a big board like this that you would bring out
 And you would put it on your legs
 So they would just be sat on your legs
 And that's why apparently there were boards
 And you would be a border
 And apparently borders who stay in your house
 That would hold the table up
 Yeah, you'd hold the table up with your legs
 I read this in Bill Bryson's book at home
 He used to say that carpets
 Before we used to walk on them you just have them on your wall
 And you'd go, "It's my carpet"
 And if you had a special guest
 And you'd take it down from the wall
 And you'd put it for them to walk on
 And chairs used to be against the walls
 You would have chairs against the walls
 Because at night when you didn't have electricity
 You would not trip over stuff in the middle of your room
 But if you had chairs all over the shop
 You should be asleep
 They would get up halfway through the night wouldn't they?
 Because people used to sleep in two different sections
 And they'd get up and have sex
 Or give it a crossword
 You're very comfortable, aren't you?
 Oh, we're going to have to move on
 Should we move on as anyone got anything else?
 I quite like the inactivity chair
 Which has recently been invented
 Which is a chair with only two legs
 And it is basically so that you live in fear while you sit on it
 And constantly be doing a balancing act
 And I think the idea is that you can exercise
 While also being seated but it sounds awful
 Anyway, invest in one if you're looking to improve your health
 I always think I'm not afraid enough when I'm sitting down
 Stop the podcast
 We have an emergency announcement to make

 Okay, back to the podcast
 Okay, time for fact number three, that is my fact
 My fact this week is that a new scientific study has concluded
 That there are too many scientific studies
 It's basically the study was saying that it's doing a thing now
 Where so many studies are coming out in science
 That it's diminishing the attention that gets given to a actual good study
 Because it's drawing headlines away from them
 And studies are going so sort of minute into these little...
 I don't know, like
 There's great ones that we've read in the past
 That we've talked about in the office and stuff
 A study that showed that the fish herring
 That they fought
 To communicate with each other
 That's how they talk
 And that's a study and that might get in the way of say
 Yeah, but that could be a good study
 Because like you might want to know if there's a lot
 So I think it was in Scandinavia somewhere
 They heard a lot of like bubbles underneath the sea
 And they thought it might have been like a Russian submarine or something like that
 But it turned out to be herring communicating by farting to each other
 And if you hadn't done the study you wouldn't know that that was a thing
 So probably saved World War II
 Russia and the whole world
 Okay, so that was a bad example
 Right
 There are lots of studies that seem to be taking attention away
 So it's the idea that we forget as well
 Yes, so we might have cracked everything five years ago
 But just not noticed at the time
 And now we're carrying on and on with more studies
 And now we're carrying on and on with more studies
 And we do study some of our relevance
 I'm not we personally
 But the Royal Society of Chemistry
 Last year published 11 steps on how to make the perfect cup of tea
 Which definitively determined after releasing this paper
 That you are supposed to put the milk in first
 To avoid de-napturation of the milk
 We actually have big arguments in the queue
 I'm facing our hearts to make tea
 And I can sense a lot of anger
 Oh my god, that was the British League ever
 There was a palpable...
 It wasn't a hiss
 It was an intake of bread, isn't it?
 I think we all felt that
 So I am with the bread intake
 Because I obviously think that was a travesty
 So just to dress you got the milk in first
 But that is what they say, that's the safer way to do it
 It's also explained in this study
 Three more tea deaths in World War II
 So the single most downloaded paper in the history of the journal
 Is it PLOS?
 Mets and PLOS?
 Is the 2005 paper
 Why most published research findings are false?
 That's quite good, isn't it?
 So there's a guy who's written a lot of studies about falsehoods in science
 And his name is John Ioanidis
 And as a boy, he was already doing research on research
 As it were, he was doing meta-research
 And when he was a child, he came up with a love numbers system
 To work out how affectionate he was about his own family
 And he said, "My mother was getting a thousand and twenty four point four two
 My grandmother, 173.73
 It's not amazing
 Yeah, he said basically that all the statistics in all these papers are a bit dubious
 But then a lot of people who said actually his statistics are a bit dubious as well
 So yeah, controversial
 It is certainly, sorry, I assume he was talking about publication bias
 So the publication bias is a major problem in scientific studies, isn't it?
 Because the only positive results tend to be published
 And about 90% of studies that are done actually yield negative results
 Which aren't as headline-grabbing
 And there are journals now which are like the journal of negative results
 Which is just people who have done experiments and gone
 We found nothing
 Nothing has been achieved here
 And there's also a guy called Mark Shrym at Harvard who wanted to see how easy it would be to get something published
 And so he published an article
 And he made one up using randomtextgenerator.com
 And the article was called "Cuckoo for Coco Puffs"
 And it was by Pinkerton A. LeBrain and Orson Wells
 And he submitted it to 37 journals over two weeks and it was accepted by 17 of them
 Wow!
 Pinkerton A. LeBrain
 It's an ominative determinism isn't it? Cause you know you have a name like LeBrain
 You're going to be a scientist
 There's a journal called Brain, isn't it? Do you remember that?
 There's a journal called Brain and there's a guy who used to be the head of Brain who was called Head
 And we had it was
 And then he left Brain
 And then when he left being the head of Brain, Head was replaced as the head of Brain by a guy called Brain
 There's a website called "Retraction Watch" which is fun because they pay attention to people quietly retracting their research when it turns out to be wrong
 Oh wow
 That is done
 Yeah, it was set up by these two journalists called Ivan Oranski and Adam Marcus and their absolute heroes
 And the top one or two retraction holders are both anesthesiologists for what it's worth
 One scientist in Japan who has had to retract 183 papers out of 212
 Oh wow, so publishing him is so much
 But his name is Captain Orson, it's the way it's used
 It must be right
 So I went on to DailyMail.co.uk and searched for according to a recent study
 If there weren't two then he wouldn't be
 And here were the first five things I found
 And even sharks can be shy according to a new study
 We have covered on the podcast that sharks can have friends
 So that's not...
 That's not gonna be a shy shot
 And study reveals the tactics we use to avoid being head on the low
 Oh, that's great
 Any test for them? Any test? They only read the headlines so...
 Another one was bump in the night, send in the wife
 One in five men pretend to be asleep when hearing a possible intruder
 Fortunately, it's always always furniture
 But they haven't placed safely by the wall
 We're gonna have to be born
 We're gonna have to be born
 Okay, one more thing, I look to other things that there's too many of
 And there was a study done
 It said three quarters of viewers of television have cited confusion over the proliferation of choice
 As the reason they miss shows
 As in there's so many channels they always miss TV shows
 It's just flicking desperately between them and they can't find the right one
 So I had a look at all the different channels on my TV system on Sky
 And I found one which I'd never seen before
 It's pavershoes.tv
 And it's Sky Channel 669
 And their programs include
 Sensational sandals
 Or pretty impumps
 And classic clogs
 Sounds like the best shot I've ever done
 You know I'm a Q-I on this
 That's great
 That's 669
 Put it in the UK at 667
 That's a shoe size trophy
 All right, we're gonna have to move on to our final facts
 How did the shoe material go on?
 (Laughter)
 Typical final fact of the evening that is James
 Okay, my fact is that you should never pick up a desert tortoise
 If you do, it can pee itself to death
 (Laughter)
 Yeah, so what they do is they store urine in the bladder
 Which they can then draw upon because they live in the desert
 So they need as much water as they can get
 And if you pick them up, they can get so scared
 That they will evacuate their bladder
 As they wet themselves
 And then they can die of dehydration
 Because they keep
 Something like 40% of their body mass
 Is kept as the urine
 That then translates into a sort of like rehydrated water
 Not rehydrated
 It's really really diluted I think
 So it's not too acidic or it doesn't damage them
 But it's just a way that something can live in the desert
 But obviously then they don't expect people to just come and pick them up
 And then they die
 But yeah, desert tortoises, pretty cool
 They live around the Las Vegas area, around the bladder, around that
 They dig basins to catch rainwater
 Another way they get water
 And they always know where they are
 Whatever it looks like, it's gonna rain
 They're always found next to these places
 That they've dug waiting for the water to come
 So they can immediately drink it
 And weirdly, this is really strange
 Humans are not so likely to die
 When they're in the children or teenagers
 Or whatever and you get more likely to die as you get older
 But weirdly, desert tortoises
 They are less likely to die
 As the time goes on
 The older they get, the less likely they are to die
 Yeah, so that's why they live for so long
 That's true of these places
 One was so old, I read this in
 Apparently there's a bit of contention about whether or not this is true or not
 But one of Dara...
 What we do is we'll cut that out
 And put it at the start of every fight
 Basically there was a tortoise called Harriet
 Which belonged to Charles Darwin
 So the contentionist bit is did that belong to Charles Darwin
 They're not fully sure
 But Harriet had a bit of a travelled life after Darwin
 Or whoever got her
 Ended up in Australia Zoo
 And ended up being looked after by Steve Irwin
 So Steve Irwin and Charles Darwin
 Are connected within one lifetime
 Wow, yeah that is pretty good
 There was a tortoise called
 There was a tortoise called Adweiter
 Who lived to the age of 255
 And that meant that this tortoise was born before the USA existed
 And the death was announced on CNN
 Wow
 So there's some quite good footage of
 A tortoise is living each other's buns like dogs
 Because they secrete pheromones from like the Chloacher of that area
 And there's quite good footage of a female tortoise
 Crawling over a lettuce
 And then secreasing her scent as she goes
 And then a male tortoise really enthusiastically trying to have sex with the lettuce
 Because we see
 Wow
 Lettuce was used to... they did think it was an aphrodisiap
 Didn't they? In ancient Egypt
 Tortuses and people did yeah
 It's because they used to grow quite tall
 They used to have wild lettuce
 Which was really tall
 And it wasn't like a normal boring modern lettuce
 It was quite exciting
 And it's secrete in a white sap
 It's secrete in a white sap
 And it tasted peppery and it was, yeah
 And it was a stem and it's secrete, you know
 Lettuce used to be better
 Apparently tortoises can use touch screen
 Technology now
 They could touch things
 Because no, because they found
 They found that tortoises are actually a lot more clever than they believe them to be originally
 For example, in mazes, they're fantastic in mazes
 They can remember multiple destinations in one single route
 Which often rats can't do
 And now they're teaching them to use touch screen technology to
 To create spotify lists
 To create spotify lists
 To create music
 Because they've got great taste of music
 Captain Orson published in his recent paper
 I haven't seen the retraction list, I don't know if it was in that
 But he, so if they need more food
 And they give them grapes and apples and stuff
 They press the right button
 That highlights itself
 So they go into a card of
 And just
 Wild lettuce
 Wild lettuce
 Oh, by the way
 Apparently, so I've always been confused
 Between what a tortoise and a turtle is
 Oh yeah
 And so I'm just going to say in case
 Everyone here doesn't know the difference
 But a tortoise has feet
 And a turtle has flippers
 So now we know
 That's a very good wave
 I thought they should have been called ninja tortoises
 Because they have feet
 Oh yeah
 God, I think you've redeemed yourself with your eyes
 What was amazing about that was it took ages for everyone to go
 It's dumb, is it?
 Definitely sound it
 So on ways of staying hydrated in the desert
 Where there's no water and no rain
 There are lots of very cool ways of doing it
 So there are some beetles
 Which when night is just turning it today
 They stand very still and they let fog condense on their bodies
 And then they can drink it because it slowly coalesces onto them
 And then they have enough water
 To get them through the day
 And then the beetles
 Is fogstown beetles
 Someone thought that was the best name on that day that they could come up with
 Every time you see animals and their names
 It's always like
 There's a tortoise called the big headed tortoise
 Like that was a fairies in all creative metres
 Well he told me it was the best tortoise ever
 Some other tortoise names while we're here
 The pancake tortoise
 The geometric tortoise
 The impressed tortoise
 Who hangs around with the big head tortoise I guess
 And this guy I really like him
 The wolf volcano giant tortoise
 It just sounds like the four best things
 Yeah
 He's got a really good PR manager
 Other ways of
 So other desert animals that have like good ways of storing their water
 So road runners urinate out their eyes
 What?
 Like they cannot see that in the cartoon
 It's how they excrete their salt
 Because you use up a lot of water
 You lose a lot of water when you urinate
 So they just lose it through their eyes
 Also mountain goats you've got to be really careful now
 Apparently in there is mountain goats like in North America
 Because they really like human urine
 Because they realise they don't have a natural salt
 A natural thing they eat that provides them with their salt
 But they have worked out that mountain is
 We and that has salt in it
 And so they will spot human
 Mountain ears and follow them until they go to take away
 And then they will sometimes
 More of them
 And attempt to eat drinks there
 Oh god
 Excretion, yeah you've got to look out
 Where do they more?
 No I don't know where
 Don't turtles pee through their mouth
 Sometimes pee through their mouth
 And there are some uh the Fitzroy River turtle
 Breeze through his amus
 It's a really cool turtle
 It's Australian I think and um yeah it is
 It's in the Fitzroy River
 And it lives in water which has a lot of oxygen in it
 And um it's uh it's clowical orifice
 Goes two thirds of the way along it
 And it gets 68% of his oxygen through his bottom
 Wow
 Did you know a tart ice was once the fastest animal in the world
 No it wasn't
 He really was
 Are you talking I can I guess
 Would you tell it?
 No is it the space thing?
 It is the space thing
 It looks like we're gonna big edit turtles in the room
 I'm very close
 This was in 1968
 And the um Soviet sent out a spaceship with um
 From Kazakhstan with a tortoise on it
 And it was the first animal in deep space
 And it travelled around the moon before returning to earth
 Seven days later so for that shot about the time
 It was the fastest animal in the world
 There were also wine flies, mealworms
 And a few other things but that was the main one
 That was the headline grabber wasn't it?
 No mealworms
 I was there too
 But they were the first life forms as well
 To get around to the moon
 So your fact was about things wetting themselves in a way
 And we don't know why
 There's no evolutionary reason why a lot of animals wet themselves
 When they're afraid and it's really weird
 But when they're being chased by lions
 Not reasonable
 Well one theory is that it might like send the lions off
 Because they have to send somewhere else
 I think that's one theory
 But don't they surely they chase the scent until they reach the bottom
 So you pee and then the lion will stop and go
 Oh there's a smell of gazelle pee there
 And then I mean that's just one theory
 What is with humans when you get shocked I think is
 Like somehow your brain gets overridden by the shock
 And normally your brain is like you always want to pee
 And your brain is saying no don't pee on stage
 But you're shocked so much that you end up wetting yourself
 It's weird there's a bit of the brain called the pontine micurition centre
 Which is constantly saying let's go let's do it
 Really yeah when you're bladder is full
 It makes the decision to empty the bladder
 And then but the prefrontal cortex always overrides the desire
 But when you get really really really stressed
 The limbic system overrides the prefrontal cortex
 And so the signals get confused
 And then you know it's like
 It's all cold and you're ashamed
 But we don't know why
 It's long to stand off with
 And we're going to have to wrap up
 Okay well I think
 Okay so there was a guy whose taught us had a swollen penis
 And he didn't have the money to pay for the operation
 And so he went on to one of these kickstart style things
 And he needed 200 pounds
 And he reached his target in less than 24 hours
 And he went over he went up to 555 pounds
 And he ended up to 555 pounds in the end people like really club together
 And paid for it
 And when you gave your money you could put a little note about what you wanted to say
 And one person said
 "I hope he gets the report done soon
 I know what it's like having it in large penis"
 That is not so nice
 But at least he gave some money
 So we have that totals doing well
 And we're going to have to wrap up
 So that's it that's all of our facts
