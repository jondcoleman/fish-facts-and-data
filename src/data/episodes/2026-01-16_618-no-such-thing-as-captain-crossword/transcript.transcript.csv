00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:07,"of No Such Things A Fish, where we were joined by the legend."
00:00:07,00:00:10,"The national treasure already, I think,"
00:00:10,00:00:13,"but definitely future national treasure, Tom Allen."
00:00:13,00:00:15,"- That's right, Tom is absolutely fantastic"
00:00:15,00:00:15,as you're about to hear.
00:00:15,00:00:17,"He's a flanner, he's a man of out town."
00:00:17,00:00:19,"Among many other things, you might not think it"
00:00:19,00:00:21,"'cause he's so dapper, but he's also a gardener."
00:00:21,00:00:23,"- You might not think it 'cause he speaks so nicely,"
00:00:23,00:00:25,but he's also a podcaster.
00:00:25,00:00:25,(laughing)
00:00:25,00:00:30,"- And he has a new podcast out, it's called ""Pottering"" with Tom Allen,"
00:00:30,00:00:33,"and he gets a celebrity to his garden,"
00:00:33,00:00:37,"be it Nish Kumar, be it James A. Castor, be it Natalie Cassidy,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,and they talk about gardening.
00:00:39,00:00:42,"- It's lovely, and I think they do some gardening as well, actually."
00:00:42,00:00:46,"- He probably has some Natalie Cassidy Bagonias,"
00:00:46,00:00:49,"get some Nish Kumar, Asperd Distras."
00:00:49,00:00:51,"- Lovely, can James name a third plunge?"
00:00:51,00:00:54,"- Absolutely not, but if you want to hear Tom's podcast,"
00:00:54,00:00:56,"then go to wherever you get your podcast,"
00:00:56,00:00:58,"it's called ""Pottering"" with Tom Allen,"
00:00:58,00:00:59,"and it's absolutely fantastic,"
00:00:59,00:01:01,"but Andy, we have some more news."
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- That's right, the other thing to say is that,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,"in a week's time, we're gonna be doing the first"
00:01:05,00:01:07,ever Club Fish Quiz.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"Now, this is for people who've joined Club Fish"
00:01:10,00:01:12,"at the top tier, the friend of the podcast tier,"
00:01:12,00:01:16,"we are gonna be doing a quiz globally, I imagine."
00:01:16,00:01:18,"We suspect hundreds of thousands may be attending,"
00:01:18,00:01:21,"and you can be one of them, it's gonna be on Zoom,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,or an equivalent streaming platform.
00:01:23,00:01:24,"We've all been writing our questions,"
00:01:24,00:01:26,"we've been showing them to each other,"
00:01:26,00:01:27,"we've been coming up with silly games,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,it's gonna be so much fun.
00:01:29,00:01:32,So mark your diaries or your calendars
00:01:32,00:01:37,"for Friday, the 23rd of January, 7pm British time,"
00:01:37,00:01:38,"but if you're around the world,"
00:01:38,00:01:39,we'd love to see you there as well.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"- Gonna be so much fun, we can't wait to do it."
00:01:41,00:01:44,"But anyway, please enjoy this week's episode"
00:01:44,00:01:47,"of ""No Six Things A Fish"" with the incredible Tom Allen,"
00:01:47,00:01:48,on with the podcast.
00:01:48,00:01:49,- On with the show.
00:01:51,00:01:53,(upbeat music)
00:01:53,00:02:05,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:02:05,00:02:08,"of ""No Such Thing"" as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:08,00:02:11,coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:11,00:02:13,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:02:13,00:02:16,"with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Tom Allen."
00:02:16,00:02:18,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:18,00:02:21,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:21,00:02:24,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:24,00:02:27,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Tom."
00:02:27,00:02:31,"- In September 1945, a small booklet was discovered"
00:02:31,00:02:34,"in the main offices of the third Reich in Berlin,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"or Reich, if you're from southern Germany."
00:02:37,00:02:41,"In Berlin, it was a secret list of 2,820 British individuals"
00:02:41,00:02:42,who'd be rounded up in the event
00:02:42,00:02:46,"of a successful invasion, and Noel Coward found his name"
00:02:46,00:02:47,on page 34.
00:02:47,00:02:51,"- Oh, okay, why were they going after him?"
00:02:51,00:02:55,"- Well, firstly, I think anybody in an entertainment"
00:02:55,00:02:57,would be annoyed that they had to go so far.
00:02:57,00:02:58,(laughing)
00:02:58,00:02:59,- Mind your own name.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"- There's only one thing worse than being on the Nazis,"
00:03:02,00:03:03,deathless.
00:03:03,00:03:04,(laughing)
00:03:04,00:03:07,"- And that's not being on the, I can't believe"
00:03:07,00:03:10,you're quoting Oscar Wilde in a Noel Coward section.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"- Oh yeah, we'll get onto that."
00:03:12,00:03:15,"- Well, they just kind of crossed over"
00:03:15,00:03:20,"in a sort of Dalai Lama way, yeah, yeah."
00:03:20,00:03:20,- Is that what was he?
00:03:20,00:03:22,- Very Dalai Lama way.
00:03:22,00:03:26,- Have you ever looked at who died just before you were born?
00:03:26,00:03:27,"- No, I never had."
00:03:27,00:03:28,"- Oh, that's a funny thing."
00:03:28,00:03:29,"- There was one of the popes,"
00:03:29,00:03:31,the one that was before John Paul II.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- So I think it was, yeah, just before I was born,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"you died, so I'm not saying anything else,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"but I am Catholic, so."
00:03:39,00:03:41,- I think you could still do it as well.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- I can?
00:03:42,00:03:44,"- Well, no, I've been excommunicated as we've said,"
00:03:44,00:03:44,but.
00:03:44,00:03:46,- But what a comeback story that would be for you.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"- Yeah, and actually the Pope."
00:03:48,00:03:49,- I can change the rules if I'm the Pope.
00:03:49,00:03:50,"- Yes, yeah. - Exactly."
00:03:50,00:03:52,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:03:52,00:03:54,- Let's get back to Noel Coward.
00:03:54,00:03:55,"- I know, I like that."
00:03:55,00:03:58,I was suddenly panicking about who died in 1983.
00:03:58,00:03:59,"- Yeah, lots."
00:03:59,00:04:03,"- Mount Batson, no, that was '70, '70s."
00:04:03,00:04:04,"- Yes, Mount Batson was."
00:04:04,00:04:05,- I went straight through.
00:04:05,00:04:06,- I just got to see what this is.
00:04:06,00:04:08,(laughing)
00:04:08,00:04:10,- We should quickly say who Noel Coward is.
00:04:10,00:04:11,"Noel Coward, very famous way around."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"- Yes, I didn't bother to say that."
00:04:13,00:04:15,I just assumed all your listeners would know who he was.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"- Yeah, but you know better than anyone,"
00:04:17,00:04:18,'cause you're part of the Noel Coward Society.
00:04:18,00:04:20,"- Well, I have been involved."
00:04:20,00:04:23,"But I, the, the, Noel Coward, yeah,"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"usually seen as a playwright and a writer of songs,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,particularly Mad Dogs and Englishman.
00:04:29,00:04:34,"He was also an actor, musician, and an author as well."
00:04:34,00:04:35,He wrote a novel.
00:04:35,00:04:37,"Well, he was wanted by the sinister,"
00:04:37,00:04:42,"Armstrong, V1, V1, V1, V1, I don't know what,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,I don't know what that looked like.
00:04:43,00:04:44,- I was like a music channel in Germany.
00:04:44,00:04:48,"- I'm so glad for V1, V1, V1, I'm glad to come."
00:04:48,00:04:50,"A department, it was a department that evaluated"
00:04:50,00:04:51,intelligence material.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"Well, he was a, it turned out a British spy."
00:04:54,00:04:56,And his cover had apparently been blown.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"And if the war had gone differently, well,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"the man known the world over further song,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,"""Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans"""
00:05:01,00:05:04,could have ended his days in front of a firing squad.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Wow. - So, yeah."
00:05:06,00:05:09,And when the list was discovered amongst other people
00:05:09,00:05:12,"who the Nazis didn't like for various reasons,"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"and the author Rebecca West sent him a telegram to say,"
00:05:16,00:05:19,"""My dear, the people who were to be seen dead with."""
00:05:19,00:05:22,- It was very cool. - That's very good.
00:05:22,00:05:23,"- This song, interestingly,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"got him in a bit of trouble back home, didn't it?"
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Yeah. - What was it called again?
00:05:27,00:05:28,It was cool.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- ""Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans."""
00:05:29,00:05:32,"- Yeah, so came out during World War II."
00:05:32,00:05:33,It was a satire.
00:05:33,00:05:35,It was-- - It was signed by the BBC.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"- Exactly, because the satire didn't quite cross"
00:05:37,00:05:38,as well as he hoped it would.
00:05:38,00:05:42,They thought that he was actually genuinely saying that.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- I was excited about it, because I think it's the only thing"
00:05:44,00:05:47,that Noel Coward has in common with the prodigy
00:05:47,00:05:49,"I found there, songs ""Smack My Bitch Up,"""
00:05:49,00:05:52,which was also banned by the BBC.
00:05:52,00:05:54,"- Can you imagine that him reading ""Smack My Bitch Up"""
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Noel Coward in his accent? - ""Smack My Bitch Up."""
00:05:56,00:05:59,- He'd have-- I think he'd have gustyed up the lyrics a bit.
00:05:59,00:06:00,He'd have made them cleverer.
00:06:00,00:06:05,"- But I always wondered how he got away with being a spy,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"'cause he was so flamboyant, right?"
00:06:07,00:06:10,It seems like as a spy you have to hide away a little bit.
00:06:10,00:06:15,"- Well, Radio IV did a dramatized version of what he was like."
00:06:15,00:06:17,I think a lot of it as well was propaganda work
00:06:17,00:06:20,"in North America, obviously, the US."
00:06:20,00:06:24,"I think to Ghana support for getting on board with the war effort,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,which I know wasn't the case at the beginning.
00:06:26,00:06:30,"So I think he was seen as sort of a special envoy,"
00:06:30,00:06:31,"I suppose, as much as anything."
00:06:31,00:06:33,I don't think he was going behind enemy lines.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"- No, but I'm-- - Hamburg."
00:06:35,00:06:38,- He'd been recruited even before the war started.
00:06:38,00:06:40,I think there was someone called Sir Robin Vancetart
00:06:40,00:06:42,"who was running-- - Sounds German, actually."
00:06:42,00:06:43,"- Yes, but he was at the foreign office"
00:06:43,00:06:45,and he was recruiting various people
00:06:45,00:06:49,"to go about their business in Europe, quite successful people,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"and then report back on the national mood,"
00:06:51,00:06:55,"what people were saying, just kind of sort of soft intelligence,"
00:06:55,00:06:56,"as it were, not, you know."
00:06:56,00:06:58,You don't need to observe this tank column
00:06:58,00:07:01,"and where it's going, this ball bearings factory."
00:07:01,00:07:03,It was just like what you're hearing in social conversations.
00:07:03,00:07:06,And I think Coward was sacked partly
00:07:06,00:07:09,because he was too public in his maneuverings.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"And also because everyone looked at him,"
00:07:11,00:07:12,"and this is after the war started,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"and they just thought, we've just got to a load of parties"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"and man, happening, you're really letting the side down."
00:07:17,00:07:19,"And actually, he was doing the war work, like he was doing."
00:07:19,00:07:22,"- He was, he was really publicly shamed about it, I think."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- Yeah. - I think the Daily Mail covered about it,"
00:07:24,00:07:27,"and said like, they said outrage, go it over there,"
00:07:27,00:07:30,"spit it all this money, public money, go to parties."
00:07:30,00:07:32,"- The Daily Mail, who's departed,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,"that's, he's just before the war."
00:07:33,00:07:35,"- Ooh. - Well, it might, yeah, I mean."
00:07:35,00:07:36,"- Yeah. - But I should check,"
00:07:36,00:07:37,"I should check, it was the Daily Mail,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,but it's out there and I'm lovely.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- Well, he used to, again, trouble with the daily express."
00:07:42,00:07:44,"- Yeah, and actually, this is another war connection."
00:07:44,00:07:47,"So he wrote the screenplay and started a movie called,"
00:07:47,00:07:51,"in which we serve, which was a really good movie,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,often got used to get the morale up
00:07:53,00:07:55,and show how the war was going.
00:07:55,00:07:59,And he kind of based the character on your past life.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"- No, that's, and yeah."
00:08:00,00:08:03,- So he consulted with him and that was largely part of it.
00:08:03,00:08:04,- Could we say who went back and was it?
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- Sorry, yeah. - Yeah, he was,"
00:08:06,00:08:09,"he was. - Oh, oh, Mountbaton, I think."
00:08:09,00:08:12,"- Oh, Mountbaton. - Yeah, Lord Mountbaton, wasn't he?"
00:08:12,00:08:13,"- Oh, yeah. - Yeah."
00:08:13,00:08:16,"- And he was, he was Prince Philip's uncle"
00:08:16,00:08:20,"by loose connection, I haven't researched it."
00:08:20,00:08:23,"- By big, the brother of his mother, or, yeah."
00:08:23,00:08:26,So it's kind of like loosely unpleased to him.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"- Is it like one of those uncles,"
00:08:28,00:08:29,who's like just friends with your parents?
00:08:29,00:08:31,"- I have a feeling if we're, yeah, exactly."
00:08:31,00:08:35,And you were shocked at some point
00:08:35,00:08:36,to find out that wasn't your uncle.
00:08:36,00:08:37,I remember this when I was five.
00:08:37,00:08:39,I found out Uncle Joe wasn't my uncle.
00:08:39,00:08:40,And I was a bit outraged.
00:08:40,00:08:43,"- Uncle Joe. - Yeah, I was in a cup of coffee."
00:08:43,00:08:46,"- Yeah, so anyway, Mountbaton was part of this thing"
00:08:46,00:08:47,with Noel Coward.
00:08:47,00:08:50,"And the daily express started ridiculing the production,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,saying that how could you have Noel Coward play
00:08:53,00:08:56,a high-ranking general in the army?
00:08:56,00:08:57,- He's a captain.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"- A captain, right?"
00:08:59,00:09:00,- In the Navy. - He wasn't.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"- Yeah, yeah, he didn't come across."
00:09:02,00:09:04,"- Apart from that, don't carry on."
00:09:04,00:09:07,- I feel like I'm going quite lost in it.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"- Sorry, no, I'm barely tripping it."
00:09:09,00:09:12,"Well, I mean, I'm pretty sure he's a captain."
00:09:12,00:09:13,"I haven't watched it, bro."
00:09:13,00:09:15,- I haven't seen the movie and you're a part of the sustain.
00:09:15,00:09:16,And you're being absolutely pancake
00:09:16,00:09:18,between Tom's love of Noel Coward
00:09:18,00:09:19,and my love of military rank.
00:09:19,00:09:20,(laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:21,Sorry.
00:09:21,00:09:23,- Just bring a bit of golf into it.
00:09:23,00:09:24,- You absolutely can't.
00:09:24,00:09:26,(laughing)
00:09:26,00:09:26,- Yeah.
00:09:26,00:09:29,"- It seems quite out of time to me, Noel Coward."
00:09:29,00:09:31,"- I know his name and I know he's part of the plays,"
00:09:31,00:09:32,"but I do, you mentioned Oscar Wilde"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"before I do play some as part of that era,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,but he was in things like the Italian job.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Yes.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- He was, you know, in the '60s."
00:09:39,00:09:40,- Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"- That was his, I think, his last acting role."
00:09:42,00:09:43,- Right.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- He was born in 1899.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"And he served briefly in the First World War,"
00:09:46,00:09:47,which I didn't know.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"'Cause again, I think of him as like,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,"he's wearing his pajamas, maybe dressed in gown."
00:09:51,00:09:53,He's smoking a pipe through a long holder.
00:09:53,00:09:55,He's writing brilliant dialogue.
00:09:55,00:09:59,"He's writing plays like Blind Spirit and Haifi, you know."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Yeah.
00:10:00,00:10:00,- Witt.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"- But he served in this company called the,"
00:10:02,00:10:06,"the Artists Rifles, which--"
00:10:06,00:10:07,"- Just sounds awful, doesn't it?"
00:10:07,00:10:11,"I think it was so, yeah, I think it was a place where"
00:10:11,00:10:13,maybe I don't want to be unkind.
00:10:13,00:10:18,Maybe slightly less useful fighters were replaced.
00:10:18,00:10:21,And I think he wasn't ever put in any sort of position
00:10:21,00:10:23,where he'd have to do anything to practical.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- Well, he got himself out of it quite fast."
00:10:25,00:10:27,"And this was only in, I mean, he was born in 1899."
00:10:27,00:10:29,So I think he was signed up aged 18
00:10:29,00:10:29,or maybe conscripted.
00:10:29,00:10:30,I'm not sure.
00:10:30,00:10:33,"He was discharged for Neurosthenia,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,which was very much a catchal you've got nerves.
00:10:36,00:10:39,- Sort of tying a piece of string around his finger.
00:10:39,00:10:39,- Why?
00:10:39,00:10:41,- I guess it's sort of stress.
00:10:41,00:10:43,"- A stressor situation, definitely."
00:10:43,00:10:45,- It'd be a tick talk about it now.
00:10:45,00:10:47,- But I think part of the reason he got so involved
00:10:47,00:10:49,"in World War II as a spy or whatever,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,is 'cause he was a bit embarrassed by the fact
00:10:51,00:10:54,that he'd gone into World War I quite young
00:10:54,00:10:56,and then had to leave quite quickly.
00:10:56,00:10:58,"- Yeah, his company suffered lots of casualties"
00:10:58,00:10:59,in the last two months of the war.
00:10:59,00:11:00,"I mean, hundreds, you know?"
00:11:00,00:11:02,"So I think, and that was after he'd been"
00:11:02,00:11:03,invalidated out as it were.
00:11:03,00:11:04,So yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:07,- I love the main thing about him outside of his plays
00:11:07,00:11:10,and his acting and his songs is the gossip.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"He was Mr. Annicdote, basically."
00:11:12,00:11:15,He's like the Charles Brandrath of his day.
00:11:15,00:11:16,(laughing)
00:11:16,00:11:17,- Charles will be very happy.
00:11:17,00:11:19,- Charles Brandrath was absolutely in love with that.
00:11:19,00:11:20,(laughing)
00:11:20,00:11:21,Oh my goodness.
00:11:21,00:11:23,What a Christmas breath of joy.
00:11:23,00:11:24,(laughing)
00:11:24,00:11:25,"Well, we'll clip this out inside of him."
00:11:25,00:11:26,- Yes.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"- And so there's one great war, Annicdote from him,"
00:11:29,00:11:31,"which is he said, he never forgot the site"
00:11:31,00:11:34,of Coco Chanel entering a Paris air raid shelter
00:11:34,00:11:36,followed by a maid who carried a gas mask
00:11:36,00:11:38,on a velvet cushion.
00:11:38,00:11:38,(laughing)
00:11:38,00:11:40,- That's wonderful stories.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"- It was a time when people did,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"well, I know there was strata of class,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"but I think if you did transcend those strata,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,you would just end up being at parties with these people.
00:11:50,00:11:50,- Yeah.
00:11:50,00:11:51,"- I don't know, maybe it would be the same now,"
00:11:51,00:11:52,"but I mean, just like--"
00:11:52,00:11:57,"- Because his mother, I think, had some vague sort of connection"
00:11:57,00:11:58,to the aristocracy.
00:11:58,00:11:59,"- Oh, is that really?"
00:11:59,00:12:01,- Maybe like an uncle or something.
00:12:01,00:12:02,(laughing)
00:12:02,00:12:05,"- Yeah, she, like, feel mashable."
00:12:05,00:12:08,"Hague was a distant cousin of hers,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"and her sister married the nephew of Sir Henry Ponsonby,"
00:12:11,00:12:14,who was private secretary to Perquean Victoria.
00:12:14,00:12:15,- Oh.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"- So they were kind of like close to high society,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,but not quite in there until he became very famous
00:12:20,00:12:22,and really hobnobbed with the--
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Right.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"- Yeah, 'cause I don't know what kind of pretty lower middle class"
00:12:25,00:12:29,grew up in Southwest London and very suburban reasonably poor.
00:12:29,00:12:32,And his mum was a real stage mum.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"- Yes, she was the Mrs. Worthington, I think."
00:12:34,00:12:35,She was the real Mrs. Worthington.
00:12:35,00:12:36,- She pushed it.
00:12:36,00:12:38,- Mrs. Worthington is--
00:12:38,00:12:41,"- Oh, is a song, don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington."
00:12:41,00:12:44,"It's kind of a song told from the position of a producer,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"I think, in an audition, but essentially kind of saying"
00:12:46,00:12:48,to this very pushy stage mum.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"She's talentless, please stop putting it into the audience."
00:12:51,00:12:53,But Noel Carrot's career happened partly
00:12:53,00:12:56,because of a medium spiritual guidance.
00:12:56,00:12:59,So his mum went to a show at the Coliseum
00:12:59,00:13:03,and an American celebrity medium Anna Eva Fay.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"And his mum asked, ""Should Noel, young Noel here,"
00:13:06,00:13:10,"go back to school or should he stay as a child actor?"""
00:13:10,00:13:14,And from beneath this big sheet that she was (laughs)
00:13:14,00:13:17,"a medium Anna Fay said, ""Keep acting."""
00:13:17,00:13:18,"- Oh, wow."
00:13:18,00:13:19,"- Yeah, I didn't know that."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"So that was a, I think, I suspect they probably would have kept"
00:13:21,00:13:25,"him acting, even if the medium had said, ""Go back to school!"""
00:13:25,00:13:27,And I suspect the ambition was strong.
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Still there.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"I haven't seen Blife's spirit, but I think it's a very satirical"
00:13:31,00:13:32,about the spiritualism movement.
00:13:32,00:13:33,- Is that right?
00:13:33,00:13:35,Is it sort of parodying it?
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- It was a big drive towards it, wasn't it?"
00:13:37,00:13:38,The 20s and 30s?
00:13:38,00:13:39,- Yeah.
00:13:39,00:13:40,- Yeah.
00:13:40,00:13:41,- Where people would have--
00:13:41,00:13:43,"- Yeah, I guess, I mean, that probably makes sense, doesn't it?"
00:13:43,00:13:48,"But my dad, even remembers his grandmother having her friends"
00:13:48,00:13:51,"around for like a say-on, which isn't it?"
00:13:51,00:13:54,"- Like they go into the back room or something, yeah."
00:13:54,00:13:57,And all these women would come in and try and contact with dad.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Yeah.
00:13:58,00:14:01,- But it was kind of seen as his thing that people do quite
00:14:01,00:14:02,socially.
00:14:02,00:14:03,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:03,00:14:04,- It was like a book club of its day.
00:14:04,00:14:07,"- The book club of its day, exactly."
00:14:07,00:14:11,"- His writing was extraordinary, the speed at which he wrote,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,because there were so many knoll-coward plays.
00:14:13,00:14:17,"There was a story that, in 1935, in the summer of that year"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"alone, he wrote nine plays."
00:14:20,00:14:22,"That's how quick he knocked out a song called ""I'll See You Again,"""
00:14:22,00:14:25,which Frank Sinatra recorded while he was stuck in a taxi
00:14:25,00:14:26,in a traffic jam.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"- It's similar to, I think, Elton John, in the way"
00:14:29,00:14:32,"that he, apparently, writes his songs in five minutes."
00:14:32,00:14:33,- I really do.
00:14:33,00:14:35,- That's the tangents and tiaras.
00:14:35,00:14:36,It's something about that creativity.
00:14:36,00:14:39,It's something quite useful about actually not allowing
00:14:39,00:14:40,lots of time.
00:14:40,00:14:40,- Yes.
00:14:40,00:14:44,- And he also says the songs slightly come to him.
00:14:44,00:14:45,He doesn't claim to have written.
00:14:45,00:14:46,- Is that Elton John now?
00:14:46,00:14:46,- Yeah.
00:14:46,00:14:49,- Elton John will say that the songs sort of arrived to him.
00:14:49,00:14:53,"- After the war, just to go back to his sort of post-war life,"
00:14:53,00:14:58,he spent a lot of time with the Navy.
00:14:58,00:15:02,"And in fact, during the war as well,"
00:15:02,00:15:06,he frequently would just hitch a lift on royal Navy ships.
00:15:06,00:15:07,- Really?
00:15:07,00:15:07,- Yeah.
00:15:07,00:15:08,- He would just...
00:15:08,00:15:10,- So he had to get on that.
00:15:10,00:15:13,"- Well, how did he get off?"
00:15:13,00:15:17,- He spent a lot of his life as a tax exile
00:15:17,00:15:19,because he was so financially successful
00:15:19,00:15:20,in the first half of his life
00:15:20,00:15:22,that a lot of his life was just moving around
00:15:22,00:15:25,to different low-taxed jurisdictions.
00:15:25,00:15:28,And he once joined a ship in Bermuda called H.M. Dragon
00:15:28,00:15:30,"and, or H.M.S. Dragon, maybe."
00:15:30,00:15:32,"And the captain said, ""What the hell are you doing"
00:15:32,00:15:33,"on board this ship?"""
00:15:33,00:15:35,"And Coward replied that he was,"
00:15:35,00:15:38,"quote, ""exhausted overworked on the verge of a nervous breakdown"
00:15:38,00:15:40,and to join the ship in order to be nurse back to health
00:15:40,00:15:44,"strength and wait it on hand and foot."""
00:15:44,00:15:46,"And the captain not only gave him a lift to Trinidad,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,he gave him loads more lifts later on.
00:15:48,00:15:49,They became friends.
00:15:49,00:15:51,- This was just like...
00:15:51,00:15:52,"- Is as well as a naval captain,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,you might be quite pleased
00:15:54,00:15:56,"that if somebody, which he and famous,"
00:15:56,00:15:57,was suddenly on board.
00:15:57,00:15:57,"- Oh, yeah, great."
00:15:57,00:15:58,- That's the entertainment.
00:15:58,00:15:59,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:15:59,00:16:02,- And better than the inser or whatever it's called.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- You say he was rich, he was so rich."
00:16:04,00:16:07,"He was making £50,000 a year,"
00:16:07,00:16:08,"the equivalent of which today,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,that would be £15 million per year
00:16:10,00:16:12,that he was making in the late 20s.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"- In the late 20s and he was really burning through it, though,"
00:16:15,00:16:16,so he had a lot of financial problems
00:16:16,00:16:20,"and hence moving to tax havens like Jamaica,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,where he moved right next door to Ian Fleming.
00:16:23,00:16:23,"- Oh, yes."
00:16:23,00:16:24,- Yeah.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"- Yeah, I love this spy."
00:16:25,00:16:26,- Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:29,"- And there are stories that he turned down the role of Doctor No,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,that that was actually offered to him for the first bond.
00:16:31,00:16:33,- He was just called Doctor before they offered it to him.
00:16:33,00:16:34,(laughing)
00:16:34,00:16:36,- Doctor Noel Coward.
00:16:36,00:16:37,- That's the original.
00:16:37,00:16:41,(laughing)
00:16:41,00:16:47,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:16:47,00:16:49,and that is my fact.
00:16:49,00:16:52,My fact this week is that there is a Marvel superhero
00:16:52,00:16:53,"called The Gardener,"
00:16:53,00:16:57,whose superpower is that he is insanely good at gardening.
00:16:57,00:17:01,"- So is it that he can grow things very, very fast?"
00:17:01,00:17:05,"- No, it's more that he is obsessed with gardening."
00:17:05,00:17:06,(laughing)
00:17:06,00:17:08,- And he is almost an immortal.
00:17:08,00:17:10,- Gardener gets supposed to be good for you
00:17:10,00:17:11,if you're getting older.
00:17:11,00:17:12,- Yeah.
00:17:12,00:17:13,"- Like it helps you live longer, doesn't it?"
00:17:13,00:17:14,- Exactly.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"- Well, yeah, and potentially forever."
00:17:17,00:17:18,- It's your life.
00:17:18,00:17:18,- It's forever.
00:17:18,00:17:20,- You give enough time to it.
00:17:20,00:17:23,So he's part of this group called The Elders of the Universe.
00:17:23,00:17:23,"And basically,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,the other one is really good at bowls.
00:17:25,00:17:28,(laughing)
00:17:28,00:17:32,- The other one is just really good at being racist.
00:17:32,00:17:34,(laughing)
00:17:34,00:17:36,"- Absolutely ruins Christmas, yeah."
00:17:36,00:17:38,"- Captain Crossword, come and say it."
00:17:38,00:17:40,(laughing)
00:17:40,00:17:42,"- Yeah, okay, these are each of them"
00:17:42,00:17:44,with the last survivors of their own race.
00:17:44,00:17:47,And these were races that evolved just after the Big Bang.
00:17:47,00:17:51,"And the idea is that they have extended lifespans,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"but not because of a mortal,"
00:17:53,00:17:57,but because of a single-minded obsession with a hobby.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- That's cool.
00:17:58,00:17:58,- Yeah.
00:17:58,00:18:00,"- That can be, I'll back that."
00:18:00,00:18:01,- There you go.
00:18:01,00:18:03,So his hobby was gardening and horticulture.
00:18:03,00:18:06,And the idea is that he would go from planet to planet
00:18:06,00:18:08,"and he would spend sort of up to a year,"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"sort of terraforming it, making it greener guys."
00:18:11,00:18:12,"- Yeah, that's sad."
00:18:12,00:18:14,"- Yeah, it might come into his own, actually."
00:18:14,00:18:15,- Yeah.
00:18:15,00:18:16,- I'm actually conscious age.
00:18:16,00:18:17,- There you go.
00:18:17,00:18:18,"Well, he should be a bigger character"
00:18:18,00:18:19,'cause actually in the original--
00:18:19,00:18:20,- I think I should play him.
00:18:20,00:18:22,(laughing)
00:18:22,00:18:23,"- In the original stories,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,"he and the other Elders all had the Infinity Gems,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,which is what Thanos collects
00:18:28,00:18:30,as part of the main Avengers storyline
00:18:30,00:18:32,in order to wipe out all of--
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- Oh, so he's one of the original holders of one of these?"
00:18:34,00:18:35,- Yeah.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"And because some reason when it came to the movie adapted,"
00:18:38,00:18:39,the gardener didn't quite get--
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Pretty cool.
00:18:40,00:18:41,That's what I'm thinking.
00:18:41,00:18:41,"- Oh, right."
00:18:41,00:18:42,- I'm talking about that.
00:18:42,00:18:44,"- Yeah, but yeah, I'd love that."
00:18:44,00:18:44,- Yeah.
00:18:44,00:18:46,- I've seen with like a big wide-brimmed hat.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- Yeah.
00:18:47,00:18:49,"- You know, the sort of thing that old ladies used to have."
00:18:49,00:18:50,"- Oh, yes, yeah."
00:18:50,00:18:51,(laughing)
00:18:51,00:18:52,- Loves on--
00:18:52,00:18:54,"- Obviously, floral gloves in one of those kneeling pads."
00:18:54,00:18:55,- I've got one.
00:18:55,00:18:56,- I've got one.
00:18:56,00:18:57,- They are very useful.
00:18:57,00:18:58,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:58,00:18:59,- The best ones when you've got a handle at the side
00:18:59,00:19:01,"- Push yourself up. - Ooh, yeah, they're good."
00:19:01,00:19:04,"- It's like an upside-down cano store, really."
00:19:04,00:19:05,- That's really helpful.
00:19:05,00:19:07,- And then you've got just to have a couple of beats
00:19:07,00:19:08,"to be like, ""Oh, with my knees."""
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:19:09,00:19:10,- They carry on.
00:19:10,00:19:12,"- Okay, we're talking to a seasoned gardener here, I'm guessing."
00:19:12,00:19:15,"- Well, I's salty, maybe, if it's just about seasoned."
00:19:15,00:19:16,(laughing)
00:19:16,00:19:18,"- You do have a garden, though, that you love to--"
00:19:18,00:19:21,- I've got-- I've gotten into gardening.
00:19:21,00:19:23,I like to use the past tense of God.
00:19:23,00:19:26,And I've gotten into gardening in the last sort of four years
00:19:26,00:19:28,since having my own place.
00:19:28,00:19:29,"For a long time, I lived with my parents"
00:19:29,00:19:33,and I didn't have my own space then.
00:19:33,00:19:36,"And so now I do, and it's quite nice just to--"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- Well, just mess around, really."
00:19:37,00:19:39,"I'm proud and obvious with it,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,but I find it really interesting.
00:19:40,00:19:43,"- So on famous gardeners, who's the most famous gardener"
00:19:43,00:19:44,in the UK?
00:19:44,00:19:45,- Alan Titchfash. - Correct.
00:19:45,00:19:48,- What has Alan Titchfash got in common
00:19:48,00:19:50,with Elvis Presley?
00:19:50,00:19:54,"- Ooh, okay, both from Memphis, that's obvious."
00:19:54,00:19:56,(laughing)
00:19:56,00:19:58,- Both sex gods.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"- Okay, I'll give you that."
00:19:59,00:20:01,It's slightly related to that.
00:20:01,00:20:01,- Poets?
00:20:01,00:20:03,"- He writes poetry, Titchfash."
00:20:03,00:20:04,- It's not that.
00:20:04,00:20:05,- Okay. - I've been to jail.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"- Well, Elvis had a song about it."
00:20:08,00:20:10,"Titchfash was done out for years, wasn't he?"
00:20:10,00:20:11,"- For years, yeah."
00:20:11,00:20:13,- That's why he has honest tattoos.
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Yeah.
00:20:14,00:20:15,(laughing)
00:20:15,00:20:17,- Come as them up for the show of class.
00:20:17,00:20:19,(laughing)
00:20:19,00:20:23,- One for everybody killed in prison.
00:20:23,00:20:25,- It's how he got into gardening was burying the bodies.
00:20:25,00:20:28,(laughing)
00:20:28,00:20:30,- The answer is that the lower halves
00:20:30,00:20:33,have been censored on television.
00:20:33,00:20:34,- Really?
00:20:34,00:20:36,"- So Elvis, obviously, when he became big,"
00:20:36,00:20:39,they would only show him from the waist up
00:20:39,00:20:41,so that people didn't get too excited.
00:20:41,00:20:44,But Alan Titchfash has been--
00:20:44,00:20:45,- They were censored for the waist out.
00:20:45,00:20:48,(laughing)
00:20:48,00:20:53,- They have censored his trousers
00:20:53,00:20:56,"because he was jeans and in North Korea,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,they don't like jeans being shown
00:20:58,00:21:00,because it's a symbol of America.
00:21:00,00:21:01,"So they show his programs,"
00:21:01,00:21:03,but they blur out his trousers.
00:21:03,00:21:04,- Wow.
00:21:04,00:21:06,- But that means he's free to broadcast
00:21:06,00:21:07,when he the post-style.
00:21:07,00:21:08,- Yeah.
00:21:08,00:21:09,(laughing)
00:21:09,00:21:12,"- So the North Korean that works, he's--"
00:21:12,00:21:13,- He's there.
00:21:13,00:21:15,- You have to paint his legs blue.
00:21:15,00:21:16,(laughing)
00:21:16,00:21:19,- I've seen Titchfash do karaoke.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"- Have you, in person?"
00:21:20,00:21:21,- In person.
00:21:21,00:21:22,- Wow. - I don't mean to clang.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- What did he say?
00:21:23,00:21:26,"Something green, green grass."
00:21:26,00:21:29,"- It was, or what's the one I killed a man in Reno?"
00:21:29,00:21:31,(laughing)
00:21:31,00:21:34,- Gangster's paradise as well.
00:21:34,00:21:36,(laughing)
00:21:36,00:21:41,"- Yeah, I don't remember the song, but it was, yeah."
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- Wow, that's very cool."
00:21:42,00:21:43,"Well, there's other reasons"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"that Alan Titchfash is a sex god, by the way,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,which is that as well as writing over something
00:21:48,00:21:50,"like 70 gardening books,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,he's written a series of novels.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"- Yes, they are."
00:21:53,00:21:54,- Are they seen?
00:21:54,00:21:55,- Are they?
00:21:55,00:21:56,"- Yeah, in fact, I don't know if you remember,"
00:21:56,00:22:00,but we had Lou Sanders read Morrissey's contribution
00:22:00,00:22:02,to the world of sex scenes.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"- Tom, do you mind?"
00:22:04,00:22:06,- I've got a little extra here.
00:22:06,00:22:06,"- Oh, here we go."
00:22:06,00:22:09,"- Well, I think I have met Alan a few times"
00:22:09,00:22:12,"and he's always very charming, as you'd imagine."
00:22:12,00:22:16,"And he did say to me, 'cause I was talking to him"
00:22:16,00:22:20,"about audio books, and he did say he was very aware"
00:22:20,00:22:23,of his more intimate scenes when he had to sit
00:22:23,00:22:27,"in a booth, and read them out, to an engineer."
00:22:27,00:22:31,"So as an example of what he might have been reading,"
00:22:31,00:22:32,there is a little bit here.
00:22:32,00:22:36,She planted moist hot kisses all over his body.
00:22:36,00:22:40,"Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead for it,"
00:22:40,00:22:44,as he became more entangled in the lism limbs
00:22:44,00:22:46,of this human bower constrictor.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"It's only 15 minutes, their mutual passion heightened"
00:22:52,00:22:56,"with groans, sighs, and liquid noises."
00:22:56,00:22:58,(laughing)
00:22:58,00:23:02,"- Oh, wow, can I just say, when you're describing lens,"
00:23:02,00:23:05,why'd go for the one animal that doesn't have any lens?
00:23:05,00:23:07,"- Little lism, lism limb."
00:23:07,00:23:09,- I don't know what lism means.
00:23:09,00:23:10,- I've never heard that word before.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"- Lism is kind of young and firm and strong, isn't it?"
00:23:13,00:23:14,- Is it?
00:23:14,00:23:15,"- Oh, sorry."
00:23:15,00:23:16,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:16,00:23:18,"- Rich marshes, too highbrow for us."
00:23:18,00:23:19,We don't know the vocabulary.
00:23:19,00:23:20,"- I know, I bet he lism."
00:23:20,00:23:22,- He's a very educated man.
00:23:22,00:23:26,- I like the way it begins with sheep planted kisses.
00:23:26,00:23:28,"Like, 'cause obviously he's a gardener."
00:23:28,00:23:29,- Absolutely.
00:23:29,00:23:30,"- Oh, every, every."
00:23:30,00:23:32,"- Well, he was wonderful."
00:23:32,00:23:35,- So he was runner up in the 1998 Literary Review
00:23:35,00:23:36,Bad Sex Awards.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"And you're right, he felt very uncomfortable reading them."
00:23:39,00:23:43,"He said, particularly with a sheet of glass between you"
00:23:43,00:23:46,"and a very large bearded man, twiddling knobs,"
00:23:46,00:23:49,"as you say the words, he found it uncomfortable."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"- I think it's a bit unfair that bad sex thing,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,"'cause they go for slabs, don't they?"
00:23:53,00:23:54,- Yeah.
00:23:54,00:23:55,- There must be loads of like not famous people
00:23:55,00:23:56,who are writing worse.
00:23:56,00:23:57,- Absolutely.
00:23:57,00:23:58,- What?
00:23:58,00:23:59,"- To be fair, the winner that year was Sebastian Forks."
00:23:59,00:24:01,- I was gonna say bird song.
00:24:01,00:24:04,"It's got lots of that, that's very interesting."
00:24:04,00:24:05,- Bird song's got some very fruity stuff in it.
00:24:05,00:24:07,- So he was very fruity.
00:24:07,00:24:08,- I remember reading that when I was about 17
00:24:08,00:24:11,"and thinking, oh gosh, that seems like a lot of effort."
00:24:11,00:24:13,(laughing)
00:24:13,00:24:14,- Can I ask you about a couple of things you might
00:24:14,00:24:16,"or might not use in your garden, Tom?"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"- Oh yeah, absolutely."
00:24:18,00:24:18,- Should we give it a go?
00:24:18,00:24:19,Right.
00:24:19,00:24:23,Do you ever use worm poo tea bags?
00:24:23,00:24:26,"No, I think I have heard of this sort of thing."
00:24:26,00:24:27,- So cool.
00:24:27,00:24:28,"- Worms are very important, aren't they?"
00:24:28,00:24:29,- Worms are vital.
00:24:29,00:24:30,- And obviously they eat soil.
00:24:30,00:24:31,They poo it out.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"You know, they help."
00:24:32,00:24:33,- So do I.
00:24:33,00:24:35,"- They do their aerate, all sorts of stuff."
00:24:35,00:24:38,"You can get tea bags with worm castings, are you worm poo?"
00:24:38,00:24:40,Where you literally make a cup of tea out of it
00:24:40,00:24:43,for your plant and it really helps your plant.
00:24:43,00:24:43,- Really?
00:24:43,00:24:45,- Lion urine?
00:24:45,00:24:46,"- Well that's the thing, isn't it?"
00:24:46,00:24:49,Because people say to keep away foxes or other animals
00:24:49,00:24:51,if you want them out of your garden.
00:24:51,00:24:51,- You need an apex predator.
00:24:51,00:24:52,"- You need an apex, you can't."
00:24:52,00:24:54,"The people say, oh just go and we in the garden"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"and then like, no, then you mend to we in the garden."
00:24:56,00:24:57,It's male urine they respond to.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"And apparently that's not, that's not going to do it."
00:25:00,00:25:01,"Apparently you need to go to the zoo and ask,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,"yeah, I'm going to get a lion to we into a cup."
00:25:03,00:25:06,(laughing)
00:25:06,00:25:08,- Or you can get the piss off plant.
00:25:08,00:25:09,- Have you heard of that?
00:25:09,00:25:09,- What's that?
00:25:09,00:25:11,- Piss off plant is a plant that's native
00:25:11,00:25:15,to southern in eastern Africa and it is a plant
00:25:15,00:25:19,that supposedly repels dogs and cats from coming near it
00:25:19,00:25:21,because of the aroma that it emits.
00:25:21,00:25:23,"So if you had that in your garden,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,most likely they would smell it and never come back again.
00:25:26,00:25:26,- I'll get one of it.
00:25:26,00:25:28,"- That's pretty good, that's a great idea."
00:25:28,00:25:31,Do you have an ornamental hermit in your garden?
00:25:31,00:25:34,"- No, I don't have anything like that."
00:25:34,00:25:35,"That was like a sort of a little house,"
00:25:35,00:25:36,wasn't it worded a little.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Well back in the 18th century,"
00:25:38,00:25:39,this was a real life human
00:25:39,00:25:41,that you would bring into your garden.
00:25:41,00:25:42,- Yeah.
00:25:42,00:25:43,- They would dress like a druid
00:25:43,00:25:44,and they would just be sat
00:25:44,00:25:47,and they would have a contract to live there
00:25:47,00:25:51,and negotiations for roaches and negotiations
00:25:51,00:25:53,every autumn as the roaches.
00:25:53,00:25:55,"- Well look, I'm not gonna do this for another year."
00:25:55,00:25:58,Let's you revise my terms.
00:25:58,00:26:00,"- No, yeah, it's been in 1797."
00:26:00,00:26:01,"There was a thing written up that said,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,the hermit is never to leave the place
00:26:03,00:26:05,or hold conversation with anyone for seven years
00:26:05,00:26:07,during which he is neither to wash himself
00:26:07,00:26:09,or cleanse himself in any way whatsoever.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- Yeah, my agent's got a problem with his clothes"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"and I'm like, yeah, (laughing)"
00:26:13,00:26:15,agent lives a bit further down the garden
00:26:15,00:26:16,and another little folly.
00:26:16,00:26:17,- Yeah.
00:26:17,00:26:20,- Do we know why people did that?
00:26:20,00:26:22,"- Well, I think it's a kind of,"
00:26:22,00:26:25,it would be like landed gentry would have this person.
00:26:25,00:26:27,You wouldn't have it in your garden in the hackney.
00:26:27,00:26:28,"- I think, no, exactly."
00:26:28,00:26:29,"I think what it is is,"
00:26:29,00:26:32,the hermit is a symbol of a wilder
00:26:32,00:26:34,and ancient way of living
00:26:34,00:26:37,and it's kind of they are reflecting on history
00:26:37,00:26:41,and on humanity and on progress and the countryside
00:26:41,00:26:44,and the wilderness and I think that's why it's cool
00:26:44,00:26:46,to have a hermit 'cause they kind of hark back to that.
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:48,- Okay.
00:26:48,00:26:49,- This has been that kind of sentimentality
00:26:49,00:26:50,isn't it around that kind of pastoral?
00:26:50,00:26:52,"- Yeah, it all."
00:26:52,00:26:53,- There was one place which had a hermit
00:26:53,00:26:55,which turned out to be a mechanical hermit.
00:26:55,00:26:56,- Genuinely.
00:26:56,00:26:58,- I think it was an 18th century aristocrat.
00:26:58,00:27:00,- Quite clearly it was a hermit.
00:27:00,00:27:02,(laughing)
00:27:02,00:27:04,"- It was like a very, very, very crude"
00:27:04,00:27:07,model robo hermit that they had in there.
00:27:07,00:27:07,- With that thing.
00:27:07,00:27:09,- Here's another famous gardener.
00:27:09,00:27:13,So this is a king called hermiti
00:27:13,00:27:16,who was in ancient Sumer
00:27:16,00:27:18,and what would happen in ancient Sumer
00:27:18,00:27:20,is you would get people who would tell the future
00:27:20,00:27:22,"and if they saw a bad omen,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,"like maybe the king's gonna die,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,"you would put someone else on the throne,"
00:27:26,00:27:29,400 days and then you take over again.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"So this guy, hermiti, decided to put his gardener"
00:27:33,00:27:35,on the throne for 100 days 'cause there'd been a bad omen
00:27:35,00:27:38,and then he died after eating some hot porridge
00:27:38,00:27:41,and his gardener then reigned ancient Sumer
00:27:41,00:27:42,for 24 years.
00:27:42,00:27:44,(laughing)
00:27:44,00:27:46,- Just 'cause he didn't blow on it.
00:27:46,00:27:47,- I guess so.
00:27:47,00:27:48,"- Oh, the porridge."
00:27:48,00:27:49,- Yeah.
00:27:49,00:27:50,- That's incredible.
00:27:50,00:27:51,- I know.
00:27:51,00:27:53,- I guess wasn't a successor in place
00:27:53,00:27:54,who would not have taken over the throne.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"- Well, he's the king now, right?"
00:27:56,00:27:57,"- Yeah, you're right."
00:27:57,00:27:58,- So what are you gonna do?
00:27:58,00:28:00,- That's so funny.
00:28:00,00:28:02,(laughing)
00:28:02,00:28:05,(upbeat music)
00:28:05,00:28:07,(upbeat music)
00:28:07,00:28:09,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:28:09,00:28:10,and that is Andy.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"- My fact is, in 1920, the King of Greece died"
00:28:13,00:28:17,after trying to break up a fight between a dog and a monkey.
00:28:17,00:28:18,(laughing)
00:28:18,00:28:20,This is the only royal death I've found
00:28:20,00:28:23,"which involved a monkey at all, actually."
00:28:23,00:28:24,- Mm-hmm.
00:28:24,00:28:26,- Little end of the fight between a dog and a monkey.
00:28:26,00:28:26,- Okay.
00:28:26,00:28:29,- This was King Alexander of Greece
00:28:29,00:28:32,"and he had a dog, he had a German shepherd"
00:28:32,00:28:34,and one day he was having a walk in there.
00:28:34,00:28:39,I think the palace grounds and I think a Barbary ape.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"- Quite an aggressive, yeah, not a titler of a monkey."
00:28:42,00:28:44,"- Oh, no, no, this isn't like Bubbles."
00:28:44,00:28:46,"- No, no, no, no, this is proper."
00:28:46,00:28:49,"- They're very naughty Barbary apes, I can say."
00:28:49,00:28:50,They all know.
00:28:50,00:28:51,"- Yeah, it's naughty."
00:28:51,00:28:53,(laughing)
00:28:53,00:28:54,- They'll kill your dog.
00:28:54,00:28:55,(laughing)
00:28:55,00:28:57,"- Slotering your dog in front, yeah."
00:28:57,00:28:57,- All you King.
00:28:57,00:29:00,"- They have the man to brawl to them, yes."
00:29:00,00:29:02,And I went up there with a pusher
00:29:02,00:29:04,with my daughter who is very young
00:29:04,00:29:06,"and basically, they will just steal everything."
00:29:06,00:29:09,"Everything that's not held down, they'll steal it."
00:29:09,00:29:10,- You got it back though.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"- No, she still lives there."
00:29:12,00:29:14,(laughing)
00:29:14,00:29:15,- She is the ape queen now.
00:29:15,00:29:16,(laughing)
00:29:16,00:29:18,- That's why I bow to for Brexit.
00:29:18,00:29:19,I don't want it to be Spanish.
00:29:19,00:29:22,(laughing)
00:29:22,00:29:25,"- Yeah, so anyway, this ape and this dog were in a fight."
00:29:25,00:29:26,"He was trying to separate them,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,at which point the apes wife turned up
00:29:28,00:29:31,and sunk fangs into King Alexander's leg.
00:29:31,00:29:33,- Oh no.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"- And I think some days later, he died, he'd become ill"
00:29:35,00:29:39,"and they had swithered over what to do, the doctors and so."
00:29:39,00:29:42,- So he died and this produced huge geopolitical consequences
00:29:42,00:29:44,"with Churchill later wrote,"
00:29:44,00:29:45,it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark
00:29:45,00:29:48,that a quarter of a million persons died
00:29:48,00:29:49,of this monkey's bite.
00:29:49,00:29:50,- Really?
00:29:50,00:29:51,- Yeah.
00:29:51,00:29:51,- Wow.
00:29:51,00:29:53,- Because they've spent the Greek Civil War.
00:29:53,00:29:57,"- Well, it all led to a lot of unhappiness and conflict"
00:29:57,00:29:58,inside Greece.
00:29:58,00:30:00,They got back the previous King.
00:30:00,00:30:03,Because what had happened to the previous King was very pro German
00:30:03,00:30:06,"and his son was pro German, his eldest son."
00:30:06,00:30:09,And so Britain and Russia and probably France
00:30:09,00:30:11,got rid of those guys and brought in this guy
00:30:11,00:30:13,who wasn't expecting to be King.
00:30:13,00:30:15,Like he was just thought he was gonna spend his days gardening
00:30:15,00:30:17,off just having a lot of fun.
00:30:17,00:30:18,- Having a lovely life.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"- Yeah, and then suddenly he's King."
00:30:20,00:30:23,"And then, you know, okay, well now we've got our puppet"
00:30:23,00:30:25,"who's in charge, but then he dies"
00:30:25,00:30:26,and then they bring the old people back
00:30:26,00:30:27,and it all goes to shit.
00:30:27,00:30:29,"- That's basically what happened, yeah."
00:30:29,00:30:31,And then he fought this war against the Turks
00:30:31,00:30:34,"which went disastrously wrong, hundreds of thousands of deaths."
00:30:34,00:30:36,The royalists were kicked out.
00:30:36,00:30:38,And then the European Great Powers just started picking
00:30:38,00:30:39,the Greek royal family.
00:30:39,00:30:42,And then eventually things got a bit more democratic.
00:30:42,00:30:47,"And the Greeks in 1862 had this vote for a new King,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,a kind of national referendum.
00:30:49,00:30:53,"And they almost universally, they chose Prince Alfred of England"
00:30:53,00:30:55,who I believe was one of Victoria's sons.
00:30:55,00:30:56,- Yes.
00:30:56,00:30:58,- He won 95% of the vote's cast.
00:30:58,00:31:02,"He said no, no thank you, I don't want to do it."
00:31:02,00:31:04,- You used the throne of Greece.
00:31:04,00:31:06,"- Yeah, but imagine he probably had a nice house"
00:31:06,00:31:07,"somewhere, wouldn't he?"
00:31:07,00:31:09,"- I'm sure he's already got a nice, you're right."
00:31:09,00:31:10,"- You're right, yeah, that nice."
00:31:10,00:31:11,"- Well yeah, was that?"
00:31:11,00:31:12,- That was 1862.
00:31:12,00:31:15,"- So this is not happening in the 1860s, wasn't it?"
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- Oh, going on."
00:31:16,00:31:16,- Bucket.
00:31:16,00:31:18,- Was that unification of Germany around then?
00:31:18,00:31:19,- Yes.
00:31:19,00:31:20,- And then formation of Italy.
00:31:20,00:31:20,- Yes.
00:31:20,00:31:22,- Also my house was built.
00:31:22,00:31:23,- Really?
00:31:23,00:31:24,- So some major events.
00:31:24,00:31:25,"- Major, major things too."
00:31:25,00:31:27,"- So your garden, that was laid out and was created."
00:31:27,00:31:28,- Yeah.
00:31:28,00:31:29,- By Prince Alfred.
00:31:29,00:31:30,- And actually around the corner from me.
00:31:30,00:31:32,And Napoleon III came to live.
00:31:32,00:31:33,- Is that so?
00:31:33,00:31:34,"- No, really."
00:31:34,00:31:35,"- Wow, so there you go."
00:31:35,00:31:36,- So we've asked to take a huge decade.
00:31:36,00:31:37,- A huge decade.
00:31:37,00:31:38,- A huge decade.
00:31:38,00:31:39,But basically Alfred was pressured into saying no
00:31:39,00:31:41,"'cause Britain, France, and Russia had all to creed."
00:31:41,00:31:43,Nobody's going to accept this throne.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"- Nobody wants it, get over it."
00:31:45,00:31:47,- And every candidate said no until they got to Prince
00:31:47,00:31:50,Wilhelm of Denmark of the Blocksburg House
00:31:50,00:31:52,and he had received six votes
00:31:52,00:31:54,from the entire population of Greece.
00:31:54,00:31:56,And he was then chosen to be the king.
00:31:56,00:31:57,- That is unfortunate.
00:31:57,00:31:58,- I know.
00:31:58,00:32:01,- I think he was 18th highest voted person in that list.
00:32:01,00:32:02,- He came 18th.
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:05,"- But various people had just written a Russian king, please."
00:32:05,00:32:06,Or whatever.
00:32:06,00:32:07,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:07,00:32:07,"- They just selected, like they just listed it."
00:32:07,00:32:09,So he came almost dead last.
00:32:09,00:32:11,And yet he then was king for 50 years.
00:32:11,00:32:13,"- King, like king face was there."
00:32:13,00:32:14,- Who they really wanted.
00:32:14,00:32:15,- Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"- And then he lasted until 1913, he lasted 50 years."
00:32:18,00:32:18,- Yeah.
00:32:18,00:32:19,- 1930.
00:32:19,00:32:20,- 1913.
00:32:20,00:32:24,- He was assassinated by either a socialist or a lunatic.
00:32:24,00:32:26,And it's not clear which apparently.
00:32:26,00:32:27,- Not necessarily.
00:32:27,00:32:28,- Not to get political.
00:32:28,00:32:31,(laughing)
00:32:31,00:32:33,- Lots of assassinations happening around that sort of area
00:32:33,00:32:35,whether that time.
00:32:35,00:32:35,- Yes.
00:32:35,00:32:36,- They loved it.
00:32:36,00:32:37,"- A vexed, vexed period."
00:32:37,00:32:39,- A vexed period in the south-east of Europe.
00:32:39,00:32:40,- Yeah.
00:32:40,00:32:43,- I found another monkey bite death.
00:32:43,00:32:44,- Oh.
00:32:44,00:32:45,- Did you?
00:32:45,00:32:46,- Didn't expect to find one.
00:32:46,00:32:48,But I tried hard and I got there.
00:32:48,00:32:50,- Do you know the character Grizzly Adams?
00:32:50,00:32:51,- Grizzly Adams.
00:32:51,00:32:52,- So barely.
00:32:52,00:32:53,- He was making a bet.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"- No, no."
00:32:54,00:32:54,(laughing)
00:32:54,00:32:56,"- So Grizzly Adams in America,"
00:32:56,00:32:59,I think he's quite a well-known historical character.
00:32:59,00:33:01,So he was a Californian mountain man.
00:33:01,00:33:03,He was a trainer of Grizzly bears.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"And he used to just do acts,"
00:33:06,00:33:09,"you know, kind of like a Petey Barnum kind of thing."
00:33:09,00:33:12,- So he made pets with quite a few of these bears
00:33:12,00:33:13,that he thought were friendly.
00:33:13,00:33:14,- I can't see this going.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- Yeah.
00:33:15,00:33:15,- Can't see where this is gonna go.
00:33:15,00:33:16,- And he was killed by a monkey.
00:33:16,00:33:18,"- That's like, yeah."
00:33:18,00:33:19,- Oh yeah.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"So, okay."
00:33:21,00:33:23,Don't take your eyes off the threat of the monkeys.
00:33:23,00:33:24,- Yeah.
00:33:24,00:33:25,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:33:25,00:33:28,- So he got attacked by Grizzly in Sierra Nevada.
00:33:28,00:33:31,"- Oh, but the monkey was one who set the Grizzly on him."
00:33:31,00:33:33,"- No, the monkey comes in later."
00:33:33,00:33:36,"So his scalp was dislodged in this attack,"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"and it left a silver dollar size impression in his skull,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,just above his forehead.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Then he had all these other Grizzlies
00:33:42,00:33:44,that he made friends with.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"Anyway, he was re-induced several times in the head"
00:33:47,00:33:49,"and it opened up the wound,"
00:33:49,00:33:53,which meant bits of brain tissue where it's exposed.
00:33:53,00:33:57,"And then, as he's still going with the bears, stick."
00:33:57,00:33:59,- He's still going with the bear's stick.
00:33:59,00:33:59,- Okay.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"- And then Grizzly out of this on tour with a circus,"
00:34:02,00:34:05,when a monkey that he was trying to train jumped up
00:34:05,00:34:07,and beat him in the brain.
00:34:07,00:34:08,- Oh god.
00:34:08,00:34:10,- Not in the head in the brain.
00:34:10,00:34:12,"- Well, you don't have any nerves in your brain,"
00:34:12,00:34:13,so you wouldn't even feel it.
00:34:13,00:34:14,- Yep.
00:34:14,00:34:15,- So anyway.
00:34:15,00:34:17,"- You know, it was happening, I think."
00:34:17,00:34:18,- Maybe came from behind.
00:34:18,00:34:20,- It was possible.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"- And so he died, October 25th, 1860."
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- It was in Grizzly, that."
00:34:24,00:34:25,- 1860.
00:34:25,00:34:26,- 1860.
00:34:26,00:34:27,- It was another big thing.
00:34:27,00:34:28,- It was another big thing.
00:34:28,00:34:31,- How extraordinary does it?
00:34:31,00:34:32,"- If you hadn't said it was a monkey,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,I wouldn't have seen that coming at all.
00:34:34,00:34:35,"- Yeah, I know, right."
00:34:35,00:34:36,It's a real plot twist at the end there.
00:34:36,00:34:37,- It really is.
00:34:37,00:34:39,"- Wow, horrifying end."
00:34:39,00:34:40,Here's some people.
00:34:40,00:34:42,"William III of England, Alexander III of Scotland,"
00:34:42,00:34:46,"Prince Alfonso Portugal, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"Duke Geoffrey of Brittany is a beller of arrogant,"
00:34:48,00:34:49,"Leopold VIII of Austria,"
00:34:49,00:34:52,"Louis IV of France, William the Conqueror,"
00:34:52,00:34:53,they all died the same way.
00:34:53,00:34:54,- Monkeys.
00:34:54,00:34:55,- Not monkeys.
00:34:55,00:34:56,- Yeah.
00:34:56,00:34:58,(laughing)
00:34:58,00:35:00,- At what point do we start suspecting the monkeys?
00:35:00,00:35:01,- A raptor of the day.
00:35:01,00:35:07,- This is something that does away with lots of royalties.
00:35:07,00:35:09,- And it's very guessable.
00:35:09,00:35:10,"- Oh, is it gouged or something?"
00:35:10,00:35:13,"- Yeah, gouged, but that's a bit of a hog."
00:35:13,00:35:16,"- Yeah, is it sort of explosion or some sort of..."
00:35:16,00:35:18,"- Oh, 'cause William the Conqueror did explode,"
00:35:18,00:35:19,but that was out of your stuff.
00:35:19,00:35:22,"- He got brother a beast, I think, didn't he?"
00:35:22,00:35:23,- Right.
00:35:23,00:35:25,They couldn't bury him straight away.
00:35:25,00:35:28,"And so when the monks came to bury him in his concrete tomb,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,they sort of shoved him in it.
00:35:30,00:35:31,And then he exploded.
00:35:31,00:35:32,(laughing)
00:35:32,00:35:33,"- Wow, and in the conqueror."
00:35:33,00:35:34,"- I'm pretty sure, yeah."
00:35:34,00:35:35,"- William the Conqueror, yeah."
00:35:35,00:35:36,He definitely exploded in the...
00:35:36,00:35:37,- Conqueror.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"- Oh, it wouldn't be Conqueror's stone, sorry."
00:35:39,00:35:40,"- Oh, yeah, okay."
00:35:40,00:35:42,- That's a bit of the story you wanted to pick up on.
00:35:42,00:35:43,- The Romans had Conqueror Avenue.
00:35:43,00:35:45,"- I know the Romans had Conqueror,"
00:35:45,00:35:46,but I wasn't aware that...
00:35:46,00:35:47,"- Yeah, it was a brutalist."
00:35:47,00:35:49,- It wasn't a brutalist coffin.
00:35:49,00:35:52,- I just want to go with something really simple.
00:35:52,00:35:54,(laughing)
00:35:54,00:35:57,"- Anyway, the answer is falling off a horse."
00:35:57,00:35:58,- Oh!
00:35:58,00:36:00,- That is a big old way that people died in the past.
00:36:00,00:36:01,- Yes.
00:36:01,00:36:04,"- Alexander III probably was riding along a high,"
00:36:04,00:36:09,"treacherous coastal path, having drank a lot of Bodo wine."
00:36:09,00:36:09,- Good thing.
00:36:09,00:36:10,- And just went straight off it.
00:36:10,00:36:11,- Right.
00:36:11,00:36:13,- What fell off the hill?
00:36:13,00:36:15,"- It just jumped straight off it, yeah."
00:36:15,00:36:16,"You would think the horse would stop,"
00:36:16,00:36:20,"but the problem is that quite often when these people die,"
00:36:20,00:36:23,"there's a big sort of something happens afterwards,"
00:36:23,00:36:25,like happened with this Greek guy.
00:36:25,00:36:27,"So when Alexander III died,"
00:36:27,00:36:30,"that started the first war of Scottish independence,"
00:36:30,00:36:31,essentially.
00:36:31,00:36:32,- Right.
00:36:32,00:36:34,"- So you know, it's quite a big deal when these kings die,"
00:36:34,00:36:35,even though they're just people.
00:36:35,00:36:38,- At what point is anyone suggesting a helmet
00:36:38,00:36:39,for horse riding?
00:36:39,00:36:40,- Oh.
00:36:40,00:36:41,- I just...
00:36:41,00:36:43,"- You don't see that, I mean, apart from knights,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,you don't see people with like cycle helmets
00:36:45,00:36:46,"in the past, do you?"
00:36:46,00:36:48,"- Yeah, but knights do have protection."
00:36:48,00:36:51,You just think that I get how many regal deaths
00:36:51,00:36:52,"do they have to have before they say,"
00:36:52,00:36:55,"I think we should say, if you're the king or queen,"
00:36:55,00:36:57,you have to wear a helmet on your horse.
00:36:57,00:36:58,- Yeah.
00:36:58,00:36:59,"- Well, how about seat belts?"
00:36:59,00:37:00,- Horse seat belts?
00:37:00,00:37:01,- Yeah.
00:37:01,00:37:01,- Horse belts.
00:37:01,00:37:03,- Is that safer?
00:37:03,00:37:05,- You're not gonna fall if you're really tied tight.
00:37:05,00:37:07,"- If your horse falls over though,"
00:37:07,00:37:08,and your seat belt is on.
00:37:08,00:37:10,- I just wonder if there's a five reggae to come along.
00:37:10,00:37:11,(laughing)
00:37:11,00:37:12,- I feel like there might be a reason
00:37:12,00:37:14,why the horse seat belt hasn't been invented.
00:37:14,00:37:17,- Or maybe a styrups is effectively the horse seat belt
00:37:17,00:37:19,'cause it really helps you hold yourself in place
00:37:19,00:37:21,when you're in the styrups.
00:37:21,00:37:23,"- Look at you, you've been riding the horse recently."
00:37:23,00:37:24,- I've ridden one half reggae.
00:37:24,00:37:25,- Didn't you?
00:37:25,00:37:26,(laughing)
00:37:26,00:37:27,- You're wearing it as Mr. equestrian.
00:37:27,00:37:29,- All I'm gonna say is that go off any cleft.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"So, you know, despite how much borderline you are."
00:37:32,00:37:34,(laughing)
00:37:34,00:37:37,"- Yeah, that's true, isn't it?"
00:37:37,00:37:40,"How do people move this is a very graphic question,"
00:37:40,00:37:41,but how do people die when they fall off a horse?
00:37:41,00:37:43,Do they get trampled in the legs?
00:37:43,00:37:44,- I think it's bang on the head.
00:37:44,00:37:45,- Bang on the head.
00:37:45,00:37:47,"- 'Cause actually, you're quite,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,"as someone who's ridden a horse, I would say."
00:37:49,00:37:51,"- Well, you would know, that's why I asked."
00:37:51,00:37:52,(laughing)
00:37:52,00:37:54,- You're quite high up.
00:37:54,00:37:55,"- Oh, yeah."
00:37:55,00:37:58,"- Like, and they do, like, my horse,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,at once they saw a lady horse.
00:38:00,00:38:01,- Oh no.
00:38:01,00:38:02,- And so I started galloping towards them.
00:38:02,00:38:03,- Oh no.
00:38:03,00:38:03,(laughing)
00:38:03,00:38:05,- And I almost shitted my angle.
00:38:05,00:38:06,(laughing)
00:38:06,00:38:07,"- One advantage for a horse ride,"
00:38:07,00:38:09,"if it mounted the feet on the horse,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"and you just have to sit there,"
00:38:11,00:38:14,"like a horse that you, (laughing)"
00:38:14,00:38:15,"- That's amazing, you're riding two horses at once."
00:38:15,00:38:16,(laughing)
00:38:16,00:38:17,- You're out of it.
00:38:17,00:38:19,(laughing)
00:38:19,00:38:22,(upbeat music)
00:38:22,00:38:27,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:38:27,00:38:28,and that is James.
00:38:28,00:38:30,"- Okay, my fact this week is that one of the most"
00:38:30,00:38:34,"popular celebrity tailors of the 1950s was,"
00:38:34,00:38:36,ironically called Newdy.
00:38:36,00:38:39,(laughing)
00:38:39,00:38:40,- This guy's a character.
00:38:40,00:38:43,"- I reckon quite a few people might have heard of him,"
00:38:43,00:38:44,but I'd never heard of him before.
00:38:44,00:38:47,He was the first person to spot rhinestones on clothing.
00:38:47,00:38:48,(laughing)
00:38:48,00:38:53,So if you've ever seen one of those rhinestone cowboy suits
00:38:53,00:38:55,"that they wore in America in the,"
00:38:55,00:38:58,"what, this 50, 60, 70s, he will have made it."
00:38:58,00:39:01,So he made suits for L this.
00:39:01,00:39:02,He made them for--
00:39:02,00:39:03,- How in Titchmarsh?
00:39:03,00:39:06,(laughing)
00:39:06,00:39:08,"- Elton John, who he mentioned before,"
00:39:08,00:39:10,"Hike Williams, John Lennon."
00:39:10,00:39:12,This is the who's who of pop music.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"- It's everybody, yeah."
00:39:14,00:39:14,- Stackers.
00:39:14,00:39:16,"- Liver archie, I imagine."
00:39:16,00:39:17,"- Oh, yeah."
00:39:17,00:39:17,- They never too much sure.
00:39:17,00:39:18,- It was sort of everyone.
00:39:18,00:39:20,"In fact, I was thinking, 'cause I, you know,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,the term rhinestone cowboy.
00:39:22,00:39:23,- Glen Campbell.
00:39:23,00:39:24,- Glen Campbell.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"That was originally written by a man called Larry Weiss,"
00:39:26,00:39:30,"and it was, it was in tribute to Newdy."
00:39:30,00:39:31,- Really?
00:39:31,00:39:32,"- Yeah, because that was a thing that all of these"
00:39:32,00:39:34,country music stars kept asking for.
00:39:34,00:39:36,"They were like, Newdy, more rhinestone."
00:39:36,00:39:38,"- More rhinestone, when they were asking for those suits"
00:39:38,00:39:39,to be tailored.
00:39:39,00:39:42,So that song was put in more of a sentence though.
00:39:42,00:39:44,"They just went, ""More rhinestone."""
00:39:44,00:39:45,"""More rhinestone."""
00:39:45,00:39:47,"- Oh, these sounds, you know, they're like,"
00:39:47,00:39:50,"""You're not a rhinestone, Newdy."""
00:39:50,00:39:51,(laughing)
00:39:51,00:39:53,"- That was, it was a guy called Lefty Frizzle,"
00:39:53,00:39:55,who was more rhinestone.
00:39:55,00:39:58,"But a few more rhinestone, Newdy, put more rhinestone."
00:39:58,00:40:00,"- Rhinestones are stones from the Rhine, by the way,"
00:40:00,00:40:02,just in case you didn't know what a rhinestone was.
00:40:02,00:40:04,"- I never knew what a rhinestone would be about this,"
00:40:04,00:40:06,"so that is now just a piece of colored glass,"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"basically, but they were kind of proper rock crystals."
00:40:09,00:40:10,"- Apparently, you just get these little"
00:40:10,00:40:13,"colorful pebbles on the banks of the Rhine,"
00:40:13,00:40:15,and people used to put them on stuff as decoration.
00:40:15,00:40:19,"- Yeah, at these days, you melt them onto clothes with heat."
00:40:19,00:40:20,- Do you?
00:40:20,00:40:21,"- So you have a little, you have a little glue layer,"
00:40:21,00:40:23,and then you just heat them up and you just shove them on.
00:40:23,00:40:28,"- But yeah, Newdy, he was born Newter Cup Clear Encore"
00:40:28,00:40:32,"in Kiev in 1902, and he moved to America,"
00:40:32,00:40:35,"but he was really into his tailoring,"
00:40:35,00:40:37,"and then when he was processed,"
00:40:37,00:40:38,"supposedly according to the story,"
00:40:38,00:40:40,"when he was processed through Ellis Island,"
00:40:40,00:40:42,"they changed his name to Newdy,"
00:40:42,00:40:45,"which I'm not sure how often that actually happened,"
00:40:45,00:40:46,and usually it was people just changing their name
00:40:46,00:40:48,to sell more American themselves.
00:40:48,00:40:49,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:49,00:40:52,"- And then he came to America, opened an underwear shop,"
00:40:52,00:40:56,selling G-strings and pasties to strippers.
00:40:56,00:40:58,"- Very broad range of West Cornwall, wasn't it?"
00:40:58,00:40:59,(laughing)
00:40:59,00:41:00,- But they're called pasties.
00:41:00,00:41:01,- They are called pasties.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- They're called your nipples?
00:41:02,00:41:03,- They are called pasties.
00:41:03,00:41:07,"- Okay, I just thought, okay, he's going to get hungry,"
00:41:07,00:41:08,"and they're quite handy,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,because that whole meal running through them.
00:41:10,00:41:11,"- If you get one hand on the pole,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,and then he's hold onto the cross.
00:41:13,00:41:16,- I think the strippers in Bolton do put pasties
00:41:16,00:41:18,"on their nipples, but..."
00:41:18,00:41:18,(laughing)
00:41:18,00:41:21,"- So they're all the more popular for it,"
00:41:21,00:41:22,as well as people love pasties.
00:41:22,00:41:23,They love pasties.
00:41:23,00:41:24,- Yeah.
00:41:24,00:41:27,- And he then had surgery when he was in his forties
00:41:27,00:41:28,"and lost all of his money,"
00:41:28,00:41:31,'cause he had to pay for the surgery in America.
00:41:31,00:41:32,"And then he thought, what am I going to do?"
00:41:32,00:41:35,I'm going to make suits for celebrities.
00:41:35,00:41:38,And he got in touch with a guy called Text Williams.
00:41:38,00:41:40,Text Williams auctioned off his horse
00:41:40,00:41:43,"and used the money to buy New Deal sewing machine,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,and they went into business together.
00:41:45,00:41:46,"- Well, you wouldn't have gone on with text."
00:41:46,00:41:47,- Yeah.
00:41:47,00:41:48,- Why?
00:41:48,00:41:49,- You both love horses.
00:41:49,00:41:52,(laughing)
00:41:52,00:41:55,- I could have started coming in and Rady's done so many times.
00:41:55,00:41:56,(laughing)
00:41:56,00:41:58,"- But yeah, I'd never heard this guy,"
00:41:58,00:42:01,and he was pretty big deal.
00:42:01,00:42:01,- Quite the guy.
00:42:01,00:42:04,"- Yeah, that early stage when he was selling the pasties"
00:42:04,00:42:07,"to strippers, he sold also Taylor Mae's G Strings."
00:42:07,00:42:09,"- You don't, you don't, you don't them to not fit."
00:42:09,00:42:12,(laughing)
00:42:12,00:42:12,- You're right.
00:42:12,00:42:14,- If you got round your knees.
00:42:14,00:42:17,(laughing)
00:42:17,00:42:18,"- Oh, was that happened again?"
00:42:18,00:42:20,I was just eating a pastie.
00:42:20,00:42:22,(laughing)
00:42:22,00:42:23,- Oh dear.
00:42:23,00:42:25,- And the name New Deal became sort of synonymous
00:42:25,00:42:27,"with these amazing suits,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,"and actually the New Deal name is still alive,"
00:42:29,00:42:31,thanks to his granddaughter.
00:42:31,00:42:34,"Jamie Newdy, who seems to have taken his first name"
00:42:34,00:42:36,"as her surname, no, not quite sure how."
00:42:36,00:42:37,(laughing)
00:42:37,00:42:40,"And so now they do still exist,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,but they mostly make t-shirts and coffee mugs
00:42:42,00:42:44,with the name Newdy on it.
00:42:44,00:42:46,They don't really make so many clothes anymore.
00:42:46,00:42:49,- His cars were absolutely bananas.
00:42:49,00:42:51,"And I only say this because I've seen one of them,"
00:42:51,00:42:53,I think in the flesh.
00:42:53,00:42:54,- No.
00:42:54,00:42:57,- In the Nashville Country Music Hall of Fame.
00:42:57,00:42:58,- Oh wow.
00:42:58,00:43:00,"- And it's, I didn't know you'd been there."
00:43:00,00:43:02,"- I mean, just 15 years ago."
00:43:02,00:43:04,- I thought I'd heard every one of your anecdotes.
00:43:04,00:43:06,"- No, no, no, no."
00:43:06,00:43:08,- Why do you keep telling us the same three then?
00:43:08,00:43:09,(laughing)
00:43:09,00:43:11,- I feel like we're getting distracted
00:43:11,00:43:13,from my fourth anecdotes.
00:43:13,00:43:15,(laughing)
00:43:15,00:43:16,"- All these facts, anyway."
00:43:16,00:43:18,"- Yeah, go on, thank you so much, that way."
00:43:18,00:43:20,- It's an insane car.
00:43:20,00:43:23,It's got 18 pistols distributed around it.
00:43:23,00:43:25,It kind of built into the doors
00:43:25,00:43:26,"and things like that, all the inside."
00:43:26,00:43:30,"It's got $1,200 silver dollars glued on"
00:43:30,00:43:31,the various points all over it.
00:43:31,00:43:33,My memory might be tricking me.
00:43:33,00:43:35,I feel like it's got a bison's horns on the front.
00:43:35,00:43:36,- Oh wow.
00:43:36,00:43:39,- Where you'd have the Mercedes sign or whatever.
00:43:39,00:43:40,It's got one of those.
00:43:40,00:43:42,"I mean, it's an absolutely loopy."
00:43:42,00:43:44,"- Well, you would plug in your electric vehicle."
00:43:44,00:43:45,- That's right.
00:43:45,00:43:46,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:46,00:43:47,(laughing)
00:43:47,00:43:49,"- Yeah, he was very obsessed with fashion"
00:43:49,00:43:50,as a lot of celebrities are.
00:43:50,00:43:54,"Tom, you are one of the best-addressed comedians."
00:43:54,00:43:57,"- Well, that's very generous to say fashion."
00:43:57,00:44:00,I've always liked zooting and tailoring.
00:44:00,00:44:03,"I don't know, I think it makes me feel a certain way."
00:44:03,00:44:04,Sort of stand in a certain way.
00:44:04,00:44:07,I guess that's part of what tailoring has always done for people.
00:44:07,00:44:10,"But yes, I do like to wear a suit."
00:44:10,00:44:13,"- Yeah, I used to wear ties a lot."
00:44:13,00:44:14,And I've stopped in recent years
00:44:14,00:44:16,and I feel less good as a human as a result.
00:44:16,00:44:18,So I think I might get back into it.
00:44:18,00:44:20,"- Well, they're a flash of color, really, I suppose."
00:44:20,00:44:22,Or a bit of variation in the...
00:44:22,00:44:25,"- Well, you always wore a black one then you don't."
00:44:25,00:44:26,- Just black.
00:44:26,00:44:27,- Yeah.
00:44:27,00:44:27,- With a white shirt.
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- Yeah, so I remember those days."
00:44:29,00:44:30,- Yes.
00:44:30,00:44:31,- The Mormon was here.
00:44:31,00:44:33,(laughing)
00:44:33,00:44:34,"- It saves time, doesn't it?"
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Yeah.
00:44:35,00:44:36,- So you don't have to change your clothes
00:44:36,00:44:36,at the end of the gig.
00:44:36,00:44:39,You can just get out and fly all the way out.
00:44:39,00:44:40,- Pop the old badge on.
00:44:40,00:44:42,(laughing)
00:44:42,00:44:44,- I don't know those books.
00:44:44,00:44:47,"- I do, whoa, what's interesting is I read a study recently."
00:44:47,00:44:49,"Is apparently when you wear a tie,"
00:44:49,00:44:53,it stops your blood flow by 7.5%.
00:44:53,00:44:53,- Really?
00:44:53,00:44:56,"- Well, that gets me high, so I like that."
00:44:56,00:44:57,That's what I'm missing.
00:44:57,00:44:58,- That's not an idea.
00:44:58,00:45:00,- To your brain?
00:45:00,00:45:01,- Yeah.
00:45:01,00:45:02,- So you've been operating with constrictor blood flow
00:45:02,00:45:03,to your brain for some years?
00:45:03,00:45:06,- They did MRI scans on 15 men who were wearing ties
00:45:06,00:45:07,and 15 men who weren't.
00:45:07,00:45:09,- I'm actually going with the MRI machine.
00:45:09,00:45:10,(laughing)
00:45:10,00:45:12,- Very smart clothes.
00:45:12,00:45:14,- Should I pop my umbrella in but I haven't?
00:45:14,00:45:15,(laughing)
00:45:15,00:45:17,"- Yeah, and that's what they concluded."
00:45:17,00:45:21,"So it is letting less, and it will give you headaches"
00:45:21,00:45:23,and dizziness and nausea if you wear a tie more.
00:45:23,00:45:24,- Wow.
00:45:24,00:45:25,"- Then it won't do me, right?"
00:45:25,00:45:26,- Yeah.
00:45:26,00:45:30,- I find now it's evolved into the work where if men
00:45:30,00:45:33,"going to work is rather than suits,"
00:45:33,00:45:38,"it is some skinny chinos, a quarter-zip jumper"
00:45:38,00:45:41,with a shirt underneath open neck and then a lanyard
00:45:41,00:45:42,instead of a tie.
00:45:42,00:45:43,- I love it.
00:45:43,00:45:44,- So people don't wear a tie because they're lanyards.
00:45:44,00:45:47,Which I think will evolve maybe one day into something else
00:45:47,00:45:49,"or we've all become quite utilitarian, I think,"
00:45:49,00:45:50,in our clothing.
00:45:50,00:45:52,I think we all become quite practical.
00:45:52,00:45:53,I think for a long time there was an air of
00:45:53,00:45:57,"Camboyance special of men's clothing, which isn't afforded"
00:45:57,00:45:59,"so much now, I think if you went out, even me wearing a tie,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"people were like, ""Oh, all right, all right."""
00:46:01,00:46:04,"Well, I don't know if you're having a wedding today."
00:46:04,00:46:06,"- You know, I'm literally just wearing the same things"
00:46:06,00:46:08,like my dad might have worn.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"You know, but they can't seem like, yeah."
00:46:10,00:46:11,- Oh.
00:46:11,00:46:13,- I was thinking to tight clothes or snug clothes
00:46:13,00:46:15,"and clothing innovations, because it's really fun."
00:46:15,00:46:17,If you look in someone like new scientist
00:46:17,00:46:19,"for all the clothing inventions, it's all like,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,this is the clothing of tomorrow.
00:46:21,00:46:24,"And so in 2007, Philips, the electronics people,"
00:46:24,00:46:27,"they invented auto snug clothing, right?"
00:46:27,00:46:31,Which is where it's a clothes with muscle wires woven
00:46:31,00:46:32,through the fabric.
00:46:32,00:46:35,You pick it up to the power and it adjusts
00:46:35,00:46:38,until your trousers are the exact right size for you.
00:46:38,00:46:38,- That's good.
00:46:38,00:46:40,- And then you know exactly what trousers you need
00:46:40,00:46:41,from now on.
00:46:41,00:46:42,"- Yeah, I think that's great."
00:46:42,00:46:43,- I think that's useful.
00:46:43,00:46:44,"I can imagine it going wrong, well."
00:46:44,00:46:46,"- Oh, absolutely, yeah."
00:46:46,00:46:48,Like hundreds of people were electrocuted very bad.
00:46:48,00:46:50,It's very badly scorched during this.
00:46:50,00:46:53,"But it's also, we have a tape measure."
00:46:53,00:46:54,We have the technology to find out
00:46:54,00:46:56,what size trousers someone needs.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"- It's not like until 2007 people were like,"
00:46:58,00:47:00,"""Didn't I have like trousers in the size of my house?"""
00:47:00,00:47:02,(all laughing)
00:47:02,00:47:04,"- The other thing is it's different in different countries,"
00:47:04,00:47:05,right? - Yeah.
00:47:05,00:47:08,- So I bought a pair of large underpants in America
00:47:08,00:47:12,"and a pair in Japan and I could tell you,"
00:47:12,00:47:16,"one of those way too big for me and the other one,"
00:47:16,00:47:17,I can't even squeeze them too.
00:47:17,00:47:20,- This is why James has his G-string's tailor.
00:47:20,00:47:22,(all laughing)
00:47:22,00:47:27,"- Speaking of putting metal inside clothes,"
00:47:27,00:47:30,"that's what Lame is, I didn't know this."
00:47:30,00:47:35,"So Newdy in 1957 made Elvis Presley a $10,000 gold Lame suit."
00:47:35,00:47:40,"And Lame is where you get your fabric,"
00:47:40,00:47:43,but then you put metallic fibers into it.
00:47:43,00:47:44,- Oh.
00:47:44,00:47:45,- I didn't know what that was.
00:47:45,00:47:49,- Where else is Lame used in the sporting world?
00:47:49,00:47:51,- So gold being woven through.
00:47:51,00:47:54,- Or any metal woven through fabric.
00:47:54,00:47:56,- Not horse-raining.
00:47:56,00:47:57,"- Aerodynamics, stuff."
00:47:57,00:47:58,- Nope.
00:47:58,00:47:59,- I've got a wild theory.
00:47:59,00:48:00,- Go on.
00:48:00,00:48:01,- Is it tennis rackets?
00:48:01,00:48:03,"- I thought you were gonna get it, but no."
00:48:03,00:48:04,(all laughing)
00:48:04,00:48:05,For me the one?
00:48:05,00:48:08,"- No, it's not that, it's used in fencing."
00:48:08,00:48:09,"- Oh, of course."
00:48:09,00:48:12,"- Because you need to, when someone stabs you with the sword,"
00:48:12,00:48:14,they need to connect it.
00:48:14,00:48:15,And so it's the threads inside.
00:48:15,00:48:20,So all fences use Lame suits in the same way that Elvis did.
00:48:20,00:48:23,- That suit of Elvis is amazing.
00:48:23,00:48:24,"- Did you see that in your,"
00:48:24,00:48:25,"- Yes, I was gonna see."
00:48:25,00:48:27,"- I don't remember if I saw it because they've,"
00:48:27,00:48:29,they've got a pair of the blue suede shoes.
00:48:29,00:48:32,"You know, they've got a load of costumes and outfits."
00:48:32,00:48:33,"But that is, if you're listening to this"
00:48:33,00:48:35,"and you wanna know what that gold Lame suit is,"
00:48:35,00:48:37,"it's on the front cover of an album,"
00:48:37,00:48:39,which gets referred to as 50 million Elvis fans
00:48:39,00:48:42,"can't be wrong, which is a very, very funny album title."
00:48:42,00:48:43,- Right.
00:48:43,00:48:45,- And it's this mad gold suit.
00:48:45,00:48:46,- Cool.
00:48:46,00:48:47,- It's very loose.
00:48:47,00:48:49,It doesn't fit him at all well by a modern standard.
00:48:49,00:48:51,"- But it's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:51,00:48:54,"I think I might, I can't remember if I saw it there."
00:48:54,00:48:56,"- You know, if there was a lightning storm, wouldn't it?"
00:48:56,00:48:56,"- Oh, yeah."
00:48:56,00:48:59,"- It would have been absolutely, absolutely."
00:48:59,00:48:59,- Absolutely.
00:48:59,00:49:00,- At the road.
00:49:00,00:49:05,"- Found a comedy play from the 1805 called The Taylors,"
00:49:05,00:49:07,which was shown at Covent Garden.
00:49:07,00:49:11,And it was kind of taken a piss out of young dandies
00:49:11,00:49:13,at the time.
00:49:13,00:49:16,And they were so annoyed with it that they all turned up
00:49:16,00:49:19,and started booing the actors and stuff.
00:49:19,00:49:22,"And not only that, they decided to throw,"
00:49:22,00:49:26,"not rot 'em tomatoes, but scissors and cutting shears."
00:49:26,00:49:28,- Cool.
00:49:28,00:49:30,- At the actors throughout their opening night.
00:49:30,00:49:31,- Oh my God.
00:49:31,00:49:32,"- Well, what is it?"
00:49:32,00:49:34,- Grizzly Adams is on the stage too.
00:49:34,00:49:35,(laughing)
00:49:35,00:49:36,He has a terrible night.
00:49:36,00:49:38,(laughing)
00:49:38,00:49:39,- Isn't that mad?
00:49:39,00:49:40,- That's crazy.
00:49:40,00:49:43,"- Yeah, that is, but how interesting to think of,"
00:49:43,00:49:45,a group of people who want to associate with sort of
00:49:45,00:49:48,foppishness and not being particularly agitated.
00:49:48,00:49:51,"- Yeah, but young dandies is like, you know,"
00:49:51,00:49:52,"muds, rockers, that kind of--"
00:49:52,00:49:53,"- Yeah, but isn't it?"
00:49:53,00:49:55,"Yeah, I know it's an obvious thing to say,"
00:49:55,00:49:58,but one realises that the things we see today
00:49:58,00:50:00,have all happened before.
00:50:00,00:50:01,- Yeah.
00:50:01,00:50:02,"- The kind of protests, all those kind of groups"
00:50:02,00:50:05,"people being, you know, people being outrageous,"
00:50:05,00:50:08,"you know, dress sense as a protest or as an expression."
00:50:08,00:50:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:50:09,00:50:10,- It's interesting.
00:50:10,00:50:11,- I've got a riddle for you guys.
00:50:11,00:50:12,"- Oh, give it."
00:50:12,00:50:13,- Okay.
00:50:13,00:50:15,- Carol Spencer was a fashion designer.
00:50:15,00:50:19,She's spent 30 years working for the same client
00:50:19,00:50:22,"designing clothes, but her clothes have never been worn"
00:50:22,00:50:23,by a human.
00:50:23,00:50:24,(laughing)
00:50:24,00:50:25,- Riddle means.
00:50:25,00:50:26,(laughing)
00:50:26,00:50:27,- It's like a lacy.
00:50:27,00:50:29,"- Well, it's something, it wasn't a lacy."
00:50:29,00:50:30,- So it's nice.
00:50:30,00:50:31,- A horse saddle.
00:50:31,00:50:32,- It wasn't a horse related.
00:50:32,00:50:34,- James would have got it a bit like.
00:50:34,00:50:34,- James did it like.
00:50:34,00:50:36,(laughing)
00:50:36,00:50:37,- I think I've got it.
00:50:37,00:50:39,"- God, I know my hit rate with the tennis racket."
00:50:39,00:50:40,- Yeah.
00:50:40,00:50:41,- Back and that up.
00:50:41,00:50:44,I think it's a living Madame Tussaud's wax work
00:50:44,00:50:46,and with the fashion changing of the first.
00:50:46,00:50:47,- Like the sauna.
00:50:47,00:50:48,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:50:48,00:50:49,- It's so fashion all the time.
00:50:49,00:50:51,"- They keep the wax work, but they don't."
00:50:51,00:50:51,- And they change that.
00:50:51,00:50:53,- You're so close.
00:50:53,00:50:54,- Oh.
00:50:54,00:50:55,- You're so close.
00:50:55,00:50:58,"It's a model of a person, but it's not Madame Tussaud."
00:50:58,00:51:03,"- Oh, is it not the, is it Lenin who's kept in the cabinet?"
00:51:03,00:51:04,- It's not.
00:51:04,00:51:05,(laughing)
00:51:05,00:51:06,- Lenin's fashion.
00:51:06,00:51:07,"- Lenin, yeah."
00:51:07,00:51:09,(laughing)
00:51:09,00:51:12,"- Mr. February Revolution, it's Lenin again."
00:51:12,00:51:13,(laughing)
00:51:13,00:51:16,"- The fashion show, where they're all kneeled out."
00:51:16,00:51:18,"- Sherman Louse, summer, look."
00:51:18,00:51:20,(laughing)
00:51:20,00:51:22,- Isn't the mannequin piece?
00:51:22,00:51:23,- It's not the mannequin piece.
00:51:23,00:51:25,"- Right, shall I tell you all?"
00:51:25,00:51:26,"- Oh, I feel like we are close."
00:51:26,00:51:28,- I'll tell you this one more clue.
00:51:28,00:51:32,- Okay. - A client was only 11 1/2 inches high.
00:51:32,00:51:34,- Oh.
00:51:34,00:51:34,- She's fashionable.
00:51:34,00:51:36,She's got a lot of outfit changed.
00:51:36,00:51:37,- Bobby.
00:51:37,00:51:37,- It's Bobby.
00:51:37,00:51:38,- Oh.
00:51:38,00:51:39,- Oh.
00:51:39,00:51:40,- Oh.
00:51:40,00:51:41,- I don't even get there.
00:51:41,00:51:42,- I'm sorry.
00:51:42,00:51:43,- You're probably itching to tell us.
00:51:43,00:51:44,"- No, no, no, no."
00:51:44,00:51:45,- To play the game is a bit longer.
00:51:45,00:51:47,(laughing)
00:51:47,00:51:49,- I'm so sorry for truncating in Brutian.
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:51:50,00:51:52,- I'm sure that we've all got homes to go to.
00:51:52,00:51:54,"- The other people listening were like,"
00:51:54,00:51:55,"""It's obviously Bobby."""
00:51:55,00:51:56,"""Is it Lenin?"""
00:51:56,00:51:59,(laughing)
00:51:59,00:52:01,(upbeat music)
00:52:01,00:52:05,"- Okay, that's it."
00:52:05,00:52:06,That is all of our facts.
00:52:06,00:52:07,Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:21,00:52:23,"- Tom, where could we find you?"

00:52:42,00:52:44,And it's about gardening and being in the garden
00:52:44,00:52:45,with my friends.
00:52:45,00:52:46,"- Oh, great."

00:52:53,00:52:55,"- Yes, don't acknowledge him."
00:52:55,00:52:56,He's got another six years left.
