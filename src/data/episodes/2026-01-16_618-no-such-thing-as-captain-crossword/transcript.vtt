00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.000
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 of No Such Things A Fish, where we were joined by the legend.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.200
 The national treasure already, I think,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.040
 but definitely future national treasure, Tom Allen.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 - That's right, Tom is absolutely fantastic

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.960
 as you're about to hear.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.760
 He's a flanner, he's a man of out town.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.680
 Among many other things, you might not think it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.960
 'cause he's so dapper, but he's also a gardener.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.680
 - You might not think it 'cause he speaks so nicely,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.120
 but he's also a podcaster.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.960
 (laughing)

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.160
 - And he has a new podcast out, it's called "Pottering" with Tom Allen,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 and he gets a celebrity to his garden,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.640
 be it Nish Kumar, be it James A. Castor, be it Natalie Cassidy,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 and they talk about gardening.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.240
 - It's lovely, and I think they do some gardening as well, actually.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.040
 - He probably has some Natalie Cassidy Bagonias,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.760
 get some Nish Kumar, Asperd Distras.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 - Lovely, can James name a third plunge?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.520
 - Absolutely not, but if you want to hear Tom's podcast,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.240
 then go to wherever you get your podcast,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.320
 it's called "Pottering" with Tom Allen,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.600
 and it's absolutely fantastic,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360
 but Andy, we have some more news.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.840
 - That's right, the other thing to say is that,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.720
 in a week's time, we're gonna be doing the first

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.560
 ever Club Fish Quiz.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200
 Now, this is for people who've joined Club Fish

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.760
 at the top tier, the friend of the podcast tier,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.160
 we are gonna be doing a quiz globally, I imagine.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.200
 We suspect hundreds of thousands may be attending,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.320
 and you can be one of them, it's gonna be on Zoom,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.360
 or an equivalent streaming platform.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.600
 We've all been writing our questions,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120
 we've been showing them to each other,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.840
 we've been coming up with silly games,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.160
 it's gonna be so much fun.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.000
 So mark your diaries or your calendars

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.080
 for Friday, the 23rd of January, 7pm British time,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.320
 but if you're around the world,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.440
 we'd love to see you there as well.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.480
 - Gonna be so much fun, we can't wait to do it.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.320
 But anyway, please enjoy this week's episode

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 of "No Six Things A Fish" with the incredible Tom Allen,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 on with the podcast.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.120
 - On with the show.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.980
 (upbeat music)

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:05.720
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.400
 of "No Such Thing" as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.040
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.080
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.600
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Tom Allen.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.880
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.680
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Tom.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.200
 - In September 1945, a small booklet was discovered

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.840
 in the main offices of the third Reich in Berlin,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.240
 or Reich, if you're from southern Germany.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.640
 In Berlin, it was a secret list of 2,820 British individuals

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.600
 who'd be rounded up in the event

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.040
 of a successful invasion, and Noel Coward found his name

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.680
 on page 34.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.800
 - Oh, okay, why were they going after him?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.240
 - Well, firstly, I think anybody in an entertainment

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.760
 would be annoyed that they had to go so far.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.600
 (laughing)

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440
 - Mind your own name.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.240
 - There's only one thing worse than being on the Nazis,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.080
 deathless.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.720
 (laughing)

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.120
 - And that's not being on the, I can't believe

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.320
 you're quoting Oscar Wilde in a Noel Coward section.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.600
 - Oh yeah, we'll get onto that.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.200
 - Well, they just kind of crossed over

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.040
 in a sort of Dalai Lama way, yeah, yeah.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 - Is that what was he?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.520
 - Very Dalai Lama way.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.280
 - Have you ever looked at who died just before you were born?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.360
 - No, I never had.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.200
 - Oh, that's a funny thing.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.160
 - There was one of the popes,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.480
 the one that was before John Paul II.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.320
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.240
 - So I think it was, yeah, just before I was born,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.440
 you died, so I'm not saying anything else,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440
 but I am Catholic, so.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.320
 - I think you could still do it as well.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 - I can?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.040
 - Well, no, I've been excommunicated as we've said,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.880
 but.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.800
 - But what a comeback story that would be for you.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.280
 - Yeah, and actually the Pope.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.880
 - I can change the rules if I'm the Pope.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.960
 - Yes, yeah. - Exactly.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.040
 - Let's get back to Noel Coward.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.280
 - I know, I like that.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.040
 I was suddenly panicking about who died in 1983.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.880
 - Yeah, lots.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.320
 - Mount Batson, no, that was '70, '70s.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.400
 - Yes, Mount Batson was.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.680
 - I went straight through.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.720
 - I just got to see what this is.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.880
 (laughing)

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.480
 - We should quickly say who Noel Coward is.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.640
 Noel Coward, very famous way around.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.240
 - Yes, I didn't bother to say that.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.800
 I just assumed all your listeners would know who he was.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.240
 - Yeah, but you know better than anyone,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.840
 'cause you're part of the Noel Coward Society.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.200
 - Well, I have been involved.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.480
 But I, the, the, Noel Coward, yeah,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.840
 usually seen as a playwright and a writer of songs,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.640
 particularly Mad Dogs and Englishman.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.160
 He was also an actor, musician, and an author as well.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.320
 He wrote a novel.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.680
 Well, he was wanted by the sinister,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.000
 Armstrong, V1, V1, V1, V1, I don't know what,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.280
 I don't know what that looked like.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.920
 - I was like a music channel in Germany.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.200
 - I'm so glad for V1, V1, V1, I'm glad to come.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.240
 A department, it was a department that evaluated

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.520
 intelligence material.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 Well, he was a, it turned out a British spy.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.560
 And his cover had apparently been blown.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.720
 And if the war had gone differently, well,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.800
 the man known the world over further song,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.520
 "Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans"

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.120
 could have ended his days in front of a firing squad.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.280
 - Wow. - So, yeah.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.680
 And when the list was discovered amongst other people

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.520
 who the Nazis didn't like for various reasons,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.120
 and the author Rebecca West sent him a telegram to say,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.640
 "My dear, the people who were to be seen dead with."

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.000
 - It was very cool. - That's very good.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.480
 - This song, interestingly,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.280
 got him in a bit of trouble back home, didn't it?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.240
 - Yeah. - What was it called again?

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.080
 It was cool.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.160
 - "Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans."

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.040
 - Yeah, so came out during World War II.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.440
 It was a satire.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.080
 It was-- - It was signed by the BBC.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.160
 - Exactly, because the satire didn't quite cross

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.640
 as well as he hoped it would.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.120
 They thought that he was actually genuinely saying that.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.920
 - I was excited about it, because I think it's the only thing

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.720
 that Noel Coward has in common with the prodigy

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.440
 I found there, songs "Smack My Bitch Up,"

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.160
 which was also banned by the BBC.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.720
 - Can you imagine that him reading "Smack My Bitch Up"

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 Noel Coward in his accent? - "Smack My Bitch Up."

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.280
 - He'd have-- I think he'd have gustyed up the lyrics a bit.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.600
 He'd have made them cleverer.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.440
 - But I always wondered how he got away with being a spy,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.880
 'cause he was so flamboyant, right?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.960
 It seems like as a spy you have to hide away a little bit.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.120
 - Well, Radio IV did a dramatized version of what he was like.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.560
 I think a lot of it as well was propaganda work

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.240
 in North America, obviously, the US.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.000
 I think to Ghana support for getting on board with the war effort,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.480
 which I know wasn't the case at the beginning.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.520
 So I think he was seen as sort of a special envoy,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.680
 I suppose, as much as anything.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.280
 I don't think he was going behind enemy lines.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.200
 - No, but I'm-- - Hamburg.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.160
 - He'd been recruited even before the war started.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
 I think there was someone called Sir Robin Vancetart

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.320
 who was running-- - Sounds German, actually.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.680
 - Yes, but he was at the foreign office

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.560
 and he was recruiting various people

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.040
 to go about their business in Europe, quite successful people,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.240
 and then report back on the national mood,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.040
 what people were saying, just kind of sort of soft intelligence,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.880
 as it were, not, you know.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.680
 You don't need to observe this tank column

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.360
 and where it's going, this ball bearings factory.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.680
 It was just like what you're hearing in social conversations.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.520
 And I think Coward was sacked partly

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.400
 because he was too public in his maneuverings.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.600
 And also because everyone looked at him,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.960
 and this is after the war started,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.560
 and they just thought, we've just got to a load of parties

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.240
 and man, happening, you're really letting the side down.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.840
 And actually, he was doing the war work, like he was doing.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.320
 - He was, he was really publicly shamed about it, I think.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.080
 - Yeah. - I think the Daily Mail covered about it,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.680
 and said like, they said outrage, go it over there,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.680
 spit it all this money, public money, go to parties.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.280
 - The Daily Mail, who's departed,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.920
 that's, he's just before the war.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.240
 - Ooh. - Well, it might, yeah, I mean.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.400
 - Yeah. - But I should check,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.520
 I should check, it was the Daily Mail,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.200
 but it's out there and I'm lovely.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.000
 - Well, he used to, again, trouble with the daily express.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.280
 - Yeah, and actually, this is another war connection.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.600
 So he wrote the screenplay and started a movie called,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.440
 in which we serve, which was a really good movie,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.480
 often got used to get the morale up

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.800
 and show how the war was going.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.320
 And he kind of based the character on your past life.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.640
 - No, that's, and yeah.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.840
 - So he consulted with him and that was largely part of it.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.880
 - Could we say who went back and was it?

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.360
 - Sorry, yeah. - Yeah, he was,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.600
 he was. - Oh, oh, Mountbaton, I think.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.200
 - Oh, Mountbaton. - Yeah, Lord Mountbaton, wasn't he?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.040
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.400
 - And he was, he was Prince Philip's uncle

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.880
 by loose connection, I haven't researched it.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.560
 - By big, the brother of his mother, or, yeah.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.840
 So it's kind of like loosely unpleased to him.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.160
 - Is it like one of those uncles,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.600
 who's like just friends with your parents?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.840
 - I have a feeling if we're, yeah, exactly.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.040
 And you were shocked at some point

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.280
 to find out that wasn't your uncle.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.680
 I remember this when I was five.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.600
 I found out Uncle Joe wasn't my uncle.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.720
 And I was a bit outraged.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.760
 - Uncle Joe. - Yeah, I was in a cup of coffee.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.480
 - Yeah, so anyway, Mountbaton was part of this thing

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.680
 with Noel Coward.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.360
 And the daily express started ridiculing the production,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.560
 saying that how could you have Noel Coward play

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.480
 a high-ranking general in the army?

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.880
 - He's a captain.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.000
 - A captain, right?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.160
 - In the Navy. - He wasn't.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.280
 - Yeah, yeah, he didn't come across.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.120
 - Apart from that, don't carry on.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.520
 - I feel like I'm going quite lost in it.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.800
 - Sorry, no, I'm barely tripping it.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.320
 Well, I mean, I'm pretty sure he's a captain.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.160
 I haven't watched it, bro.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.440
 - I haven't seen the movie and you're a part of the sustain.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.640
 And you're being absolutely pancake

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.080
 between Tom's love of Noel Coward

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.480
 and my love of military rank.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.480
 (laughing)

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.320
 Sorry.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.840
 - Just bring a bit of golf into it.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.960
 - You absolutely can't.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.120
 (laughing)

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.960
 - Yeah.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.520
 - It seems quite out of time to me, Noel Coward.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.040
 - I know his name and I know he's part of the plays,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.560
 but I do, you mentioned Oscar Wilde

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.400
 before I do play some as part of that era,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.520
 but he was in things like the Italian job.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.360
 - Yes.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.600
 - He was, you know, in the '60s.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.440
 - Yeah.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.360
 - That was his, I think, his last acting role.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.200
 - Right.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.600
 - He was born in 1899.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.320
 And he served briefly in the First World War,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.280
 which I didn't know.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.880
 'Cause again, I think of him as like,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.880
 he's wearing his pajamas, maybe dressed in gown.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.880
 He's smoking a pipe through a long holder.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.640
 He's writing brilliant dialogue.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.280
 He's writing plays like Blind Spirit and Haifi, you know.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.120
 - Yeah.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.960
 - Witt.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.480
 - But he served in this company called the,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.080
 the Artists Rifles, which--

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.800
 - Just sounds awful, doesn't it?

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.000
 I think it was so, yeah, I think it was a place where

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.160
 maybe I don't want to be unkind.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.160
 Maybe slightly less useful fighters were replaced.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.640
 And I think he wasn't ever put in any sort of position

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.240
 where he'd have to do anything to practical.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.080
 - Well, he got himself out of it quite fast.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.080
 And this was only in, I mean, he was born in 1899.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.080
 So I think he was signed up aged 18

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.920
 or maybe conscripted.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.760
 I'm not sure.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.440
 He was discharged for Neurosthenia,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.160
 which was very much a catchal you've got nerves.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.040
 - Sort of tying a piece of string around his finger.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.880
 - Why?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.080
 - I guess it's sort of stress.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.080
 - A stressor situation, definitely.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.360
 - It'd be a tick talk about it now.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.360
 - But I think part of the reason he got so involved

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.480
 in World War II as a spy or whatever,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.360
 is 'cause he was a bit embarrassed by the fact

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.640
 that he'd gone into World War I quite young

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.200
 and then had to leave quite quickly.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.240
 - Yeah, his company suffered lots of casualties

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.520
 in the last two months of the war.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520
 I mean, hundreds, you know?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.320
 So I think, and that was after he'd been

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.560
 invalidated out as it were.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.800
 So yeah.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.640
 - I love the main thing about him outside of his plays

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.600
 and his acting and his songs is the gossip.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.960
 He was Mr. Annicdote, basically.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.120
 He's like the Charles Brandrath of his day.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.280
 (laughing)

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.440
 - Charles will be very happy.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.680
 - Charles Brandrath was absolutely in love with that.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.520
 (laughing)

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.880
 Oh my goodness.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.720
 What a Christmas breath of joy.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.560
 (laughing)

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.560
 Well, we'll clip this out inside of him.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.640
 - Yes.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.440
 - And so there's one great war, Annicdote from him,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.600
 which is he said, he never forgot the site

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.240
 of Coco Chanel entering a Paris air raid shelter

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.760
 followed by a maid who carried a gas mask

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.040
 on a velvet cushion.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.880
 (laughing)

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.560
 - That's wonderful stories.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.560
 - It was a time when people did,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.400
 well, I know there was strata of class,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.480
 but I think if you did transcend those strata,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.080
 you would just end up being at parties with these people.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.920
 - Yeah.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.760
 - I don't know, maybe it would be the same now,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.600
 but I mean, just like--

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.600
 - Because his mother, I think, had some vague sort of connection

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.760
 to the aristocracy.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.600
 - Oh, is that really?

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 - Maybe like an uncle or something.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 (laughing)

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.240
 - Yeah, she, like, feel mashable.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.080
 Hague was a distant cousin of hers,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.760
 and her sister married the nephew of Sir Henry Ponsonby,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.600
 who was private secretary to Perquean Victoria.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.440
 - Oh.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.000
 - So they were kind of like close to high society,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.640
 but not quite in there until he became very famous

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.280
 and really hobnobbed with the--

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.120
 - Right.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.720
 - Yeah, 'cause I don't know what kind of pretty lower middle class

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.760
 grew up in Southwest London and very suburban reasonably poor.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.520
 And his mum was a real stage mum.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.640
 - Yes, she was the Mrs. Worthington, I think.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.600
 She was the real Mrs. Worthington.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.440
 - She pushed it.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.320
 - Mrs. Worthington is--

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.480
 - Oh, is a song, don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.280
 It's kind of a song told from the position of a producer,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.480
 I think, in an audition, but essentially kind of saying

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.320
 to this very pushy stage mum.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.440
 She's talentless, please stop putting it into the audience.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.400
 But Noel Carrot's career happened partly

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.920
 because of a medium spiritual guidance.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.600
 So his mum went to a show at the Coliseum

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.240
 and an American celebrity medium Anna Eva Fay.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.680
 And his mum asked, "Should Noel, young Noel here,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.440
 go back to school or should he stay as a child actor?"

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.240
 And from beneath this big sheet that she was (laughs)

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.080
 a medium Anna Fay said, "Keep acting."

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.080
 - Oh, wow.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.080
 - Yeah, I didn't know that.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.440
 So that was a, I think, I suspect they probably would have kept

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.840
 him acting, even if the medium had said, "Go back to school!"

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.840
 And I suspect the ambition was strong.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840
 - Still there.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.160
 I haven't seen Blife's spirit, but I think it's a very satirical

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.680
 about the spiritualism movement.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.840
 - Is that right?

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.680
 Is it sort of parodying it?

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.480
 - It was a big drive towards it, wasn't it?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.480
 The 20s and 30s?

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.480
 - Yeah.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.320
 - Yeah.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320
 - Where people would have--

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.960
 - Yeah, I guess, I mean, that probably makes sense, doesn't it?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.960
 But my dad, even remembers his grandmother having her friends

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.800
 around for like a say-on, which isn't it?

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.600
 - Like they go into the back room or something, yeah.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.560
 And all these women would come in and try and contact with dad.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.400
 - Yeah.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.360
 - But it was kind of seen as his thing that people do quite

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.200
 socially.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.360
 - It was like a book club of its day.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.240
 - The book club of its day, exactly.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.200
 - His writing was extraordinary, the speed at which he wrote,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.680
 because there were so many knoll-coward plays.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.520
 There was a story that, in 1935, in the summer of that year

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.040
 alone, he wrote nine plays.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.520
 That's how quick he knocked out a song called "I'll See You Again,"

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.840
 which Frank Sinatra recorded while he was stuck in a taxi

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.960
 in a traffic jam.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.800
 - It's similar to, I think, Elton John, in the way

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.960
 that he, apparently, writes his songs in five minutes.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.800
 - I really do.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.000
 - That's the tangents and tiaras.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.880
 It's something about that creativity.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.320
 It's something quite useful about actually not allowing

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.040
 lots of time.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.800
 - Yes.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.080
 - And he also says the songs slightly come to him.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.160
 He doesn't claim to have written.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.000
 - Is that Elton John now?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.840
 - Yeah.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.200
 - Elton John will say that the songs sort of arrived to him.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.400
 - After the war, just to go back to his sort of post-war life,

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.360
 he spent a lot of time with the Navy.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.880
 And in fact, during the war as well,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.240
 he frequently would just hitch a lift on royal Navy ships.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.080
 - Really?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.920
 - Yeah.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920
 - He would just...

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.760
 - So he had to get on that.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.120
 - Well, how did he get off?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.720
 - He spent a lot of his life as a tax exile

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.560
 because he was so financially successful

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.880
 in the first half of his life

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.480
 that a lot of his life was just moving around

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.040
 to different low-taxed jurisdictions.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.760
 And he once joined a ship in Bermuda called H.M. Dragon

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.600
 and, or H.M.S. Dragon, maybe.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.240
 And the captain said, "What the hell are you doing

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.920
 on board this ship?"

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.560
 And Coward replied that he was,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.680
 quote, "exhausted overworked on the verge of a nervous breakdown

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.800
 and to join the ship in order to be nurse back to health

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.600
 strength and wait it on hand and foot."

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 And the captain not only gave him a lift to Trinidad,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.440
 he gave him loads more lifts later on.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.840
 They became friends.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.280
 - This was just like...

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.640
 - Is as well as a naval captain,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.320
 you might be quite pleased

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.160
 that if somebody, which he and famous,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160
 was suddenly on board.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.760
 - Oh, yeah, great.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.920
 - That's the entertainment.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.760
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.960
 - And better than the inser or whatever it's called.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.840
 - You say he was rich, he was so rich.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.080
 He was making £50,000 a year,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.120
 the equivalent of which today,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.480
 that would be £15 million per year

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.440
 that he was making in the late 20s.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.120
 - In the late 20s and he was really burning through it, though,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.680
 so he had a lot of financial problems

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.200
 and hence moving to tax havens like Jamaica,

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.040
 where he moved right next door to Ian Fleming.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.880
 - Oh, yes.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.720
 - Yeah.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720
 - Yeah, I love this spy.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.560
 - Yeah.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.000
 - And there are stories that he turned down the role of Doctor No,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.440
 that that was actually offered to him for the first bond.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.520
 - He was just called Doctor before they offered it to him.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.760
 (laughing)

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.080
 - Doctor Noel Coward.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.160
 - That's the original.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.280
 (laughing)

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:47.840
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.200
 and that is my fact.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.000
 My fact this week is that there is a Marvel superhero

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.560
 called The Gardener,

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.520
 whose superpower is that he is insanely good at gardening.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.760
 - So is it that he can grow things very, very fast?

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.400
 - No, it's more that he is obsessed with gardening.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.640
 (laughing)

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.680
 - And he is almost an immortal.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.400
 - Gardener gets supposed to be good for you

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.640
 if you're getting older.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.480
 - Yeah.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.640
 - Like it helps you live longer, doesn't it?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.480
 - Exactly.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.200
 - Well, yeah, and potentially forever.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.040
 - It's your life.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.880
 - It's forever.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.880
 - You give enough time to it.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.000
 So he's part of this group called The Elders of the Universe.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.840
 And basically,

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.440
 the other one is really good at bowls.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.240
 (laughing)

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.240
 - The other one is just really good at being racist.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.880
 (laughing)

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.760
 - Absolutely ruins Christmas, yeah.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.280
 - Captain Crossword, come and say it.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.520
 (laughing)

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.520
 - Yeah, okay, these are each of them

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.720
 with the last survivors of their own race.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.720
 And these were races that evolved just after the Big Bang.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.720
 And the idea is that they have extended lifespans,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.320
 but not because of a mortal,

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.200
 but because of a single-minded obsession with a hobby.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.040
 - That's cool.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.880
 - Yeah.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.720
 - That can be, I'll back that.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.560
 - There you go.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.440
 So his hobby was gardening and horticulture.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.400
 And the idea is that he would go from planet to planet

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.360
 and he would spend sort of up to a year,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.520
 sort of terraforming it, making it greener guys.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.360
 - Yeah, that's sad.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.560
 - Yeah, it might come into his own, actually.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.400
 - Yeah.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.240
 - I'm actually conscious age.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.080
 - There you go.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.080
 Well, he should be a bigger character

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.400
 'cause actually in the original--

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400
 - I think I should play him.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.280
 (laughing)

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.600
 - In the original stories,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.360
 he and the other Elders all had the Infinity Gems,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.240
 which is what Thanos collects

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.400
 as part of the main Avengers storyline

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.320
 in order to wipe out all of--

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.720
 - Oh, so he's one of the original holders of one of these?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.560
 - Yeah.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.040
 And because some reason when it came to the movie adapted,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.200
 the gardener didn't quite get--

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.040
 - Pretty cool.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040
 That's what I'm thinking.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.880
 - Oh, right.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.720
 - I'm talking about that.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.000
 - Yeah, but yeah, I'd love that.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.840
 - Yeah.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.960
 - I've seen with like a big wide-brimmed hat.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.800
 - Yeah.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.560
 - You know, the sort of thing that old ladies used to have.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.400
 - Oh, yes, yeah.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400
 (laughing)

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.240
 - Loves on--

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.960
 - Obviously, floral gloves in one of those kneeling pads.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.800
 - I've got one.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.640
 - I've got one.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.480
 - They are very useful.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.160
 - The best ones when you've got a handle at the side

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.920
 - Push yourself up. - Ooh, yeah, they're good.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.160
 - It's like an upside-down cano store, really.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.360
 - That's really helpful.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.240
 - And then you've got just to have a couple of beats

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.560
 to be like, "Oh, with my knees."

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.400
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.240
 - They carry on.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.320
 - Okay, we're talking to a seasoned gardener here, I'm guessing.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.080
 - Well, I's salty, maybe, if it's just about seasoned.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.880
 (laughing)

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.840
 - You do have a garden, though, that you love to--

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.320
 - I've got-- I've gotten into gardening.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.800
 I like to use the past tense of God.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.800
 And I've gotten into gardening in the last sort of four years

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.160
 since having my own place.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.840
 For a long time, I lived with my parents

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.040
 and I didn't have my own space then.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.120
 And so now I do, and it's quite nice just to--

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.920
 - Well, just mess around, really.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.040
 I'm proud and obvious with it,

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.320
 but I find it really interesting.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.440
 - So on famous gardeners, who's the most famous gardener

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.280
 in the UK?

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.800
 - Alan Titchfash. - Correct.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.640
 - What has Alan Titchfash got in common

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.440
 with Elvis Presley?

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.400
 - Ooh, okay, both from Memphis, that's obvious.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.520
 (laughing)

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.400
 - Both sex gods.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.400
 - Okay, I'll give you that.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.120
 It's slightly related to that.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.960
 - Poets?

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.480
 - He writes poetry, Titchfash.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.320
 - It's not that.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.600
 - Okay. - I've been to jail.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.240
 - Well, Elvis had a song about it.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.200
 Titchfash was done out for years, wasn't he?

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.800
 - For years, yeah.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.240
 - That's why he has honest tattoos.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.080
 - Yeah.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.360
 (laughing)

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.400
 - Come as them up for the show of class.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.760
 (laughing)

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.080
 - One for everybody killed in prison.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.560
 - It's how he got into gardening was burying the bodies.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.200
 (laughing)

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.880
 - The answer is that the lower halves

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.440
 have been censored on television.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.280
 - Really?

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.880
 - So Elvis, obviously, when he became big,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.120
 they would only show him from the waist up

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.320
 so that people didn't get too excited.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.080
 But Alan Titchfash has been--

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.720
 - They were censored for the waist out.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.320
 (laughing)

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.120
 - They have censored his trousers

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.280
 because he was jeans and in North Korea,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.000
 they don't like jeans being shown

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.240
 because it's a symbol of America.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.760
 So they show his programs,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.520
 but they blur out his trousers.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.520
 - Wow.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.320
 - But that means he's free to broadcast

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.920
 when he the post-style.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.760
 - Yeah.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.600
 (laughing)

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.160
 - So the North Korean that works, he's--

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.200
 - He's there.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.000
 - You have to paint his legs blue.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.920
 (laughing)

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.040
 - I've seen Titchfash do karaoke.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.960
 - Have you, in person?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.800
 - In person.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.960
 - Wow. - I don't mean to clang.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.800
 - What did he say?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.160
 Something green, green grass.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.280
 - It was, or what's the one I killed a man in Reno?

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.320
 (laughing)

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.560
 - Gangster's paradise as well.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.560
 (laughing)

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.280
 - Yeah, I don't remember the song, but it was, yeah.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.200
 - Wow, that's very cool.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.140
 Well, there's other reasons

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.000
 that Alan Titchfash is a sex god, by the way,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.600
 which is that as well as writing over something

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.440
 like 70 gardening books,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.960
 he's written a series of novels.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.240
 - Yes, they are.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.440
 - Are they seen?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.280
 - Are they?

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.880
 - Yeah, in fact, I don't know if you remember,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.840
 but we had Lou Sanders read Morrissey's contribution

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.720
 to the world of sex scenes.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.360
 - Tom, do you mind?

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.120
 - I've got a little extra here.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:06.960
 - Oh, here we go.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.680
 - Well, I think I have met Alan a few times

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.680
 and he's always very charming, as you'd imagine.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.720
 And he did say to me, 'cause I was talking to him

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.640
 about audio books, and he did say he was very aware

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.280
 of his more intimate scenes when he had to sit

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.400
 in a booth, and read them out, to an engineer.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.400
 So as an example of what he might have been reading,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.480
 there is a little bit here.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.160
 She planted moist hot kisses all over his body.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.520
 Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead for it,

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.120
 as he became more entangled in the lism limbs

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.600
 of this human bower constrictor.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.120
 It's only 15 minutes, their mutual passion heightened

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.640
 with groans, sighs, and liquid noises.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.120
 (laughing)

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.720
 - Oh, wow, can I just say, when you're describing lens,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.720
 why'd go for the one animal that doesn't have any lens?

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.760
 - Little lism, lism limb.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.000
 - I don't know what lism means.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.560
 - I've never heard that word before.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.920
 - Lism is kind of young and firm and strong, isn't it?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.760
 - Is it?

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.600
 - Oh, sorry.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.200
 - Rich marshes, too highbrow for us.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.280
 We don't know the vocabulary.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.640
 - I know, I bet he lism.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.600
 - He's a very educated man.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.080
 - I like the way it begins with sheep planted kisses.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.360
 Like, 'cause obviously he's a gardener.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.200
 - Absolutely.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.800
 - Oh, every, every.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.120
 - Well, he was wonderful.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.280
 - So he was runner up in the 1998 Literary Review

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.920
 Bad Sex Awards.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.880
 And you're right, he felt very uncomfortable reading them.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.080
 He said, particularly with a sheet of glass between you

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.040
 and a very large bearded man, twiddling knobs,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.600
 as you say the words, he found it uncomfortable.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.640
 - I think it's a bit unfair that bad sex thing,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.280
 'cause they go for slabs, don't they?

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.120
 - Yeah.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.600
 - There must be loads of like not famous people

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.600
 who are writing worse.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.440
 - Absolutely.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.280
 - What?

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.960
 - To be fair, the winner that year was Sebastian Forks.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.640
 - I was gonna say bird song.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.000
 It's got lots of that, that's very interesting.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.560
 - Bird song's got some very fruity stuff in it.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.080
 - So he was very fruity.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.640
 - I remember reading that when I was about 17

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.040
 and thinking, oh gosh, that seems like a lot of effort.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.240
 (laughing)

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.720
 - Can I ask you about a couple of things you might

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.960
 or might not use in your garden, Tom?

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.040
 - Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.880
 - Should we give it a go?

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.720
 Right.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.000
 Do you ever use worm poo tea bags?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.320
 No, I think I have heard of this sort of thing.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.160
 - So cool.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.240
 - Worms are very important, aren't they?

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.320
 - Worms are vital.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.560
 - And obviously they eat soil.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560
 They poo it out.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560
 You know, they help.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.400
 - So do I.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.120
 - They do their aerate, all sorts of stuff.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.200
 You can get tea bags with worm castings, are you worm poo?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.800
 Where you literally make a cup of tea out of it

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.040
 for your plant and it really helps your plant.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.880
 - Really?

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.200
 - Lion urine?

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.040
 - Well that's the thing, isn't it?

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.920
 Because people say to keep away foxes or other animals

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.000
 if you want them out of your garden.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.880
 - You need an apex predator.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.960
 - You need an apex, you can't.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.600
 The people say, oh just go and we in the garden

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.240
 and then like, no, then you mend to we in the garden.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.880
 It's male urine they respond to.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.000
 And apparently that's not, that's not going to do it.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.760
 Apparently you need to go to the zoo and ask,

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.960
 yeah, I'm going to get a lion to we into a cup.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.640
 (laughing)

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.240
 - Or you can get the piss off plant.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.080
 - Have you heard of that?

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.920
 - What's that?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.560
 - Piss off plant is a plant that's native

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.640
 to southern in eastern Africa and it is a plant

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.080
 that supposedly repels dogs and cats from coming near it

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.200
 because of the aroma that it emits.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.440
 So if you had that in your garden,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.000
 most likely they would smell it and never come back again.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.840
 - I'll get one of it.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.080
 - That's pretty good, that's a great idea.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.720
 Do you have an ornamental hermit in your garden?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.160
 - No, I don't have anything like that.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.800
 That was like a sort of a little house,

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.920
 wasn't it worded a little.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.200
 - Well back in the 18th century,

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.320
 this was a real life human

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.200
 that you would bring into your garden.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.040
 - Yeah.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.080
 - They would dress like a druid

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.680
 and they would just be sat

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.000
 and they would have a contract to live there

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.320
 and negotiations for roaches and negotiations

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.240
 every autumn as the roaches.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.560
 - Well look, I'm not gonna do this for another year.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.320
 Let's you revise my terms.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.680
 - No, yeah, it's been in 1797.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.760
 There was a thing written up that said,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.120
 the hermit is never to leave the place

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.440
 or hold conversation with anyone for seven years

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.520
 during which he is neither to wash himself

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.880
 or cleanse himself in any way whatsoever.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.720
 - Yeah, my agent's got a problem with his clothes

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.320
 and I'm like, yeah, (laughing)

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.160
 agent lives a bit further down the garden

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.360
 and another little folly.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.200
 - Yeah.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.280
 - Do we know why people did that?

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.800
 - Well, I think it's a kind of,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.120
 it would be like landed gentry would have this person.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.480
 You wouldn't have it in your garden in the hackney.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.680
 - I think, no, exactly.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.520
 I think what it is is,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.840
 the hermit is a symbol of a wilder

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.320
 and ancient way of living

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.160
 and it's kind of they are reflecting on history

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.320
 and on humanity and on progress and the countryside

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.080
 and the wilderness and I think that's why it's cool

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.400
 to have a hermit 'cause they kind of hark back to that.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.240
 - Yeah.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.080
 - Okay.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.400
 - This has been that kind of sentimentality

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.960
 isn't it around that kind of pastoral?

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.200
 - Yeah, it all.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.680
 - There was one place which had a hermit

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.600
 which turned out to be a mechanical hermit.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.840
 - Genuinely.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.840
 - I think it was an 18th century aristocrat.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.600
 - Quite clearly it was a hermit.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.440
 (laughing)

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.080
 - It was like a very, very, very crude

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.000
 model robo hermit that they had in there.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.840
 - With that thing.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.640
 - Here's another famous gardener.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.920
 So this is a king called hermiti

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480
 who was in ancient Sumer

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.280
 and what would happen in ancient Sumer

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.680
 is you would get people who would tell the future

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.440
 and if they saw a bad omen,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.400
 like maybe the king's gonna die,

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.400
 you would put someone else on the throne,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.160
 400 days and then you take over again.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.040
 So this guy, hermiti, decided to put his gardener

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.920
 on the throne for 100 days 'cause there'd been a bad omen

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.640
 and then he died after eating some hot porridge

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.320
 and his gardener then reigned ancient Sumer

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.640
 for 24 years.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.200
 (laughing)

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.200
 - Just 'cause he didn't blow on it.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.480
 - I guess so.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.640
 - Oh, the porridge.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.480
 - Yeah.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.720
 - That's incredible.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.760
 - I know.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.640
 - I guess wasn't a successor in place

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.840
 who would not have taken over the throne.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.720
 - Well, he's the king now, right?

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.560
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.920
 - So what are you gonna do?

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.240
 - That's so funny.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.400
 (laughing)

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.000
 (upbeat music)

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.160
 (upbeat music)

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.600
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.840
 and that is Andy.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.880
 - My fact is, in 1920, the King of Greece died

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.640
 after trying to break up a fight between a dog and a monkey.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.640
 (laughing)

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.800
 This is the only royal death I've found

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.920
 which involved a monkey at all, actually.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.760
 - Mm-hmm.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.040
 - Little end of the fight between a dog and a monkey.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.880
 - Okay.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.200
 - This was King Alexander of Greece

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.720
 and he had a dog, he had a German shepherd

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.760
 and one day he was having a walk in there.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.760
 I think the palace grounds and I think a Barbary ape.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.880
 - Quite an aggressive, yeah, not a titler of a monkey.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.720
 - Oh, no, no, this isn't like Bubbles.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.560
 - No, no, no, no, this is proper.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.400
 - They're very naughty Barbary apes, I can say.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.240
 They all know.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.520
 - Yeah, it's naughty.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.000
 (laughing)

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.240
 - They'll kill your dog.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.400
 (laughing)

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.040
 - Slotering your dog in front, yeah.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:57.880
 - All you King.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.360
 - They have the man to brawl to them, yes.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.800
 And I went up there with a pusher

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.480
 with my daughter who is very young

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.840
 and basically, they will just steal everything.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.200
 Everything that's not held down, they'll steal it.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.800
 - You got it back though.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.480
 - No, she still lives there.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.560
 (laughing)

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.720
 - She is the ape queen now.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.920
 (laughing)

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.280
 - That's why I bow to for Brexit.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.880
 I don't want it to be Spanish.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.160
 (laughing)

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.880
 - Yeah, so anyway, this ape and this dog were in a fight.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.920
 He was trying to separate them,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.800
 at which point the apes wife turned up

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.680
 and sunk fangs into King Alexander's leg.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.000
 - Oh no.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.720
 - And I think some days later, he died, he'd become ill

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.400
 and they had swithered over what to do, the doctors and so.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.920
 - So he died and this produced huge geopolitical consequences

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.120
 with Churchill later wrote,

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.880
 it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.160
 that a quarter of a million persons died

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.320
 of this monkey's bite.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.160
 - Really?

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.000
 - Yeah.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.840
 - Wow.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.600
 - Because they've spent the Greek Civil War.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.560
 - Well, it all led to a lot of unhappiness and conflict

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.920
 inside Greece.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.640
 They got back the previous King.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.440
 Because what had happened to the previous King was very pro German

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.440
 and his son was pro German, his eldest son.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.160
 And so Britain and Russia and probably France

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.560
 got rid of those guys and brought in this guy

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.200
 who wasn't expecting to be King.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.880
 Like he was just thought he was gonna spend his days gardening

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.200
 off just having a lot of fun.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200
 - Having a lovely life.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.400
 - Yeah, and then suddenly he's King.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.400
 And then, you know, okay, well now we've got our puppet

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.120
 who's in charge, but then he dies

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.480
 and then they bring the old people back

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.840
 and it all goes to shit.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.800
 - That's basically what happened, yeah.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.640
 And then he fought this war against the Turks

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.920
 which went disastrously wrong, hundreds of thousands of deaths.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.280
 The royalists were kicked out.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.480
 And then the European Great Powers just started picking

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.960
 the Greek royal family.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.640
 And then eventually things got a bit more democratic.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.160
 And the Greeks in 1862 had this vote for a new King,

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.600
 a kind of national referendum.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.680
 And they almost universally, they chose Prince Alfred of England

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.440
 who I believe was one of Victoria's sons.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.280
 - Yes.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.720
 - He won 95% of the vote's cast.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.360
 He said no, no thank you, I don't want to do it.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.560
 - You used the throne of Greece.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.760
 - Yeah, but imagine he probably had a nice house

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.600
 somewhere, wouldn't he?

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.360
 - I'm sure he's already got a nice, you're right.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.200
 - You're right, yeah, that nice.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.040
 - Well yeah, was that?

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.440
 - That was 1862.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.200
 - So this is not happening in the 1860s, wasn't it?

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.040
 - Oh, going on.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.880
 - Bucket.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.360
 - Was that unification of Germany around then?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.200
 - Yes.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.040
 - And then formation of Italy.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:20.880
 - Yes.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.240
 - Also my house was built.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.080
 - Really?

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.440
 - So some major events.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.440
 - Major, major things too.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.840
 - So your garden, that was laid out and was created.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.680
 - Yeah.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.520
 - By Prince Alfred.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.880
 - And actually around the corner from me.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.440
 And Napoleon III came to live.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.280
 - Is that so?

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.120
 - No, really.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.280
 - Wow, so there you go.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.480
 - So we've asked to take a huge decade.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.320
 - A huge decade.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.160
 - A huge decade.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.960
 But basically Alfred was pressured into saying no

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.720
 'cause Britain, France, and Russia had all to creed.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.240
 Nobody's going to accept this throne.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.040
 - Nobody wants it, get over it.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.760
 - And every candidate said no until they got to Prince

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.640
 Wilhelm of Denmark of the Blocksburg House

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.240
 and he had received six votes

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.440
 from the entire population of Greece.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.320
 And he was then chosen to be the king.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.160
 - That is unfortunate.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.000
 - I know.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.520
 - I think he was 18th highest voted person in that list.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.520
 - He came 18th.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.360
 - Yeah.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.440
 - But various people had just written a Russian king, please.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.280
 Or whatever.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.960
 - They just selected, like they just listed it.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.200
 So he came almost dead last.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.400
 And yet he then was king for 50 years.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.480
 - King, like king face was there.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.680
 - Who they really wanted.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.520
 - Yeah.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.120
 - And then he lasted until 1913, he lasted 50 years.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:18.960
 - Yeah.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.800
 - 1930.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.640
 - 1913.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.360
 - He was assassinated by either a socialist or a lunatic.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.000
 And it's not clear which apparently.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.080
 - Not necessarily.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.880
 - Not to get political.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.320
 (laughing)

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.520
 - Lots of assassinations happening around that sort of area

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.040
 whether that time.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.880
 - Yes.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.720
 - They loved it.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.760
 - A vexed, vexed period.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.560
 - A vexed period in the south-east of Europe.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.400
 - Yeah.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.480
 - I found another monkey bite death.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.320
 - Oh.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.160
 - Did you?

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.000
 - Didn't expect to find one.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.360
 But I tried hard and I got there.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.760
 - Do you know the character Grizzly Adams?

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.600
 - Grizzly Adams.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.440
 - So barely.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.280
 - He was making a bet.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.120
 - No, no.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:54.960
 (laughing)

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.360
 - So Grizzly Adams in America,

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.360
 I think he's quite a well-known historical character.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.880
 So he was a Californian mountain man.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.960
 He was a trainer of Grizzly bears.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.920
 And he used to just do acts,

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.040
 you know, kind of like a Petey Barnum kind of thing.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.480
 - So he made pets with quite a few of these bears

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.400
 that he thought were friendly.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.240
 - I can't see this going.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.080
 - Yeah.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:15.920
 - Can't see where this is gonna go.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920
 - And he was killed by a monkey.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.400
 - That's like, yeah.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.240
 - Oh yeah.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.640
 So, okay.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.640
 Don't take your eyes off the threat of the monkeys.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.480
 - Yeah.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.680
 - So he got attacked by Grizzly in Sierra Nevada.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.240
 - Oh, but the monkey was one who set the Grizzly on him.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.160
 - No, the monkey comes in later.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.600
 So his scalp was dislodged in this attack,

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.760
 and it left a silver dollar size impression in his skull,

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.320
 just above his forehead.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.920
 Then he had all these other Grizzlies

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.240
 that he made friends with.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.840
 Anyway, he was re-induced several times in the head

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.200
 and it opened up the wound,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.120
 which meant bits of brain tissue where it's exposed.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.360
 And then, as he's still going with the bears, stick.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.000
 - He's still going with the bear's stick.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.840
 - Okay.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.120
 - And then Grizzly out of this on tour with a circus,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.760
 when a monkey that he was trying to train jumped up

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.600
 and beat him in the brain.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.840
 - Oh god.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.800
 - Not in the head in the brain.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.320
 - Well, you don't have any nerves in your brain,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.440
 so you wouldn't even feel it.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.280
 - Yep.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.120
 - So anyway.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.160
 - You know, it was happening, I think.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.880
 - Maybe came from behind.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.120
 - It was possible.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.600
 - And so he died, October 25th, 1860.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.440
 - It was in Grizzly, that.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440
 - 1860.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.280
 - 1860.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.400
 - It was another big thing.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.560
 - It was another big thing.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.640
 - How extraordinary does it?

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.800
 - If you hadn't said it was a monkey,

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.160
 I wouldn't have seen that coming at all.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.000
 - Yeah, I know, right.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.240
 It's a real plot twist at the end there.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.080
 - It really is.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.160
 - Wow, horrifying end.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.000
 Here's some people.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.320
 William III of England, Alexander III of Scotland,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.000
 Prince Alfonso Portugal, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.200
 Duke Geoffrey of Brittany is a beller of arrogant,

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.600
 Leopold VIII of Austria,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.040
 Louis IV of France, William the Conqueror,

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.680
 they all died the same way.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.520
 - Monkeys.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.360
 - Not monkeys.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.200
 - Yeah.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.520
 (laughing)

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.680
 - At what point do we start suspecting the monkeys?

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.680
 - A raptor of the day.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:07.360
 - This is something that does away with lots of royalties.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.280
 - And it's very guessable.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.680
 - Oh, is it gouged or something?

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.120
 - Yeah, gouged, but that's a bit of a hog.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.320
 - Yeah, is it sort of explosion or some sort of...

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.160
 - Oh, 'cause William the Conqueror did explode,

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.640
 but that was out of your stuff.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.840
 - He got brother a beast, I think, didn't he?

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.920
 - Right.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.680
 They couldn't bury him straight away.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.360
 And so when the monks came to bury him in his concrete tomb,

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.080
 they sort of shoved him in it.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.720
 And then he exploded.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.560
 (laughing)

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.400
 - Wow, and in the conqueror.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.240
 - I'm pretty sure, yeah.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.080
 - William the Conqueror, yeah.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.240
 He definitely exploded in the...

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.080
 - Conqueror.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.560
 - Oh, it wouldn't be Conqueror's stone, sorry.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.400
 - Oh, yeah, okay.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.120
 - That's a bit of the story you wanted to pick up on.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.960
 - The Romans had Conqueror Avenue.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.080
 - I know the Romans had Conqueror,

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.400
 but I wasn't aware that...

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.400
 - Yeah, it was a brutalist.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.960
 - It wasn't a brutalist coffin.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.040
 - I just want to go with something really simple.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.280
 (laughing)

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.000
 - Anyway, the answer is falling off a horse.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.640
 - Oh!

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.800
 - That is a big old way that people died in the past.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.800
 - Yes.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.840
 - Alexander III probably was riding along a high,

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:09.120
 treacherous coastal path, having drank a lot of Bodo wine.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:09.960
 - Good thing.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.920
 - And just went straight off it.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.760
 - Right.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.240
 - What fell off the hill?

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.000
 - It just jumped straight off it, yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.520
 You would think the horse would stop,

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.400
 but the problem is that quite often when these people die,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.280
 there's a big sort of something happens afterwards,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.240
 like happened with this Greek guy.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.720
 So when Alexander III died,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.640
 that started the first war of Scottish independence,

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640
 essentially.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.480
 - Right.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.280
 - So you know, it's quite a big deal when these kings die,

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.920
 even though they're just people.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.080
 - At what point is anyone suggesting a helmet

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.680
 for horse riding?

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.520
 - Oh.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.360
 - I just...

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.320
 - You don't see that, I mean, apart from knights,

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.360
 you don't see people with like cycle helmets

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.200
 in the past, do you?

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.480
 - Yeah, but knights do have protection.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.200
 You just think that I get how many regal deaths

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.880
 do they have to have before they say,

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.560
 I think we should say, if you're the king or queen,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.320
 you have to wear a helmet on your horse.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.160
 - Yeah.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.360
 - Well, how about seat belts?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.200
 - Horse seat belts?

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.040
 - Yeah.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.880
 - Horse belts.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.800
 - Is that safer?

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.920
 - You're not gonna fall if you're really tied tight.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.240
 - If your horse falls over though,

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.760
 and your seat belt is on.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.840
 - I just wonder if there's a five reggae to come along.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.680
 (laughing)

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.600
 - I feel like there might be a reason

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.160
 why the horse seat belt hasn't been invented.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.320
 - Or maybe a styrups is effectively the horse seat belt

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.560
 'cause it really helps you hold yourself in place

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.000
 when you're in the styrups.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.080
 - Look at you, you've been riding the horse recently.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.400
 - I've ridden one half reggae.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.240
 - Didn't you?

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.240
 (laughing)

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.600
 - You're wearing it as Mr. equestrian.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.440
 - All I'm gonna say is that go off any cleft.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.720
 So, you know, despite how much borderline you are.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.960
 (laughing)

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.000
 - Yeah, that's true, isn't it?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.040
 How do people move this is a very graphic question,

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.440
 but how do people die when they fall off a horse?

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.440
 Do they get trampled in the legs?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.920
 - I think it's bang on the head.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920
 - Bang on the head.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.640
 - 'Cause actually, you're quite,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.800
 as someone who's ridden a horse, I would say.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.480
 - Well, you would know, that's why I asked.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.480
 (laughing)

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.120
 - You're quite high up.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.280
 - Oh, yeah.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.240
 - Like, and they do, like, my horse,

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.360
 at once they saw a lady horse.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.200
 - Oh no.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.280
 - And so I started galloping towards them.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.120
 - Oh no.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.960
 (laughing)

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.160
 - And I almost shitted my angle.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.200
 (laughing)

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.800
 - One advantage for a horse ride,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.760
 if it mounted the feet on the horse,

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.560
 and you just have to sit there,

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.040
 like a horse that you, (laughing)

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.920
 - That's amazing, you're riding two horses at once.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.760
 (laughing)

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.760
 - You're out of it.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.880
 (laughing)

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.460
 (upbeat music)

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:27.040
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.600
 and that is James.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.600
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one of the most

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.240
 popular celebrity tailors of the 1950s was,

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.800
 ironically called Newdy.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.800
 (laughing)

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.800
 - This guy's a character.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.120
 - I reckon quite a few people might have heard of him,

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.440
 but I'd never heard of him before.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.640
 He was the first person to spot rhinestones on clothing.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640
 (laughing)

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.040
 So if you've ever seen one of those rhinestone cowboy suits

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.200
 that they wore in America in the,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.840
 what, this 50, 60, 70s, he will have made it.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.600
 So he made suits for L this.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.600
 He made them for--

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.800
 - How in Titchmarsh?

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.800
 (laughing)

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.520
 - Elton John, who he mentioned before,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.760
 Hike Williams, John Lennon.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.160
 This is the who's who of pop music.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.000
 - It's everybody, yeah.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.840
 - Stackers.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.200
 - Liver archie, I imagine.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.040
 - Oh, yeah.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.880
 - They never too much sure.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.720
 - It was sort of everyone.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.640
 In fact, I was thinking, 'cause I, you know,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.320
 the term rhinestone cowboy.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.160
 - Glen Campbell.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.000
 - Glen Campbell.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.800
 That was originally written by a man called Larry Weiss,

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.200
 and it was, it was in tribute to Newdy.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.040
 - Really?

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.960
 - Yeah, because that was a thing that all of these

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.640
 country music stars kept asking for.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.760
 They were like, Newdy, more rhinestone.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.800
 - More rhinestone, when they were asking for those suits

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.840
 to be tailored.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.720
 So that song was put in more of a sentence though.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.360
 They just went, "More rhinestone."

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.560
 "More rhinestone."

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.640
 - Oh, these sounds, you know, they're like,

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.200
 "You're not a rhinestone, Newdy."

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.040
 (laughing)

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.640
 - That was, it was a guy called Lefty Frizzle,

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.480
 who was more rhinestone.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.040
 But a few more rhinestone, Newdy, put more rhinestone.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.720
 - Rhinestones are stones from the Rhine, by the way,

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.640
 just in case you didn't know what a rhinestone was.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.720
 - I never knew what a rhinestone would be about this,

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.720
 so that is now just a piece of colored glass,

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.360
 basically, but they were kind of proper rock crystals.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.840
 - Apparently, you just get these little

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.120
 colorful pebbles on the banks of the Rhine,

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.680
 and people used to put them on stuff as decoration.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.200
 - Yeah, at these days, you melt them onto clothes with heat.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.040
 - Do you?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.120
 - So you have a little, you have a little glue layer,

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.960
 and then you just heat them up and you just shove them on.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.960
 - But yeah, Newdy, he was born Newter Cup Clear Encore

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.760
 in Kiev in 1902, and he moved to America,

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.240
 but he was really into his tailoring,

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.200
 and then when he was processed,

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.640
 supposedly according to the story,

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.640
 when he was processed through Ellis Island,

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.840
 they changed his name to Newdy,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.280
 which I'm not sure how often that actually happened,

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.800
 and usually it was people just changing their name

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.840
 to sell more American themselves.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.880
 - And then he came to America, opened an underwear shop,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.320
 selling G-strings and pasties to strippers.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.480
 - Very broad range of West Cornwall, wasn't it?

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.840
 (laughing)

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840
 - But they're called pasties.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.840
 - They are called pasties.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840
 - They're called your nipples?

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.680
 - They are called pasties.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.000
 - Okay, I just thought, okay, he's going to get hungry,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.040
 and they're quite handy,

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.040
 because that whole meal running through them.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.560
 - If you get one hand on the pole,

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.080
 and then he's hold onto the cross.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.840
 - I think the strippers in Bolton do put pasties

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.040
 on their nipples, but...

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:18.960
 (laughing)

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.280
 - So they're all the more popular for it,

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.480
 as well as people love pasties.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.320
 They love pasties.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.160
 - Yeah.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.240
 - And he then had surgery when he was in his forties

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.400
 and lost all of his money,

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.120
 'cause he had to pay for the surgery in America.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.960
 And then he thought, what am I going to do?

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.440
 I'm going to make suits for celebrities.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.760
 And he got in touch with a guy called Text Williams.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.960
 Text Williams auctioned off his horse

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.720
 and used the money to buy New Deal sewing machine,

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.240
 and they went into business together.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.880
 - Well, you wouldn't have gone on with text.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.720
 - Yeah.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.560
 - Why?

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.560
 - You both love horses.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.560
 (laughing)

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.160
 - I could have started coming in and Rady's done so many times.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.960
 (laughing)

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.560
 - But yeah, I'd never heard this guy,

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.040
 and he was pretty big deal.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.880
 - Quite the guy.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.360
 - Yeah, that early stage when he was selling the pasties

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.600
 to strippers, he sold also Taylor Mae's G Strings.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.480
 - You don't, you don't, you don't them to not fit.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.000
 (laughing)

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.840
 - You're right.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.280
 - If you got round your knees.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.280
 (laughing)

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.680
 - Oh, was that happened again?

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.320
 I was just eating a pastie.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.480
 (laughing)

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.320
 - Oh dear.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.920
 - And the name New Deal became sort of synonymous

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.440
 with these amazing suits,

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.720
 and actually the New Deal name is still alive,

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.080
 thanks to his granddaughter.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.480
 Jamie Newdy, who seems to have taken his first name

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.720
 as her surname, no, not quite sure how.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.560
 (laughing)

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.360
 And so now they do still exist,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.720
 but they mostly make t-shirts and coffee mugs

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.040
 with the name Newdy on it.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.480
 They don't really make so many clothes anymore.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.920
 - His cars were absolutely bananas.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.920
 And I only say this because I've seen one of them,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.920
 I think in the flesh.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.760
 - No.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.480
 - In the Nashville Country Music Hall of Fame.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.320
 - Oh wow.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.760
 - And it's, I didn't know you'd been there.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.560
 - I mean, just 15 years ago.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.800
 - I thought I'd heard every one of your anecdotes.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.080
 - No, no, no, no.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.160
 - Why do you keep telling us the same three then?

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.920
 (laughing)

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.400
 - I feel like we're getting distracted

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.440
 from my fourth anecdotes.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.120
 (laughing)

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.680
 - All these facts, anyway.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.320
 - Yeah, go on, thank you so much, that way.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.200
 - It's an insane car.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.960
 It's got 18 pistols distributed around it.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.440
 It kind of built into the doors

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.960
 and things like that, all the inside.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.240
 It's got $1,200 silver dollars glued on

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.720
 the various points all over it.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.280
 My memory might be tricking me.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.520
 I feel like it's got a bison's horns on the front.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.360
 - Oh wow.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.320
 - Where you'd have the Mercedes sign or whatever.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.240
 It's got one of those.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.400
 I mean, it's an absolutely loopy.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.680
 - Well, you would plug in your electric vehicle.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.520
 - That's right.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.680
 (laughing)

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.480
 - Yeah, he was very obsessed with fashion

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.920
 as a lot of celebrities are.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.320
 Tom, you are one of the best-addressed comedians.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.960
 - Well, that's very generous to say fashion.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.880
 I've always liked zooting and tailoring.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.760
 I don't know, I think it makes me feel a certain way.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.920
 Sort of stand in a certain way.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.760
 I guess that's part of what tailoring has always done for people.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.240
 But yes, I do like to wear a suit.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.360
 - Yeah, I used to wear ties a lot.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.480
 And I've stopped in recent years

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.960
 and I feel less good as a human as a result.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.320
 So I think I might get back into it.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.800
 - Well, they're a flash of color, really, I suppose.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.840
 Or a bit of variation in the...

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.200
 - Well, you always wore a black one then you don't.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.200
 - Just black.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.040
 - Yeah.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:27.880
 - With a white shirt.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.280
 - Yeah, so I remember those days.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.120
 - Yes.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.360
 - The Mormon was here.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.280
 (laughing)

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.280
 - It saves time, doesn't it?

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.120
 - Yeah.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.120
 - So you don't have to change your clothes

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:36.960
 at the end of the gig.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.120
 You can just get out and fly all the way out.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.640
 - Pop the old badge on.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.920
 (laughing)

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.960
 - I don't know those books.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.560
 - I do, whoa, what's interesting is I read a study recently.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.440
 Is apparently when you wear a tie,

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.120
 it stops your blood flow by 7.5%.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:53.960
 - Really?

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.360
 - Well, that gets me high, so I like that.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.200
 That's what I'm missing.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.680
 - That's not an idea.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.200
 - To your brain?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.040
 - Yeah.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.360
 - So you've been operating with constrictor blood flow

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.760
 to your brain for some years?

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.720
 - They did MRI scans on 15 men who were wearing ties

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.720
 and 15 men who weren't.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.560
 - I'm actually going with the MRI machine.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.880
 (laughing)

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.720
 - Very smart clothes.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.880
 - Should I pop my umbrella in but I haven't?

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.640
 (laughing)

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.920
 - Yeah, and that's what they concluded.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.440
 So it is letting less, and it will give you headaches

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.560
 and dizziness and nausea if you wear a tie more.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.400
 - Wow.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.560
 - Then it won't do me, right?

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.400
 - Yeah.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.880
 - I find now it's evolved into the work where if men

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.240
 going to work is rather than suits,

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:38.560
 it is some skinny chinos, a quarter-zip jumper

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.520
 with a shirt underneath open neck and then a lanyard

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.680
 instead of a tie.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.520
 - I love it.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.640
 - So people don't wear a tie because they're lanyards.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.280
 Which I think will evolve maybe one day into something else

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.480
 or we've all become quite utilitarian, I think,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.480
 in our clothing.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.080
 I think we all become quite practical.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.720
 I think for a long time there was an air of

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.040
 Camboyance special of men's clothing, which isn't afforded

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.280
 so much now, I think if you went out, even me wearing a tie,

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.840
 people were like, "Oh, all right, all right."

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.520
 Well, I don't know if you're having a wedding today.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.400
 - You know, I'm literally just wearing the same things

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.240
 like my dad might have worn.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.160
 You know, but they can't seem like, yeah.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.000
 - Oh.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.200
 - I was thinking to tight clothes or snug clothes

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.600
 and clothing innovations, because it's really fun.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.440
 If you look in someone like new scientist

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.960
 for all the clothing inventions, it's all like,

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.560
 this is the clothing of tomorrow.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.200
 And so in 2007, Philips, the electronics people,

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.440
 they invented auto snug clothing, right?

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.120
 Which is where it's a clothes with muscle wires woven

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.120
 through the fabric.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.160
 You pick it up to the power and it adjusts

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.120
 until your trousers are the exact right size for you.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:38.960
 - That's good.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.440
 - And then you know exactly what trousers you need

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.600
 from now on.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.440
 - Yeah, I think that's great.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.280
 - I think that's useful.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.760
 I can imagine it going wrong, well.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.160
 - Oh, absolutely, yeah.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.160
 Like hundreds of people were electrocuted very bad.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.200
 It's very badly scorched during this.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.040
 But it's also, we have a tape measure.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.320
 We have the technology to find out

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.040
 what size trousers someone needs.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.120
 - It's not like until 2007 people were like,

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.360
 "Didn't I have like trousers in the size of my house?"

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.440
 (all laughing)

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.520
 - The other thing is it's different in different countries,

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.360
 right? - Yeah.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.640
 - So I bought a pair of large underpants in America

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.840
 and a pair in Japan and I could tell you,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.160
 one of those way too big for me and the other one,

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.640
 I can't even squeeze them too.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.360
 - This is why James has his G-string's tailor.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.640
 (all laughing)

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.400
 - Speaking of putting metal inside clothes,

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.040
 that's what Lame is, I didn't know this.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:35.040
 So Newdy in 1957 made Elvis Presley a $10,000 gold Lame suit.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.880
 And Lame is where you get your fabric,

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.560
 but then you put metallic fibers into it.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.400
 - Oh.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.880
 - I didn't know what that was.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.840
 - Where else is Lame used in the sporting world?

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.760
 - So gold being woven through.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.560
 - Or any metal woven through fabric.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.120
 - Not horse-raining.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.560
 - Aerodynamics, stuff.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.400
 - Nope.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.760
 - I've got a wild theory.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.600
 - Go on.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.600
 - Is it tennis rackets?

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.280
 - I thought you were gonna get it, but no.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.280
 (all laughing)

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.120
 For me the one?

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.120
 - No, it's not that, it's used in fencing.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.240
 - Oh, of course.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.640
 - Because you need to, when someone stabs you with the sword,

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.120
 they need to connect it.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.960
 And so it's the threads inside.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:20.480
 So all fences use Lame suits in the same way that Elvis did.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.160
 - That suit of Elvis is amazing.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.560
 - Did you see that in your,

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.400
 - Yes, I was gonna see.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.440
 - I don't remember if I saw it because they've,

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.380
 they've got a pair of the blue suede shoes.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.040
 You know, they've got a load of costumes and outfits.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.920
 But that is, if you're listening to this

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.440
 and you wanna know what that gold Lame suit is,

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.040
 it's on the front cover of an album,

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.320
 which gets referred to as 50 million Elvis fans

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.480
 can't be wrong, which is a very, very funny album title.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.320
 - Right.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.640
 - And it's this mad gold suit.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.480
 - Cool.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.320
 - It's very loose.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.960
 It doesn't fit him at all well by a modern standard.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.640
 - But it's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.000
 I think I might, I can't remember if I saw it there.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.080
 - You know, if there was a lightning storm, wouldn't it?

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:56.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.040
 - It would have been absolutely, absolutely.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.880
 - Absolutely.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.720
 - At the road.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.480
 - Found a comedy play from the 1805 called The Taylors,

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.400
 which was shown at Covent Garden.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.600
 And it was kind of taken a piss out of young dandies

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.040
 at the time.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.480
 And they were so annoyed with it that they all turned up

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.120
 and started booing the actors and stuff.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.880
 And not only that, they decided to throw,

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.760
 not rot 'em tomatoes, but scissors and cutting shears.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.080
 - Cool.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.320
 - At the actors throughout their opening night.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.160
 - Oh my God.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.480
 - Well, what is it?

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.200
 - Grizzly Adams is on the stage too.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.360
 (laughing)

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.480
 He has a terrible night.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.400
 (laughing)

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.240
 - Isn't that mad?

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.080
 - That's crazy.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.760
 - Yeah, that is, but how interesting to think of,

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.680
 a group of people who want to associate with sort of

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.800
 foppishness and not being particularly agitated.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.400
 - Yeah, but young dandies is like, you know,

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.680
 muds, rockers, that kind of--

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.680
 - Yeah, but isn't it?

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.600
 Yeah, I know it's an obvious thing to say,

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.880
 but one realises that the things we see today

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.280
 have all happened before.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.120
 - Yeah.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.520
 - The kind of protests, all those kind of groups

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.480
 people being, you know, people being outrageous,

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.720
 you know, dress sense as a protest or as an expression.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.400
 - It's interesting.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.640
 - I've got a riddle for you guys.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.480
 - Oh, give it.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.320
 - Okay.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.800
 - Carol Spencer was a fashion designer.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.600
 She's spent 30 years working for the same client

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.560
 designing clothes, but her clothes have never been worn

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.760
 by a human.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.600
 (laughing)

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.440
 - Riddle means.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.520
 (laughing)

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.680
 - It's like a lacy.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.320
 - Well, it's something, it wasn't a lacy.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.160
 - So it's nice.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.360
 - A horse saddle.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.840
 - It wasn't a horse related.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.040
 - James would have got it a bit like.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.880
 - James did it like.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.200
 (laughing)

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.440
 - I think I've got it.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.360
 - God, I know my hit rate with the tennis racket.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.200
 - Yeah.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.040
 - Back and that up.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.640
 I think it's a living Madame Tussaud's wax work

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.840
 and with the fashion changing of the first.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.680
 - Like the sauna.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.520
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.440
 - It's so fashion all the time.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.040
 - They keep the wax work, but they don't.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:51.880
 - And they change that.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.520
 - You're so close.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.360
 - Oh.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.200
 - You're so close.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.720
 It's a model of a person, but it's not Madame Tussaud.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.200
 - Oh, is it not the, is it Lenin who's kept in the cabinet?

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.040
 - It's not.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.320
 (laughing)

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.160
 - Lenin's fashion.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.000
 - Lenin, yeah.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.240
 (laughing)

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.680
 - Mr. February Revolution, it's Lenin again.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680
 (laughing)

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.560
 - The fashion show, where they're all kneeled out.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.360
 - Sherman Louse, summer, look.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.640
 (laughing)

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.360
 - Isn't the mannequin piece?

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.960
 - It's not the mannequin piece.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.080
 - Right, shall I tell you all?

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.680
 - Oh, I feel like we are close.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.680
 - I'll tell you this one more clue.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.720
 - Okay. - A client was only 11 1/2 inches high.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.120
 - Oh.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:34.960
 - She's fashionable.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.200
 She's got a lot of outfit changed.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.040
 - Bobby.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.880
 - It's Bobby.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.720
 - Oh.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.560
 - Oh.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.400
 - Oh.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.240
 - I don't even get there.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.080
 - I'm sorry.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.320
 - You're probably itching to tell us.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.160
 - No, no, no, no.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.680
 - To play the game is a bit longer.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.440
 (laughing)

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.440
 - I'm so sorry for truncating in Brutian.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.600
 - No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.840
 - I'm sure that we've all got homes to go to.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.080
 - The other people listening were like,

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.440
 "It's obviously Bobby."

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.760
 "Is it Lenin?"

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.360
 (laughing)

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.960
 (upbeat music)

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:05.320
 - Okay, that's it.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.400
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.920
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.640
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.680
 about the things that we've said

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.960
 over the course of this podcast,

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.720
 we can all be found online.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.680
 I'm on Instagram, on @Streiberland.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.520
 James.

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.560
 - Come find me on Tech Talk.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.920
 No such thing as James Harkin.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.760
 Andy.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.400
 - Instagram @AndruHunterRab.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.320
 - Tom, where could we find you?

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.080
 - My Instagram handle is @TomIndeed.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.360
 So do feel free to follow me there.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:31.960
 Or I have just started a visualized podcast.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.920
 I don't know if you're familiar with this idea.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.240
 And that is available from all podcast providers.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.720
 And also on YouTube @TomAllon is the handle.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.640
 And it's called "Pottering."

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.520
 And it's about gardening and being in the garden

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.520
 with my friends.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.360
 - Oh, great.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.280
 So you're in the garden.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.440
 You've got your guests sitting there

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.280
 in the distance.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.240
 We see a carpet just sort of wandering around.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.520
 - Yes, don't acknowledge him.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.960
 He's got another six years left.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.760
 (laughing)

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.320
 - Well, yeah, if you want to get to us as a group,

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.720
 go to podcast@qy.com.

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.200
 You can send us some facts.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.120
 You can send us some extra things

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.000
 that you want us to know about

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.840
 that we were talking about.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.040
 Whatever you send Andy goes through these emails.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.360
 He cherry picks the best of them

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.040
 and they make their way to our bonus show called Drop Us A Line.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.760
 Now this is part of a secret club called Club Fish,

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.160
 which you can find on Patreon.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.880
 If you go to patreon.com/nosuchthingasafish

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.960
 you can find all the details there.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.800
 And you can also send us your most interesting facts

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.560
 because we have a bonus show that goes out

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.160
 on this main feed called Little Fish every Monday.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.680
 And we will be reading out the best of your facts on that show.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.840
 Otherwise, just come back here.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.560
 Next week we're gonna be back again

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.280
 with another wonderful guest.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.400
 We'll see you then.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.240
 Good bye.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.820
 (upbeat music)

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.400
 (upbeat music)

00:53:48.400 --> 00:54:18.400
 (upbeat music)
