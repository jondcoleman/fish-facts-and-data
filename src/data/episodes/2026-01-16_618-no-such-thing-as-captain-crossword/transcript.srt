1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,000
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 of No Such Things A Fish, where we were joined by the legend.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,200
 The national treasure already, I think,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,040
 but definitely future national treasure, Tom Allen.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,000
 - That's right, Tom is absolutely fantastic

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,960
 as you're about to hear.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,760
 He's a flanner, he's a man of out town.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,680
 Among many other things, you might not think it

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,960
 'cause he's so dapper, but he's also a gardener.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,680
 - You might not think it 'cause he speaks so nicely,

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,120
 but he's also a podcaster.

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,960
 (laughing)

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 - And he has a new podcast out, it's called "Pottering" with Tom Allen,

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,720
 and he gets a celebrity to his garden,

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,640
 be it Nish Kumar, be it James A. Castor, be it Natalie Cassidy,

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,600
 and they talk about gardening.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,240
 - It's lovely, and I think they do some gardening as well, actually.

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,040
 - He probably has some Natalie Cassidy Bagonias,

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,760
 get some Nish Kumar, Asperd Distras.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
 - Lovely, can James name a third plunge?

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,520
 - Absolutely not, but if you want to hear Tom's podcast,

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,240
 then go to wherever you get your podcast,

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,320
 it's called "Pottering" with Tom Allen,

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,600
 and it's absolutely fantastic,

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,360
 but Andy, we have some more news.

27
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,840
 - That's right, the other thing to say is that,

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,720
 in a week's time, we're gonna be doing the first

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,560
 ever Club Fish Quiz.

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,200
 Now, this is for people who've joined Club Fish

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,760
 at the top tier, the friend of the podcast tier,

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,160
 we are gonna be doing a quiz globally, I imagine.

33
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,200
 We suspect hundreds of thousands may be attending,

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,320
 and you can be one of them, it's gonna be on Zoom,

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,360
 or an equivalent streaming platform.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,600
 We've all been writing our questions,

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,120
 we've been showing them to each other,

38
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,840
 we've been coming up with silly games,

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,160
 it's gonna be so much fun.

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,000
 So mark your diaries or your calendars

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,080
 for Friday, the 23rd of January, 7pm British time,

42
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,320
 but if you're around the world,

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,440
 we'd love to see you there as well.

44
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,480
 - Gonna be so much fun, we can't wait to do it.

45
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,320
 But anyway, please enjoy this week's episode

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,040
 of "No Six Things A Fish" with the incredible Tom Allen,

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
 on with the podcast.

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,120
 - On with the show.

49
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,980
 (upbeat music)

50
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:05,720
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,400
 of "No Such Thing" as a Fish, a weekly podcast

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,040
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,600
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Tom Allen.

55
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

56
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,680
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,840
 and in a particular order, here we go.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Tom.

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
 - In September 1945, a small booklet was discovered

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,840
 in the main offices of the third Reich in Berlin,

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,240
 or Reich, if you're from southern Germany.

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,640
 In Berlin, it was a secret list of 2,820 British individuals

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,600
 who'd be rounded up in the event

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,040
 of a successful invasion, and Noel Coward found his name

65
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,680
 on page 34.

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,800
 - Oh, okay, why were they going after him?

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,240
 - Well, firstly, I think anybody in an entertainment

68
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,760
 would be annoyed that they had to go so far.

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,600
 (laughing)

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
 - Mind your own name.

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,240
 - There's only one thing worse than being on the Nazis,

72
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
 deathless.

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,720
 (laughing)

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
 - And that's not being on the, I can't believe

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,320
 you're quoting Oscar Wilde in a Noel Coward section.

76
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,600
 - Oh yeah, we'll get onto that.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
 - Well, they just kind of crossed over

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,040
 in a sort of Dalai Lama way, yeah, yeah.

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
 - Is that what was he?

80
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,520
 - Very Dalai Lama way.

81
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,280
 - Have you ever looked at who died just before you were born?

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,360
 - No, I never had.

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,200
 - Oh, that's a funny thing.

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
 - There was one of the popes,

85
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,480
 the one that was before John Paul II.

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,320
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

87
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,240
 - So I think it was, yeah, just before I was born,

88
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,440
 you died, so I'm not saying anything else,

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 but I am Catholic, so.

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,320
 - I think you could still do it as well.

91
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
 - I can?

92
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,040
 - Well, no, I've been excommunicated as we've said,

93
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,880
 but.

94
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,800
 - But what a comeback story that would be for you.

95
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
 - Yeah, and actually the Pope.

96
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,880
 - I can change the rules if I'm the Pope.

97
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
 - Yes, yeah. - Exactly.

98
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,440
 - Yeah, yeah.

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,040
 - Let's get back to Noel Coward.

100
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,280
 - I know, I like that.

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,040
 I was suddenly panicking about who died in 1983.

102
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,880
 - Yeah, lots.

103
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,320
 - Mount Batson, no, that was '70, '70s.

104
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,400
 - Yes, Mount Batson was.

105
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
 - I went straight through.

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,720
 - I just got to see what this is.

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,880
 (laughing)

108
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,480
 - We should quickly say who Noel Coward is.

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,640
 Noel Coward, very famous way around.

110
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,240
 - Yes, I didn't bother to say that.

111
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,800
 I just assumed all your listeners would know who he was.

112
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,240
 - Yeah, but you know better than anyone,

113
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,840
 'cause you're part of the Noel Coward Society.

114
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,200
 - Well, I have been involved.

115
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,480
 But I, the, the, Noel Coward, yeah,

116
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,840
 usually seen as a playwright and a writer of songs,

117
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,640
 particularly Mad Dogs and Englishman.

118
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,160
 He was also an actor, musician, and an author as well.

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,320
 He wrote a novel.

120
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,680
 Well, he was wanted by the sinister,

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,000
 Armstrong, V1, V1, V1, V1, I don't know what,

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
 I don't know what that looked like.

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,920
 - I was like a music channel in Germany.

124
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,200
 - I'm so glad for V1, V1, V1, I'm glad to come.

125
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,240
 A department, it was a department that evaluated

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
 intelligence material.

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,520
 Well, he was a, it turned out a British spy.

128
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,560
 And his cover had apparently been blown.

129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,720
 And if the war had gone differently, well,

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,800
 the man known the world over further song,

131
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,520
 "Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans"

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,120
 could have ended his days in front of a firing squad.

133
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,280
 - Wow. - So, yeah.

134
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,680
 And when the list was discovered amongst other people

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,520
 who the Nazis didn't like for various reasons,

136
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,120
 and the author Rebecca West sent him a telegram to say,

137
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,640
 "My dear, the people who were to be seen dead with."

138
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,000
 - It was very cool. - That's very good.

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,480
 - This song, interestingly,

140
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,280
 got him in a bit of trouble back home, didn't it?

141
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,240
 - Yeah. - What was it called again?

142
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
 It was cool.

143
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,160
 - "Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans."

144
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,040
 - Yeah, so came out during World War II.

145
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,440
 It was a satire.

146
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,080
 It was-- - It was signed by the BBC.

147
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,160
 - Exactly, because the satire didn't quite cross

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
 as well as he hoped it would.

149
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,120
 They thought that he was actually genuinely saying that.

150
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,920
 - I was excited about it, because I think it's the only thing

151
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,720
 that Noel Coward has in common with the prodigy

152
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
 I found there, songs "Smack My Bitch Up,"

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,160
 which was also banned by the BBC.

154
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
 - Can you imagine that him reading "Smack My Bitch Up"

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 Noel Coward in his accent? - "Smack My Bitch Up."

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
 - He'd have-- I think he'd have gustyed up the lyrics a bit.

157
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,600
 He'd have made them cleverer.

158
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,440
 - But I always wondered how he got away with being a spy,

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,880
 'cause he was so flamboyant, right?

160
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,960
 It seems like as a spy you have to hide away a little bit.

161
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
 - Well, Radio IV did a dramatized version of what he was like.

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
 I think a lot of it as well was propaganda work

163
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,240
 in North America, obviously, the US.

164
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
 I think to Ghana support for getting on board with the war effort,

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
 which I know wasn't the case at the beginning.

166
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,520
 So I think he was seen as sort of a special envoy,

167
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,680
 I suppose, as much as anything.

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
 I don't think he was going behind enemy lines.

169
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,200
 - No, but I'm-- - Hamburg.

170
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,160
 - He'd been recruited even before the war started.

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
 I think there was someone called Sir Robin Vancetart

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,320
 who was running-- - Sounds German, actually.

173
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,680
 - Yes, but he was at the foreign office

174
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,560
 and he was recruiting various people

175
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,040
 to go about their business in Europe, quite successful people,

176
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,240
 and then report back on the national mood,

177
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,040
 what people were saying, just kind of sort of soft intelligence,

178
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,880
 as it were, not, you know.

179
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,680
 You don't need to observe this tank column

180
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,360
 and where it's going, this ball bearings factory.

181
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,680
 It was just like what you're hearing in social conversations.

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,520
 And I think Coward was sacked partly

183
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,400
 because he was too public in his maneuverings.

184
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,600
 And also because everyone looked at him,

185
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,960
 and this is after the war started,

186
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
 and they just thought, we've just got to a load of parties

187
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,240
 and man, happening, you're really letting the side down.

188
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,840
 And actually, he was doing the war work, like he was doing.

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,320
 - He was, he was really publicly shamed about it, I think.

190
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,080
 - Yeah. - I think the Daily Mail covered about it,

191
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,680
 and said like, they said outrage, go it over there,

192
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,680
 spit it all this money, public money, go to parties.

193
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
 - The Daily Mail, who's departed,

194
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,920
 that's, he's just before the war.

195
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,240
 - Ooh. - Well, it might, yeah, I mean.

196
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,400
 - Yeah. - But I should check,

197
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
 I should check, it was the Daily Mail,

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,200
 but it's out there and I'm lovely.

199
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,000
 - Well, he used to, again, trouble with the daily express.

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
 - Yeah, and actually, this is another war connection.

201
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,600
 So he wrote the screenplay and started a movie called,

202
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,440
 in which we serve, which was a really good movie,

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,480
 often got used to get the morale up

204
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,800
 and show how the war was going.

205
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,320
 And he kind of based the character on your past life.

206
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,640
 - No, that's, and yeah.

207
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,840
 - So he consulted with him and that was largely part of it.

208
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
 - Could we say who went back and was it?

209
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,360
 - Sorry, yeah. - Yeah, he was,

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,600
 he was. - Oh, oh, Mountbaton, I think.

211
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,200
 - Oh, Mountbaton. - Yeah, Lord Mountbaton, wasn't he?

212
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

213
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,400
 - And he was, he was Prince Philip's uncle

214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,880
 by loose connection, I haven't researched it.

215
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,560
 - By big, the brother of his mother, or, yeah.

216
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,840
 So it's kind of like loosely unpleased to him.

217
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,160
 - Is it like one of those uncles,

218
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
 who's like just friends with your parents?

219
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,840
 - I have a feeling if we're, yeah, exactly.

220
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,040
 And you were shocked at some point

221
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,280
 to find out that wasn't your uncle.

222
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,680
 I remember this when I was five.

223
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,600
 I found out Uncle Joe wasn't my uncle.

224
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
 And I was a bit outraged.

225
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,760
 - Uncle Joe. - Yeah, I was in a cup of coffee.

226
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,480
 - Yeah, so anyway, Mountbaton was part of this thing

227
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
 with Noel Coward.

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,360
 And the daily express started ridiculing the production,

229
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,560
 saying that how could you have Noel Coward play

230
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,480
 a high-ranking general in the army?

231
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,880
 - He's a captain.

232
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
 - A captain, right?

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,160
 - In the Navy. - He wasn't.

234
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,280
 - Yeah, yeah, he didn't come across.

235
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,120
 - Apart from that, don't carry on.

236
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,520
 - I feel like I'm going quite lost in it.

237
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,800
 - Sorry, no, I'm barely tripping it.

238
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,320
 Well, I mean, I'm pretty sure he's a captain.

239
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,160
 I haven't watched it, bro.

240
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,440
 - I haven't seen the movie and you're a part of the sustain.

241
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,640
 And you're being absolutely pancake

242
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
 between Tom's love of Noel Coward

243
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,480
 and my love of military rank.

244
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
 (laughing)

245
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
 Sorry.

246
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,840
 - Just bring a bit of golf into it.

247
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,960
 - You absolutely can't.

248
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
 (laughing)

249
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,960
 - Yeah.

250
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,520
 - It seems quite out of time to me, Noel Coward.

251
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
 - I know his name and I know he's part of the plays,

252
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
 but I do, you mentioned Oscar Wilde

253
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,400
 before I do play some as part of that era,

254
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,520
 but he was in things like the Italian job.

255
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,360
 - Yes.

256
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
 - He was, you know, in the '60s.

257
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
 - Yeah.

258
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,360
 - That was his, I think, his last acting role.

259
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,200
 - Right.

260
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
 - He was born in 1899.

261
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,320
 And he served briefly in the First World War,

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,280
 which I didn't know.

263
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
 'Cause again, I think of him as like,

264
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
 he's wearing his pajamas, maybe dressed in gown.

265
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
 He's smoking a pipe through a long holder.

266
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,640
 He's writing brilliant dialogue.

267
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,280
 He's writing plays like Blind Spirit and Haifi, you know.

268
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
 - Yeah.

269
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
 - Witt.

270
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,480
 - But he served in this company called the,

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,080
 the Artists Rifles, which--

272
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,800
 - Just sounds awful, doesn't it?

273
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,000
 I think it was so, yeah, I think it was a place where

274
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,160
 maybe I don't want to be unkind.

275
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,160
 Maybe slightly less useful fighters were replaced.

276
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,640
 And I think he wasn't ever put in any sort of position

277
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,240
 where he'd have to do anything to practical.

278
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,080
 - Well, he got himself out of it quite fast.

279
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 And this was only in, I mean, he was born in 1899.

280
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 So I think he was signed up aged 18

281
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
 or maybe conscripted.

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,760
 I'm not sure.

283
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,440
 He was discharged for Neurosthenia,

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
 which was very much a catchal you've got nerves.

285
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,040
 - Sort of tying a piece of string around his finger.

286
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
 - Why?

287
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
 - I guess it's sort of stress.

288
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
 - A stressor situation, definitely.

289
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,360
 - It'd be a tick talk about it now.

290
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
 - But I think part of the reason he got so involved

291
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,480
 in World War II as a spy or whatever,

292
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,360
 is 'cause he was a bit embarrassed by the fact

293
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
 that he'd gone into World War I quite young

294
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,200
 and then had to leave quite quickly.

295
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,240
 - Yeah, his company suffered lots of casualties

296
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
 in the last two months of the war.

297
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
 I mean, hundreds, you know?

298
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,320
 So I think, and that was after he'd been

299
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,560
 invalidated out as it were.

300
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,800
 So yeah.

301
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,640
 - I love the main thing about him outside of his plays

302
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,600
 and his acting and his songs is the gossip.

303
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,960
 He was Mr. Annicdote, basically.

304
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,120
 He's like the Charles Brandrath of his day.

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
 (laughing)

306
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,440
 - Charles will be very happy.

307
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
 - Charles Brandrath was absolutely in love with that.

308
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,520
 (laughing)

309
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,880
 Oh my goodness.

310
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,720
 What a Christmas breath of joy.

311
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,560
 (laughing)

312
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
 Well, we'll clip this out inside of him.

313
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,640
 - Yes.

314
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,440
 - And so there's one great war, Annicdote from him,

315
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
 which is he said, he never forgot the site

316
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
 of Coco Chanel entering a Paris air raid shelter

317
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,760
 followed by a maid who carried a gas mask

318
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,040
 on a velvet cushion.

319
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,880
 (laughing)

320
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
 - That's wonderful stories.

321
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
 - It was a time when people did,

322
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,400
 well, I know there was strata of class,

323
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,480
 but I think if you did transcend those strata,

324
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,080
 you would just end up being at parties with these people.

325
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
 - Yeah.

326
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,760
 - I don't know, maybe it would be the same now,

327
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,600
 but I mean, just like--

328
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,600
 - Because his mother, I think, had some vague sort of connection

329
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
 to the aristocracy.

330
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,600
 - Oh, is that really?

331
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 - Maybe like an uncle or something.

332
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
 (laughing)

333
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,240
 - Yeah, she, like, feel mashable.

334
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,080
 Hague was a distant cousin of hers,

335
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,760
 and her sister married the nephew of Sir Henry Ponsonby,

336
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,600
 who was private secretary to Perquean Victoria.

337
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
 - Oh.

338
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
 - So they were kind of like close to high society,

339
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,640
 but not quite in there until he became very famous

340
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,280
 and really hobnobbed with the--

341
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,120
 - Right.

342
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,720
 - Yeah, 'cause I don't know what kind of pretty lower middle class

343
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,760
 grew up in Southwest London and very suburban reasonably poor.

344
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,520
 And his mum was a real stage mum.

345
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,640
 - Yes, she was the Mrs. Worthington, I think.

346
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,600
 She was the real Mrs. Worthington.

347
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,440
 - She pushed it.

348
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,320
 - Mrs. Worthington is--

349
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,480
 - Oh, is a song, don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington.

350
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,280
 It's kind of a song told from the position of a producer,

351
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,480
 I think, in an audition, but essentially kind of saying

352
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,320
 to this very pushy stage mum.

353
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
 She's talentless, please stop putting it into the audience.

354
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,400
 But Noel Carrot's career happened partly

355
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,920
 because of a medium spiritual guidance.

356
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,600
 So his mum went to a show at the Coliseum

357
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,240
 and an American celebrity medium Anna Eva Fay.

358
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,680
 And his mum asked, "Should Noel, young Noel here,

359
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,440
 go back to school or should he stay as a child actor?"

360
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,240
 And from beneath this big sheet that she was (laughs)

361
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,080
 a medium Anna Fay said, "Keep acting."

362
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
 - Oh, wow.

363
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
 - Yeah, I didn't know that.

364
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,440
 So that was a, I think, I suspect they probably would have kept

365
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,840
 him acting, even if the medium had said, "Go back to school!"

366
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
 And I suspect the ambition was strong.

367
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
 - Still there.

368
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,160
 I haven't seen Blife's spirit, but I think it's a very satirical

369
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,680
 about the spiritualism movement.

370
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,840
 - Is that right?

371
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,680
 Is it sort of parodying it?

372
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,480
 - It was a big drive towards it, wasn't it?

373
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
 The 20s and 30s?

374
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
 - Yeah.

375
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,320
 - Yeah.

376
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
 - Where people would have--

377
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,960
 - Yeah, I guess, I mean, that probably makes sense, doesn't it?

378
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,960
 But my dad, even remembers his grandmother having her friends

379
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,800
 around for like a say-on, which isn't it?

380
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,600
 - Like they go into the back room or something, yeah.

381
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,560
 And all these women would come in and try and contact with dad.

382
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
 - Yeah.

383
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,360
 - But it was kind of seen as his thing that people do quite

384
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
 socially.

385
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,360
 - It was like a book club of its day.

387
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,240
 - The book club of its day, exactly.

388
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,200
 - His writing was extraordinary, the speed at which he wrote,

389
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,680
 because there were so many knoll-coward plays.

390
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,520
 There was a story that, in 1935, in the summer of that year

391
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,040
 alone, he wrote nine plays.

392
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,520
 That's how quick he knocked out a song called "I'll See You Again,"

393
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,840
 which Frank Sinatra recorded while he was stuck in a taxi

394
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,960
 in a traffic jam.

395
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,800
 - It's similar to, I think, Elton John, in the way

396
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,960
 that he, apparently, writes his songs in five minutes.

397
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,800
 - I really do.

398
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,000
 - That's the tangents and tiaras.

399
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,880
 It's something about that creativity.

400
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,320
 It's something quite useful about actually not allowing

401
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,040
 lots of time.

402
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,800
 - Yes.

403
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,080
 - And he also says the songs slightly come to him.

404
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,160
 He doesn't claim to have written.

405
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,000
 - Is that Elton John now?

406
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,840
 - Yeah.

407
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,200
 - Elton John will say that the songs sort of arrived to him.

408
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,400
 - After the war, just to go back to his sort of post-war life,

409
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,360
 he spent a lot of time with the Navy.

410
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,880
 And in fact, during the war as well,

411
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,240
 he frequently would just hitch a lift on royal Navy ships.

412
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,080
 - Really?

413
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
 - Yeah.

414
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
 - He would just...

415
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,760
 - So he had to get on that.

416
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,120
 - Well, how did he get off?

417
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,720
 - He spent a lot of his life as a tax exile

418
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,560
 because he was so financially successful

419
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,880
 in the first half of his life

420
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
 that a lot of his life was just moving around

421
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,040
 to different low-taxed jurisdictions.

422
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,760
 And he once joined a ship in Bermuda called H.M. Dragon

423
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,600
 and, or H.M.S. Dragon, maybe.

424
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
 And the captain said, "What the hell are you doing

425
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
 on board this ship?"

426
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,560
 And Coward replied that he was,

427
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,680
 quote, "exhausted overworked on the verge of a nervous breakdown

428
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,800
 and to join the ship in order to be nurse back to health

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,600
 strength and wait it on hand and foot."

430
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 And the captain not only gave him a lift to Trinidad,

431
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,440
 he gave him loads more lifts later on.

432
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,840
 They became friends.

433
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,280
 - This was just like...

434
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,640
 - Is as well as a naval captain,

435
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,320
 you might be quite pleased

436
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
 that if somebody, which he and famous,

437
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
 was suddenly on board.

438
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,760
 - Oh, yeah, great.

439
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,920
 - That's the entertainment.

440
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,760
 - Yeah, absolutely.

441
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,960
 - And better than the inser or whatever it's called.

442
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,840
 - You say he was rich, he was so rich.

443
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,080
 He was making £50,000 a year,

444
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,120
 the equivalent of which today,

445
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,480
 that would be £15 million per year

446
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,440
 that he was making in the late 20s.

447
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,120
 - In the late 20s and he was really burning through it, though,

448
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,680
 so he had a lot of financial problems

449
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,200
 and hence moving to tax havens like Jamaica,

450
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,040
 where he moved right next door to Ian Fleming.

451
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,880
 - Oh, yes.

452
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,720
 - Yeah.

453
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
 - Yeah, I love this spy.

454
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
 - Yeah.

455
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,000
 - And there are stories that he turned down the role of Doctor No,

456
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,440
 that that was actually offered to him for the first bond.

457
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,520
 - He was just called Doctor before they offered it to him.

458
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,760
 (laughing)

459
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,080
 - Doctor Noel Coward.

460
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,160
 - That's the original.

461
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,280
 (laughing)

462
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,840
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

463
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,200
 and that is my fact.

464
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,000
 My fact this week is that there is a Marvel superhero

465
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,560
 called The Gardener,

466
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,520
 whose superpower is that he is insanely good at gardening.

467
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,760
 - So is it that he can grow things very, very fast?

468
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,400
 - No, it's more that he is obsessed with gardening.

469
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
 (laughing)

470
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,680
 - And he is almost an immortal.

471
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,400
 - Gardener gets supposed to be good for you

472
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,640
 if you're getting older.

473
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
 - Yeah.

474
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,640
 - Like it helps you live longer, doesn't it?

475
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
 - Exactly.

476
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,200
 - Well, yeah, and potentially forever.

477
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,040
 - It's your life.

478
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,880
 - It's forever.

479
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
 - You give enough time to it.

480
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,000
 So he's part of this group called The Elders of the Universe.

481
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,840
 And basically,

482
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,440
 the other one is really good at bowls.

483
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,240
 (laughing)

484
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,240
 - The other one is just really good at being racist.

485
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,880
 (laughing)

486
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,760
 - Absolutely ruins Christmas, yeah.

487
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,280
 - Captain Crossword, come and say it.

488
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,520
 (laughing)

489
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
 - Yeah, okay, these are each of them

490
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,720
 with the last survivors of their own race.

491
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 And these were races that evolved just after the Big Bang.

492
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,720
 And the idea is that they have extended lifespans,

493
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,320
 but not because of a mortal,

494
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,200
 but because of a single-minded obsession with a hobby.

495
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,040
 - That's cool.

496
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,880
 - Yeah.

497
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
 - That can be, I'll back that.

498
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,560
 - There you go.

499
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,440
 So his hobby was gardening and horticulture.

500
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,400
 And the idea is that he would go from planet to planet

501
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,360
 and he would spend sort of up to a year,

502
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,520
 sort of terraforming it, making it greener guys.

503
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
 - Yeah, that's sad.

504
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,560
 - Yeah, it might come into his own, actually.

505
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,400
 - Yeah.

506
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,240
 - I'm actually conscious age.

507
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
 - There you go.

508
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 Well, he should be a bigger character

509
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,400
 'cause actually in the original--

510
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 - I think I should play him.

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,280
 (laughing)

512
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,600
 - In the original stories,

513
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,360
 he and the other Elders all had the Infinity Gems,

514
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,240
 which is what Thanos collects

515
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
 as part of the main Avengers storyline

516
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
 in order to wipe out all of--

517
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,720
 - Oh, so he's one of the original holders of one of these?

518
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,560
 - Yeah.

519
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,040
 And because some reason when it came to the movie adapted,

520
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,200
 the gardener didn't quite get--

521
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,040
 - Pretty cool.

522
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
 That's what I'm thinking.

523
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,880
 - Oh, right.

524
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
 - I'm talking about that.

525
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
 - Yeah, but yeah, I'd love that.

526
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,840
 - Yeah.

527
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,960
 - I've seen with like a big wide-brimmed hat.

528
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,800
 - Yeah.

529
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,560
 - You know, the sort of thing that old ladies used to have.

530
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,400
 - Oh, yes, yeah.

531
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
 (laughing)

532
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,240
 - Loves on--

533
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
 - Obviously, floral gloves in one of those kneeling pads.

534
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,800
 - I've got one.

535
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,640
 - I've got one.

536
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,480
 - They are very useful.

537
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

538
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,160
 - The best ones when you've got a handle at the side

539
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,920
 - Push yourself up. - Ooh, yeah, they're good.

540
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,160
 - It's like an upside-down cano store, really.

541
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
 - That's really helpful.

542
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,240
 - And then you've got just to have a couple of beats

543
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,560
 to be like, "Oh, with my knees."

544
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,400
 - Yeah, absolutely.

545
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,240
 - They carry on.

546
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,320
 - Okay, we're talking to a seasoned gardener here, I'm guessing.

547
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,080
 - Well, I's salty, maybe, if it's just about seasoned.

548
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,880
 (laughing)

549
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,840
 - You do have a garden, though, that you love to--

550
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,320
 - I've got-- I've gotten into gardening.

551
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,800
 I like to use the past tense of God.

552
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 And I've gotten into gardening in the last sort of four years

553
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,160
 since having my own place.

554
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
 For a long time, I lived with my parents

555
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,040
 and I didn't have my own space then.

556
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,120
 And so now I do, and it's quite nice just to--

557
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,920
 - Well, just mess around, really.

558
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,040
 I'm proud and obvious with it,

559
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,320
 but I find it really interesting.

560
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
 - So on famous gardeners, who's the most famous gardener

561
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,280
 in the UK?

562
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,800
 - Alan Titchfash. - Correct.

563
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,640
 - What has Alan Titchfash got in common

564
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,440
 with Elvis Presley?

565
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,400
 - Ooh, okay, both from Memphis, that's obvious.

566
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,520
 (laughing)

567
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,400
 - Both sex gods.

568
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
 - Okay, I'll give you that.

569
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,120
 It's slightly related to that.

570
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,960
 - Poets?

571
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,480
 - He writes poetry, Titchfash.

572
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,320
 - It's not that.

573
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,600
 - Okay. - I've been to jail.

574
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,240
 - Well, Elvis had a song about it.

575
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,200
 Titchfash was done out for years, wasn't he?

576
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,800
 - For years, yeah.

577
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,240
 - That's why he has honest tattoos.

578
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,080
 - Yeah.

579
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,360
 (laughing)

580
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,400
 - Come as them up for the show of class.

581
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,760
 (laughing)

582
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,080
 - One for everybody killed in prison.

583
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,560
 - It's how he got into gardening was burying the bodies.

584
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,200
 (laughing)

585
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,880
 - The answer is that the lower halves

586
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,440
 have been censored on television.

587
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,280
 - Really?

588
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,880
 - So Elvis, obviously, when he became big,

589
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
 they would only show him from the waist up

590
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,320
 so that people didn't get too excited.

591
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,080
 But Alan Titchfash has been--

592
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,720
 - They were censored for the waist out.

593
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,320
 (laughing)

594
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,120
 - They have censored his trousers

595
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,280
 because he was jeans and in North Korea,

596
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,000
 they don't like jeans being shown

597
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,240
 because it's a symbol of America.

598
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,760
 So they show his programs,

599
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
 but they blur out his trousers.

600
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
 - Wow.

601
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,320
 - But that means he's free to broadcast

602
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,920
 when he the post-style.

603
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,760
 - Yeah.

604
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
 (laughing)

605
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,160
 - So the North Korean that works, he's--

606
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,200
 - He's there.

607
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,000
 - You have to paint his legs blue.

608
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,920
 (laughing)

609
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,040
 - I've seen Titchfash do karaoke.

610
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
 - Have you, in person?

611
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,800
 - In person.

612
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,960
 - Wow. - I don't mean to clang.

613
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,800
 - What did he say?

614
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,160
 Something green, green grass.

615
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,280
 - It was, or what's the one I killed a man in Reno?

616
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,320
 (laughing)

617
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,560
 - Gangster's paradise as well.

618
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
 (laughing)

619
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,280
 - Yeah, I don't remember the song, but it was, yeah.

620
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,200
 - Wow, that's very cool.

621
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,140
 Well, there's other reasons

622
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,000
 that Alan Titchfash is a sex god, by the way,

623
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,600
 which is that as well as writing over something

624
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,440
 like 70 gardening books,

625
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,960
 he's written a series of novels.

626
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,240
 - Yes, they are.

627
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,440
 - Are they seen?

628
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,280
 - Are they?

629
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,880
 - Yeah, in fact, I don't know if you remember,

630
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,840
 but we had Lou Sanders read Morrissey's contribution

631
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,720
 to the world of sex scenes.

632
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,360
 - Tom, do you mind?

633
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,120
 - I've got a little extra here.

634
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,960
 - Oh, here we go.

635
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,680
 - Well, I think I have met Alan a few times

636
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,680
 and he's always very charming, as you'd imagine.

637
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,720
 And he did say to me, 'cause I was talking to him

638
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
 about audio books, and he did say he was very aware

639
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,280
 of his more intimate scenes when he had to sit

640
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,400
 in a booth, and read them out, to an engineer.

641
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 So as an example of what he might have been reading,

642
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,480
 there is a little bit here.

643
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,160
 She planted moist hot kisses all over his body.

644
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,520
 Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead for it,

645
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,120
 as he became more entangled in the lism limbs

646
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,600
 of this human bower constrictor.

647
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,120
 It's only 15 minutes, their mutual passion heightened

648
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,640
 with groans, sighs, and liquid noises.

649
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,120
 (laughing)

650
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,720
 - Oh, wow, can I just say, when you're describing lens,

651
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,720
 why'd go for the one animal that doesn't have any lens?

652
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,760
 - Little lism, lism limb.

653
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,000
 - I don't know what lism means.

654
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,560
 - I've never heard that word before.

655
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,920
 - Lism is kind of young and firm and strong, isn't it?

656
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,760
 - Is it?

657
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,600
 - Oh, sorry.

658
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,440
 - Yeah, yeah.

659
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,200
 - Rich marshes, too highbrow for us.

660
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,280
 We don't know the vocabulary.

661
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
 - I know, I bet he lism.

662
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,600
 - He's a very educated man.

663
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,080
 - I like the way it begins with sheep planted kisses.

664
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,360
 Like, 'cause obviously he's a gardener.

665
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,200
 - Absolutely.

666
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
 - Oh, every, every.

667
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,120
 - Well, he was wonderful.

668
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,280
 - So he was runner up in the 1998 Literary Review

669
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,920
 Bad Sex Awards.

670
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,880
 And you're right, he felt very uncomfortable reading them.

671
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,080
 He said, particularly with a sheet of glass between you

672
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,040
 and a very large bearded man, twiddling knobs,

673
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,600
 as you say the words, he found it uncomfortable.

674
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,640
 - I think it's a bit unfair that bad sex thing,

675
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,280
 'cause they go for slabs, don't they?

676
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,120
 - Yeah.

677
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,600
 - There must be loads of like not famous people

678
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 who are writing worse.

679
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,440
 - Absolutely.

680
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,280
 - What?

681
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,960
 - To be fair, the winner that year was Sebastian Forks.

682
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,640
 - I was gonna say bird song.

683
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,000
 It's got lots of that, that's very interesting.

684
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,560
 - Bird song's got some very fruity stuff in it.

685
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,080
 - So he was very fruity.

686
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,640
 - I remember reading that when I was about 17

687
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,040
 and thinking, oh gosh, that seems like a lot of effort.

688
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,240
 (laughing)

689
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,720
 - Can I ask you about a couple of things you might

690
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
 or might not use in your garden, Tom?

691
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,040
 - Oh yeah, absolutely.

692
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,880
 - Should we give it a go?

693
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,720
 Right.

694
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,000
 Do you ever use worm poo tea bags?

695
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,320
 No, I think I have heard of this sort of thing.

696
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,160
 - So cool.

697
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,240
 - Worms are very important, aren't they?

698
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,320
 - Worms are vital.

699
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,560
 - And obviously they eat soil.

700
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
 They poo it out.

701
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
 You know, they help.

702
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,400
 - So do I.

703
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,120
 - They do their aerate, all sorts of stuff.

704
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,200
 You can get tea bags with worm castings, are you worm poo?

705
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,800
 Where you literally make a cup of tea out of it

706
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,040
 for your plant and it really helps your plant.

707
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,880
 - Really?

708
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,200
 - Lion urine?

709
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,040
 - Well that's the thing, isn't it?

710
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,920
 Because people say to keep away foxes or other animals

711
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
 if you want them out of your garden.

712
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,880
 - You need an apex predator.

713
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,960
 - You need an apex, you can't.

714
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,600
 The people say, oh just go and we in the garden

715
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,240
 and then like, no, then you mend to we in the garden.

716
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,880
 It's male urine they respond to.

717
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,000
 And apparently that's not, that's not going to do it.

718
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
 Apparently you need to go to the zoo and ask,

719
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,960
 yeah, I'm going to get a lion to we into a cup.

720
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,640
 (laughing)

721
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
 - Or you can get the piss off plant.

722
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,080
 - Have you heard of that?

723
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,920
 - What's that?

724
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,560
 - Piss off plant is a plant that's native

725
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,640
 to southern in eastern Africa and it is a plant

726
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,080
 that supposedly repels dogs and cats from coming near it

727
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,200
 because of the aroma that it emits.

728
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,440
 So if you had that in your garden,

729
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,000
 most likely they would smell it and never come back again.

730
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,840
 - I'll get one of it.

731
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,080
 - That's pretty good, that's a great idea.

732
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,720
 Do you have an ornamental hermit in your garden?

733
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,160
 - No, I don't have anything like that.

734
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,800
 That was like a sort of a little house,

735
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,920
 wasn't it worded a little.

736
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,200
 - Well back in the 18th century,

737
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,320
 this was a real life human

738
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,200
 that you would bring into your garden.

739
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,040
 - Yeah.

740
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,080
 - They would dress like a druid

741
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,680
 and they would just be sat

742
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,000
 and they would have a contract to live there

743
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,320
 and negotiations for roaches and negotiations

744
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,240
 every autumn as the roaches.

745
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,560
 - Well look, I'm not gonna do this for another year.

746
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,320
 Let's you revise my terms.

747
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,680
 - No, yeah, it's been in 1797.

748
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,760
 There was a thing written up that said,

749
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,120
 the hermit is never to leave the place

750
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,440
 or hold conversation with anyone for seven years

751
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,520
 during which he is neither to wash himself

752
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,880
 or cleanse himself in any way whatsoever.

753
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,720
 - Yeah, my agent's got a problem with his clothes

754
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,320
 and I'm like, yeah, (laughing)

755
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,160
 agent lives a bit further down the garden

756
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,360
 and another little folly.

757
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,200
 - Yeah.

758
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,280
 - Do we know why people did that?

759
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,800
 - Well, I think it's a kind of,

760
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,120
 it would be like landed gentry would have this person.

761
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,480
 You wouldn't have it in your garden in the hackney.

762
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,680
 - I think, no, exactly.

763
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,520
 I think what it is is,

764
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,840
 the hermit is a symbol of a wilder

765
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,320
 and ancient way of living

766
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,160
 and it's kind of they are reflecting on history

767
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,320
 and on humanity and on progress and the countryside

768
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,080
 and the wilderness and I think that's why it's cool

769
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,400
 to have a hermit 'cause they kind of hark back to that.

770
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,240
 - Yeah.

771
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,080
 - Okay.

772
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,400
 - This has been that kind of sentimentality

773
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,960
 isn't it around that kind of pastoral?

774
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,200
 - Yeah, it all.

775
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,680
 - There was one place which had a hermit

776
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,600
 which turned out to be a mechanical hermit.

777
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,840
 - Genuinely.

778
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
 - I think it was an 18th century aristocrat.

779
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,600
 - Quite clearly it was a hermit.

780
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,440
 (laughing)

781
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,080
 - It was like a very, very, very crude

782
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,000
 model robo hermit that they had in there.

783
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,840
 - With that thing.

784
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,640
 - Here's another famous gardener.

785
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,920
 So this is a king called hermiti

786
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,480
 who was in ancient Sumer

787
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,280
 and what would happen in ancient Sumer

788
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,680
 is you would get people who would tell the future

789
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,440
 and if they saw a bad omen,

790
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,400
 like maybe the king's gonna die,

791
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
 you would put someone else on the throne,

792
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,160
 400 days and then you take over again.

793
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,040
 So this guy, hermiti, decided to put his gardener

794
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,920
 on the throne for 100 days 'cause there'd been a bad omen

795
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,640
 and then he died after eating some hot porridge

796
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,320
 and his gardener then reigned ancient Sumer

797
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,640
 for 24 years.

798
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,200
 (laughing)

799
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 - Just 'cause he didn't blow on it.

800
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,480
 - I guess so.

801
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,640
 - Oh, the porridge.

802
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,480
 - Yeah.

803
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,720
 - That's incredible.

804
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,760
 - I know.

805
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,640
 - I guess wasn't a successor in place

806
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,840
 who would not have taken over the throne.

807
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,720
 - Well, he's the king now, right?

808
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,560
 - Yeah, you're right.

809
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,920
 - So what are you gonna do?

810
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,240
 - That's so funny.

811
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,400
 (laughing)

812
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,000
 (upbeat music)

813
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,160
 (upbeat music)

814
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,600
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

815
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,840
 and that is Andy.

816
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,880
 - My fact is, in 1920, the King of Greece died

817
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,640
 after trying to break up a fight between a dog and a monkey.

818
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
 (laughing)

819
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,800
 This is the only royal death I've found

820
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,920
 which involved a monkey at all, actually.

821
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,760
 - Mm-hmm.

822
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,040
 - Little end of the fight between a dog and a monkey.

823
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,880
 - Okay.

824
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
 - This was King Alexander of Greece

825
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,720
 and he had a dog, he had a German shepherd

826
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,760
 and one day he was having a walk in there.

827
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,760
 I think the palace grounds and I think a Barbary ape.

828
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,880
 - Quite an aggressive, yeah, not a titler of a monkey.

829
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
 - Oh, no, no, this isn't like Bubbles.

830
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,560
 - No, no, no, no, this is proper.

831
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,400
 - They're very naughty Barbary apes, I can say.

832
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,240
 They all know.

833
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,520
 - Yeah, it's naughty.

834
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,000
 (laughing)

835
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,240
 - They'll kill your dog.

836
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,400
 (laughing)

837
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,040
 - Slotering your dog in front, yeah.

838
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,880
 - All you King.

839
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,360
 - They have the man to brawl to them, yes.

840
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,800
 And I went up there with a pusher

841
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,480
 with my daughter who is very young

842
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,840
 and basically, they will just steal everything.

843
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,200
 Everything that's not held down, they'll steal it.

844
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
 - You got it back though.

845
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,480
 - No, she still lives there.

846
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,560
 (laughing)

847
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,720
 - She is the ape queen now.

848
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,920
 (laughing)

849
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,280
 - That's why I bow to for Brexit.

850
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,880
 I don't want it to be Spanish.

851
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,160
 (laughing)

852
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,880
 - Yeah, so anyway, this ape and this dog were in a fight.

853
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,920
 He was trying to separate them,

854
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,800
 at which point the apes wife turned up

855
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,680
 and sunk fangs into King Alexander's leg.

856
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,000
 - Oh no.

857
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,720
 - And I think some days later, he died, he'd become ill

858
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,400
 and they had swithered over what to do, the doctors and so.

859
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,920
 - So he died and this produced huge geopolitical consequences

860
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,120
 with Churchill later wrote,

861
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,880
 it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark

862
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,160
 that a quarter of a million persons died

863
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,320
 of this monkey's bite.

864
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,160
 - Really?

865
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
 - Yeah.

866
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,840
 - Wow.

867
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
 - Because they've spent the Greek Civil War.

868
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,560
 - Well, it all led to a lot of unhappiness and conflict

869
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,920
 inside Greece.

870
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,640
 They got back the previous King.

871
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,440
 Because what had happened to the previous King was very pro German

872
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,440
 and his son was pro German, his eldest son.

873
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,160
 And so Britain and Russia and probably France

874
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,560
 got rid of those guys and brought in this guy

875
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,200
 who wasn't expecting to be King.

876
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,880
 Like he was just thought he was gonna spend his days gardening

877
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,200
 off just having a lot of fun.

878
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
 - Having a lovely life.

879
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
 - Yeah, and then suddenly he's King.

880
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
 And then, you know, okay, well now we've got our puppet

881
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,120
 who's in charge, but then he dies

882
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
 and then they bring the old people back

883
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
 and it all goes to shit.

884
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,800
 - That's basically what happened, yeah.

885
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,640
 And then he fought this war against the Turks

886
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,920
 which went disastrously wrong, hundreds of thousands of deaths.

887
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,280
 The royalists were kicked out.

888
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,480
 And then the European Great Powers just started picking

889
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,960
 the Greek royal family.

890
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,640
 And then eventually things got a bit more democratic.

891
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,160
 And the Greeks in 1862 had this vote for a new King,

892
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,600
 a kind of national referendum.

893
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,680
 And they almost universally, they chose Prince Alfred of England

894
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,440
 who I believe was one of Victoria's sons.

895
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,280
 - Yes.

896
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,720
 - He won 95% of the vote's cast.

897
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,360
 He said no, no thank you, I don't want to do it.

898
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,560
 - You used the throne of Greece.

899
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,760
 - Yeah, but imagine he probably had a nice house

900
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,600
 somewhere, wouldn't he?

901
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,360
 - I'm sure he's already got a nice, you're right.

902
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,200
 - You're right, yeah, that nice.

903
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,040
 - Well yeah, was that?

904
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,440
 - That was 1862.

905
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,200
 - So this is not happening in the 1860s, wasn't it?

906
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,040
 - Oh, going on.

907
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
 - Bucket.

908
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,360
 - Was that unification of Germany around then?

909
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,200
 - Yes.

910
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,040
 - And then formation of Italy.

911
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,880
 - Yes.

912
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
 - Also my house was built.

913
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,080
 - Really?

914
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,440
 - So some major events.

915
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
 - Major, major things too.

916
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,840
 - So your garden, that was laid out and was created.

917
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,680
 - Yeah.

918
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,520
 - By Prince Alfred.

919
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,880
 - And actually around the corner from me.

920
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,440
 And Napoleon III came to live.

921
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,280
 - Is that so?

922
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,120
 - No, really.

923
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,280
 - Wow, so there you go.

924
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,480
 - So we've asked to take a huge decade.

925
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,320
 - A huge decade.

926
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,160
 - A huge decade.

927
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,960
 But basically Alfred was pressured into saying no

928
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,720
 'cause Britain, France, and Russia had all to creed.

929
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,240
 Nobody's going to accept this throne.

930
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,040
 - Nobody wants it, get over it.

931
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,760
 - And every candidate said no until they got to Prince

932
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,640
 Wilhelm of Denmark of the Blocksburg House

933
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
 and he had received six votes

934
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,440
 from the entire population of Greece.

935
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,320
 And he was then chosen to be the king.

936
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,160
 - That is unfortunate.

937
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,000
 - I know.

938
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,520
 - I think he was 18th highest voted person in that list.

939
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
 - He came 18th.

940
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,360
 - Yeah.

941
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
 - But various people had just written a Russian king, please.

942
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,280
 Or whatever.

943
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

944
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
 - They just selected, like they just listed it.

945
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,200
 So he came almost dead last.

946
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,400
 And yet he then was king for 50 years.

947
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,480
 - King, like king face was there.

948
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,680
 - Who they really wanted.

949
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,520
 - Yeah.

950
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,120
 - And then he lasted until 1913, he lasted 50 years.

951
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,960
 - Yeah.

952
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,800
 - 1930.

953
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,640
 - 1913.

954
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,360
 - He was assassinated by either a socialist or a lunatic.

955
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,000
 And it's not clear which apparently.

956
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,080
 - Not necessarily.

957
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,880
 - Not to get political.

958
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,320
 (laughing)

959
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,520
 - Lots of assassinations happening around that sort of area

960
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,040
 whether that time.

961
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,880
 - Yes.

962
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,720
 - They loved it.

963
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,760
 - A vexed, vexed period.

964
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,560
 - A vexed period in the south-east of Europe.

965
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,400
 - Yeah.

966
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,480
 - I found another monkey bite death.

967
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,320
 - Oh.

968
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,160
 - Did you?

969
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
 - Didn't expect to find one.

970
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,360
 But I tried hard and I got there.

971
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,760
 - Do you know the character Grizzly Adams?

972
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,600
 - Grizzly Adams.

973
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,440
 - So barely.

974
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,280
 - He was making a bet.

975
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,120
 - No, no.

976
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,960
 (laughing)

977
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,360
 - So Grizzly Adams in America,

978
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,360
 I think he's quite a well-known historical character.

979
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,880
 So he was a Californian mountain man.

980
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,960
 He was a trainer of Grizzly bears.

981
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,920
 And he used to just do acts,

982
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,040
 you know, kind of like a Petey Barnum kind of thing.

983
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,480
 - So he made pets with quite a few of these bears

984
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,400
 that he thought were friendly.

985
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,240
 - I can't see this going.

986
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,080
 - Yeah.

987
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,920
 - Can't see where this is gonna go.

988
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
 - And he was killed by a monkey.

989
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,400
 - That's like, yeah.

990
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,240
 - Oh yeah.

991
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,640
 So, okay.

992
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
 Don't take your eyes off the threat of the monkeys.

993
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,480
 - Yeah.

994
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

995
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,680
 - So he got attacked by Grizzly in Sierra Nevada.

996
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,240
 - Oh, but the monkey was one who set the Grizzly on him.

997
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,160
 - No, the monkey comes in later.

998
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,600
 So his scalp was dislodged in this attack,

999
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,760
 and it left a silver dollar size impression in his skull,

1000
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,320
 just above his forehead.

1001
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,920
 Then he had all these other Grizzlies

1002
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,240
 that he made friends with.

1003
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,840
 Anyway, he was re-induced several times in the head

1004
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,200
 and it opened up the wound,

1005
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,120
 which meant bits of brain tissue where it's exposed.

1006
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,360
 And then, as he's still going with the bears, stick.

1007
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,000
 - He's still going with the bear's stick.

1008
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,840
 - Okay.

1009
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,120
 - And then Grizzly out of this on tour with a circus,

1010
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,760
 when a monkey that he was trying to train jumped up

1011
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,600
 and beat him in the brain.

1012
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,840
 - Oh god.

1013
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,800
 - Not in the head in the brain.

1014
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
 - Well, you don't have any nerves in your brain,

1015
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
 so you wouldn't even feel it.

1016
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,280
 - Yep.

1017
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,120
 - So anyway.

1018
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,160
 - You know, it was happening, I think.

1019
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,880
 - Maybe came from behind.

1020
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,120
 - It was possible.

1021
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,600
 - And so he died, October 25th, 1860.

1022
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,440
 - It was in Grizzly, that.

1023
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
 - 1860.

1024
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,280
 - 1860.

1025
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,400
 - It was another big thing.

1026
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,560
 - It was another big thing.

1027
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,640
 - How extraordinary does it?

1028
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,800
 - If you hadn't said it was a monkey,

1029
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,160
 I wouldn't have seen that coming at all.

1030
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,000
 - Yeah, I know, right.

1031
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,240
 It's a real plot twist at the end there.

1032
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,080
 - It really is.

1033
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,160
 - Wow, horrifying end.

1034
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,000
 Here's some people.

1035
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,320
 William III of England, Alexander III of Scotland,

1036
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,000
 Prince Alfonso Portugal, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony,

1037
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,200
 Duke Geoffrey of Brittany is a beller of arrogant,

1038
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,600
 Leopold VIII of Austria,

1039
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,040
 Louis IV of France, William the Conqueror,

1040
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,680
 they all died the same way.

1041
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,520
 - Monkeys.

1042
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,360
 - Not monkeys.

1043
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,200
 - Yeah.

1044
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,520
 (laughing)

1045
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,680
 - At what point do we start suspecting the monkeys?

1046
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
 - A raptor of the day.

1047
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,360
 - This is something that does away with lots of royalties.

1048
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,280
 - And it's very guessable.

1049
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,680
 - Oh, is it gouged or something?

1050
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,120
 - Yeah, gouged, but that's a bit of a hog.

1051
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,320
 - Yeah, is it sort of explosion or some sort of...

1052
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,160
 - Oh, 'cause William the Conqueror did explode,

1053
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,640
 but that was out of your stuff.

1054
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,840
 - He got brother a beast, I think, didn't he?

1055
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,920
 - Right.

1056
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,680
 They couldn't bury him straight away.

1057
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,360
 And so when the monks came to bury him in his concrete tomb,

1058
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,080
 they sort of shoved him in it.

1059
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,720
 And then he exploded.

1060
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,560
 (laughing)

1061
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,400
 - Wow, and in the conqueror.

1062
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
 - I'm pretty sure, yeah.

1063
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,080
 - William the Conqueror, yeah.

1064
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,240
 He definitely exploded in the...

1065
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,080
 - Conqueror.

1066
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,560
 - Oh, it wouldn't be Conqueror's stone, sorry.

1067
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,400
 - Oh, yeah, okay.

1068
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,120
 - That's a bit of the story you wanted to pick up on.

1069
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,960
 - The Romans had Conqueror Avenue.

1070
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,080
 - I know the Romans had Conqueror,

1071
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,400
 but I wasn't aware that...

1072
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
 - Yeah, it was a brutalist.

1073
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,960
 - It wasn't a brutalist coffin.

1074
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,040
 - I just want to go with something really simple.

1075
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,280
 (laughing)

1076
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,000
 - Anyway, the answer is falling off a horse.

1077
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,640
 - Oh!

1078
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,800
 - That is a big old way that people died in the past.

1079
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
 - Yes.

1080
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,840
 - Alexander III probably was riding along a high,

1081
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,120
 treacherous coastal path, having drank a lot of Bodo wine.

1082
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,960
 - Good thing.

1083
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,920
 - And just went straight off it.

1084
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,760
 - Right.

1085
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,240
 - What fell off the hill?

1086
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,000
 - It just jumped straight off it, yeah.

1087
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,520
 You would think the horse would stop,

1088
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,400
 but the problem is that quite often when these people die,

1089
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,280
 there's a big sort of something happens afterwards,

1090
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,240
 like happened with this Greek guy.

1091
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,720
 So when Alexander III died,

1092
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,640
 that started the first war of Scottish independence,

1093
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
 essentially.

1094
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,480
 - Right.

1095
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,280
 - So you know, it's quite a big deal when these kings die,

1096
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,920
 even though they're just people.

1097
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,080
 - At what point is anyone suggesting a helmet

1098
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,680
 for horse riding?

1099
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,520
 - Oh.

1100
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,360
 - I just...

1101
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,320
 - You don't see that, I mean, apart from knights,

1102
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,360
 you don't see people with like cycle helmets

1103
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,200
 in the past, do you?

1104
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,480
 - Yeah, but knights do have protection.

1105
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,200
 You just think that I get how many regal deaths

1106
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,880
 do they have to have before they say,

1107
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,560
 I think we should say, if you're the king or queen,

1108
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,320
 you have to wear a helmet on your horse.

1109
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,160
 - Yeah.

1110
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,360
 - Well, how about seat belts?

1111
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,200
 - Horse seat belts?

1112
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,040
 - Yeah.

1113
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,880
 - Horse belts.

1114
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,800
 - Is that safer?

1115
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,920
 - You're not gonna fall if you're really tied tight.

1116
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,240
 - If your horse falls over though,

1117
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,760
 and your seat belt is on.

1118
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,840
 - I just wonder if there's a five reggae to come along.

1119
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,680
 (laughing)

1120
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,600
 - I feel like there might be a reason

1121
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,160
 why the horse seat belt hasn't been invented.

1122
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,320
 - Or maybe a styrups is effectively the horse seat belt

1123
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,560
 'cause it really helps you hold yourself in place

1124
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,000
 when you're in the styrups.

1125
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,080
 - Look at you, you've been riding the horse recently.

1126
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,400
 - I've ridden one half reggae.

1127
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,240
 - Didn't you?

1128
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
 (laughing)

1129
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,600
 - You're wearing it as Mr. equestrian.

1130
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,440
 - All I'm gonna say is that go off any cleft.

1131
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,720
 So, you know, despite how much borderline you are.

1132
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,960
 (laughing)

1133
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,000
 - Yeah, that's true, isn't it?

1134
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,040
 How do people move this is a very graphic question,

1135
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,440
 but how do people die when they fall off a horse?

1136
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
 Do they get trampled in the legs?

1137
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,920
 - I think it's bang on the head.

1138
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
 - Bang on the head.

1139
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,640
 - 'Cause actually, you're quite,

1140
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,800
 as someone who's ridden a horse, I would say.

1141
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,480
 - Well, you would know, that's why I asked.

1142
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
 (laughing)

1143
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,120
 - You're quite high up.

1144
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,280
 - Oh, yeah.

1145
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,240
 - Like, and they do, like, my horse,

1146
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,360
 at once they saw a lady horse.

1147
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
 - Oh no.

1148
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,280
 - And so I started galloping towards them.

1149
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,120
 - Oh no.

1150
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,960
 (laughing)

1151
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,160
 - And I almost shitted my angle.

1152
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,200
 (laughing)

1153
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,800
 - One advantage for a horse ride,

1154
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,760
 if it mounted the feet on the horse,

1155
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,560
 and you just have to sit there,

1156
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,040
 like a horse that you, (laughing)

1157
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,920
 - That's amazing, you're riding two horses at once.

1158
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,760
 (laughing)

1159
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
 - You're out of it.

1160
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,880
 (laughing)

1161
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,460
 (upbeat music)

1162
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,040
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1163
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,600
 and that is James.

1164
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one of the most

1165
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,240
 popular celebrity tailors of the 1950s was,

1166
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
 ironically called Newdy.

1167
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,800
 (laughing)

1168
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
 - This guy's a character.

1169
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,120
 - I reckon quite a few people might have heard of him,

1170
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,440
 but I'd never heard of him before.

1171
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,640
 He was the first person to spot rhinestones on clothing.

1172
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
 (laughing)

1173
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,040
 So if you've ever seen one of those rhinestone cowboy suits

1174
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,200
 that they wore in America in the,

1175
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,840
 what, this 50, 60, 70s, he will have made it.

1176
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,600
 So he made suits for L this.

1177
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
 He made them for--

1178
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
 - How in Titchmarsh?

1179
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
 (laughing)

1180
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,520
 - Elton John, who he mentioned before,

1181
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,760
 Hike Williams, John Lennon.

1182
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,160
 This is the who's who of pop music.

1183
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,000
 - It's everybody, yeah.

1184
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,840
 - Stackers.

1185
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,200
 - Liver archie, I imagine.

1186
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,040
 - Oh, yeah.

1187
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,880
 - They never too much sure.

1188
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,720
 - It was sort of everyone.

1189
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
 In fact, I was thinking, 'cause I, you know,

1190
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
 the term rhinestone cowboy.

1191
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,160
 - Glen Campbell.

1192
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,000
 - Glen Campbell.

1193
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,800
 That was originally written by a man called Larry Weiss,

1194
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,200
 and it was, it was in tribute to Newdy.

1195
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,040
 - Really?

1196
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,960
 - Yeah, because that was a thing that all of these

1197
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,640
 country music stars kept asking for.

1198
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,760
 They were like, Newdy, more rhinestone.

1199
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,800
 - More rhinestone, when they were asking for those suits

1200
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,840
 to be tailored.

1201
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,720
 So that song was put in more of a sentence though.

1202
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,360
 They just went, "More rhinestone."

1203
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,560
 "More rhinestone."

1204
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,640
 - Oh, these sounds, you know, they're like,

1205
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,200
 "You're not a rhinestone, Newdy."

1206
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,040
 (laughing)

1207
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,640
 - That was, it was a guy called Lefty Frizzle,

1208
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,480
 who was more rhinestone.

1209
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,040
 But a few more rhinestone, Newdy, put more rhinestone.

1210
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,720
 - Rhinestones are stones from the Rhine, by the way,

1211
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
 just in case you didn't know what a rhinestone was.

1212
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,720
 - I never knew what a rhinestone would be about this,

1213
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
 so that is now just a piece of colored glass,

1214
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,360
 basically, but they were kind of proper rock crystals.

1215
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,840
 - Apparently, you just get these little

1216
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,120
 colorful pebbles on the banks of the Rhine,

1217
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,680
 and people used to put them on stuff as decoration.

1218
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,200
 - Yeah, at these days, you melt them onto clothes with heat.

1219
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,040
 - Do you?

1220
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,120
 - So you have a little, you have a little glue layer,

1221
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,960
 and then you just heat them up and you just shove them on.

1222
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,960
 - But yeah, Newdy, he was born Newter Cup Clear Encore

1223
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,760
 in Kiev in 1902, and he moved to America,

1224
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,240
 but he was really into his tailoring,

1225
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,200
 and then when he was processed,

1226
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
 supposedly according to the story,

1227
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
 when he was processed through Ellis Island,

1228
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,840
 they changed his name to Newdy,

1229
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,280
 which I'm not sure how often that actually happened,

1230
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,800
 and usually it was people just changing their name

1231
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,840
 to sell more American themselves.

1232
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1233
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,880
 - And then he came to America, opened an underwear shop,

1234
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,320
 selling G-strings and pasties to strippers.

1235
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,480
 - Very broad range of West Cornwall, wasn't it?

1236
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,840
 (laughing)

1237
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
 - But they're called pasties.

1238
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 - They are called pasties.

1239
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
 - They're called your nipples?

1240
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,680
 - They are called pasties.

1241
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,000
 - Okay, I just thought, okay, he's going to get hungry,

1242
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,040
 and they're quite handy,

1243
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
 because that whole meal running through them.

1244
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,560
 - If you get one hand on the pole,

1245
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,080
 and then he's hold onto the cross.

1246
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,840
 - I think the strippers in Bolton do put pasties

1247
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,040
 on their nipples, but...

1248
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,960
 (laughing)

1249
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,280
 - So they're all the more popular for it,

1250
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,480
 as well as people love pasties.

1251
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,320
 They love pasties.

1252
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,160
 - Yeah.

1253
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,240
 - And he then had surgery when he was in his forties

1254
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,400
 and lost all of his money,

1255
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,120
 'cause he had to pay for the surgery in America.

1256
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,960
 And then he thought, what am I going to do?

1257
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,440
 I'm going to make suits for celebrities.

1258
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,760
 And he got in touch with a guy called Text Williams.

1259
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,960
 Text Williams auctioned off his horse

1260
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,720
 and used the money to buy New Deal sewing machine,

1261
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,240
 and they went into business together.

1262
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,880
 - Well, you wouldn't have gone on with text.

1263
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,720
 - Yeah.

1264
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,560
 - Why?

1265
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
 - You both love horses.

1266
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,560
 (laughing)

1267
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,160
 - I could have started coming in and Rady's done so many times.

1268
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,960
 (laughing)

1269
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,560
 - But yeah, I'd never heard this guy,

1270
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,040
 and he was pretty big deal.

1271
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,880
 - Quite the guy.

1272
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,360
 - Yeah, that early stage when he was selling the pasties

1273
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,600
 to strippers, he sold also Taylor Mae's G Strings.

1274
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,480
 - You don't, you don't, you don't them to not fit.

1275
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,000
 (laughing)

1276
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,840
 - You're right.

1277
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,280
 - If you got round your knees.

1278
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,280
 (laughing)

1279
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,680
 - Oh, was that happened again?

1280
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,320
 I was just eating a pastie.

1281
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,480
 (laughing)

1282
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,320
 - Oh dear.

1283
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,920
 - And the name New Deal became sort of synonymous

1284
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,440
 with these amazing suits,

1285
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,720
 and actually the New Deal name is still alive,

1286
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,080
 thanks to his granddaughter.

1287
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,480
 Jamie Newdy, who seems to have taken his first name

1288
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,720
 as her surname, no, not quite sure how.

1289
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,560
 (laughing)

1290
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,360
 And so now they do still exist,

1291
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,720
 but they mostly make t-shirts and coffee mugs

1292
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,040
 with the name Newdy on it.

1293
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,480
 They don't really make so many clothes anymore.

1294
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,920
 - His cars were absolutely bananas.

1295
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
 And I only say this because I've seen one of them,

1296
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
 I think in the flesh.

1297
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,760
 - No.

1298
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,480
 - In the Nashville Country Music Hall of Fame.

1299
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,320
 - Oh wow.

1300
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,760
 - And it's, I didn't know you'd been there.

1301
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,560
 - I mean, just 15 years ago.

1302
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
 - I thought I'd heard every one of your anecdotes.

1303
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,080
 - No, no, no, no.

1304
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,160
 - Why do you keep telling us the same three then?

1305
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,920
 (laughing)

1306
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,400
 - I feel like we're getting distracted

1307
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,440
 from my fourth anecdotes.

1308
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,120
 (laughing)

1309
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,680
 - All these facts, anyway.

1310
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,320
 - Yeah, go on, thank you so much, that way.

1311
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,200
 - It's an insane car.

1312
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,960
 It's got 18 pistols distributed around it.

1313
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,440
 It kind of built into the doors

1314
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,960
 and things like that, all the inside.

1315
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,240
 It's got $1,200 silver dollars glued on

1316
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,720
 the various points all over it.

1317
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,280
 My memory might be tricking me.

1318
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,520
 I feel like it's got a bison's horns on the front.

1319
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,360
 - Oh wow.

1320
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,320
 - Where you'd have the Mercedes sign or whatever.

1321
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,240
 It's got one of those.

1322
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,400
 I mean, it's an absolutely loopy.

1323
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,680
 - Well, you would plug in your electric vehicle.

1324
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,520
 - That's right.

1325
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1326
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,680
 (laughing)

1327
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,480
 - Yeah, he was very obsessed with fashion

1328
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,920
 as a lot of celebrities are.

1329
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,320
 Tom, you are one of the best-addressed comedians.

1330
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,960
 - Well, that's very generous to say fashion.

1331
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,880
 I've always liked zooting and tailoring.

1332
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,760
 I don't know, I think it makes me feel a certain way.

1333
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,920
 Sort of stand in a certain way.

1334
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,760
 I guess that's part of what tailoring has always done for people.

1335
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,240
 But yes, I do like to wear a suit.

1336
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,360
 - Yeah, I used to wear ties a lot.

1337
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,480
 And I've stopped in recent years

1338
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,960
 and I feel less good as a human as a result.

1339
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,320
 So I think I might get back into it.

1340
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,800
 - Well, they're a flash of color, really, I suppose.

1341
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,840
 Or a bit of variation in the...

1342
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,200
 - Well, you always wore a black one then you don't.

1343
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
 - Just black.

1344
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,040
 - Yeah.

1345
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,880
 - With a white shirt.

1346
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,280
 - Yeah, so I remember those days.

1347
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,120
 - Yes.

1348
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,360
 - The Mormon was here.

1349
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,280
 (laughing)

1350
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
 - It saves time, doesn't it?

1351
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,120
 - Yeah.

1352
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,120
 - So you don't have to change your clothes

1353
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,960
 at the end of the gig.

1354
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,120
 You can just get out and fly all the way out.

1355
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,640
 - Pop the old badge on.

1356
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,920
 (laughing)

1357
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,960
 - I don't know those books.

1358
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,560
 - I do, whoa, what's interesting is I read a study recently.

1359
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,440
 Is apparently when you wear a tie,

1360
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,120
 it stops your blood flow by 7.5%.

1361
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,960
 - Really?

1362
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,360
 - Well, that gets me high, so I like that.

1363
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,200
 That's what I'm missing.

1364
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,680
 - That's not an idea.

1365
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,200
 - To your brain?

1366
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,040
 - Yeah.

1367
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,360
 - So you've been operating with constrictor blood flow

1368
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,760
 to your brain for some years?

1369
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,720
 - They did MRI scans on 15 men who were wearing ties

1370
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
 and 15 men who weren't.

1371
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,560
 - I'm actually going with the MRI machine.

1372
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,880
 (laughing)

1373
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,720
 - Very smart clothes.

1374
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,880
 - Should I pop my umbrella in but I haven't?

1375
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,640
 (laughing)

1376
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,920
 - Yeah, and that's what they concluded.

1377
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,440
 So it is letting less, and it will give you headaches

1378
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,560
 and dizziness and nausea if you wear a tie more.

1379
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,400
 - Wow.

1380
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,560
 - Then it won't do me, right?

1381
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,400
 - Yeah.

1382
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,880
 - I find now it's evolved into the work where if men

1383
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,240
 going to work is rather than suits,

1384
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,560
 it is some skinny chinos, a quarter-zip jumper

1385
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,520
 with a shirt underneath open neck and then a lanyard

1386
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,680
 instead of a tie.

1387
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,520
 - I love it.

1388
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,640
 - So people don't wear a tie because they're lanyards.

1389
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,280
 Which I think will evolve maybe one day into something else

1390
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,480
 or we've all become quite utilitarian, I think,

1391
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
 in our clothing.

1392
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,080
 I think we all become quite practical.

1393
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,720
 I think for a long time there was an air of

1394
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,040
 Camboyance special of men's clothing, which isn't afforded

1395
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,280
 so much now, I think if you went out, even me wearing a tie,

1396
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,840
 people were like, "Oh, all right, all right."

1397
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,520
 Well, I don't know if you're having a wedding today.

1398
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,400
 - You know, I'm literally just wearing the same things

1399
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,240
 like my dad might have worn.

1400
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,160
 You know, but they can't seem like, yeah.

1401
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,000
 - Oh.

1402
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,200
 - I was thinking to tight clothes or snug clothes

1403
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,600
 and clothing innovations, because it's really fun.

1404
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,440
 If you look in someone like new scientist

1405
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,960
 for all the clothing inventions, it's all like,

1406
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,560
 this is the clothing of tomorrow.

1407
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,200
 And so in 2007, Philips, the electronics people,

1408
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,440
 they invented auto snug clothing, right?

1409
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,120
 Which is where it's a clothes with muscle wires woven

1410
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,120
 through the fabric.

1411
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,160
 You pick it up to the power and it adjusts

1412
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,120
 until your trousers are the exact right size for you.

1413
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,960
 - That's good.

1414
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,440
 - And then you know exactly what trousers you need

1415
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,600
 from now on.

1416
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,440
 - Yeah, I think that's great.

1417
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,280
 - I think that's useful.

1418
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,760
 I can imagine it going wrong, well.

1419
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,160
 - Oh, absolutely, yeah.

1420
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,160
 Like hundreds of people were electrocuted very bad.

1421
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,200
 It's very badly scorched during this.

1422
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,040
 But it's also, we have a tape measure.

1423
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,320
 We have the technology to find out

1424
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,040
 what size trousers someone needs.

1425
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,120
 - It's not like until 2007 people were like,

1426
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,360
 "Didn't I have like trousers in the size of my house?"

1427
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,440
 (all laughing)

1428
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,520
 - The other thing is it's different in different countries,

1429
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,360
 right? - Yeah.

1430
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,640
 - So I bought a pair of large underpants in America

1431
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,840
 and a pair in Japan and I could tell you,

1432
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,160
 one of those way too big for me and the other one,

1433
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,640
 I can't even squeeze them too.

1434
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,360
 - This is why James has his G-string's tailor.

1435
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,640
 (all laughing)

1436
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,400
 - Speaking of putting metal inside clothes,

1437
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,040
 that's what Lame is, I didn't know this.

1438
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,040
 So Newdy in 1957 made Elvis Presley a $10,000 gold Lame suit.

1439
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,880
 And Lame is where you get your fabric,

1440
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,560
 but then you put metallic fibers into it.

1441
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,400
 - Oh.

1442
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,880
 - I didn't know what that was.

1443
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,840
 - Where else is Lame used in the sporting world?

1444
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,760
 - So gold being woven through.

1445
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,560
 - Or any metal woven through fabric.

1446
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,120
 - Not horse-raining.

1447
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,560
 - Aerodynamics, stuff.

1448
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,400
 - Nope.

1449
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,760
 - I've got a wild theory.

1450
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,600
 - Go on.

1451
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,600
 - Is it tennis rackets?

1452
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,280
 - I thought you were gonna get it, but no.

1453
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
 (all laughing)

1454
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,120
 For me the one?

1455
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,120
 - No, it's not that, it's used in fencing.

1456
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,240
 - Oh, of course.

1457
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,640
 - Because you need to, when someone stabs you with the sword,

1458
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,120
 they need to connect it.

1459
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,960
 And so it's the threads inside.

1460
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,480
 So all fences use Lame suits in the same way that Elvis did.

1461
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,160
 - That suit of Elvis is amazing.

1462
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,560
 - Did you see that in your,

1463
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,400
 - Yes, I was gonna see.

1464
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,440
 - I don't remember if I saw it because they've,

1465
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,380
 they've got a pair of the blue suede shoes.

1466
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,040
 You know, they've got a load of costumes and outfits.

1467
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,920
 But that is, if you're listening to this

1468
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,440
 and you wanna know what that gold Lame suit is,

1469
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
 it's on the front cover of an album,

1470
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,320
 which gets referred to as 50 million Elvis fans

1471
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,480
 can't be wrong, which is a very, very funny album title.

1472
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,320
 - Right.

1473
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,640
 - And it's this mad gold suit.

1474
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,480
 - Cool.

1475
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,320
 - It's very loose.

1476
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,960
 It doesn't fit him at all well by a modern standard.

1477
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,640
 - But it's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1478
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,000
 I think I might, I can't remember if I saw it there.

1479
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,080
 - You know, if there was a lightning storm, wouldn't it?

1480
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,920
 - Oh, yeah.

1481
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,040
 - It would have been absolutely, absolutely.

1482
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,880
 - Absolutely.

1483
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,720
 - At the road.

1484
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,480
 - Found a comedy play from the 1805 called The Taylors,

1485
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,400
 which was shown at Covent Garden.

1486
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,600
 And it was kind of taken a piss out of young dandies

1487
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,040
 at the time.

1488
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,480
 And they were so annoyed with it that they all turned up

1489
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,120
 and started booing the actors and stuff.

1490
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,880
 And not only that, they decided to throw,

1491
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,760
 not rot 'em tomatoes, but scissors and cutting shears.

1492
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,080
 - Cool.

1493
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,320
 - At the actors throughout their opening night.

1494
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,160
 - Oh my God.

1495
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,480
 - Well, what is it?

1496
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,200
 - Grizzly Adams is on the stage too.

1497
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,360
 (laughing)

1498
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,480
 He has a terrible night.

1499
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,400
 (laughing)

1500
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,240
 - Isn't that mad?

1501
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,080
 - That's crazy.

1502
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,760
 - Yeah, that is, but how interesting to think of,

1503
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,680
 a group of people who want to associate with sort of

1504
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,800
 foppishness and not being particularly agitated.

1505
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,400
 - Yeah, but young dandies is like, you know,

1506
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,680
 muds, rockers, that kind of--

1507
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
 - Yeah, but isn't it?

1508
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,600
 Yeah, I know it's an obvious thing to say,

1509
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,880
 but one realises that the things we see today

1510
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,280
 have all happened before.

1511
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,120
 - Yeah.

1512
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,520
 - The kind of protests, all those kind of groups

1513
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,480
 people being, you know, people being outrageous,

1514
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,720
 you know, dress sense as a protest or as an expression.

1515
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1516
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,400
 - It's interesting.

1517
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,640
 - I've got a riddle for you guys.

1518
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,480
 - Oh, give it.

1519
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,320
 - Okay.

1520
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,800
 - Carol Spencer was a fashion designer.

1521
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,600
 She's spent 30 years working for the same client

1522
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,560
 designing clothes, but her clothes have never been worn

1523
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,760
 by a human.

1524
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,600
 (laughing)

1525
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,440
 - Riddle means.

1526
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,520
 (laughing)

1527
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,680
 - It's like a lacy.

1528
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,320
 - Well, it's something, it wasn't a lacy.

1529
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,160
 - So it's nice.

1530
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,360
 - A horse saddle.

1531
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,840
 - It wasn't a horse related.

1532
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,040
 - James would have got it a bit like.

1533
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,880
 - James did it like.

1534
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,200
 (laughing)

1535
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,440
 - I think I've got it.

1536
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,360
 - God, I know my hit rate with the tennis racket.

1537
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,200
 - Yeah.

1538
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,040
 - Back and that up.

1539
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,640
 I think it's a living Madame Tussaud's wax work

1540
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,840
 and with the fashion changing of the first.

1541
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,680
 - Like the sauna.

1542
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,520
 - Yeah, exactly.

1543
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,440
 - It's so fashion all the time.

1544
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
 - They keep the wax work, but they don't.

1545
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,880
 - And they change that.

1546
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,520
 - You're so close.

1547
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,360
 - Oh.

1548
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,200
 - You're so close.

1549
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,720
 It's a model of a person, but it's not Madame Tussaud.

1550
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,200
 - Oh, is it not the, is it Lenin who's kept in the cabinet?

1551
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,040
 - It's not.

1552
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,320
 (laughing)

1553
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,160
 - Lenin's fashion.

1554
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,000
 - Lenin, yeah.

1555
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,240
 (laughing)

1556
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,680
 - Mr. February Revolution, it's Lenin again.

1557
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,680
 (laughing)

1558
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,560
 - The fashion show, where they're all kneeled out.

1559
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,360
 - Sherman Louse, summer, look.

1560
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,640
 (laughing)

1561
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,360
 - Isn't the mannequin piece?

1562
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,960
 - It's not the mannequin piece.

1563
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,080
 - Right, shall I tell you all?

1564
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,680
 - Oh, I feel like we are close.

1565
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,680
 - I'll tell you this one more clue.

1566
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,720
 - Okay. - A client was only 11 1/2 inches high.

1567
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,120
 - Oh.

1568
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,960
 - She's fashionable.

1569
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,200
 She's got a lot of outfit changed.

1570
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,040
 - Bobby.

1571
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,880
 - It's Bobby.

1572
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,720
 - Oh.

1573
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,560
 - Oh.

1574
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,400
 - Oh.

1575
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,240
 - I don't even get there.

1576
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,080
 - I'm sorry.

1577
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,320
 - You're probably itching to tell us.

1578
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,160
 - No, no, no, no.

1579
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,680
 - To play the game is a bit longer.

1580
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,440
 (laughing)

1581
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
 - I'm so sorry for truncating in Brutian.

1582
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,600
 - No, no, no, no, no, no.

1583
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,840
 - I'm sure that we've all got homes to go to.

1584
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,080
 - The other people listening were like,

1585
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,440
 "It's obviously Bobby."

1586
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,760
 "Is it Lenin?"

1587
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,360
 (laughing)

1588
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,960
 (upbeat music)

1589
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,320
 - Okay, that's it.

1590
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,400
 That is all of our facts.

1591
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,920
 Thank you so much for listening.

1592
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,640
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1593
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,680
 about the things that we've said

1594
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,960
 over the course of this podcast,

1595
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,720
 we can all be found online.

1596
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,680
 I'm on Instagram, on @Streiberland.

1597
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,520
 James.

1598
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,560
 - Come find me on Tech Talk.

1599
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,920
 No such thing as James Harkin.

1600
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,760
 Andy.

1601
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,400
 - Instagram @AndruHunterRab.

1602
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,320
 - Tom, where could we find you?

1603
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,080
 - My Instagram handle is @TomIndeed.

1604
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,360
 So do feel free to follow me there.

1605
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,960
 Or I have just started a visualized podcast.

1606
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,920
 I don't know if you're familiar with this idea.

1607
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,240
 And that is available from all podcast providers.

1608
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,720
 And also on YouTube @TomAllon is the handle.

1609
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,640
 And it's called "Pottering."

1610
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,520
 And it's about gardening and being in the garden

1611
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,520
 with my friends.

1612
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,360
 - Oh, great.

1613
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,280
 So you're in the garden.

1614
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,440
 You've got your guests sitting there

1615
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,280
 in the distance.

1616
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,240
 We see a carpet just sort of wandering around.

1617
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,520
 - Yes, don't acknowledge him.

1618
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,960
 He's got another six years left.

1619
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,760
 (laughing)

1620
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,320
 - Well, yeah, if you want to get to us as a group,

1621
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,720
 go to podcast@qy.com.

1622
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,200
 You can send us some facts.

1623
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,120
 You can send us some extra things

1624
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,000
 that you want us to know about

1625
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,840
 that we were talking about.

1626
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,040
 Whatever you send Andy goes through these emails.

1627
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,360
 He cherry picks the best of them

1628
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:17,040
 and they make their way to our bonus show called Drop Us A Line.

1629
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,760
 Now this is part of a secret club called Club Fish,

1630
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,160
 which you can find on Patreon.

1631
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,880
 If you go to patreon.com/nosuchthingasafish

1632
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,960
 you can find all the details there.

1633
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,800
 And you can also send us your most interesting facts

1634
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,560
 because we have a bonus show that goes out

1635
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,160
 on this main feed called Little Fish every Monday.

1636
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,680
 And we will be reading out the best of your facts on that show.

1637
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,840
 Otherwise, just come back here.

1638
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,560
 Next week we're gonna be back again

1639
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,280
 with another wonderful guest.

1640
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,400
 We'll see you then.

1641
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,240
 Good bye.

1642
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,820
 (upbeat music)

1643
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,400
 (upbeat music)

1644
00:53:48,400 --> 00:54:18,400
 (upbeat music)
