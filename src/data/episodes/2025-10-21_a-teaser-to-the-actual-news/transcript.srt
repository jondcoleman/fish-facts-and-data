00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,740
 - Hi everyone, James here.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,880
 I am here with some amazing upcoming news.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,040
 In fact, this is like a teaser to the actual news.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,320
 And that is that we have some big changes

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,800
 coming to No Such Things A Fish.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,320
 We are going big time.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,400
 There will be more facts.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,800
 There will be more silliness.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,640
 There will be more of everything you love

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,440
 about No Such Things A Fish,

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,760
 but I'm not gonna tell you everything quite yet

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,800
 because it will all be revealed

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,640
 when we launch this Friday.

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,920
 So this is just to warn you that you might see

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,160
 a few changes on our page over the next couple of days.

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,480
 But the key message really is that everything you get

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,120
 right now is staying exactly the same on Patreon

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,760
 and on Apple, same price, same content.

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,200
 We will be adding some extra things.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
 And of course, what I always say

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,880
 when we make these announcements is true

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,680
 that the main show will always be free

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,840
 to listen for everyone.

25
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,640
 Okay, that's all I have to say.

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,400
 I know it's a bit of a tease.

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,600
 We're really excited about what's coming up.

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
 We can't wait to see what other things about it

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,880
 when she gets back.

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,280
 But yeah, listen out on Friday

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,200
 for all of the information about our new tears,

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,280
 our new perks and all our new stuff coming

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,960
 to the brand new No Such Things A Fish.

34
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,640
 Did I say new enough times?
