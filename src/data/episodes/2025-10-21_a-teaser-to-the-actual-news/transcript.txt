 - Hi everyone, James here.
 I am here with some amazing upcoming news.
 In fact, this is like a teaser to the actual news.
 And that is that we have some big changes
 coming to No Such Things A Fish.
 We are going big time.
 There will be more facts.
 There will be more silliness.
 There will be more of everything you love
 about No Such Things A Fish,
 but I'm not gonna tell you everything quite yet
 because it will all be revealed
 when we launch this Friday.
 So this is just to warn you that you might see
 a few changes on our page over the next couple of days.
 But the key message really is that everything you get
 right now is staying exactly the same on Patreon
 and on Apple, same price, same content.
 We will be adding some extra things.
 And of course, what I always say
 when we make these announcements is true
 that the main show will always be free
 to listen for everyone.
 Okay, that's all I have to say.
 I know it's a bit of a tease.
 We're really excited about what's coming up.
 We can't wait to see what other things about it
 when she gets back.
 But yeah, listen out on Friday
 for all of the information about our new tears,
 our new perks and all our new stuff coming
 to the brand new No Such Things A Fish.
 Did I say new enough times?
