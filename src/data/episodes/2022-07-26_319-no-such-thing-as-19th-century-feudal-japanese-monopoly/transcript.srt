00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, we first of all want to make sure everyone's

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,280
 okay and hope that you're keeping well and keeping sane and you're getting through this

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,960
 lockdown okay. But one thing we quickly wanted to say is that Dan is away still, he'll

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,640
 be back next week, but in his stead we have our good friend and colleague Anne Miller.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,120
 Yeah, that is right, and Miller's here. Not only is Anne Miller a QIL for you all know

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,600
 very well, she's also a published author, which I'm sure you guys might know, and honestly,

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,400
 if you're looking for a book to entertain your children while you're stuck at home with them

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,960
 having to endure whatever it is that children do, do go and look up Anne's book, it's called

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,360
 Mickey and the Animal Spies. I mean, I've actually read it and loved it and I realise I'm 34,

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,040
 but I do think I loved it in the mind of like a nine-year-old. It's about basically a bunch of

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,280
 animals and a ray of animals who go around solving crimes together with the lead character,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,400
 this really adventurous kind of spunky gal called Mickey. It's fab. Yes, and actually the other person

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,680
 who's on this week's show, as well as myself and Anna and Anne, is of course Andrew Hunter Murray,

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
 and of course he has a book as well, which we should mention, and that's for people who's reading

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,800
 ages above the age of nine. So have you read that, Anna? I have indeed. So here I have to slip into my

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,360
 10-year-old self to really get to grips with that. No, that's called The Last Day, and it's brilliant.

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,560
 If what you're looking for to escape this kind of current dystopia is a fictional and much more

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,560
 exciting dystopia, you want to go to The Last Day. The concept is amazing, so the concept is that

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,040
 the world stops spinning and half of it's plunged into darkness, half of it's in light,

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,920
 and it's all the repercussions of that combined with a thriller story. And again, a great spunky

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,880
 female character. I think it might be Mickey when she's grown up. Oh wow, imagine that if that's

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 the same universe. Oh my god, this whole thing has been blown wide open. All right, so go and look

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,920
 at both of those books, The Last Day and Mickey and the Animal Spies. Yes, especially at the moment

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,560
 when it's a really good time to be supporting authors and buying books. It's such a good time to buy

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,480
 books. The whole book industry is massively struggling, so it's just think of it as a good thing to do

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,320
 for the world as well as yourself to go out and buy books. Okay, on with the show.

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:32,560
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you,

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,480
 not from the QI offices in Covent Garden, but from four rooms across the country. My name is Andrew

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,160
 Hunter Murray and with me today are Anna Tajinsky, James Harkin and Anne Miller. And once again,

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,040
 we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days

31
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,400
 and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:08,880
 loofas are edible. Yummy but time snack. Yeah, I didn't say they tasted nice, but loofas,

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,760
 which I find it a really funny word. So loofas are plants from the Luffa, the Lufa plant,

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
 so I think I assumed, and maybe other people did, that real loofa sponges that you get in the shower

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,280
 are sponges, like the animals, the organisms, but they're not, they're a plant, they're a gourd, in fact,

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,640
 and you can grow them. I realise that there's this plant that I've been looking at in my local shop

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,080
 in London, pre-locked out, obviously, that I've never known what it is, and it's this. It's just a

38
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,160
 loofa sponge in its early days. No. Yeah. It looks like a ridged cauljet, and yeah, basically it's like

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,400
 a gourd and the loofa that you have hanging in your shower is when it's past its delicious phase,

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,640
 and more in the dried up, desiccated phase. And it's like, if you think of a pumpkin when you empty a

41
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,920
 pumpkin out to make a face out of it, then all the white stringy stuff in that, when that dries

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,160
 up in the loofa, it turns into a sponge. Loofas have so many uses that I didn't know about. So

43
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,760
 researchers in Mumbai, they've made bricks out of loofas, and they have more air pockets than a

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,000
 standard brick, so you have to dry it and grind it down and mix it with aggregate material,

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,520
 kind of like concrete, it mixes together with other stuff. But they're really porous, and they

46
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,160
 can harbour plant and animal life inside the brick, and they're so porous, they have kind of

47
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,960
 mini water tanks inside them, so that cools the building down. So loofas sound like the ideal brick

48
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,320
 home building material. Okay, but one thing you shouldn't really use loofas for is scrubbing your

49
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,880
 back in the bath, isn't that right? According to some microbiologists, they're like a breeding ground

50
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,240
 for bacteria, because they have lots of air pockets, lots of holes where bacteria can get in, and

51
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,000
 dead skin cells, you get dead skin cells in there, what the bacteria like to eat, dead skin cells,

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,080
 where do they like to live in warm damp environments? What is an after-y of a warm damp environment?

53
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,720
 It's perfect. I read a bit of a advice saying, you should chuck away your loofa pretty much every

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,360
 week, which feels like you're going through so many loofas. So the three-pack should last you about

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,160
 a month, that's too many. Yeah, but loofas are quite long, I've seen one at Q Gardens, and it's much

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,760
 longer than a loofah you put in the bath, so maybe you just cut a bit off, maybe it grows back like

57
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,840
 celery, and take the end off it. Maybe it does that. We're not sure, and I'm thinking by one from

58
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,080
 that shop, when it reopens. I will. Well, if there are anything like your average kind of gods,

59
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,480
 you know when you try to grow courgettes, and you end up at the end of the season with 200,000

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,920
 courgettes, or marrow is quite the point you do. No, I don't know that. Maybe I've never grown a marrow.

61
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,800
 This might be your experience, but it's not a universal human experience.

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,920
 I think anyone who's ever done gardening and garden with courgettes that turn into marrow will know,

63
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,320
 I remember this in my childhood, that they grow much better than any other vegetable, so you get

64
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,840
 so sick of eating them for every single meal. Please write it in if you've had this experience.

65
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,120
 And don't say that, you're going to get hundreds of thousands of emails now.

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,560
 That one thing you can do, if you don't want to throw your loofa away, is microwave it.

67
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,920
 That's one advice from the loofah experts. They say that to eat it or clean it.

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,720
 That's a great point. I don't know how it cooks in a microwave, but if you have a loofah in your

69
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,640
 bathroom and you're worried that it's getting a bit germy, apparently if you shove it in the microwave

70
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,600
 for 30 seconds, or a minute, then it'll, don't put it, just start with 10 seconds.

71
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,280
 Don't put it in for too long. That's the microwaves. Always the way with the microwave though.

72
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,240
 Start with 10 seconds. Build up to giving it an hour. Yeah. Take it out, stir it around.

73
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,680
 Nice. Do you guys know that there's only one hotel in the UK that grows its own loofas?

74
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,800
 Really? Yeah, one hotel. Where? It's near Bath. It's near Bath. That's funny.

75
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,280
 A place called Ston, Eastern Park. Not only do they make their own loofas, they have an annual

76
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,480
 event, the Loofah Harvest, where you can go to the hotel and see the loofas being harvested.

77
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,440
 And it's the end of October or the start of November every single year, so hopefully it won't be

78
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,360
 affected by the current lockdown, fingers crossed, and the gardeners will take you down and advise you

79
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,120
 on your own loofa cultivation, and then they'll give you a demonstration on how to de-skin your loofah,

80
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
 and then you get a two-cost lunch. I don't know if there's any loofas part of that.

81
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,360
 Both courses. And then you get a loofa demonstration, and at the end of the day you get to go back to

82
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,600
 the garden and pick your own loofa. Wow. What a day out that would be. That's amazing.

83
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,480
 Yeah. Hey, you know who would love that? So I was looking up

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,200
 gourds and squashes, so gourd is basically generally used for the inedible ones and squash

85
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,320
 are the ones that we eat. But the American Gourd Society, they began in 1937, and they are

86
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,880
 big enthusiasts of all the kinds. And as having a look at other kinds of gourds, because the loofah

87
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,520
 obviously great. Do you know about the bottle gourd? No. So it's basically it's long, and when you dry

88
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,680
 it out, it kind of becomes hollow and it's got a long stem, which works like a handle, so you can

89
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240
 use it to carry water around. Oh, nice. Kind of useful. I was just thinking the word 'gourd'.

90
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,760
 I think I first came across it in the Asterix books. Did he use to carry like magic potions in his

91
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,560
 garden stuff? Oh, that does look well. Yeah, because you definitely drink out of them like I

92
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,840
 used them as mugs and stuff, wouldn't you? Well, Anna, you must have a nightmare with your 200,000

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,320
 full-jet mugs every year. My cobbards are full. Have you ever been to one of Anna's drinking parties

94
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,400
 where we all drink tequila out of a gourd? All the jinx taste of courgett. It's actually not very pleasant.

95
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,400
 We're here for a gourd time, not for a long time. That could be the tagline.

96
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,400
 On other historical using of loofahs, it was a real craze in the end of the 19th century. So this

97
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,880
 is when people really picked up on the loofah as being handy. And it was because friction baths had

98
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,200
 just become very popular. And so this was the idea that it began with the concept that

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,040
 showering or washing was bad for you. So for about 200 years, it was quite common not to wash much

100
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,880
 because people thought that getting hot opened up your pores and led in lots of little bad guys.

101
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,560
 And then they decided that scrubbing with something really rough and sand papery. So women used to use

102
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,280
 mohair or flesh brushes. If you scrubbed and scoured your skin, that would get all the bad guys out.

103
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,200
 And then they discovered loofah, which was perfect for scraping out all these tiny little

104
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,640
 bad guys. The bad guys. I guess we now call them sort of pathogen or something. But there was this

105
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,280
 this craze with friction bars. And it was invented by guy called Lewis Coon. And it was the friction

106
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,800
 sits bath. And what you did was you sat in a bathtub. But the water was about 10 to 14 degrees centigrade.

107
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,640
 So cold, unpleasantly cold. And you rub your lower abdomen, hips and genitals very vigorously

108
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,360
 with a rough cloth or a loofah. And the nerve stimulation was thought to evacuate all the toxins.

109
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,800
 Wow. And then you go straight to bed. I wonder if that's part of the loofah day out that James passed.

110
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,720
 I decided to go off the loofah day out of that part of it. The genitals stimulation,

111
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,480
 you have to pay extra for that part. Some of the people are not people, actually the opposite of

112
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,200
 people, animals. Some animals that have friction baths are sperm whales. And now sperm whales.

113
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,960
 People are animals. You're right. It's not the opposite at all, is it? Animals are not people though.

114
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,200
 No. Well some animals are people. This is contentious guys. And for another day.

115
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,040
 Okay. So anyway, animals that have friction baths include sperm whales. And what they do is they

116
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,480
 get together and they exfoliate by rubbing against each other. So normally sperm whales are quite

117
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,920
 solitary or they'll be in small pods of maybe 10 or 15. But every now and then about 70 of them

118
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,400
 will come together and they'll all start rubbing against each other to get the bad guys off.

119
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,280
 Because they have bad guys who attach themselves to the skin like limpids and stuff like that,

120
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,160
 parasites. And there's genuinely serves an actual purpose, doesn't it? So it's like temperature

121
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,520
 regulation. If you're covered in algae, it's hard to regulate your temperature or you've got

122
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,240
 proper parasites. Whereas for humans, it's kind of bizarre that we exfoliate or I obviously don't

123
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,560
 because I'm not a fool. But it's bizarre that exfoliating has become such an accepted thing.

124
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,800
 I mean, what is it? There's no scientific evidence to say it's doing anything useful.

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,280
 Find it kind of gets rid of those gross bumpy things on the back of our arms, which I'm kind of

126
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:51,200
 fond of. But that might also be personal to you. I think you need to see someone about those.

127
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,960
 But when I was reading about the different kinds of girls they've made, apparently a

128
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,800
 warty girl does quite a thing because it's like it's even more distinctive. So they like a warty

129
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
 girl. They would want to it. I don't think I'm the kind of saying that Aralbo looks like a

130
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,040
 warty god. Well, actually, it sounds like it's in me here. You've been spending too much time

131
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:19,280
 rolling around in the courgette patch. Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is N. My fact

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,840
 is that the man who invented Jramanji did so because he hated Monopoly. Wow. If only we could

133
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,760
 all kind of channel that hatred for Monopoly into some creators. I mean, we've all been there, right?

134
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,120
 Yeah, he's awesome. So his name is Chris Van Alzberg. He is a children's author and illustrator.

135
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,720
 And he's got really interesting ways of how he gets ideas. So as well as he wrote Jramanji,

136
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,880
 the original picture book, and he also wrote The Puller Express, which also turned into a big movie.

137
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,320
 And he said that when he was younger, he used to find it frustrating that if you were playing Cludo,

138
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,880
 you couldn't actually interrogate Colonel Mustard. And if you're playing Monopoly, you didn't get any

139
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,240
 money. You weren't actually rich at the end, even if you'd built lots of hotels and had all the

140
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,200
 expensive properties. And then he also thought, well, what are things that I see a lot? So

141
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,840
 everyone's seen footage of a Rhino Stampede, but they haven't seen a Rhino Stampede in a living room.

142
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,920
 And then he was like, ah, a jungle game that comes to life. That's what I'm going to make.

143
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,560
 Okay. Yeah. That was a huge thing. But which game was he playing when he decided to do

144
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,280
 The Puller Express? I think that will be that train game, which I've forgotten the name of,

145
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,720
 that goes through Europe. Oh, ticket to ride. Wow. And was he annoyed that at the end of

146
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,240
 ticket to ride, you're not in but a pest? Like, this guy has very high demands of his

147
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,760
 ball games, I would say. I think everyone else accepts the fundamental conceit that at the end

148
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,560
 of Monopoly, you don't get 30 grand and the hilton. So yeah, it's, it's another interesting leap,

149
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,520
 isn't it, that he went from Monopoly to Rhino's. He must have had a jungle ponchont running alongside

150
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,440
 his hatred of Monopoly. Yeah. He does sound very cool. No, I love him. And his approach to,

151
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,960
 sorry, so he shared a letter that a fan wrote to him. And this is a girl called Alexander. And she

152
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,000
 said, "Dear Mr Van Al's book, I love the books you write. I am glad your books are so weird because

153
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,200
 I am very weird. I think you are weird, but great. I wish the volcano and flood would be in my room."

154
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,760
 Okay. Wow. What a silly thing to wish for. Very, very troubled home life that we're not really

155
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,800
 going to have time to get into properly, I think. My favourite origin story actually for a board game

156
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,040
 is there's the two men who invented trivial pursuit in 1979. And it's an incredibly boring story

157
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,880
 after you get to the bones of it. It's like the two businessmen who thought, "Yeah, should we invent

158
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,440
 trivial pursuit?" So it came about, I think one of them said they were inspired to invent it when

159
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,320
 they were playing Scrabble and some of the pieces were missing. So they couldn't play it anymore. Now,

160
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,360
 if you think about it, if you have pieces missing in Scrabble, it doesn't matter. If the piece that's

161
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,400
 missing is the board, then that's a problem. That's the crucial, yeah. Is the only absolutely crucial

162
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,640
 piece. No, I think there are lots of different ways in which you lose pieces. So, for example, if you

163
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,680
 lose all the vowels, that is going to be a tricky game of Scrabble to get through. And that would

164
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,840
 actually be a great prank to play on someone. Maybe it was the holder for the counters and they couldn't

165
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,080
 find a way to display them. Well, that's the other person seeing what they had. Must have been the holder.

166
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,960
 That's very good. We found three different ways in which this origin story stacks up.

167
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,120
 I like the origin of operation. Do you know that game? It's like it's a guy in a hospital and you have

168
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,920
 to pick out bits of his body with tweezers, right? And if you hit the sides, then it makes a buzz.

169
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:41,120
 Now, this was invented by a student in the 1960s. He was a design student and it was for his exam.

170
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,200
 But before that, Benjamin Franklin invented operation in the 1700s. What? He invented a game,

171
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:55,360
 which was basically the same. It was called treason. And it had a picture of King George II and you had

172
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,960
 to get a crown out of him. And if you touch the sides, then it would make a buzzing noise. So, Benjamin

173
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,960
 Franklin invented operation. Isn't that amazing? That's incredible, James.

174
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,160
 If real life operations were anything like operation, then surgeons would open up their patients

175
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,760
 and go, "Oh, shit, there are no organs in here at all." It's taken the organs. Is that what happens in

176
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,400
 operation? Do you just lose the organs over time? Pretty amazing. Oh, okay. I've never, I've never

177
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,840
 owned a set. Oh, that was a good time to get one, Andy. Yeah, that's true. I've only got four

178
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,160
 board games, one of which I bought for an earlier episode of Fish, which was the cattle seam and trading

179
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,640
 board game, great up to Elite Cow. Oh, wow. I know. And then one of the others is the QI board game,

180
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,760
 one is Scrabble. I don't have a very good cover. Do you think they could turn the, you know,

181
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,520
 how Jumanji is like kind of a board game, but then also a movie? Do you think they could turn the

182
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,160
 cattle seam and trading board game into a movie? Yes. I absolutely do. I think some bad guys

183
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,720
 hold the world's cattle seam and stock to ransom. And the rock will have to be involved somehow.

184
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,360
 Because they did have a monopoly, the movie, didn't they? Oh, no, they're making. No, they're making

185
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,160
 monopoly movie. I think they've tried before, but they're making a new one with Kevin Hart,

186
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,320
 who was in the new Jumanji movies. So I feel like he's going to absolutely conquer board game

187
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,440
 movie crossovers. Oh, well, it's going to be very, very long. That's the only thing we know about

188
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,680
 the monopoly film, be 16 hours long. You know, they're about to ruin monopoly, or I think they might

189
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,640
 have ruined it already by inventing a new updated version where it's cashless. So they want to get

190
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,920
 in tune with the modern man or woman. And so they've got a cashless monopoly where basically

191
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,520
 Mr. Monopoly is the banker. So no player gets to be the banker anymore. Mr. Monopoly is a top

192
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,480
 hat, a big top hat who sits in the middle of the board and uses voice recognition technology

193
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,640
 to know which player is talking to him. And a player will say, I want to buy Park Lane,

194
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,280
 and then he'll just deduct that amount from your amount. That's true. And so it takes away the joy

195
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,640
 of cheating as the banker, which is the only reason anyone plays monopoly in the first place.

196
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,560
 Exactly. The whole point is to cheat. Yeah. Well, Anna, I know which version you should get,

197
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,800
 because they've also made monopoly, the cheeto's edition, where a part of the game is to try and

198
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,040
 steal from the bank lie about your dice rolls. And it comes with a set of handcuffs, like I talk

199
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,080
 in a handcuffs. Great. They're really embracing the cheating. But there's tons of them, like,

200
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,200
 novelty monopoly. I had a look at a big list of them. And just the ones beginning with A include

201
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,960
 Abba monopoly, Alton Towers monopoly, Alice in Wonderland, Alpaca monopoly. That's an unofficial

202
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,160
 one, an Aberdeen monopoly. There are so many, if you look up monopoly, and if you're attempting

203
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,160
 to find facts about it, then half the news results are different places, you know,

204
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,200
 Kingston on Thames is getting its own monopoly set. And I do wonder what the advantage of this is,

205
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,600
 or whether they franchise it, or whether, because it seems like no one, you know, I used to live

206
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,400
 quite near Kingston, I didn't want to Kingston monopoly set. Well, I think they're all pandering

207
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,640
 to this one guy who has the world record, most number of monopoly sets. Okay, he's called Neil Scalen,

208
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,080
 and he has the Guinness world record. And how many monopoly sets do you think he owns? Completely

209
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,480
 good. Each one is completely different. 312. I think there's over a thousand novelty ones. I'm

210
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,080
 going to go a thousand. A thousand number one. And each one has a 400. He has, as of the 25th of

211
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:26,960
 January 2019. So a while ago, he has 2,249 different monopoly sets. And if you go into the amazing website

212
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,920
 worldofmonopoly.com, you can see a list of all the ones that he has. But that's not a cheap game,

213
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,960
 that's a lot of money. He almost could have like real monopoly. I know. And also, Anna, you and I

214
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,000
 have a copy of an extremely random monopoly set, don't we? We do the University of Kent, right?

215
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,040
 Yeah, and this guy also has that no way. Yeah, that's so good. Christmas in this guy's household

216
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,520
 must be hell. I was so sure we would have loved that he didn't have, but that is amazing.

217
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,320
 Jesus Christ. I wondered what his like, like the most sought out after it, the most the

218
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,920
 rarest like special monopolies. Because I read about one they made for Wall Street where it's like

219
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,240
 made of like solid gold pieces, but I think it's a bit overkill. But I wonder if there's like a,

220
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,880
 I don't know, what's a, like from a tiny village somewhere who's just got their own one and

221
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,440
 selling it in the post office. I wonder what's the hardest to get? I went on to eBay and I looked for

222
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,600
 the most expensive monopoly set at the moment. And it was a Bulgarian monopoly. I guess for some reason

223
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,240
 there weren't many made or something like that, but yeah, it was quite a few, it was about 700 pounds

224
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,960
 or something for a Bulgarian monopoly. And so you got it on the queue. I just, I don't want Neil

225
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,440
 Scallon to have it. I just stop him. I wonder if Chris Van Alesborg ever, like, makes up with

226
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,480
 monopoly. They could make a German G monopoly. That would be quite fun. Oh, then must be one. I don't

227
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,280
 think the world, I don't think the world needs more editions of monopoly. I have to say it's so

228
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,760
 interesting how people who play ball games in any serious way all hate monopoly so much.

229
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,400
 So the Guardian asked people for their least favourite ball games for a feature they were writing.

230
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,240
 And one of the responses just said, monopoly is awful because of the vice-like grip it has over how

231
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,320
 the British public perceived ball games. I'm going to a ball game night at a local comic shop this

232
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,200
 evening. Nobody will be playing monopoly. And if it was suggested, then I would assume it was a sick

233
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:29,760
 joke of some kind. They had in 2016 House Pro now makes monopoly announce they were operating a

234
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,320
 special hotline on Christmas day where people who had been traumatised by their monopoly-based

235
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,480
 experiences could call. It actually ran from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day and I just feel so devastatingly

236
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,040
 sorry for whatever intern was asked to perform that role. Guy Hasbro, it wasn't a recorded message,

237
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,560
 they said, we'll have experts on hand with the official rule books to instantly settle any disputes

238
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,520
 and advise on how to resolve common complaints. God, okay, so it's Christmas day. You're in

239
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,480
 intern, you have to work and you're sat by the phone. Would you rather no one called you or someone

240
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,760
 called you to talk to you about monopoly? Oh God, it's Sophie's choice, isn't it? I'd rather go directly

241
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,360
 to jail to be honest with you. I was reading some monopoly strategy and I'm sure there was a

242
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,040
 basically an article in the New York magazine with the headline, you don't hate monopoly, you just

243
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,200
 suck at it and said the reason we hate it is we can't play it properly. But if everyone can play

244
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,080
 it properly then we all suck at it again because there are only so many key skills and tricks

245
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,480
 you can get. But the main things they say are if you're after the oranges it's good to stay in jail

246
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,120
 because there's more chance of rolling a double and completing your set. When there are not so many

247
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,040
 properties available it's good to sit in jail because then you don't have to pay any rent and they

248
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,760
 were very cross about the, some people play a version where you collect the money from fines if

249
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,040
 you land on free parking and they are very angry about that because apparently it messes with the

250
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,400
 game and makes it more random. Oh it's the only joy of monopoly is going to pick up that money and I

251
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,600
 hate the people who won't hate it. Well you hate the people who use the actual rules of monopoly on it.

252
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:11,520
 I hate them. You need that hot life. I read an article with the 2015 UK Championship winner Natalie

253
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,800
 Fitzsimmons and she gave her tips of how to win monopoly and this is, I mean I think this is terrible

254
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:25,280
 what she does. So she basically goes and buys all of the properties she can and then mortgages them all

255
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,320
 and so she gets the money back but she doesn't collect any rent but it doesn't matter because the rent

256
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,600
 is so small and then she collects one group and then puts four houses on each of those groups. She

257
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,200
 doesn't put a hotel on there or anything like that and then she tries to get into jail for as long

258
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:51,520
 as possible. And apparently this is the best technique to win the game. Wow. It's amazing. And another

259
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,600
 thing she says is sometimes you can get instead of mortgaging them all you get a few different groups

260
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,800
 and then you always put four houses on each so there's not enough houses left for anyone else to build

261
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,280
 houses. Well you just run out the pieces of the game. Yeah there's not enough houses in the box

262
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,520
 for everyone to put four houses on each thing. So if you put four and all yours it stops anyone

263
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,800
 else from being able to do it. That can't be in the rules. It is. You run out of houses. Oh my

264
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,440
 it is the rules. It's the rules. So when we were younger we used to just put like a thimble instead

265
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,600
 of a house but that we were doing it wrong. Oh my god. Wow. That's amazing. I suppose that's

266
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,760
 realistic. Yeah. If you run out of building materials you can't replace them with the thimble.

267
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,800
 That's true. We've actually never mentioned it on this podcast although I think we have one QI

268
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,160
 the origin story of monopoly. So basically there's this guy Charles Darrow and if you go on the

269
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,400
 monopoly website actually if you look at find the history which I think they've buried

270
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,200
 deeper than it used to be. There's Charles Darrow who dreamed up monopoly in the 1930s and this

271
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 guy Darrow went around saying he'd just come up with it. In one interview someone said you know

272
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,840
 where did it come from and he had no origin story he just said it was like magic it just came to

273
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:11,200
 me. So in fact what happened and this was only really uncovered in the 1970s was that there was a woman

274
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,240
 about 30 years early in 1903 called Elizabeth McGee and she sounded so awesome she was very unusual

275
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,600
 a proper self-made woman who was independently made living she was a secretary she wrote poetry

276
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,200
 and short stories she did stand up comedy. She once came second in a beauty contest.

277
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,120
 And you wouldn't have thought that someone so fun would invent monopoly but she did she called it

278
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,160
 the landlord's game and the whole point of it at the time was that it exposed the folly of capitalism

279
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,120
 so there were two sets of rules there was the anti-monopolis rule where everyone is rewarded for the

280
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,120
 wealth that they create and then there was the monopoly rule where you build up monopolies and

281
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,440
 crush your opponents and she didn't quite mean for humanity to fully embrace the second one

282
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,320
 and decide that was the one we wanted to play but she played it and she showed it to her friends and

283
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,880
 it caught on and eventually you know quite a few people played it in a certain part of the state

284
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,800
 and it reached Charles Darrow through a friend and he sort of like slightly tweaked it and

285
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:20,240
 published it claimed the patent sorted he's a hero wow that's terrible he needs to go straight to jail

286
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,160
 we're going to have to move on in second I just have one thing I went off on a bit of a tangent here

287
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,120
 because it was about jumanji and I was and this what this guy didn't like about monopoly was a fact you couldn't go

288
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,480
 into the game you know and experience it so I was looking up by the kind of going into immersive

289
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,600
 reality experiences and I just came across this short story that I read and it's called pigmalion

290
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:51,280
 spectacles from 1935 and I think it's the earliest reference to virtual reality sort of 3D amazing

291
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,760
 experience glasses so it's by this guy called Stanley Weinbaum and it starts out with a man who's

292
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,280
 a bit drunk at a party and stumbles out to the street meets a professor who says wouldn't you love to

293
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,480
 see a film that was really realistic caught a bear in mind this is the 1930s so the guy was like yeah

294
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,920
 but that could never exist and he said what if I give you these glasses and this chap puts on the

295
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:21,200
 glasses and suddenly he can see here feel taste and smell everything and he has this incredible

296
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,440
 adventure and it's really really exciting and then he takes the glasses off and he's like fuck that

297
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,160
 was magic and then the professor says it's not actually I just dip these glasses in a chemical

298
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,080
 electrical solution which did all the audio input and the woman you fell in love with is actually

299
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,880
 my niece she's an actress like in one of these immersive reality things okay but what I wanted to

300
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,400
 tell you was um he said so the guy was like how did you make all the trees seem so real you know

301
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,080
 it was like jamanji he was in a forest and he said oh the trees they are simply now what do you

302
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:03,200
 think they were uh toilet brushes incorrect and do you might know moss it was boss no way

303
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,800
 our club moss is enlarged by a lens now I don't know if we have mentioned openly on the podcast

304
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,480
 before but Andy's been insisting for years that club moss looks exactly like trees and now this is

305
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:27,440
 vindication vindication okay it's time for fact number three and that is James okay my fat

306
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,280
 this week is that there is a man in Brazil who nobody is allowed to go within five miles of

307
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:40,400
 and is this a he hasn't showered for a long time it's not a social isolation well it is a social

308
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,520
 isolation thing but not a um and actually it is on government advice as well so it's kind of similar

309
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,200
 to what's happening but he is the last survivor of an uncontacted tribe he lives in the Amazon

310
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,840
 rainforest and basically what happened in Brazil for a long time is these people who are living in

311
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,080
 the rainforests they would try and contact them and try and assimilate them into modern life

312
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,200
 and obviously um or maybe not obviously but I think we now know that that is not a particularly good

313
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,760
 idea because basically you're bringing pathogens over there you you're kind of destroying the

314
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,960
 ways of life they lose their languages they lose their culture stuff like that and so the current

315
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,600
 idea is a thing called policy of no contact where you just let people live their lives you don't have

316
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,760
 to get in touch with them you don't have to give them stuff if they want to come to you they will

317
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,600
 come to you if they need stuff they'll come to you and get it but you need to leave them on their

318
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,840
 own and so there is this one guy who's living on his own it seems he's the last member of the tribe

319
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,800
 and in 2007 Brazil declared a 31 square mile area around him to be completely off limits for anyone

320
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,560
 else so no one else is allowed to go there and it was later expanded by 11.5 square miles so

321
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,320
 about 3,000 hectares and now you are definitely not allowed to go anywhere in that area because you'll

322
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,960
 be disturbing his way of life wow yeah so cool did the government have to keep proving that he

323
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,120
 exists that's a good point actually I think the last time they saw him was a few years ago but I think

324
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,840
 they do have ethnologists who go there every now and then just checking up to see to see what's

325
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,960
 happening because he builds lots of different huts from place to place and goes from one place to

326
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,840
 another he makes traps for animals which he then eats and he also makes markings on trees which

327
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,360
 they think maybe some kind of spiritual thing so he's constantly using his environment for various

328
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,480
 things and so you can see when he's moving around and what he's doing doesn't he also dig quite

329
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,840
 deep holes and people are because obviously nobody can ask him they're not quite sure whether that's

330
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,440
 for him as shelter whether it's a trap for animals whether it's something spiritual it's quite mysterious

331
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,160
 yeah so weird is that where they call him the man of the whole yeah we haven't said that he's

332
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,000
 called the man of the whole actually but that's that is one of the things they call him yeah

333
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,800
 James if this guy moves does the zone of exclusion move with him so could he move to the center of

334
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:11,200
 the genera and everyone would have to go you are absolutely right this is one from the metal floor

335
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,880
 with the way that I've worded by fact no one is allowed to go within five miles of him if he stands

336
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,120
 in the middle of his range oh yeah I mean so if he goes to right to the edge of the area which

337
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,040
 has been given to him then actually you could stand right next to him you could stand within two

338
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,640
 metres of him if he happens to be standing at the edge of that area okay otherwise it would be

339
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,080
 tragic if he ever tried to make contact people just sprinting away screaming yeah but I guess that's

340
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,160
 nice because then if he wants to greet people and meet someone he can go to the end and there are

341
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,760
 people there exactly that yeah because I was I was reading about the Centre Lee's Islanders

342
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,080
 and they are basically hardly anyone has had contact with them there was a group of anthropologists

343
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,640
 who made two trips to try and make contact and the one way they managed to do it was they went

344
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,800
 in their boat and they floated coconuts over to the island and the islanders don't have coconuts so

345
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,440
 they took them and that was sort of like a beginning of a barter system and then when they went back

346
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,320
 they were not quite so keen the next time so they sort of trying to make contact if people want to

347
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,120
 make it but not to impose yourself yeah especially you don't want to with the Centre Lee's because they're

348
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,720
 famously they're not I wouldn't say unfriendly I'd say quite murderous of strangers I read one

349
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,920
 thing about those guys that if you go onto their island and they don't want you to be there the

350
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,520
 first thing they'll do is turn their back on you and go down on their haunches and pretend to defecate

351
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,960
 and that is kind of they're putting two fingers up saying fuck off get out fire island kind of thing

352
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,320
 and then if you don't pay he to that then they'll start firing arrows at you and and try and kill you

353
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,080
 that's really interesting but can you imagine the slight shame of the anthropologists who went

354
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,520
 all the way there I've been like we're going to do it we found a way to make contact and then they say

355
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,560
 and what happens they buried their bombs and pretended to defecate you can't really use us you can't

356
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,480
 give a big lecture to a based on moaning I don't think do you know if you um google map north

357
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,680
 Sentinel island which is where they live uh it's you can zoom right in and you will see there's

358
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:15,680
 actually a bar there so yeah uh going to go it's a curry house and bar it's got a series of five

359
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,040
 star reviews and uh at the moment there is a sign underneath it that says hours may be affected

360
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,800
 by covid-19 which is understandable um but so the reviews include a good getaway especially given

361
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,960
 current events did a good but interrupted by arrows and death threats from wages uh so what is

362
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,840
 it is a joke guys it's a google joke it was actually uh someone sent it to me a guy called Harry

363
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,040
 Johnston wrote in a fan of the podcast saying have you seen this about a year ago wow wow that's a

364
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:50,400
 curry house and bar yeah so give it a visit don't um I also went on google maps for this area where

365
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:57,680
 this guy is living the Brazilian guy um and it's an area called valet do havari a lot of people call it

366
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,320
 like one of the last unexplored areas of the world but actually of course lots of people live there

367
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,880
 because you have lots of amazonian tribes who live there but if you go on google maps and you

368
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,800
 search for it it's basically just a gray square and then you can zoom out and zoom out and zoom out

369
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,960
 and zoom out and it's still just a gray square with like a river going through it and there's

370
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,560
 literally nothing and you can zoom out to about the size of like England and Wales and you can still

371
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,080
 not see any towns or anything it's just a gray square it's absolutely amazing but in this area

372
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,560
 there is a mountain called uh pico de neblina and this is the highest mountain in Brazil

373
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:42,800
 and no one knew it existed until the 1950s wow that is how isolated this is the tallest mountain in

374
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,880
 the whole country is there and no one knew it was there it's really good that's very cool and in theory

375
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,640
 what happened is someone was flying over it in an aeroplane and thought there's a big mountain

376
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,880
 there where it's not supposed to be and they went maybe someone could check this out and then

377
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,400
 they measured it and it was way taller than anywhere else that's awesome um I was having a look at

378
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,840
 other remote places places that hard to get to and do you know there's a section of america where

379
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,280
 they still receive their post by mule it's part of the official us postal service um there is an

380
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,640
 Indian reservation at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and so it's hard to get helicopters down there

381
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,720
 and if it's windy they can't fly at all but the mules go whatever the weather every day

382
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,920
 so they go by car by road to the edge of the Grand Canyon and then it is a three-hour trip down by

383
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,520
 mule uh down to the bottom it's a post he called Charlie Chamberlain it's his job and he they basically

384
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,960
 anything you can put a stamp on they will take they take food they take supplies they take post

385
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,040
 and they have got a jug that if you want the express service they just let one of the mules

386
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,040
 go free and run to the bottom i would have thought the express service would be throwing a mule

387
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,720
 off the edge of the Grand Canyon it's a highly trained special mules anti that's a mule

388
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:02,240
 I was looking up the other loneliest people in the world people like this so um you're there's one

389
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,800
 person who missed Neil Armstrong saying this is one small step for man one giant leap for mankind

390
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,800
 guess what it was uh Michael Collins it was Michael Collins Michael Collins was on the other side

391
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,880
 of the moon and could not get that line so so many other people in the world would have had access

392
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,200
 to that and people keep asking Michael Collins who's still alive um about his isolation because

393
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:35,120
 for 76 hours when Armstrong and Aldrin were on the moon Collins was orbiting and for 48 minutes

394
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,200
 every two hours he was on the far side of the moon so he was completely out of contact with everybody

395
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,640
 and you know there was there was only one person on that side of the moon out of three billion people

396
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,520
 on the other side of the moon um and he keeps being uh but he's so he's now enraged anytime

397
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:58,240
 anyone asks him so he says um he keeps being asked mr. Collins weren't you the loneliest man in the

398
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,720
 whole lonely history of this lonely planet by your lonely self behind the lonely moon and this

399
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,640
 lonely orbit weren't it terribly lonely and he says he was really happy he had nobody

400
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,440
 admission control weren't yak and away in his ear he was absolutely delighted out there yeah sounds

401
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,400
 like that journalist could have done with the sorceress yeah I think the person who's got the Guinness

402
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,440
 world record for the most isolated person is the other guy I can't I can't remember this is just

403
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,360
 from memory but is the other person Al Warden Alam Warden yeah who also went around the back of the

404
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,080
 moon didn't really why does he get the record I think he was there for longer okay while they were

405
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,840
 exploring cool it was three days it's kind of a it's kind of a kind of a burn on him and his social

406
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,880
 life to give him again a world record for loneliest dude ever do you not think it's quite a good lie

407
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,760
 in a bar is go hi I'm I'm the world's loneliest man what is that a pickup line do you think it's a bit

408
00:37:51,760 --> 00:38:02,800
 needy it's a bit intense as an ice break yeah I was reading about life in the Amazon did you know

409
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,520
 that there are no bridges across the Amazon river the whole river no it's the longest I've

410
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,920
 the longest all the second longest river in the world depending on how you measure it and there's

411
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,240
 no bridges across a whole thing and do you know why that is it's because it's massive what is that

412
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,400
 oh you mean it's a massive river because it's wide it's right because it's wide yeah yeah it's not

413
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,920
 always wide it's wide that it's mouth but it's narrower at its source isn't it yeah obviously it's

414
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,600
 narrower in the source I know that I'm just saying I don't you know it's most of it seems pretty

415
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,640
 big to me well I guess you're kind of half right hang on I wish surely we can work this out

416
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:49,200
 is it because the bits where it's narrow enough to put a bridge across it's protected or sacred

417
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,240
 territory no not really it's more that in the bits where it's narrow enough to put a bridge across

418
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,960
 no one lives there so it's basically you know at the mouth of the river there are few cities and

419
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,480
 really it's too wide there to to put bridges across really it's kind of super wide

420
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,320
 but in where it gets bit narrower no one lives there and there's a few kind of boat crossings

421
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,680
 and stuff like that but really there's no roads so why would you need a bridge Jesus I can't

422
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,560
 believe there's none in between zone yeah you'd think so wouldn't you that's an amazing fact yeah

423
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,080
 isn't it cool yeah do you know that there's a bridge over the Atlantic is this another Boris Johnson

424
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:34,720
 fantasy yeah there is over the whole Atlantic no go on so I was on holiday on the west coast of

425
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,200
 Scotland and we will go and that was one of the local attractions so it's a it's a stream that comes

426
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,680
 off the Atlantic so they claim it as the bridge over the Atlantic's it's the same bit and I thought

427
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,040
 that was amazing so my head it's from Cornwall to New York what do what do you mean it as a stream

428
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,560
 it's a bit of water that comes off the I can't remember the details I didn't get actually get to

429
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,800
 visit it so I sat there did not get the information guide they claim it as the bridge in the Atlantic

430
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,760
 what do you do do you go and look at it or do you yeah and you can walk across it right yeah well

431
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,200
 if I'd gone I could answer all these questions so you know I think Anne's parents took her on holiday

432
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,440
 and told her they'd been to America when in fact they had been to the small stream on the west coast

433
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,840
 of Scotland but she walked across the bridge no we didn't we didn't get to go Anna this is my dream

434
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:24,000
 you didn't even get to go we went near the bridge over the Atlantic amazing one more thing about

435
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,360
 living in the Amazon one issue is they have piranhas but what do you think would happen if you

436
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 actually tried to swim with piranhas I know go on Anna you got your hand up if you fall in a river

437
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,640
 that's full of piranha they'll strip off your skin like your skin and banana there's no time

438
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,640
 for screaming there's no time for groans in 45 seconds you're nothing but bones that was an

439
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,880
 amazing bit of improv thank you very much what's that for I just happen to know the answer to your

440
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,360
 question what what is it from that it is a random poem from my childhood and I'm sorry scientifically

441
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,880
 accurate what really happens I'm really sorry for whoever wrote that poem but that's not true

442
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,720
 oh god piranhas they're kind of scared of big animals they don't really want to go near you if you

443
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,960
 fall in the water and you don't bother them they'll just hide away and they don't want to go anywhere

444
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,640
 near you now if they're in the dry season whether not getting any food or if they're in the breeding

445
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,800
 season then you might have a bit more problem but really they're more like vultures they're more like

446
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,920
 scavengers so if a bit of dead meat goes in there they'll go after it but if a human goes in there

447
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,520
 they'll think it might be something trying to attack them and they'll just hide away oh really

448
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,360
 so most of the time you'll be completely safe if you fall in the piranha pool and another kind of

449
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,200
 type of piranha that definitely won't kill you is the vegetarian piranha which is a thing that

450
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,440
 exists there is a species of piranha that is a vegetarian and they just eat seeds and fruit

451
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,600
 and stuff that falls into the water but those those those guys they seem innocuous but they can

452
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:05,120
 strip a courgette right down in 45 seconds there is a hermit in Scotland just while we're on

453
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,720
 the subject of lonely people okay and he's obviously he's playing amateur league hermitine if he's

454
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,840
 in Scotland it's supposed to in the middle of completely nowhere but he he's quite elderly he's

455
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:23,120
 called Ken Smith and he was injured this year by a log pile falling on him but he was rescued

456
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,680
 via Texas so he has an emergency beacon on him and he can press a button and it flags up

457
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:38,800
 with an American satellite and it goes to a command post in Texas saying the hermit in Scotland has

458
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,240
 had a mishap they contact the coast guard in Scotland and they say one of your hermitines is injured

459
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,920
 and then they have to send out a team to go and chuck them but they just go over that bridge of

460
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:59,920
 the Atlantic don't they to go that's why they built it yeah but the amazing thing is that is the

461
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,600
 second time it's happened in two years he's been rescued from the consummation what what does he

462
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,800
 keep doing is he very clumsy he's got a wood pile and I guess it's improperly stacked because it

463
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,640
 keeps falling on him hey he's doing that all by himself is there's no one to help him build it safely

464
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,320
 I guess no true it's like a real you know how jamangia is a real life board game this is like the real

465
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:32,160
 life jenga that he's living okay it's time for the final factor the show and that is my fact my

466
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,600
 fact is that in 19th century Osaka flat residents owned the rights to their own urine but the

467
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:48,240
 rights of their poo belong to their landlord so yeah and tendency agreements must have looked

468
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:56,000
 absolutely awesome yeah much messier so this was a great article on a on dot com which I will

469
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,680
 try and put up on my Twitter and it's all about the relationships between humans and human

470
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,720
 excretions basically and how it's been used throughout history and the the kind of commercial

471
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,640
 arrangements that we've made over it and in 18th and 19th century Japan and particularly in

472
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,360
 the city of Osaka there were complicated arrangements because feces were used for fertilizer

473
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,520
 and if you lived in an apartment building the rights to your feces belong to the buildings owner who

474
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,720
 would have arrangements in place to sell that and it would be loaded onto ships and taken away

475
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,440
 but you owned your own we that was something you had so feces were valuable because they would help

476
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,800
 to grow crops so it would affect your rent if there were lots of people living in your flat then

477
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,840
 you would produce lots of poo for your landlord to sell and your rent would be slightly lower as a

478
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,080
 result whereas if you're single occupancy you'd pay slightly more not just because you got your own

479
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,600
 flat but also because you weren't producing enough of the the brown gold and could you say to your

480
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,120
 landlord if you're negotiating you know I eat a lot of curry I have quite extravagant bowel movements

481
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:15,440
 honestly you'll be getting triple the average for me so I don't think so. So I was talking to a

482
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:23,600
 friend of mine in Tokyo called John Perry he is a writer of quiz books and pretty much my go-to

483
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,240
 experts on Japanese history and he said that what you say is true but it's very slightly different

484
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,600
 in that it's not the landlords who had the rights to your poo it was like the managing agents

485
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,360
 because the landlords they would live miles and miles and miles away and would have nothing to do

486
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,760
 this they would own your house but they would really not be involved in your day-stay life

487
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,160
 and what would happen is you'd have these people who were called Uya and they would be slightly

488
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,520
 higher than the tenants in importance but not much higher but they had a full-time job where it was

489
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,240
 like looking after the house collecting the rent doing the repairs settling disputes stuff like that

490
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,920
 and they would be able to read and write whereas the tenants might not be able to read or write

491
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,760
 and they would take the poo and they would sell it and they would get the money but the money was

492
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,520
 kind of expected to be used it would pay their wages but it was also used for all the tenants as well

493
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,920
 so they would buy rice cakes for new year out of the money from the poo and so it would go it would

494
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,880
 all go back into the community all the poo money it's not cool and they're called Uya which sounds

495
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,200
 like the noise they would make as they're collecting your poo you'd walk into someone's bathroom go

496
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,360
 Uya that is that's a bad one it sounds like the noise you make while you're making the poo doesn't it?

497
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,920
 it does and you were saying about like if you've had a curry you would tell people or something

498
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,280
 honey yes well it's not what I was saying yeah it's not what you were saying but the the value of your

499
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,960
 night soil which is what they called it depended on how rich you were so if you were rich you had a

500
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,280
 really good diet and it meant that your poo was better as a fertilizer so you'd be able to sell it

501
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,560
 for more so it's kind of a monopoly thing whereas the rich get richer do you know what I mean yeah

502
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,120
 but you know in a kind of poo sense because they're if their poo is literally richer

503
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:20,720
 and each but this is not James a version of monopoly I would like to play I don't think I need to play

504
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,520
 19th century feudal Japan monopoly look there are two thousand five hundred different types of

505
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,920
 monopoly I haven't looked through the whole list for all I know there is a poo monopoly

506
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,880
 it would be called monopoly I'm sorry I just needed to say that it's good that you got it out

507
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:48,640
 yeah thank you in 1724 in osuka there was a fight that broke out over the collection rights to poo

508
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:57,920
 so there were two groups from the villages of Yamazaki and Takasuki and they had the rights to

509
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,880
 buy the poo from the the managing agents and then they would give them to the farmers but they

510
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,160
 kind of fought against each other and it turned into a massive riot in the city really a lot of

511
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,200
 kind of shits laying yes there was a lot of that going on and it was got so valuable people would

512
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,720
 steal it so people would just in the dead of night come into your apartment and steal all your poo

513
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:27,040
 I mean it sort of it depends on the scale of the crime doesn't it whether it's worth it for you

514
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,240
 because if you just go into I just wonder about someone walking into their living room in the

515
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,160
 morning after a night's sleep and looking at the the third cabinet and thinking oh my god we've been

516
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,680
 robbed was it stealing large consignment so I wonder that probably makes more sense than individual

517
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,600
 burglaries yeah I don't think they would just take a single stool from each house out there used

518
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,160
 to be quite a harsh penalties in Japan for it didn't there because it you know it was lucrative

519
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,120
 and we should say this continued for hundreds of years and still up until the 1980s people will go

520
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,760
 around to people's houses in Japan and in lots of the east actually so in China it was a huge thing

521
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,800
 as well but in Japan in the 1980s there were vacuum trucks that would drive around to your house

522
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,960
 and you plug them into your sewage tank I guess and they suck the poo out and then it's gone and it's

523
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:26,080
 sold but yeah China as well was used feces human feces to enrich their soil for many hundreds of

524
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,840
 years and it was crucial so a lot of people think that it was part of the reason that Chinese agriculture

525
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,640
 did really well in a time when a lot of western countries didn't and there was a soil scientist I

526
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,480
 think this is a new article Andy that you sent us a soil scientist in 1911 called FH King who

527
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,480
 estimated that over 180 million tons of human manure was collected annually in the far east to

528
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:55,840
 enrich the soil and now that equates to 1.2 kilos of poo per person per day which is quite a

529
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,000
 lot so we do wonder if he overestimated slightly even if you're efficiently collecting it from every

530
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,360
 single person that's it's a lot it's a lot you know earlier I mentioned the the bricks that you can

531
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,760
 make out of loufers yeah there's another way of making bricks out of human urine so this is another

532
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:23,360
 as they call it biobrick that you can produce and it's urine and living bacteria so you get urine

533
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,760
 you get sand you get bacteria you put it all in a brick-shaped mold and there is a chemical reaction

534
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,600
 which ensues and that gradually solidifies the brick kind of like baking a cake kind of like baking

535
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,960
 kind of kind of I don't fancy your chances on the great pictures bake off next year and for my show

536
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:48,800
 stopper I've made a piss brick but the really good thing about this is that astronauts might one day

537
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:55,360
 be able to piss their own moon bases that's how that's basically what you could do you go you take

538
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:01,040
 a load of the molds up there and you slowly you know we your own home into existence look so that

539
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,920
 means as the food on the space station is depleted the space station is being built around you presumably

540
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:12,560
 yes exactly yeah but you only get food or shelter right that's true yeah you're not very far

541
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:21,200
 up Maslow's pyramid of needs they do call it cake actually in like the biosolids that are used

542
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,400
 in all of our farming less we forget so sewage is picked up and it's treated and then it's often

543
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,560
 used as fertilizer but when they talk about the digest dates of basically poo and other types of

544
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,160
 matter like that they do refer to it as cake and it comes in these cake shaped and cake textured

545
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,760
 particles that um you know you order through a farmer so for the great British bake off you could say

546
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,480
 I'm going to be making a cake today yeah you could get away with it I think you would be voted down

547
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,400
 but you could call it a urinal cake and that has a that's like a triple meaning of the word cake

548
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,200
 they're always making cakes out there in the shape of weird things yeah yeah so you could make
