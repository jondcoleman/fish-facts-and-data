00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, we first of all want to make sure everyone's"
00:00:04,00:00:09,okay and hope that you're keeping well and keeping sane and you're getting through this
00:00:09,00:00:14,"lockdown okay. But one thing we quickly wanted to say is that Dan is away still, he'll"
00:00:14,00:00:20,"be back next week, but in his stead we have our good friend and colleague Anne Miller."
00:00:20,00:00:25,"Yeah, that is right, and Miller's here. Not only is Anne Miller a QIL for you all know"
00:00:25,00:00:29,"very well, she's also a published author, which I'm sure you guys might know, and honestly,"
00:00:29,00:00:34,if you're looking for a book to entertain your children while you're stuck at home with them
00:00:34,00:00:38,"having to endure whatever it is that children do, do go and look up Anne's book, it's called"
00:00:38,00:00:43,"Mickey and the Animal Spies. I mean, I've actually read it and loved it and I realise I'm 34,"
00:00:43,00:00:49,but I do think I loved it in the mind of like a nine-year-old. It's about basically a bunch of
00:00:49,00:00:53,"animals and a ray of animals who go around solving crimes together with the lead character,"
00:00:53,00:00:58,"this really adventurous kind of spunky gal called Mickey. It's fab. Yes, and actually the other person"
00:00:58,00:01:03,"who's on this week's show, as well as myself and Anna and Anne, is of course Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:03,00:01:08,"and of course he has a book as well, which we should mention, and that's for people who's reading"
00:01:08,00:01:12,"ages above the age of nine. So have you read that, Anna? I have indeed. So here I have to slip into my"
00:01:12,00:01:19,"10-year-old self to really get to grips with that. No, that's called The Last Day, and it's brilliant."
00:01:19,00:01:24,If what you're looking for to escape this kind of current dystopia is a fictional and much more
00:01:24,00:01:30,"exciting dystopia, you want to go to The Last Day. The concept is amazing, so the concept is that"
00:01:30,00:01:35,"the world stops spinning and half of it's plunged into darkness, half of it's in light,"
00:01:35,00:01:41,"and it's all the repercussions of that combined with a thriller story. And again, a great spunky"
00:01:41,00:01:46,"female character. I think it might be Mickey when she's grown up. Oh wow, imagine that if that's"
00:01:46,00:01:52,"the same universe. Oh my god, this whole thing has been blown wide open. All right, so go and look"
00:01:52,00:01:57,"at both of those books, The Last Day and Mickey and the Animal Spies. Yes, especially at the moment"
00:01:57,00:02:02,when it's a really good time to be supporting authors and buying books. It's such a good time to buy
00:02:02,00:02:08,"books. The whole book industry is massively struggling, so it's just think of it as a good thing to do"
00:02:08,00:02:12,"for the world as well as yourself to go out and buy books. Okay, on with the show."
00:02:13,00:02:32,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you,"
00:02:32,00:02:40,"not from the QI offices in Covent Garden, but from four rooms across the country. My name is Andrew"
00:02:40,00:02:46,"Hunter Murray and with me today are Anna Tajinsky, James Harkin and Anne Miller. And once again,"
00:02:46,00:02:51,we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days
00:02:51,00:02:58,"and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that"
00:02:58,00:03:08,"loofas are edible. Yummy but time snack. Yeah, I didn't say they tasted nice, but loofas,"
00:03:08,00:03:15,"which I find it a really funny word. So loofas are plants from the Luffa, the Lufa plant,"
00:03:15,00:03:20,"so I think I assumed, and maybe other people did, that real loofa sponges that you get in the shower"
00:03:20,00:03:27,"are sponges, like the animals, the organisms, but they're not, they're a plant, they're a gourd, in fact,"
00:03:27,00:03:32,and you can grow them. I realise that there's this plant that I've been looking at in my local shop
00:03:32,00:03:38,"in London, pre-locked out, obviously, that I've never known what it is, and it's this. It's just a"
00:03:38,00:03:46,"loofa sponge in its early days. No. Yeah. It looks like a ridged cauljet, and yeah, basically it's like"
00:03:46,00:03:52,"a gourd and the loofa that you have hanging in your shower is when it's past its delicious phase,"
00:03:52,00:03:58,"and more in the dried up, desiccated phase. And it's like, if you think of a pumpkin when you empty a"
00:03:58,00:04:03,"pumpkin out to make a face out of it, then all the white stringy stuff in that, when that dries"
00:04:03,00:04:10,"up in the loofa, it turns into a sponge. Loofas have so many uses that I didn't know about. So"
00:04:10,00:04:15,"researchers in Mumbai, they've made bricks out of loofas, and they have more air pockets than a"
00:04:15,00:04:22,"standard brick, so you have to dry it and grind it down and mix it with aggregate material,"
00:04:22,00:04:27,"kind of like concrete, it mixes together with other stuff. But they're really porous, and they"
00:04:27,00:04:32,"can harbour plant and animal life inside the brick, and they're so porous, they have kind of"
00:04:32,00:04:38,"mini water tanks inside them, so that cools the building down. So loofas sound like the ideal brick"
00:04:38,00:04:44,"home building material. Okay, but one thing you shouldn't really use loofas for is scrubbing your"
00:04:44,00:04:50,"back in the bath, isn't that right? According to some microbiologists, they're like a breeding ground"
00:04:50,00:04:56,"for bacteria, because they have lots of air pockets, lots of holes where bacteria can get in, and"
00:04:56,00:05:02,"dead skin cells, you get dead skin cells in there, what the bacteria like to eat, dead skin cells,"
00:05:02,00:05:08,where do they like to live in warm damp environments? What is an after-y of a warm damp environment?
00:05:08,00:05:12,"It's perfect. I read a bit of a advice saying, you should chuck away your loofa pretty much every"
00:05:12,00:05:17,"week, which feels like you're going through so many loofas. So the three-pack should last you about"
00:05:17,00:05:22,"a month, that's too many. Yeah, but loofas are quite long, I've seen one at Q Gardens, and it's much"
00:05:22,00:05:25,"longer than a loofah you put in the bath, so maybe you just cut a bit off, maybe it grows back like"
00:05:25,00:05:31,"celery, and take the end off it. Maybe it does that. We're not sure, and I'm thinking by one from"
00:05:31,00:05:36,"that shop, when it reopens. I will. Well, if there are anything like your average kind of gods,"
00:05:36,00:05:40,"you know when you try to grow courgettes, and you end up at the end of the season with 200,000"
00:05:40,00:05:45,"courgettes, or marrow is quite the point you do. No, I don't know that. Maybe I've never grown a marrow."
00:05:45,00:05:50,"This might be your experience, but it's not a universal human experience."
00:05:52,00:05:57,"I think anyone who's ever done gardening and garden with courgettes that turn into marrow will know,"
00:05:57,00:06:02,"I remember this in my childhood, that they grow much better than any other vegetable, so you get"
00:06:02,00:06:05,so sick of eating them for every single meal. Please write it in if you've had this experience.
00:06:05,00:06:09,"And don't say that, you're going to get hundreds of thousands of emails now."
00:06:09,00:06:16,"That one thing you can do, if you don't want to throw your loofa away, is microwave it."
00:06:16,00:06:21,That's one advice from the loofah experts. They say that to eat it or clean it.
00:06:21,00:06:26,"That's a great point. I don't know how it cooks in a microwave, but if you have a loofah in your"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"bathroom and you're worried that it's getting a bit germy, apparently if you shove it in the microwave"
00:06:30,00:06:35,"for 30 seconds, or a minute, then it'll, don't put it, just start with 10 seconds."
00:06:35,00:06:41,Don't put it in for too long. That's the microwaves. Always the way with the microwave though.
00:06:41,00:06:46,"Start with 10 seconds. Build up to giving it an hour. Yeah. Take it out, stir it around."
00:06:46,00:06:51,Nice. Do you guys know that there's only one hotel in the UK that grows its own loofas?
00:06:52,00:06:58,"Really? Yeah, one hotel. Where? It's near Bath. It's near Bath. That's funny."
00:06:58,00:07:07,"A place called Ston, Eastern Park. Not only do they make their own loofas, they have an annual"
00:07:07,00:07:12,"event, the Loofah Harvest, where you can go to the hotel and see the loofas being harvested."
00:07:12,00:07:17,"And it's the end of October or the start of November every single year, so hopefully it won't be"
00:07:17,00:07:23,"affected by the current lockdown, fingers crossed, and the gardeners will take you down and advise you"
00:07:23,00:07:29,"on your own loofa cultivation, and then they'll give you a demonstration on how to de-skin your loofah,"
00:07:29,00:07:32,and then you get a two-cost lunch. I don't know if there's any loofas part of that.
00:07:32,00:07:39,"Both courses. And then you get a loofa demonstration, and at the end of the day you get to go back to"
00:07:39,00:07:45,the garden and pick your own loofa. Wow. What a day out that would be. That's amazing.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"Yeah. Hey, you know who would love that? So I was looking up"
00:07:48,00:07:53,"gourds and squashes, so gourd is basically generally used for the inedible ones and squash"
00:07:53,00:07:58,"are the ones that we eat. But the American Gourd Society, they began in 1937, and they are"
00:07:58,00:08:02,"big enthusiasts of all the kinds. And as having a look at other kinds of gourds, because the loofah"
00:08:02,00:08:09,"obviously great. Do you know about the bottle gourd? No. So it's basically it's long, and when you dry"
00:08:09,00:08:13,"it out, it kind of becomes hollow and it's got a long stem, which works like a handle, so you can"
00:08:13,00:08:18,"use it to carry water around. Oh, nice. Kind of useful. I was just thinking the word 'gourd'."
00:08:18,00:08:23,I think I first came across it in the Asterix books. Did he use to carry like magic potions in his
00:08:23,00:08:28,"garden stuff? Oh, that does look well. Yeah, because you definitely drink out of them like I"
00:08:28,00:08:33,"used them as mugs and stuff, wouldn't you? Well, Anna, you must have a nightmare with your 200,000"
00:08:33,00:08:40,full-jet mugs every year. My cobbards are full. Have you ever been to one of Anna's drinking parties
00:08:40,00:08:46,where we all drink tequila out of a gourd? All the jinx taste of courgett. It's actually not very pleasant.
00:08:46,00:08:52,"We're here for a gourd time, not for a long time. That could be the tagline."
00:08:52,00:08:58,"On other historical using of loofahs, it was a real craze in the end of the 19th century. So this"
00:08:58,00:09:02,is when people really picked up on the loofah as being handy. And it was because friction baths had
00:09:02,00:09:09,just become very popular. And so this was the idea that it began with the concept that
00:09:10,00:09:15,"showering or washing was bad for you. So for about 200 years, it was quite common not to wash much"
00:09:15,00:09:20,because people thought that getting hot opened up your pores and led in lots of little bad guys.
00:09:20,00:09:28,And then they decided that scrubbing with something really rough and sand papery. So women used to use
00:09:28,00:09:33,"mohair or flesh brushes. If you scrubbed and scoured your skin, that would get all the bad guys out."
00:09:33,00:09:37,"And then they discovered loofah, which was perfect for scraping out all these tiny little"
00:09:37,00:09:44,bad guys. The bad guys. I guess we now call them sort of pathogen or something. But there was this
00:09:44,00:09:51,this craze with friction bars. And it was invented by guy called Lewis Coon. And it was the friction
00:09:51,00:09:56,sits bath. And what you did was you sat in a bathtub. But the water was about 10 to 14 degrees centigrade.
00:09:56,00:10:04,"So cold, unpleasantly cold. And you rub your lower abdomen, hips and genitals very vigorously"
00:10:04,00:10:11,with a rough cloth or a loofah. And the nerve stimulation was thought to evacuate all the toxins.
00:10:11,00:10:16,Wow. And then you go straight to bed. I wonder if that's part of the loofah day out that James passed.
00:10:16,00:10:22,"I decided to go off the loofah day out of that part of it. The genitals stimulation,"
00:10:22,00:10:28,"you have to pay extra for that part. Some of the people are not people, actually the opposite of"
00:10:28,00:10:35,"people, animals. Some animals that have friction baths are sperm whales. And now sperm whales."
00:10:35,00:10:40,"People are animals. You're right. It's not the opposite at all, is it? Animals are not people though."
00:10:40,00:10:45,No. Well some animals are people. This is contentious guys. And for another day.
00:10:45,00:10:53,"Okay. So anyway, animals that have friction baths include sperm whales. And what they do is they"
00:10:53,00:10:58,get together and they exfoliate by rubbing against each other. So normally sperm whales are quite
00:10:58,00:11:03,solitary or they'll be in small pods of maybe 10 or 15. But every now and then about 70 of them
00:11:03,00:11:08,will come together and they'll all start rubbing against each other to get the bad guys off.
00:11:08,00:11:15,"Because they have bad guys who attach themselves to the skin like limpids and stuff like that,"
00:11:15,00:11:20,"parasites. And there's genuinely serves an actual purpose, doesn't it? So it's like temperature"
00:11:20,00:11:23,"regulation. If you're covered in algae, it's hard to regulate your temperature or you've got"
00:11:23,00:11:30,"proper parasites. Whereas for humans, it's kind of bizarre that we exfoliate or I obviously don't"
00:11:30,00:11:36,because I'm not a fool. But it's bizarre that exfoliating has become such an accepted thing.
00:11:36,00:11:40,"I mean, what is it? There's no scientific evidence to say it's doing anything useful."
00:11:40,00:11:45,"Find it kind of gets rid of those gross bumpy things on the back of our arms, which I'm kind of"
00:11:45,00:11:51,fond of. But that might also be personal to you. I think you need to see someone about those.
00:11:51,00:11:56,"But when I was reading about the different kinds of girls they've made, apparently a"
00:11:56,00:12:00,warty girl does quite a thing because it's like it's even more distinctive. So they like a warty
00:12:00,00:12:03,girl. They would want to it. I don't think I'm the kind of saying that Aralbo looks like a
00:12:03,00:12:09,"warty god. Well, actually, it sounds like it's in me here. You've been spending too much time"
00:12:09,00:12:19,"rolling around in the courgette patch. Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is N. My fact"
00:12:19,00:12:25,is that the man who invented Jramanji did so because he hated Monopoly. Wow. If only we could
00:12:25,00:12:31,"all kind of channel that hatred for Monopoly into some creators. I mean, we've all been there, right?"
00:12:31,00:12:37,"Yeah, he's awesome. So his name is Chris Van Alzberg. He is a children's author and illustrator."
00:12:37,00:12:42,"And he's got really interesting ways of how he gets ideas. So as well as he wrote Jramanji,"
00:12:42,00:12:46,"the original picture book, and he also wrote The Puller Express, which also turned into a big movie."
00:12:46,00:12:52,"And he said that when he was younger, he used to find it frustrating that if you were playing Cludo,"
00:12:52,00:12:56,"you couldn't actually interrogate Colonel Mustard. And if you're playing Monopoly, you didn't get any"
00:12:56,00:13:00,"money. You weren't actually rich at the end, even if you'd built lots of hotels and had all the"
00:13:00,00:13:05,"expensive properties. And then he also thought, well, what are things that I see a lot? So"
00:13:05,00:13:09,"everyone's seen footage of a Rhino Stampede, but they haven't seen a Rhino Stampede in a living room."
00:13:09,00:13:13,"And then he was like, ah, a jungle game that comes to life. That's what I'm going to make."
00:13:13,00:13:18,Okay. Yeah. That was a huge thing. But which game was he playing when he decided to do
00:13:18,00:13:23,"The Puller Express? I think that will be that train game, which I've forgotten the name of,"
00:13:23,00:13:28,"that goes through Europe. Oh, ticket to ride. Wow. And was he annoyed that at the end of"
00:13:28,00:13:34,"ticket to ride, you're not in but a pest? Like, this guy has very high demands of his"
00:13:34,00:13:37,"ball games, I would say. I think everyone else accepts the fundamental conceit that at the end"
00:13:37,00:13:44,"of Monopoly, you don't get 30 grand and the hilton. So yeah, it's, it's another interesting leap,"
00:13:44,00:13:49,"isn't it, that he went from Monopoly to Rhino's. He must have had a jungle ponchont running alongside"
00:13:49,00:13:55,"his hatred of Monopoly. Yeah. He does sound very cool. No, I love him. And his approach to,"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"sorry, so he shared a letter that a fan wrote to him. And this is a girl called Alexander. And she"
00:14:00,00:14:06,"said, ""Dear Mr Van Al's book, I love the books you write. I am glad your books are so weird because"
00:14:06,00:14:11,"I am very weird. I think you are weird, but great. I wish the volcano and flood would be in my room."""
00:14:11,00:14:17,"Okay. Wow. What a silly thing to wish for. Very, very troubled home life that we're not really"
00:14:17,00:14:22,"going to have time to get into properly, I think. My favourite origin story actually for a board game"
00:14:22,00:14:29,is there's the two men who invented trivial pursuit in 1979. And it's an incredibly boring story
00:14:29,00:14:32,"after you get to the bones of it. It's like the two businessmen who thought, ""Yeah, should we invent"
00:14:32,00:14:39,"trivial pursuit?"" So it came about, I think one of them said they were inspired to invent it when"
00:14:39,00:14:44,"they were playing Scrabble and some of the pieces were missing. So they couldn't play it anymore. Now,"
00:14:44,00:14:51,"if you think about it, if you have pieces missing in Scrabble, it doesn't matter. If the piece that's"
00:14:51,00:14:56,"missing is the board, then that's a problem. That's the crucial, yeah. Is the only absolutely crucial"
00:14:56,00:15:00,"piece. No, I think there are lots of different ways in which you lose pieces. So, for example, if you"
00:15:00,00:15:05,"lose all the vowels, that is going to be a tricky game of Scrabble to get through. And that would"
00:15:05,00:15:11,actually be a great prank to play on someone. Maybe it was the holder for the counters and they couldn't
00:15:11,00:15:16,"find a way to display them. Well, that's the other person seeing what they had. Must have been the holder."
00:15:16,00:15:20,That's very good. We found three different ways in which this origin story stacks up.
00:15:23,00:15:29,I like the origin of operation. Do you know that game? It's like it's a guy in a hospital and you have
00:15:29,00:15:33,"to pick out bits of his body with tweezers, right? And if you hit the sides, then it makes a buzz."
00:15:33,00:15:41,"Now, this was invented by a student in the 1960s. He was a design student and it was for his exam."
00:15:41,00:15:49,"But before that, Benjamin Franklin invented operation in the 1700s. What? He invented a game,"
00:15:49,00:15:55,which was basically the same. It was called treason. And it had a picture of King George II and you had
00:15:55,00:16:00,"to get a crown out of him. And if you touch the sides, then it would make a buzzing noise. So, Benjamin"
00:16:00,00:16:04,"Franklin invented operation. Isn't that amazing? That's incredible, James."
00:16:04,00:16:10,"If real life operations were anything like operation, then surgeons would open up their patients"
00:16:10,00:16:15,"and go, ""Oh, shit, there are no organs in here at all."" It's taken the organs. Is that what happens in"
00:16:15,00:16:20,"operation? Do you just lose the organs over time? Pretty amazing. Oh, okay. I've never, I've never"
00:16:20,00:16:25,"owned a set. Oh, that was a good time to get one, Andy. Yeah, that's true. I've only got four"
00:16:25,00:16:30,"board games, one of which I bought for an earlier episode of Fish, which was the cattle seam and trading"
00:16:30,00:16:36,"board game, great up to Elite Cow. Oh, wow. I know. And then one of the others is the QI board game,"
00:16:36,00:16:41,"one is Scrabble. I don't have a very good cover. Do you think they could turn the, you know,"
00:16:41,00:16:47,"how Jumanji is like kind of a board game, but then also a movie? Do you think they could turn the"
00:16:47,00:16:54,cattle seam and trading board game into a movie? Yes. I absolutely do. I think some bad guys
00:16:54,00:17:00,hold the world's cattle seam and stock to ransom. And the rock will have to be involved somehow.
00:17:00,00:17:05,"Because they did have a monopoly, the movie, didn't they? Oh, no, they're making. No, they're making"
00:17:05,00:17:10,"monopoly movie. I think they've tried before, but they're making a new one with Kevin Hart,"
00:17:10,00:17:14,who was in the new Jumanji movies. So I feel like he's going to absolutely conquer board game
00:17:14,00:17:19,"movie crossovers. Oh, well, it's going to be very, very long. That's the only thing we know about"
00:17:19,00:17:23,"the monopoly film, be 16 hours long. You know, they're about to ruin monopoly, or I think they might"
00:17:23,00:17:30,have ruined it already by inventing a new updated version where it's cashless. So they want to get
00:17:30,00:17:35,in tune with the modern man or woman. And so they've got a cashless monopoly where basically
00:17:35,00:17:41,Mr. Monopoly is the banker. So no player gets to be the banker anymore. Mr. Monopoly is a top
00:17:41,00:17:46,"hat, a big top hat who sits in the middle of the board and uses voice recognition technology"
00:17:46,00:17:50,"to know which player is talking to him. And a player will say, I want to buy Park Lane,"
00:17:50,00:17:55,and then he'll just deduct that amount from your amount. That's true. And so it takes away the joy
00:17:55,00:17:58,"of cheating as the banker, which is the only reason anyone plays monopoly in the first place."
00:17:58,00:18:02,"Exactly. The whole point is to cheat. Yeah. Well, Anna, I know which version you should get,"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"because they've also made monopoly, the cheeto's edition, where a part of the game is to try and"
00:18:06,00:18:11,"steal from the bank lie about your dice rolls. And it comes with a set of handcuffs, like I talk"
00:18:11,00:18:16,"in a handcuffs. Great. They're really embracing the cheating. But there's tons of them, like,"
00:18:16,00:18:21,novelty monopoly. I had a look at a big list of them. And just the ones beginning with A include
00:18:21,00:18:26,"Abba monopoly, Alton Towers monopoly, Alice in Wonderland, Alpaca monopoly. That's an unofficial"
00:18:26,00:18:34,"one, an Aberdeen monopoly. There are so many, if you look up monopoly, and if you're attempting"
00:18:34,00:18:40,"to find facts about it, then half the news results are different places, you know,"
00:18:40,00:18:45,"Kingston on Thames is getting its own monopoly set. And I do wonder what the advantage of this is,"
00:18:45,00:18:49,"or whether they franchise it, or whether, because it seems like no one, you know, I used to live"
00:18:49,00:18:54,"quite near Kingston, I didn't want to Kingston monopoly set. Well, I think they're all pandering"
00:18:54,00:19:00,"to this one guy who has the world record, most number of monopoly sets. Okay, he's called Neil Scalen,"
00:19:00,00:19:06,and he has the Guinness world record. And how many monopoly sets do you think he owns? Completely
00:19:06,00:19:12,good. Each one is completely different. 312. I think there's over a thousand novelty ones. I'm
00:19:12,00:19:18,"going to go a thousand. A thousand number one. And each one has a 400. He has, as of the 25th of"
00:19:18,00:19:26,"January 2019. So a while ago, he has 2,249 different monopoly sets. And if you go into the amazing website"
00:19:26,00:19:33,"worldofmonopoly.com, you can see a list of all the ones that he has. But that's not a cheap game,"
00:19:33,00:19:40,"that's a lot of money. He almost could have like real monopoly. I know. And also, Anna, you and I"
00:19:40,00:19:46,"have a copy of an extremely random monopoly set, don't we? We do the University of Kent, right?"
00:19:46,00:19:53,"Yeah, and this guy also has that no way. Yeah, that's so good. Christmas in this guy's household"
00:19:53,00:19:57,"must be hell. I was so sure we would have loved that he didn't have, but that is amazing."
00:19:57,00:20:02,"Jesus Christ. I wondered what his like, like the most sought out after it, the most the"
00:20:02,00:20:05,rarest like special monopolies. Because I read about one they made for Wall Street where it's like
00:20:05,00:20:10,"made of like solid gold pieces, but I think it's a bit overkill. But I wonder if there's like a,"
00:20:10,00:20:14,"I don't know, what's a, like from a tiny village somewhere who's just got their own one and"
00:20:14,00:20:19,selling it in the post office. I wonder what's the hardest to get? I went on to eBay and I looked for
00:20:19,00:20:27,the most expensive monopoly set at the moment. And it was a Bulgarian monopoly. I guess for some reason
00:20:27,00:20:32,"there weren't many made or something like that, but yeah, it was quite a few, it was about 700 pounds"
00:20:32,00:20:38,"or something for a Bulgarian monopoly. And so you got it on the queue. I just, I don't want Neil"
00:20:38,00:20:45,"Scallon to have it. I just stop him. I wonder if Chris Van Alesborg ever, like, makes up with"
00:20:45,00:20:50,"monopoly. They could make a German G monopoly. That would be quite fun. Oh, then must be one. I don't"
00:20:50,00:20:55,"think the world, I don't think the world needs more editions of monopoly. I have to say it's so"
00:20:55,00:21:01,interesting how people who play ball games in any serious way all hate monopoly so much.
00:21:01,00:21:06,So the Guardian asked people for their least favourite ball games for a feature they were writing.
00:21:06,00:21:12,"And one of the responses just said, monopoly is awful because of the vice-like grip it has over how"
00:21:12,00:21:16,the British public perceived ball games. I'm going to a ball game night at a local comic shop this
00:21:16,00:21:21,"evening. Nobody will be playing monopoly. And if it was suggested, then I would assume it was a sick"
00:21:21,00:21:29,joke of some kind. They had in 2016 House Pro now makes monopoly announce they were operating a
00:21:29,00:21:34,special hotline on Christmas day where people who had been traumatised by their monopoly-based
00:21:34,00:21:40,experiences could call. It actually ran from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day and I just feel so devastatingly
00:21:40,00:21:47,"sorry for whatever intern was asked to perform that role. Guy Hasbro, it wasn't a recorded message,"
00:21:47,00:21:52,"they said, we'll have experts on hand with the official rule books to instantly settle any disputes"
00:21:52,00:21:57,"and advise on how to resolve common complaints. God, okay, so it's Christmas day. You're in"
00:21:57,00:22:04,"intern, you have to work and you're sat by the phone. Would you rather no one called you or someone"
00:22:04,00:22:09,"called you to talk to you about monopoly? Oh God, it's Sophie's choice, isn't it? I'd rather go directly"
00:22:09,00:22:17,to jail to be honest with you. I was reading some monopoly strategy and I'm sure there was a
00:22:17,00:22:21,"basically an article in the New York magazine with the headline, you don't hate monopoly, you just"
00:22:21,00:22:25,suck at it and said the reason we hate it is we can't play it properly. But if everyone can play
00:22:25,00:22:30,it properly then we all suck at it again because there are only so many key skills and tricks
00:22:30,00:22:34,you can get. But the main things they say are if you're after the oranges it's good to stay in jail
00:22:34,00:22:39,because there's more chance of rolling a double and completing your set. When there are not so many
00:22:39,00:22:43,properties available it's good to sit in jail because then you don't have to pay any rent and they
00:22:43,00:22:47,"were very cross about the, some people play a version where you collect the money from fines if"
00:22:47,00:22:51,you land on free parking and they are very angry about that because apparently it messes with the
00:22:51,00:22:56,game and makes it more random. Oh it's the only joy of monopoly is going to pick up that money and I
00:22:56,00:23:01,hate the people who won't hate it. Well you hate the people who use the actual rules of monopoly on it.
00:23:01,00:23:11,I hate them. You need that hot life. I read an article with the 2015 UK Championship winner Natalie
00:23:11,00:23:18,"Fitzsimmons and she gave her tips of how to win monopoly and this is, I mean I think this is terrible"
00:23:18,00:23:25,what she does. So she basically goes and buys all of the properties she can and then mortgages them all
00:23:25,00:23:30,and so she gets the money back but she doesn't collect any rent but it doesn't matter because the rent
00:23:30,00:23:35,is so small and then she collects one group and then puts four houses on each of those groups. She
00:23:35,00:23:41,doesn't put a hotel on there or anything like that and then she tries to get into jail for as long
00:23:41,00:23:51,as possible. And apparently this is the best technique to win the game. Wow. It's amazing. And another
00:23:51,00:23:57,thing she says is sometimes you can get instead of mortgaging them all you get a few different groups
00:23:57,00:24:02,and then you always put four houses on each so there's not enough houses left for anyone else to build
00:24:02,00:24:09,houses. Well you just run out the pieces of the game. Yeah there's not enough houses in the box
00:24:09,00:24:13,for everyone to put four houses on each thing. So if you put four and all yours it stops anyone
00:24:13,00:24:18,else from being able to do it. That can't be in the rules. It is. You run out of houses. Oh my
00:24:18,00:24:23,it is the rules. It's the rules. So when we were younger we used to just put like a thimble instead
00:24:23,00:24:29,of a house but that we were doing it wrong. Oh my god. Wow. That's amazing. I suppose that's
00:24:29,00:24:33,realistic. Yeah. If you run out of building materials you can't replace them with the thimble.
00:24:33,00:24:38,That's true. We've actually never mentioned it on this podcast although I think we have one QI
00:24:38,00:24:44,the origin story of monopoly. So basically there's this guy Charles Darrow and if you go on the
00:24:44,00:24:48,monopoly website actually if you look at find the history which I think they've buried
00:24:48,00:24:55,deeper than it used to be. There's Charles Darrow who dreamed up monopoly in the 1930s and this
00:24:55,00:24:59,guy Darrow went around saying he'd just come up with it. In one interview someone said you know
00:24:59,00:25:03,where did it come from and he had no origin story he just said it was like magic it just came to
00:25:03,00:25:11,me. So in fact what happened and this was only really uncovered in the 1970s was that there was a woman
00:25:11,00:25:18,about 30 years early in 1903 called Elizabeth McGee and she sounded so awesome she was very unusual
00:25:18,00:25:23,a proper self-made woman who was independently made living she was a secretary she wrote poetry
00:25:23,00:25:29,and short stories she did stand up comedy. She once came second in a beauty contest.
00:25:33,00:25:37,And you wouldn't have thought that someone so fun would invent monopoly but she did she called it
00:25:37,00:25:44,the landlord's game and the whole point of it at the time was that it exposed the folly of capitalism
00:25:44,00:25:49,so there were two sets of rules there was the anti-monopolis rule where everyone is rewarded for the
00:25:49,00:25:53,wealth that they create and then there was the monopoly rule where you build up monopolies and
00:25:53,00:25:57,crush your opponents and she didn't quite mean for humanity to fully embrace the second one
00:25:57,00:26:02,and decide that was the one we wanted to play but she played it and she showed it to her friends and
00:26:02,00:26:06,it caught on and eventually you know quite a few people played it in a certain part of the state
00:26:06,00:26:12,and it reached Charles Darrow through a friend and he sort of like slightly tweaked it and
00:26:12,00:26:20,published it claimed the patent sorted he's a hero wow that's terrible he needs to go straight to jail
00:26:20,00:26:26,we're going to have to move on in second I just have one thing I went off on a bit of a tangent here
00:26:26,00:26:31,because it was about jumanji and I was and this what this guy didn't like about monopoly was a fact you couldn't go
00:26:31,00:26:36,into the game you know and experience it so I was looking up by the kind of going into immersive
00:26:36,00:26:43,reality experiences and I just came across this short story that I read and it's called pigmalion
00:26:43,00:26:51,spectacles from 1935 and I think it's the earliest reference to virtual reality sort of 3D amazing
00:26:51,00:26:57,experience glasses so it's by this guy called Stanley Weinbaum and it starts out with a man who's
00:26:57,00:27:03,a bit drunk at a party and stumbles out to the street meets a professor who says wouldn't you love to
00:27:03,00:27:08,see a film that was really realistic caught a bear in mind this is the 1930s so the guy was like yeah
00:27:08,00:27:13,but that could never exist and he said what if I give you these glasses and this chap puts on the
00:27:13,00:27:21,glasses and suddenly he can see here feel taste and smell everything and he has this incredible
00:27:21,00:27:25,adventure and it's really really exciting and then he takes the glasses off and he's like fuck that
00:27:25,00:27:30,was magic and then the professor says it's not actually I just dip these glasses in a chemical
00:27:30,00:27:34,electrical solution which did all the audio input and the woman you fell in love with is actually
00:27:34,00:27:40,my niece she's an actress like in one of these immersive reality things okay but what I wanted to
00:27:40,00:27:46,tell you was um he said so the guy was like how did you make all the trees seem so real you know
00:27:46,00:27:52,it was like jamanji he was in a forest and he said oh the trees they are simply now what do you
00:27:52,00:28:03,think they were uh toilet brushes incorrect and do you might know moss it was boss no way
00:28:03,00:28:08,our club moss is enlarged by a lens now I don't know if we have mentioned openly on the podcast
00:28:08,00:28:14,before but Andy's been insisting for years that club moss looks exactly like trees and now this is
00:28:14,00:28:27,vindication vindication okay it's time for fact number three and that is James okay my fat
00:28:27,00:28:33,this week is that there is a man in Brazil who nobody is allowed to go within five miles of
00:28:33,00:28:40,and is this a he hasn't showered for a long time it's not a social isolation well it is a social
00:28:40,00:28:47,isolation thing but not a um and actually it is on government advice as well so it's kind of similar
00:28:47,00:28:53,to what's happening but he is the last survivor of an uncontacted tribe he lives in the Amazon
00:28:53,00:28:59,rainforest and basically what happened in Brazil for a long time is these people who are living in
00:28:59,00:29:06,the rainforests they would try and contact them and try and assimilate them into modern life
00:29:06,00:29:11,and obviously um or maybe not obviously but I think we now know that that is not a particularly good
00:29:11,00:29:15,idea because basically you're bringing pathogens over there you you're kind of destroying the
00:29:15,00:29:20,ways of life they lose their languages they lose their culture stuff like that and so the current
00:29:20,00:29:27,idea is a thing called policy of no contact where you just let people live their lives you don't have
00:29:27,00:29:31,to get in touch with them you don't have to give them stuff if they want to come to you they will
00:29:31,00:29:35,come to you if they need stuff they'll come to you and get it but you need to leave them on their
00:29:35,00:29:41,own and so there is this one guy who's living on his own it seems he's the last member of the tribe
00:29:41,00:29:48,and in 2007 Brazil declared a 31 square mile area around him to be completely off limits for anyone
00:29:48,00:29:54,else so no one else is allowed to go there and it was later expanded by 11.5 square miles so
00:29:54,00:30:00,"about 3,000 hectares and now you are definitely not allowed to go anywhere in that area because you'll"
00:30:00,00:30:06,be disturbing his way of life wow yeah so cool did the government have to keep proving that he
00:30:06,00:30:13,exists that's a good point actually I think the last time they saw him was a few years ago but I think
00:30:13,00:30:17,they do have ethnologists who go there every now and then just checking up to see to see what's
00:30:17,00:30:22,happening because he builds lots of different huts from place to place and goes from one place to
00:30:22,00:30:29,another he makes traps for animals which he then eats and he also makes markings on trees which
00:30:29,00:30:35,they think maybe some kind of spiritual thing so he's constantly using his environment for various
00:30:35,00:30:40,things and so you can see when he's moving around and what he's doing doesn't he also dig quite
00:30:40,00:30:43,deep holes and people are because obviously nobody can ask him they're not quite sure whether that's
00:30:43,00:30:49,for him as shelter whether it's a trap for animals whether it's something spiritual it's quite mysterious
00:30:49,00:30:54,yeah so weird is that where they call him the man of the whole yeah we haven't said that he's
00:30:54,00:30:58,called the man of the whole actually but that's that is one of the things they call him yeah
00:30:58,00:31:04,James if this guy moves does the zone of exclusion move with him so could he move to the center of
00:31:04,00:31:11,the genera and everyone would have to go you are absolutely right this is one from the metal floor
00:31:11,00:31:16,with the way that I've worded by fact no one is allowed to go within five miles of him if he stands
00:31:16,00:31:23,in the middle of his range oh yeah I mean so if he goes to right to the edge of the area which
00:31:23,00:31:27,has been given to him then actually you could stand right next to him you could stand within two
00:31:27,00:31:32,metres of him if he happens to be standing at the edge of that area okay otherwise it would be
00:31:32,00:31:38,tragic if he ever tried to make contact people just sprinting away screaming yeah but I guess that's
00:31:38,00:31:42,nice because then if he wants to greet people and meet someone he can go to the end and there are
00:31:42,00:31:47,people there exactly that yeah because I was I was reading about the Centre Lee's Islanders
00:31:47,00:31:52,and they are basically hardly anyone has had contact with them there was a group of anthropologists
00:31:52,00:31:56,who made two trips to try and make contact and the one way they managed to do it was they went
00:31:56,00:32:00,in their boat and they floated coconuts over to the island and the islanders don't have coconuts so
00:32:00,00:32:05,they took them and that was sort of like a beginning of a barter system and then when they went back
00:32:05,00:32:10,they were not quite so keen the next time so they sort of trying to make contact if people want to
00:32:10,00:32:15,make it but not to impose yourself yeah especially you don't want to with the Centre Lee's because they're
00:32:15,00:32:22,famously they're not I wouldn't say unfriendly I'd say quite murderous of strangers I read one
00:32:22,00:32:27,thing about those guys that if you go onto their island and they don't want you to be there the
00:32:27,00:32:33,first thing they'll do is turn their back on you and go down on their haunches and pretend to defecate
00:32:33,00:32:38,and that is kind of they're putting two fingers up saying fuck off get out fire island kind of thing
00:32:38,00:32:44,and then if you don't pay he to that then they'll start firing arrows at you and and try and kill you
00:32:44,00:32:48,that's really interesting but can you imagine the slight shame of the anthropologists who went
00:32:48,00:32:51,all the way there I've been like we're going to do it we found a way to make contact and then they say
00:32:51,00:32:56,and what happens they buried their bombs and pretended to defecate you can't really use us you can't
00:32:56,00:33:02,give a big lecture to a based on moaning I don't think do you know if you um google map north
00:33:02,00:33:07,Sentinel island which is where they live uh it's you can zoom right in and you will see there's
00:33:07,00:33:15,actually a bar there so yeah uh going to go it's a curry house and bar it's got a series of five
00:33:15,00:33:21,star reviews and uh at the moment there is a sign underneath it that says hours may be affected
00:33:21,00:33:26,by covid-19 which is understandable um but so the reviews include a good getaway especially given
00:33:26,00:33:32,current events did a good but interrupted by arrows and death threats from wages uh so what is
00:33:32,00:33:37,it is a joke guys it's a google joke it was actually uh someone sent it to me a guy called Harry
00:33:37,00:33:43,Johnston wrote in a fan of the podcast saying have you seen this about a year ago wow wow that's a
00:33:43,00:33:50,curry house and bar yeah so give it a visit don't um I also went on google maps for this area where
00:33:50,00:33:57,this guy is living the Brazilian guy um and it's an area called valet do havari a lot of people call it
00:33:57,00:34:02,like one of the last unexplored areas of the world but actually of course lots of people live there
00:34:02,00:34:06,because you have lots of amazonian tribes who live there but if you go on google maps and you
00:34:06,00:34:12,search for it it's basically just a gray square and then you can zoom out and zoom out and zoom out
00:34:12,00:34:16,and zoom out and it's still just a gray square with like a river going through it and there's
00:34:16,00:34:22,literally nothing and you can zoom out to about the size of like England and Wales and you can still
00:34:22,00:34:28,not see any towns or anything it's just a gray square it's absolutely amazing but in this area
00:34:28,00:34:34,there is a mountain called uh pico de neblina and this is the highest mountain in Brazil
00:34:34,00:34:42,and no one knew it existed until the 1950s wow that is how isolated this is the tallest mountain in
00:34:42,00:34:48,the whole country is there and no one knew it was there it's really good that's very cool and in theory
00:34:48,00:34:52,what happened is someone was flying over it in an aeroplane and thought there's a big mountain
00:34:52,00:34:56,there where it's not supposed to be and they went maybe someone could check this out and then
00:34:56,00:35:02,they measured it and it was way taller than anywhere else that's awesome um I was having a look at
00:35:02,00:35:07,other remote places places that hard to get to and do you know there's a section of america where
00:35:07,00:35:13,they still receive their post by mule it's part of the official us postal service um there is an
00:35:13,00:35:18,Indian reservation at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and so it's hard to get helicopters down there
00:35:18,00:35:22,and if it's windy they can't fly at all but the mules go whatever the weather every day
00:35:22,00:35:27,so they go by car by road to the edge of the Grand Canyon and then it is a three-hour trip down by
00:35:27,00:35:33,mule uh down to the bottom it's a post he called Charlie Chamberlain it's his job and he they basically
00:35:33,00:35:36,anything you can put a stamp on they will take they take food they take supplies they take post
00:35:36,00:35:41,and they have got a jug that if you want the express service they just let one of the mules
00:35:41,00:35:47,go free and run to the bottom i would have thought the express service would be throwing a mule
00:35:47,00:35:52,off the edge of the Grand Canyon it's a highly trained special mules anti that's a mule
00:35:52,00:36:02,I was looking up the other loneliest people in the world people like this so um you're there's one
00:36:02,00:36:08,person who missed Neil Armstrong saying this is one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
00:36:08,00:36:14,guess what it was uh Michael Collins it was Michael Collins Michael Collins was on the other side
00:36:14,00:36:20,of the moon and could not get that line so so many other people in the world would have had access
00:36:20,00:36:27,to that and people keep asking Michael Collins who's still alive um about his isolation because
00:36:27,00:36:35,for 76 hours when Armstrong and Aldrin were on the moon Collins was orbiting and for 48 minutes
00:36:35,00:36:39,every two hours he was on the far side of the moon so he was completely out of contact with everybody
00:36:39,00:36:44,and you know there was there was only one person on that side of the moon out of three billion people
00:36:44,00:36:51,on the other side of the moon um and he keeps being uh but he's so he's now enraged anytime
00:36:51,00:36:58,anyone asks him so he says um he keeps being asked mr. Collins weren't you the loneliest man in the
00:36:58,00:37:02,whole lonely history of this lonely planet by your lonely self behind the lonely moon and this
00:37:02,00:37:08,lonely orbit weren't it terribly lonely and he says he was really happy he had nobody
00:37:08,00:37:13,admission control weren't yak and away in his ear he was absolutely delighted out there yeah sounds
00:37:13,00:37:20,like that journalist could have done with the sorceress yeah I think the person who's got the Guinness
00:37:20,00:37:25,world record for the most isolated person is the other guy I can't I can't remember this is just
00:37:25,00:37:29,from memory but is the other person Al Warden Alam Warden yeah who also went around the back of the
00:37:29,00:37:34,moon didn't really why does he get the record I think he was there for longer okay while they were
00:37:34,00:37:39,exploring cool it was three days it's kind of a it's kind of a kind of a burn on him and his social
00:37:39,00:37:44,life to give him again a world record for loneliest dude ever do you not think it's quite a good lie
00:37:44,00:37:51,in a bar is go hi I'm I'm the world's loneliest man what is that a pickup line do you think it's a bit
00:37:51,00:38:02,needy it's a bit intense as an ice break yeah I was reading about life in the Amazon did you know
00:38:02,00:38:09,that there are no bridges across the Amazon river the whole river no it's the longest I've
00:38:09,00:38:13,the longest all the second longest river in the world depending on how you measure it and there's
00:38:13,00:38:20,no bridges across a whole thing and do you know why that is it's because it's massive what is that
00:38:20,00:38:24,oh you mean it's a massive river because it's wide it's right because it's wide yeah yeah it's not
00:38:24,00:38:29,always wide it's wide that it's mouth but it's narrower at its source isn't it yeah obviously it's
00:38:29,00:38:35,narrower in the source I know that I'm just saying I don't you know it's most of it seems pretty
00:38:35,00:38:40,big to me well I guess you're kind of half right hang on I wish surely we can work this out
00:38:41,00:38:49,is it because the bits where it's narrow enough to put a bridge across it's protected or sacred
00:38:49,00:38:54,territory no not really it's more that in the bits where it's narrow enough to put a bridge across
00:38:54,00:39:00,no one lives there so it's basically you know at the mouth of the river there are few cities and
00:39:00,00:39:06,really it's too wide there to to put bridges across really it's kind of super wide
00:39:07,00:39:12,but in where it gets bit narrower no one lives there and there's a few kind of boat crossings
00:39:12,00:39:17,and stuff like that but really there's no roads so why would you need a bridge Jesus I can't
00:39:17,00:39:22,believe there's none in between zone yeah you'd think so wouldn't you that's an amazing fact yeah
00:39:22,00:39:28,isn't it cool yeah do you know that there's a bridge over the Atlantic is this another Boris Johnson
00:39:28,00:39:34,fantasy yeah there is over the whole Atlantic no go on so I was on holiday on the west coast of
00:39:34,00:39:39,Scotland and we will go and that was one of the local attractions so it's a it's a stream that comes
00:39:39,00:39:43,off the Atlantic so they claim it as the bridge over the Atlantic's it's the same bit and I thought
00:39:43,00:39:49,that was amazing so my head it's from Cornwall to New York what do what do you mean it as a stream
00:39:49,00:39:52,it's a bit of water that comes off the I can't remember the details I didn't get actually get to
00:39:52,00:39:56,visit it so I sat there did not get the information guide they claim it as the bridge in the Atlantic
00:39:56,00:40:01,what do you do do you go and look at it or do you yeah and you can walk across it right yeah well
00:40:01,00:40:07,if I'd gone I could answer all these questions so you know I think Anne's parents took her on holiday
00:40:07,00:40:11,and told her they'd been to America when in fact they had been to the small stream on the west coast
00:40:11,00:40:17,of Scotland but she walked across the bridge no we didn't we didn't get to go Anna this is my dream
00:40:17,00:40:24,you didn't even get to go we went near the bridge over the Atlantic amazing one more thing about
00:40:24,00:40:31,living in the Amazon one issue is they have piranhas but what do you think would happen if you
00:40:31,00:40:37,actually tried to swim with piranhas I know go on Anna you got your hand up if you fall in a river
00:40:37,00:40:40,that's full of piranha they'll strip off your skin like your skin and banana there's no time
00:40:40,00:40:44,for screaming there's no time for groans in 45 seconds you're nothing but bones that was an
00:40:44,00:40:48,amazing bit of improv thank you very much what's that for I just happen to know the answer to your
00:40:48,00:40:55,question what what is it from that it is a random poem from my childhood and I'm sorry scientifically
00:40:55,00:41:00,accurate what really happens I'm really sorry for whoever wrote that poem but that's not true
00:41:00,00:41:06,oh god piranhas they're kind of scared of big animals they don't really want to go near you if you
00:41:06,00:41:10,fall in the water and you don't bother them they'll just hide away and they don't want to go anywhere
00:41:10,00:41:16,near you now if they're in the dry season whether not getting any food or if they're in the breeding
00:41:16,00:41:20,season then you might have a bit more problem but really they're more like vultures they're more like
00:41:20,00:41:25,scavengers so if a bit of dead meat goes in there they'll go after it but if a human goes in there
00:41:25,00:41:29,they'll think it might be something trying to attack them and they'll just hide away oh really
00:41:29,00:41:35,so most of the time you'll be completely safe if you fall in the piranha pool and another kind of
00:41:35,00:41:41,type of piranha that definitely won't kill you is the vegetarian piranha which is a thing that
00:41:41,00:41:47,exists there is a species of piranha that is a vegetarian and they just eat seeds and fruit
00:41:47,00:41:53,and stuff that falls into the water but those those those guys they seem innocuous but they can
00:41:53,00:42:05,strip a courgette right down in 45 seconds there is a hermit in Scotland just while we're on
00:42:05,00:42:10,the subject of lonely people okay and he's obviously he's playing amateur league hermitine if he's
00:42:10,00:42:15,in Scotland it's supposed to in the middle of completely nowhere but he he's quite elderly he's
00:42:15,00:42:23,called Ken Smith and he was injured this year by a log pile falling on him but he was rescued
00:42:23,00:42:31,via Texas so he has an emergency beacon on him and he can press a button and it flags up
00:42:31,00:42:38,with an American satellite and it goes to a command post in Texas saying the hermit in Scotland has
00:42:38,00:42:46,had a mishap they contact the coast guard in Scotland and they say one of your hermitines is injured
00:42:46,00:42:49,and then they have to send out a team to go and chuck them but they just go over that bridge of
00:42:49,00:42:59,the Atlantic don't they to go that's why they built it yeah but the amazing thing is that is the
00:42:59,00:43:05,second time it's happened in two years he's been rescued from the consummation what what does he
00:43:05,00:43:10,keep doing is he very clumsy he's got a wood pile and I guess it's improperly stacked because it
00:43:10,00:43:16,keeps falling on him hey he's doing that all by himself is there's no one to help him build it safely
00:43:16,00:43:22,I guess no true it's like a real you know how jamangia is a real life board game this is like the real
00:43:22,00:43:32,life jenga that he's living okay it's time for the final factor the show and that is my fact my
00:43:32,00:43:39,fact is that in 19th century Osaka flat residents owned the rights to their own urine but the
00:43:39,00:43:48,rights of their poo belong to their landlord so yeah and tendency agreements must have looked
00:43:48,00:43:56,absolutely awesome yeah much messier so this was a great article on a on dot com which I will
00:43:56,00:44:01,try and put up on my Twitter and it's all about the relationships between humans and human
00:44:01,00:44:06,excretions basically and how it's been used throughout history and the the kind of commercial
00:44:06,00:44:12,arrangements that we've made over it and in 18th and 19th century Japan and particularly in
00:44:12,00:44:19,the city of Osaka there were complicated arrangements because feces were used for fertilizer
00:44:19,00:44:25,and if you lived in an apartment building the rights to your feces belong to the buildings owner who
00:44:25,00:44:32,would have arrangements in place to sell that and it would be loaded onto ships and taken away
00:44:32,00:44:39,but you owned your own we that was something you had so feces were valuable because they would help
00:44:39,00:44:46,to grow crops so it would affect your rent if there were lots of people living in your flat then
00:44:46,00:44:51,you would produce lots of poo for your landlord to sell and your rent would be slightly lower as a
00:44:51,00:44:56,result whereas if you're single occupancy you'd pay slightly more not just because you got your own
00:44:56,00:45:01,flat but also because you weren't producing enough of the the brown gold and could you say to your
00:45:01,00:45:07,landlord if you're negotiating you know I eat a lot of curry I have quite extravagant bowel movements
00:45:07,00:45:15,honestly you'll be getting triple the average for me so I don't think so. So I was talking to a
00:45:15,00:45:23,friend of mine in Tokyo called John Perry he is a writer of quiz books and pretty much my go-to
00:45:23,00:45:30,experts on Japanese history and he said that what you say is true but it's very slightly different
00:45:30,00:45:35,in that it's not the landlords who had the rights to your poo it was like the managing agents
00:45:35,00:45:39,because the landlords they would live miles and miles and miles away and would have nothing to do
00:45:39,00:45:43,this they would own your house but they would really not be involved in your day-stay life
00:45:43,00:45:50,and what would happen is you'd have these people who were called Uya and they would be slightly
00:45:50,00:45:55,higher than the tenants in importance but not much higher but they had a full-time job where it was
00:45:55,00:46:00,like looking after the house collecting the rent doing the repairs settling disputes stuff like that
00:46:00,00:46:03,and they would be able to read and write whereas the tenants might not be able to read or write
00:46:03,00:46:09,and they would take the poo and they would sell it and they would get the money but the money was
00:46:09,00:46:15,kind of expected to be used it would pay their wages but it was also used for all the tenants as well
00:46:15,00:46:21,so they would buy rice cakes for new year out of the money from the poo and so it would go it would
00:46:21,00:46:28,all go back into the community all the poo money it's not cool and they're called Uya which sounds
00:46:28,00:46:33,like the noise they would make as they're collecting your poo you'd walk into someone's bathroom go
00:46:33,00:46:39,Uya that is that's a bad one it sounds like the noise you make while you're making the poo doesn't it?
00:46:39,00:46:45,it does and you were saying about like if you've had a curry you would tell people or something
00:46:45,00:46:53,honey yes well it's not what I was saying yeah it's not what you were saying but the the value of your
00:46:53,00:46:58,night soil which is what they called it depended on how rich you were so if you were rich you had a
00:46:58,00:47:03,really good diet and it meant that your poo was better as a fertilizer so you'd be able to sell it
00:47:03,00:47:08,for more so it's kind of a monopoly thing whereas the rich get richer do you know what I mean yeah
00:47:08,00:47:13,but you know in a kind of poo sense because they're if their poo is literally richer
00:47:13,00:47:20,and each but this is not James a version of monopoly I would like to play I don't think I need to play
00:47:20,00:47:25,19th century feudal Japan monopoly look there are two thousand five hundred different types of
00:47:25,00:47:29,monopoly I haven't looked through the whole list for all I know there is a poo monopoly
00:47:29,00:47:36,it would be called monopoly I'm sorry I just needed to say that it's good that you got it out
00:47:36,00:47:48,yeah thank you in 1724 in osuka there was a fight that broke out over the collection rights to poo
00:47:48,00:47:57,so there were two groups from the villages of Yamazaki and Takasuki and they had the rights to
00:47:57,00:48:04,buy the poo from the the managing agents and then they would give them to the farmers but they
00:48:04,00:48:10,kind of fought against each other and it turned into a massive riot in the city really a lot of
00:48:10,00:48:15,kind of shits laying yes there was a lot of that going on and it was got so valuable people would
00:48:15,00:48:20,steal it so people would just in the dead of night come into your apartment and steal all your poo
00:48:20,00:48:27,I mean it sort of it depends on the scale of the crime doesn't it whether it's worth it for you
00:48:27,00:48:32,because if you just go into I just wonder about someone walking into their living room in the
00:48:32,00:48:38,morning after a night's sleep and looking at the the third cabinet and thinking oh my god we've been
00:48:38,00:48:45,robbed was it stealing large consignment so I wonder that probably makes more sense than individual
00:48:45,00:48:51,burglaries yeah I don't think they would just take a single stool from each house out there used
00:48:51,00:48:56,to be quite a harsh penalties in Japan for it didn't there because it you know it was lucrative
00:48:56,00:49:03,and we should say this continued for hundreds of years and still up until the 1980s people will go
00:49:03,00:49:07,around to people's houses in Japan and in lots of the east actually so in China it was a huge thing
00:49:07,00:49:12,as well but in Japan in the 1980s there were vacuum trucks that would drive around to your house
00:49:12,00:49:18,and you plug them into your sewage tank I guess and they suck the poo out and then it's gone and it's
00:49:18,00:49:26,sold but yeah China as well was used feces human feces to enrich their soil for many hundreds of
00:49:26,00:49:31,years and it was crucial so a lot of people think that it was part of the reason that Chinese agriculture
00:49:31,00:49:36,did really well in a time when a lot of western countries didn't and there was a soil scientist I
00:49:36,00:49:42,think this is a new article Andy that you sent us a soil scientist in 1911 called FH King who
00:49:42,00:49:48,estimated that over 180 million tons of human manure was collected annually in the far east to
00:49:48,00:49:55,enrich the soil and now that equates to 1.2 kilos of poo per person per day which is quite a
00:49:55,00:50:02,lot so we do wonder if he overestimated slightly even if you're efficiently collecting it from every
00:50:02,00:50:09,single person that's it's a lot it's a lot you know earlier I mentioned the the bricks that you can
00:50:09,00:50:15,make out of loufers yeah there's another way of making bricks out of human urine so this is another
00:50:15,00:50:23,as they call it biobrick that you can produce and it's urine and living bacteria so you get urine
00:50:23,00:50:27,you get sand you get bacteria you put it all in a brick-shaped mold and there is a chemical reaction
00:50:27,00:50:33,which ensues and that gradually solidifies the brick kind of like baking a cake kind of like baking
00:50:33,00:50:38,kind of kind of I don't fancy your chances on the great pictures bake off next year and for my show
00:50:38,00:50:48,stopper I've made a piss brick but the really good thing about this is that astronauts might one day
00:50:48,00:50:55,be able to piss their own moon bases that's how that's basically what you could do you go you take
00:50:55,00:51:01,a load of the molds up there and you slowly you know we your own home into existence look so that
00:51:01,00:51:05,means as the food on the space station is depleted the space station is being built around you presumably
00:51:05,00:51:12,yes exactly yeah but you only get food or shelter right that's true yeah you're not very far
00:51:12,00:51:21,up Maslow's pyramid of needs they do call it cake actually in like the biosolids that are used
00:51:21,00:51:26,in all of our farming less we forget so sewage is picked up and it's treated and then it's often
00:51:26,00:51:32,used as fertilizer but when they talk about the digest dates of basically poo and other types of
00:51:32,00:51:38,matter like that they do refer to it as cake and it comes in these cake shaped and cake textured
00:51:38,00:51:43,particles that um you know you order through a farmer so for the great British bake off you could say
00:51:43,00:51:48,I'm going to be making a cake today yeah you could get away with it I think you would be voted down
00:51:48,00:51:54,but you could call it a urinal cake and that has a that's like a triple meaning of the word cake
00:51:54,00:51:59,they're always making cakes out there in the shape of weird things yeah yeah so you could make
00:51:59,00:52:04,it could be in the shape of the urinal cake but it could be made of biosolids so it's almost
00:52:04,00:52:09,it's like a trick you're getting one disgusting thing but you got one even more disgusting thing
00:52:09,00:52:14,that's the half way through the first bite you think no don't worry guys I know this looks like
