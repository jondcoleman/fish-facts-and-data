00:00:00,00:00:02,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"Yeah, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:22,00:00:26,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:26,00:00:27,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:27,00:00:31,"I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Ani Chazinski, and James Harkin."
00:00:31,00:00:35,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here they are."
00:00:38,00:00:42,"Chazinski, fact number one."
00:00:42,00:00:47,"My point is that if you got into an argument in 18th century Aversinia,"
00:00:47,00:00:50,you could resolve it by blaming everything on the camel.
00:00:50,00:00:52,The camel.
00:00:52,00:00:53,"On the camel, yeah."
00:00:53,00:00:56,"Well, all arguments about who had eaten the hay."
00:00:56,00:00:59,"I think it's another all crimes, but yeah, we're perpetrated by camels."
00:00:59,00:01:03,"Blamed on the camel too much, he's bound to get the hump."
00:01:03,00:01:05,"Hey, how long have you been planning that?"
00:01:05,00:01:12,"Yeah, so this was first recorded in Bruce's travels into Aversinia to discover the source of the"
00:01:12,00:01:18,"Nile. And this book was written between 1768 and 1773, and it was his travels around Africa,"
00:01:18,00:01:19,trying to find the source of the Nile.
00:01:19,00:01:22,And he observed this tradition.
00:01:22,00:01:23,Wow.
00:01:23,00:01:25,So what exactly does it involve?
00:01:25,00:01:30,"What he said was, he came across a town where the townspeople had been fighting for several days"
00:01:30,00:01:35,"when it was agreed upon by the elders of both parties that nobody had been to blame on either side,"
00:01:35,00:01:37,but the whole wrong was the work of a camel.
00:01:37,00:01:42,"And so the townspeople rounded up this camel, they chose a camel around him, I guess."
00:01:42,00:01:44,You can't round up one camel.
00:01:44,00:01:46,"Well, it was a very clever camel."
00:01:46,00:01:48,It was a criminal camel.
00:01:48,00:01:53,"It was seized and everyone in the town gathered around and one by one, they speared the camel."
00:01:53,00:01:57,And he recalled that they upgraded the camel with all the wrongs done.
00:01:57,00:02:00,"So they told the camel everything had done wrong, shouted at it for a while."
00:02:00,00:02:06,"Each one of them speared it, and then apparently it retired fully satisfied as to the wrongs"
00:02:06,00:02:08,they had received from the camel.
00:02:08,00:02:12,"So yeah, there's quite a long history of blaming things on animals, isn't it?"
00:02:12,00:02:14,"Like scapegoat, for instance, famous one."
00:02:14,00:02:20,"There was a case in St. Kilda, I think, where a great orc was accused of being responsible for a storm"
00:02:20,00:02:25,that had ravaged St. Kilda. It was captured and put on trial and found guilty and stoned to death.
00:02:25,00:02:28,"This is a real animal, presumably. Or it was like a bird, right?"
00:02:28,00:02:30,"A UK is a bird, it's nuts."
00:02:30,00:02:33,"No, it's extinct. That was one of the first things I ever researched with QI was the Great Orcs,"
00:02:33,00:02:34,I joined during the G-Series.
00:02:34,00:02:37,"They used them for everything on St. Kilda, didn't they?"
00:02:37,00:02:43,"Yes, they used filmers and gannets and orcs and they ate porridge for breakfast, which was,"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"you know, sprinkled with great orc shavings and they had, they had, yeah."
00:02:46,00:02:50,"They used to go and kill them in their thousands, and the men would just walk around because they're"
00:02:50,00:02:54,"flightless. They would go to the islands where they flocked, and they would just go around clubbing"
00:02:54,00:02:58,"them to death because it saved ammunition, so you didn't have to waste bullets killing them."
00:02:58,00:03:04,"And then the last one was seen, you know, floating out at sea in the mid-19th century."
00:03:04,00:03:05,"And that was it, it's never been seen since."
00:03:05,00:03:06,Wow.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Awkward.
00:03:07,00:03:09,Oh my god.
00:03:09,00:03:14,"Ancient Egyptians used to, when, like, they felt they'd been particularly simple,"
00:03:14,00:03:18,"used to sacrifice an animal and lump all their sins onto this animal and sacrifice it,"
00:03:18,00:03:20,and then they'd sell it to foreigners.
00:03:20,00:03:24,They'd sell it to great foreigners because they didn't want to eat the sin non.
00:03:24,00:03:25,Classic to use the foreigner joke.
00:03:25,00:03:28,"So this was where we got the scapegoat from, is that right?"
00:03:28,00:03:34,"Now the scapegoat is from the Torah, from Jewish folklore, I think, and what they would do is"
00:03:34,00:03:39,"on the day of atonement, the Jewish high priest would lay his hands on alive goats, confess all the sins"
00:03:39,00:03:43,of the children of Israel and then send it away into the wilderness.
00:03:43,00:03:48,"There's like a Santa Claus who just gets the naughty list, but then has to deal with it."
00:03:48,00:03:51,"The ancient Greeks used people for this kind of purpose, didn't they?"
00:03:51,00:03:56,"So they would have a person, I think it was often a disabled person, who they would, again,"
00:03:56,00:04:00,they'd pile all their sins upon this person and send him into exile.
00:04:00,00:04:02,And that would be that person taking their sins away.
00:04:02,00:04:06,"And he was called a pharma cos, which is where we get pharmacy."
00:04:06,00:04:11,"Pharmaceuticals is from, because he would remedy the sins of a community."
00:04:11,00:04:12,"Yes, it's amazing."
00:04:12,00:04:15,"Yeah, it's quite a cool word origin and sort of unpleasant."
00:04:15,00:04:19,Was there a reward for it beforehand? Did you live quite well before you were cast out?
00:04:19,00:04:23,"Yes, you did. You used to be treated as kind of a blessed and cursed."
00:04:23,00:04:28,"So they'd be preserved and they'd be, like, they'd be hosted around the village."
00:04:28,00:04:33,"Does that not make it worse? Because, like, the difference between being sent into the wilderness"
00:04:33,00:04:37,"and just having a normal life is one thing, but the difference between that and having a really"
00:04:37,00:04:38,great life is even worse.
00:04:38,00:04:39,Yeah.
00:04:39,00:04:43,"Well, Tom Hanks explores this theme in the film ""Jo versus the Volcano,"" I believe."
00:04:44,00:04:46,"If you remember that one. I've seen that, no."
00:04:46,00:04:49,"I didn't know that was a great philosophical, three times of a film."
00:04:49,00:04:52,And the QIs gain was news that reviews lots was there.
00:04:52,00:04:57,Camels? Does anyone have anything about camels?
00:04:57,00:04:58,I do.
00:04:58,00:04:58,Go on.
00:04:58,00:05:01,"Google, you know, Google Maps."
00:05:01,00:05:02,"I do, yeah."
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Yeah, so Street View?"
00:05:03,00:05:04,Yeah.
00:05:04,00:05:09,They've had one camel with a camera on its back walking the Liwad Desert.
00:05:09,00:05:10,That's good.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"Yeah, it's basically a camel who's mapped one of the deserts, one of the great deserts."
00:05:13,00:05:14,One camel.
00:05:14,00:05:15,Just one camel.
00:05:15,00:05:16,That's a lot for a camel to do.
00:05:16,00:05:17,Yeah. His name's Raffia.
00:05:17,00:05:18,That's a great name.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:22,150 kilometers southwest of Abu Dhabi.
00:05:22,00:05:23,"And, yeah, just went through it."
00:05:23,00:05:24,Is it on its own?
00:05:24,00:05:25,How do they know?
00:05:25,00:05:26,How do they direct it?
00:05:26,00:05:29,"Well, in the picture that I've seen online, there's a dude walking it."
00:05:29,00:05:35,"You can train camels to go in certain directions by giving them food if they go in one way,"
00:05:35,00:05:38,and then they'll keep going there because they think that's where they'll find food.
00:05:38,00:05:41,And that's a way that they transport drugs across the Sahara.
00:05:41,00:05:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:42,00:05:48,They train these camels to walk from Western Africa all the way up to the Mediterranean.
00:05:48,00:05:50,They train them and train them and train them.
00:05:50,00:05:54,And then they put the drugs on the back of the camels and they don't need any human assistance at all.
00:05:54,00:05:57,"So if they get caught, if the camels get caught by the police, then there's no humans too."
00:05:57,00:06:02,"No, but again, camels getting blamed because they're the camels going to be the one that takes the rap."
00:06:02,00:06:04,"Camel milk is more nutritious than camel, isn't it?"
00:06:04,00:06:05,Is it?
00:06:05,00:06:07,"Yeah, I don't know why they don't drink it in Australia, for instance,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,where they've got more camels than anywhere else.
00:06:09,00:06:10,Or they're all feral.
00:06:10,00:06:11,They started selling in America.
00:06:11,00:06:12,Why wouldn't you?
00:06:12,00:06:13,"Yeah, they do."
00:06:13,00:06:15,And I think they're trying to make it into a baby milk as well.
00:06:15,00:06:18,Australia sells camels to Saudi Arabia.
00:06:18,00:06:19,Does it?
00:06:19,00:06:19,Yeah.
00:06:19,00:06:22,Saudi Arabia also imports sand for use in construction.
00:06:22,00:06:23,Exactly.
00:06:23,00:06:26,"So the Saudi sand isn't good for construction, whereas the Australian one is."
00:06:26,00:06:31,"And also the Saudi camels are for breeding and racing,"
00:06:31,00:06:33,whereas the Australian ones are good for meat.
00:06:33,00:06:38,"I've got, I was looking into just general excuses because I do like that."
00:06:38,00:06:42,"That's the scapegoat, but it is also just a fantastic excuse to sort of say,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,let's no longer argue about this stuff.
00:06:44,00:06:48,"And so, okay, so some of my favorite sporting excuses."
00:06:48,00:06:52,"Yeah, this one comes from US sprinter, Lachon Merritt."
00:06:52,00:06:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:52,00:06:56,He was banned because he did a drug called DHEA.
00:06:56,00:06:58,I'm not going to try and pronounce the longer version of that word.
00:06:58,00:07:01,But he claims it wasn't to improve his performance.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"He claims, this is a quote, I was trying to make my penis bigger."
00:07:06,00:07:08,It's he didn't realize that they had this kind of drug in it.
00:07:08,00:07:12,"It was to improve his performance, but it's just not an interesting one."
00:07:12,00:07:16,"Yeah, it would probably not help his spotting performance at all, would it?"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"It's still, it could be where it could be a high jumper."
00:07:18,00:07:18,This is an interesting one.
00:07:18,00:07:20,"I don't know, you know how high jump works."
00:07:20,00:07:22,"Yeah, you leave that behind, yeah."
00:07:22,00:07:25,Here's another one.
00:07:25,00:07:29,"So, okay, there's a cyclist called Tyler Hamilton,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,"who, do you know about this one?"
00:07:31,00:07:32,I know him.
00:07:32,00:07:37,"Okay, so he got busted because they'd found someone else's red blood cells."
00:07:37,00:07:41,"Oh, yeah, which suggested that there was all this thing about replacing your blood and stuff."
00:07:41,00:07:45,His claim was that it was his unborn twin.
00:07:45,00:07:48,He said that his mother had a twin who died.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"Weirdly, medical authorities have said that that's plausible."
00:07:51,00:07:52,That could definitely happen.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"Yeah, it's called chimeraism, isn't it?"
00:07:54,00:07:55,How's it?
00:07:55,00:08:01,"And the idea is that you had two babies and then at a very, very early stage, one of them"
00:08:02,00:08:03,was enveloped into the other one.
00:08:03,00:08:05,It could be even just when it's a few cells.
00:08:05,00:08:10,"And it means that you can sometimes people who have one eye, which is different color,"
00:08:10,00:08:12,that could be cut due to chimeraism.
00:08:12,00:08:14,"But also, yeah, it's really interesting actually."
00:08:14,00:08:15,Yeah.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"Okay, so blaming people."
00:08:17,00:08:22,Blaming your mistakes on other people is socially contagious in the same way that a yarn is.
00:08:22,00:08:28,"So, they've done studies and they found that when you watch someone else blaming someone,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,then you will blame someone yourself.
00:08:30,00:08:31,And that's more likely to happen.
00:08:31,00:08:32,Wow.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"So, there can be a culture of blame."
00:08:34,00:08:35,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:08:35,00:08:38,"Also, you just mentioned in your name because it made me yarn now."
00:08:38,00:08:38,"So, thank you for that."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"Actually, I think it was probably that sort."
00:08:40,00:08:48,"Okay, time to move on to fact number two."
00:08:48,00:08:50,And fact number two is my fact.
00:08:50,00:08:55,"My fact this week is that in ancient Greece, they used to play with yo-yos."
00:08:55,00:08:59,"Now, I know that everyone in this room is not surprised by that as I am."
00:08:59,00:09:01,But I just find it amazing.
00:09:01,00:09:02,It's incredible.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"Yeah, eyes amazing."
00:09:03,00:09:03,"Oh, okay."
00:09:03,00:09:05,Because James and Anna seem to know that.
00:09:05,00:09:05,But I saw this.
00:09:05,00:09:07,I went to a Wikipedia page.
00:09:07,00:09:08,"Yeah, I thought they just played with Xboxes."
00:09:08,00:09:11,There's actually called them Kai boxes.
00:09:11,00:09:14,"Exciting, exciting."
00:09:14,00:09:15,Very good.
00:09:15,00:09:20,"There's a vase and there's an illustration on this vase of someone from ancient Greece,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,a boy playing with the yo-yo.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"And I looked at that and I was like, what the hell is that doing there?"
00:09:24,00:09:25,It's really weird.
00:09:25,00:09:26,It's so out of place in time for me.
00:09:26,00:09:30,"I'll say to James earlier, I feel like that's like, if I was looking for evidence of time travel."
00:09:30,00:09:34,"And I didn't know stuff about history, which now I know it's not time travel."
00:09:34,00:09:36,But I didn't know that that was...
00:09:36,00:09:39,"I think that's the only one there is that jar, I think."
00:09:39,00:09:42,And I don't think we have written evidence of it.
00:09:42,00:09:47,"So, and I don't think yo-yos reappeared until quite a lot later."
00:09:47,00:09:49,So maybe he was a time traveler.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"Wow, and he made onto a vase."
00:09:50,00:09:56,"It makes you think as well that if you did get put back in ancient Greece as a time traveler,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,then I know I have no uses.
00:09:58,00:10:01,But I do know how to walk the dog and rock a cradle in yo-yos.
00:10:01,00:10:03,I would instantly be Mr. Popular.
00:10:03,00:10:04,You'd be on all the vases.
00:10:04,00:10:06,I'd be on a planet.
00:10:06,00:10:08,"To be fair though, we only have that one vase,"
00:10:08,00:10:12,because almost all the vases in the world have been smashed from that time.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"So, yo-yos, by you."
00:10:13,00:10:19,So maybe it's that maybe every single vase...
00:10:19,00:10:19,How do yo-yos?
00:10:19,00:10:21,...in a piece of yo-yos on it.
00:10:21,00:10:25,But they do think they do think it appeared in ancient China way before.
00:10:25,00:10:27,There's three locations that they kind of say it could belong to.
00:10:27,00:10:30,"Ancient Greece, ancient China and the Philippines."
00:10:30,00:10:32,"The Philippines is less so of a strong argument,"
00:10:32,00:10:35,except for the fact that they call it the yo-yo.
00:10:35,00:10:38,And that's where America adopted the word yo-yo from.
00:10:38,00:10:40,"But in Philippines, they used it as a weapon."
00:10:40,00:10:45,"We thought on QI, certainly, that yo-yos were never used as weapons."
00:10:45,00:10:48,And we got quite close to running it as a general ignorance on the show.
00:10:48,00:10:50,And I don't think we did in the end.
00:10:50,00:10:55,"But then I read something by President Acquino III of the Philippines,"
00:10:55,00:10:59,and he reckons that they do have evidence that it was used as a weapon after all.
00:10:59,00:11:03,"So according to the president, it's true, but we still really don't think it."
00:11:03,00:11:08,He said that their version that they used was large and with sharp edges and studs
00:11:08,00:11:12,and attached to thick 20-foot ropes for flinging attendees or prey.
00:11:12,00:11:14,"I've heard a different etymology for yo-yo, which is the..."
00:11:14,00:11:20,"It was known in France in the late 18th century as the Juju de Normandie,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,which just means a little toy.
00:11:22,00:11:23,So that's another possible one.
00:11:23,00:11:24,Okay.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"It's one that's, again, you look into the history of it,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,and suddenly it starts appearing everywhere.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"Napoleon's army, it says online, the..."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Fort with yo-yos.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"No, just used to play with them in the kind of downfall."
00:11:34,00:11:37,"Yeah, I read that Napoleon played."
00:11:37,00:11:39,"I mean, surely that's a myth."
00:11:39,00:11:43,"There are paintings of, yeah, the Napoleonic army, aren't there, with yo-yos."
00:11:43,00:11:48,"Almost all pictures of people playing with yo-yos in the 18th, 17th centuries are adults."
00:11:48,00:11:49,And it was a really fashionable thing to do.
00:11:49,00:11:52,You get Parisian ladies in the 18th century playing with yo-yos.
00:11:52,00:11:53,It's so cool.
00:11:53,00:11:56,As they're walking along with their parasols and their smart clothes.
00:11:56,00:11:57,I think it was quite trendy.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"It's so great. I just didn't know it was such a big deal, the yo-yo."
00:12:00,00:12:01,It was a big deal when I was a kid.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"Yeah, me too."
00:12:02,00:12:05,"Between the eighties, late eighties when I was a kid,"
00:12:05,00:12:06,it was massive in school.
00:12:06,00:12:07,We all had yo-yos.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Same in the nineties.
00:12:08,00:12:11,"It was when it was voted the biggest fad toy of the 20th century,"
00:12:11,00:12:15,because every childhood has had a yo-yo being a big part of it.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"Yeah, there was a massive one in 1988."
00:12:18,00:12:24,"And they, the company that made this particular type of yo-yo sold a couple of hundred in 1987"
00:12:24,00:12:26,and more than half a million in 1988.
00:12:26,00:12:28,How come?
00:12:28,00:12:31,It just became a massive fad and everyone in every school had to have one.
00:12:31,00:12:34,The company that made them was called PMS International.
00:12:34,00:12:38,It's a really pissed off woman looking for something to occupy her kids.
00:12:40,00:12:45,You used to be able to become rich and famous for scale-extric in America.
00:12:45,00:12:48,"Yeah, it was massively popular in the 1960s."
00:12:48,00:12:51,They used to show live tournaments on US TV.
00:12:51,00:12:55,And there were more slot car facilities and there were bowling alleys in America.
00:12:55,00:12:57,That's in the 1960s.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"And today, there are none."
00:12:58,00:12:59,"No way, yeah."
00:12:59,00:13:01,What's a slot car?
00:13:01,00:13:03,"So it's like, you know, scale-extric."
00:13:03,00:13:04,"It's the same thing, it's just like..."
00:13:04,00:13:07,It just slots in on a little sort of plugs into the track.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"Another famous toy car, maybe the most famous toy car."
00:13:11,00:13:13,"Yeah, go on."
00:13:13,00:13:14,Brum.
00:13:14,00:13:15,Brum.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"Oh, wow, he's a cartoon from the Netherlands."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"Brum, the little car who goes on adventures."
00:13:21,00:13:22,He's not a toy.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"What's the toy, you know?"
00:13:23,00:13:24,What about Hot Wheels?
00:13:24,00:13:25,They were quite famous.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"Yeah, I was going for bigger."
00:13:27,00:13:30,"I was going for the Kozy Coop, you know, the one I mean, right?"
00:13:30,00:13:31,"No, it's for the car."
00:13:31,00:13:32,Is the red and yellow car...
00:13:32,00:13:33,"Oh, yes, you're all kids."
00:13:33,00:13:34,"You have that as a kid, yeah."
00:13:34,00:13:35,There's a kid that you sit inside.
00:13:35,00:13:37,Eyes for a kid.
00:13:37,00:13:37,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:13:37,00:13:38,"Yeah, one of those."
00:13:38,00:13:42,So that has been the best-selling car in the US.
00:13:42,00:13:43,It was throughout the '90s.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"And last time, the last also happened from 2008."
00:13:46,00:13:49,"In the US and the UK, it sells more than any other make-of-car."
00:13:49,00:13:50,That's great.
00:13:50,00:13:52,That'd be great if that was the rescue plan for General Motors.
00:13:52,00:13:53,"Well, we've actually got a new model."
00:13:53,00:13:54,We are very excited.
00:13:54,00:13:56,And it's going to reinvigorate the American car in the street.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"Well, it's not a long way from smart cars, are they?"
00:13:59,00:14:00,"No, that's true."
00:14:00,00:14:02,"Yeah, but they're closer to flinstone cars as well."
00:14:03,00:14:07,"Well, that's similar to the fact that Lego is supposed to be the largest"
00:14:07,00:14:08,tire manufacturer.
00:14:08,00:14:09,Yeah.
00:14:09,00:14:13,You know you can buy a Lego Nazi concentration camp.
00:14:13,00:14:14,It's just been...
00:14:14,00:14:15,"Yeah, you can."
00:14:15,00:14:16,"Yeah, it was designed by an artist."
00:14:16,00:14:19,And I think it was bought by the Warsaw Jewish Memorial Museum
00:14:19,00:14:20,or something.
00:14:20,00:14:22,And so it's not meant to be...
00:14:22,00:14:24,"Right, so it's not a commercial product?"
00:14:24,00:14:25,I don't think so.
00:14:25,00:14:28,They've said that Lego people are getting angrier
00:14:28,00:14:29,as the years go on out there.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Yeah.
00:14:30,00:14:31,You have expressions.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Can I tell you about Twister?
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Yes, I love Twister."
00:14:33,00:14:34,I love Twister so much.
00:14:34,00:14:35,Did it in ancient times?
00:14:35,00:14:36,This is not an ancient Greek game.
00:14:36,00:14:37,"No, no."
00:14:37,00:14:39,That'll be correct.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"Yeah, it's on the other side of the bars where they've never lived."
00:14:41,00:14:45,"Well, they have ancient Persian rugs with the circles on that line of Greek."
00:14:45,00:14:50,"So, okay, the inventor is a guy called Reign Goya."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"Reign Goya, I think, is his name."
00:14:52,00:14:53,I don't know how to pronounce it.
00:14:53,00:14:55,But he wanted to call it pretzel.
00:14:55,00:14:57,Although one of his initial names for it was King's FTSE.
00:14:57,00:15:01,But the thing is it tanked when they first sold it
00:15:01,00:15:02,because people thought it was risqué.
00:15:02,00:15:04,Did they sell it a sex in the box or something like that?
00:15:04,00:15:06,"Well, other people complained, supposedly,"
00:15:06,00:15:10,"that other manufacturers, or possibly the bosses at the other firm, which made it."
00:15:10,00:15:12,And they were going to give up.
00:15:12,00:15:14,Sears didn't want it for their catalog.
00:15:14,00:15:17,And one last ditch attempt they had was to get it on a TV show.
00:15:17,00:15:22,And the PR firm pushing Twister got it onto the tonight show with Johnny Carson.
00:15:22,00:15:26,"And he played a round of it with Eva Gabor,"
00:15:26,00:15:28,who was a sex symbol at the time.
00:15:28,00:15:32,"And the next morning, the queue was 50 deep."
00:15:32,00:15:34,And they sold 3 million that year.
00:15:34,00:15:35,Wow.
00:15:35,00:15:39,And it suddenly took off because that won appearance on TV.
00:15:39,00:15:42,"It's weird because toys, if they take off, they really take off."
00:15:42,00:15:44,"Yeah, especially toy helicopters."
00:15:44,00:15:51,"My little, I went to see my little niece recently."
00:15:51,00:15:52,It was her birthday.
00:15:52,00:15:55,And I was shocked that there's a whole new toy
00:15:55,00:15:58,that's dominating everything in its looms.
00:15:58,00:15:59,Looming is the biggest thing.
00:15:59,00:16:01,Is that kind of like loom bands?
00:16:01,00:16:02,"Giant, weaving looms."
00:16:02,00:16:02,Yes.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"And you use rubber bands, and you loom bands around your wrist."
00:16:05,00:16:06,You make necklaces.
00:16:06,00:16:07,All that.
00:16:07,00:16:08,It's the biggest go.
00:16:08,00:16:10,Walk by any kid's shop at the moment.
00:16:10,00:16:10,Look in the window.
00:16:10,00:16:12,It's all looms on display.
00:16:12,00:16:13,Get this.
00:16:13,00:16:16,"In 2008, the National Toy Hall of Fame awarded"
00:16:16,00:16:19,oldest toy to the stick.
00:16:19,00:16:25,"Also, the cardboard boxes in that hall of fame."
00:16:25,00:16:25,Is it?
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"Oh, I imagine that Christmas and your parents go,"
00:16:30,00:16:33,"""Good news, we bought you something from the Toy Hall of Fame."""
00:16:33,00:16:40,"Time for backing number three, and that is Andy."
00:16:40,00:16:44,My fact this week is that most honey bee hives in the USA
00:16:44,00:16:46,"live on trucks, on flatbed trucks."
00:16:46,00:16:49,They do not live in fields where you might think
00:16:49,00:16:51,or in stationary apuries.
00:16:51,00:16:54,Most bees in the USA are driven around
00:16:54,00:16:56,and rented out so that they can pollinate plants.
00:16:56,00:16:57,They never find a home.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"They just, the truck is their home."
00:16:59,00:17:01,"I think some, I don't know about how it happens during winter,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"but I think during the summer season,"
00:17:03,00:17:06,there are billions of bees being driven all over America.
00:17:06,00:17:11,And they stop and they're released to pollinate a crop.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"And then they go back to the hive in the evening,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"or whenever it is they finish doing all the pollinating,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,and then away they go.
00:17:16,00:17:18,They're dressed as a colony collapse.
00:17:18,00:17:19,It's partly because of that.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"Yeah, although colony collapse has slowed down."
00:17:21,00:17:22,They're not sure why.
00:17:22,00:17:26,"But even so, a third of all bees in America die each year."
00:17:26,00:17:27,They think it's because of these chemicals
00:17:27,00:17:29,used called neonicotinoids.
00:17:29,00:17:31,I thought bees would die within a year.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"The lifespan is really variable,"
00:17:33,00:17:34,depending on how hard they work.
00:17:34,00:17:40,"So I think as with people, I think we're all in our late 80s."
00:17:40,00:17:44,"I think worker bees in hot weather,"
00:17:44,00:17:46,"where I think they have to work harder,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,and have a lifespan of about six weeks.
00:17:48,00:17:49,"And then if it's a cold year,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,then they can last about 10 months.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"They move around slowly, then they're sort of sluggish."
00:17:53,00:17:55,The other thing I read about old bees
00:17:55,00:17:58,"is if you give them a job that normally young bees do,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"then their brains stop aging, or even reverse aging."
00:18:01,00:18:02,"They get younger, then."
00:18:02,00:18:04,They're like doing Sudoku for them.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"Yeah, apart from I don't think the young people"
00:18:06,00:18:07,are doing Sudoku these days.
00:18:07,00:18:09,"If you started playing with looms,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,then your brain would go down.
00:18:11,00:18:14,Or if you teach an old bee to play call of duty advanced warfare.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"Yeah, cool."
00:18:16,00:18:18,"And the brain chemistry can change, can't it?"
00:18:18,00:18:20,So I think honey bees do lots of jobs.
00:18:20,00:18:23,"So there are certain worker bees, adjust workers,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,"and drone bees, et cetera."
00:18:25,00:18:27,But honey bees do lots of jobs.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"And when they switch from one job to another,"
00:18:29,00:18:30,their actual brain chemistry changes.
00:18:30,00:18:33,And I think they're one of the only animals it's known to do that
00:18:33,00:18:35,in order to adapt them to the other job.
00:18:35,00:18:39,"But they do, so we do need them to pollinate our crops, do we?"
00:18:39,00:18:42,I think pollinate a third of the world's crops.
00:18:42,00:18:46,They're responsible for $20 billion worth of food production
00:18:46,00:18:47,"in America alone, I think."
00:18:47,00:18:50,Don't flies pollinate flowers more than bees do?
00:18:50,00:18:51,No.
00:18:51,00:18:52,"Well, lots of other things do as well."
00:18:52,00:18:54,"So there are 20,000 species of bee,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,"which know, and the honey bee is the one that gets all the press."
00:18:57,00:18:59,"So the agave plant, which tequila is made out of,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,is pollinated by bats.
00:19:01,00:19:02,Yeah.
00:19:02,00:19:05,The cocoa plant is pollinated by midges.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Yeah, midges."
00:19:06,00:19:07,But we're about to go through all the plants.
00:19:07,00:19:09,That's what they pollinate.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"This is my, this is my last chance."
00:19:10,00:19:11,This is my last chance.
00:19:11,00:19:12,This is my last chance.
00:19:12,00:19:14,I've never been invited to a party again.
00:19:14,00:19:16,Are you drinking tequila?
00:19:16,00:19:19,"Oh, I can't help it."
00:19:19,00:19:21,Noticing you're eating an orange.
00:19:21,00:19:23,I wonder if I can tell you about the pull-in action of the orange.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"It's a peanut, fuck up."
00:19:24,00:19:29,There is a bat.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"If you're listening to this, stop what you're doing"
00:19:32,00:19:34,"in Google, the tube-lipped nectar bat,"
00:19:34,00:19:37,because it has the longest tongue proportional
00:19:37,00:19:38,to its body look of any animal.
00:19:38,00:19:40,"It's longer, I think, than the animal itself,"
00:19:40,00:19:42,or it's 2/3 of the animal's length.
00:19:42,00:19:43,And it has such a long tongue.
00:19:43,00:19:45,It has to keep a bit of it in its rib cage.
00:19:45,00:19:49,And they specialize in pollinating and drinking the nectar from
00:19:49,00:19:51,these flowers with incredibly long trumpets.
00:19:51,00:19:53,So that's what they have to do.
00:19:53,00:19:55,They have to have this unbelievable tongue.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Wow.
00:19:56,00:19:59,I found a great headline to do with the trucks carrying all the bees.
00:19:59,00:20:00,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:00,00:20:01,And the headline is this.
00:20:01,00:20:02,It's someone who made a connection.
00:20:02,00:20:05,Why are so many bee carrying trucks crashing?
00:20:05,00:20:08,"Apparently, in the last few years,"
00:20:08,00:20:10,there's been serious problems with these trucks
00:20:10,00:20:12,"that are carrying the bees overturning on the road,"
00:20:12,00:20:16,smashing down and releasing millions of bees into the road.
00:20:16,00:20:18,Just millions swarming everywhere.
00:20:18,00:20:20,"Presumably, that happens mostly not on motorways,"
00:20:20,00:20:21,but on b-roads.
00:20:21,00:20:25,I enjoyed that.
00:20:25,00:20:26,"So they crash, they crash."
00:20:26,00:20:27,"Yeah, they crash."
00:20:27,00:20:28,And they release all these bees.
00:20:28,00:20:30,It caused us hell for them.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"There was a really funny thing of there's been, like,"
00:20:32,00:20:36,"2 to 3 of these major crashes, millions of bees throughout."
00:20:36,00:20:40,"At one time, another truck came along that crashed,"
00:20:40,00:20:41,but it wasn't carrying bees.
00:20:41,00:20:42,It was carrying honey.
00:20:42,00:20:46,"And it spilled, so you're like, 200 gallons of honey,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,which attracted just thousands of swarms of bees.
00:20:49,00:20:51,And so they had another bee crisis on their hand.
00:20:51,00:20:52,"And then you have to get them,"
00:20:52,00:20:55,"the right ones back onto the truck, when you fix the truck,"
00:20:55,00:20:56,and you have to separate them.
00:20:56,00:20:59,"Plenty had a theory that if honey bees were caught outdoors at night,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"and they had to camp out, basically,"
00:21:01,00:21:04,and they would sleep on their backs to protect their wings from the dew.
00:21:04,00:21:06,But in many ways--
00:21:06,00:21:07,"Which was rubbish, right?"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"It was rubbish, yes, it was, and remains rubbish."
00:21:09,00:21:10,"Oh, god, see, that's hell."
00:21:10,00:21:11,That's hell.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Interesting.
00:21:12,00:21:13,"I was like, ""But not true."""
00:21:13,00:21:14,That means--
00:21:14,00:21:17,"Have you heard of the superhero, the Red Bee?"
00:21:17,00:21:19,"No, he's one of the worst superheroes of all time."
00:21:19,00:21:21,I just-- I love him.
00:21:21,00:21:23,And his identity is Rick Raleigh.
00:21:23,00:21:26,He's an assistant district attorney in Oregon.
00:21:26,00:21:28,And his motorcycle brandy is to put on a red and yellow costume.
00:21:28,00:21:31,And he has trained bees with which he fights Nazis.
00:21:31,00:21:34,And this is from the Wikipedia page for the Red Bee.
00:21:34,00:21:36,"His favorite bee is named Michael,"
00:21:36,00:21:39,and lives inside his belt buckle for use in special circumstance.
00:21:39,00:21:41,This is so hard.
00:21:41,00:21:45,"OK, time for a final fact."
00:21:45,00:21:47,And that is James.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"OK, my fact this week is the Sacramento Police Department"
00:21:51,00:21:55,get at least one call a week from people stuck in the world's largest corn maze.
00:21:55,00:21:56,That's really funny.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Wow.
00:21:57,00:21:59,I could tell by the way you laughed.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"No, it was-- I just like the thought of it,"
00:22:01,00:22:03,of just the phone ringing in the station.
00:22:03,00:22:06,So how big is this corn maze?
00:22:06,00:22:08,It's 63 acres in size.
00:22:08,00:22:11,So what do the police do when they're called?
00:22:11,00:22:13,"Often the police will get into the maze,"
00:22:13,00:22:17,and then they themselves will have to call it the bigger police.
00:22:17,00:22:20,"Yeah, until it's kind of like a conger line that they can actually find."
00:22:20,00:22:22,"Yeah, I think they just calm them down really,"
00:22:22,00:22:26,because it's mostly that people are like freaking out a little bit because they're stuck.
00:22:26,00:22:26,OK.
00:22:26,00:22:30,And then presumably the owners of the maze and can then go in and sort it out.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"There was-- it must be a nightmare of being like,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"OK, we shot at six."
00:22:34,00:22:36,"Kind of clock now, there's something there."
00:22:36,00:22:39,"We shot at six, but last entry is at 9.30 in the morning."
00:22:39,00:22:42,That's when you know you're in a serious--
00:22:42,00:22:46,There was a guy in England who had a maze.
00:22:46,00:22:48,It was quite-- it wasn't like a big like corn one.
00:22:48,00:22:50,It was a small one.
00:22:50,00:22:51,And he was mowing it.
00:22:51,00:22:52,He was mowing the path.
00:22:52,00:22:55,And he got to about halfway through.
00:22:55,00:22:59,And then he realized he had to go to his daughter's school thing.
00:22:59,00:23:00,And so he had to leave.
00:23:00,00:23:02,But he couldn't get out of his own maze.
00:23:02,00:23:05,And so he just used his lawn mower and just plowed straight through
00:23:05,00:23:06,and gave himself an exit.
00:23:06,00:23:08,"Oh, that's the worst maze now."
00:23:08,00:23:10,"Yeah, exactly. He said-- I've just found the article."
00:23:10,00:23:14,"He said, ""I'd already had feedback suggesting the maze was tricky to negotiate"
00:23:14,00:23:16,before I became lost myself.
00:23:16,00:23:19,"Next year, I think I'll make it a bit easier."""
00:23:19,00:23:21,"Next year, I'll listen to the bloody feedback."
00:23:21,00:23:26,"But yeah, mazes, in general, they're pretty good on that."
00:23:26,00:23:28,I love mazes. I've been on mazes for ages.
00:23:28,00:23:29,I don't think I've ever been to a maze.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Really? I don't know.
00:23:30,00:23:31,Let's all get a Hampton Court.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"In Germany, mazes are called ""Irgarten"" or ""Era Gardens."""
00:23:34,00:23:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:35,00:23:36,How good is that?
00:23:36,00:23:37,Yeah. That's good.
00:23:37,00:23:40,"But they used to be-- so mazes grow out of labyrinths, is that right?"
00:23:40,00:23:43,"Yeah, so labyrinth is a maze with only one entrance and exit."
00:23:43,00:23:45,So you can't get lost in it.
00:23:45,00:23:46,You just go straight and you come straight back out.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"Well, lots of mazes have surely got only one exit and entrance."
00:23:49,00:23:50,"Do you mean-- Sorry, they're half."
00:23:50,00:23:51,"No, no, no, no."
00:23:51,00:23:53,"Yeah, so you walk in and you keep walking."
00:23:53,00:23:54,Yeah.
00:23:54,00:23:56,You get to the middle and then you get back out again.
00:23:56,00:23:58,And there's no way you can't turn left or right.
00:23:58,00:23:59,You just have to go in that direction.
00:23:59,00:24:00,I see.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"Because yeah, there's all the stuff about the labyrinth"
00:24:03,00:24:05,that greet with thesis in the mind at all.
00:24:05,00:24:06,But you wouldn't get lost in that.
00:24:06,00:24:07,You wouldn't even need a thread.
00:24:07,00:24:11,So labyrinth just effectively a more complicated walk.
00:24:11,00:24:13,What was the purpose behind it?
00:24:13,00:24:15,"So actually, it does look nice."
00:24:15,00:24:19,But people used it for like religious reasons sometimes
00:24:19,00:24:22,or because it's a very particular pattern.
00:24:22,00:24:25,One way that you could do it is you would walk in and on the way
00:24:25,00:24:27,into the center of the labyrinth.
00:24:27,00:24:28,You would be thinking about your problems
00:24:28,00:24:31,and then the way out you would think about your solutions.
00:24:31,00:24:33,It's also the contemplative thing.
00:24:33,00:24:37,Apparently like also Norwegian sailors would go through
00:24:37,00:24:39,these mazes just before they went.
00:24:39,00:24:40,They would be good luck.
00:24:40,00:24:42,So they used it as a charm thing sometimes as well.
00:24:42,00:24:47,I read another theory either symbolising
00:24:47,00:24:48,the hard life of an early Christian
00:24:48,00:24:52,or showing the entanglements of sin or my favourite.
00:24:52,00:24:54,You would be like doing a mini pilgrimage
00:24:54,00:24:58,if you were committed to small sin.
00:24:58,00:25:00,Go to Hampton course.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"But like, it's cheating because labyrinths are quite fun."
00:25:02,00:25:03,Or mazes are quite fun.
00:25:03,00:25:05,But I think it's like go and have a long walk
00:25:05,00:25:07,and think about what you've done.
00:25:07,00:25:08,I suppose so.
00:25:08,00:25:09,"Yeah, that's it."
00:25:09,00:25:12,"Gone a long walk, but stay within this."
00:25:12,00:25:14,Stay within sight of me.
00:25:14,00:25:15,We close at six.
00:25:15,00:25:20,I think they've found a maze in Peru
00:25:20,00:25:23,"that's more than 3,000 years old, I think."
00:25:23,00:25:25,So it's in the Peruvian Andes
00:25:25,00:25:28,"and it's beneath Chavinda Huantar,"
00:25:28,00:25:30,which is this ancient site.
00:25:30,00:25:32,And the whole maze is underground
00:25:32,00:25:34,and they think that it has a ceremonial
00:25:34,00:25:37,like massive and disorienting acoustic chamber.
00:25:37,00:25:38,"Because if you go down into it,"
00:25:38,00:25:43,the way that it's built means that your voice bounces off the walls
00:25:43,00:25:45,"madly and like if someone else in another part of the maze,"
00:25:45,00:25:46,you can never find them and you think
00:25:46,00:25:47,they're coming from a different direction.
00:25:47,00:25:50,"And if you're above the maze, it sounds absolutely terrifying."
00:25:50,00:25:53,And they found at this site all these kind of trumpet things.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"And if you blow the trumpets, it sounds like a torture thing."
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
00:25:58,00:26:01,So you get lost in this maze and also sounds are coming from everywhere.
00:26:01,00:26:04,There's an old Scandinavian punishment
00:26:04,00:26:07,called the Cave of Roses.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"And that was, you would go into a dark cave"
00:26:09,00:26:12,and then they would throw a load of poisonous animals at you
00:26:12,00:26:14,and you'd just have to stay there for a while
00:26:14,00:26:15,and then come out and hopefully not be bitten.
00:26:15,00:26:16,Really?
00:26:16,00:26:18,It's a bit like I'm a celebrity kind of.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Yeah.
00:26:19,00:26:21,Cave of Roses is a misleading title.
00:26:21,00:26:22,It looks.
00:26:22,00:26:24,"They all have misleading names, torture equipments,"
00:26:24,00:26:25,because you very rarely get one
00:26:25,00:26:28,called the incruciating footcutter-offer thing.
00:26:28,00:26:33,"There's one called the pair of anguish, which is a piece of metal, right?"
00:26:33,00:26:36,And it gets put into your mouth and then I think it's expanded
00:26:36,00:26:39,"and it hurts your door terribly, or it's heated and, you know, it's all--"
00:26:39,00:26:41,"But the pair, you know, oh, pair."
00:26:41,00:26:44,"Oh, I have a pair of anguish, not so good."
00:26:44,00:26:45,If a judge has a bit of a knife
00:26:45,00:26:47,"for the amateur dramatic side of things, he's sent."
00:26:47,00:26:52,I sent it to you to eat a pair of anguish.
00:26:52,00:26:54,People make noises and do weird things.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"And finally, I think I said you something recently,"
00:26:55,00:26:59,down of Brian Blatt's face was turned into a maze slash a circle thing.
00:26:59,00:27:00,"That's right, yes."
00:27:00,00:27:00,It's pretty great.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Yeah.
00:27:01,00:27:06,"In the November, 2004, election in America, a farmer carved giant faces"
00:27:06,00:27:11,"of John Kerry and President Bush into his cornfield in Pleasant Grove, in Utah,"
00:27:11,00:27:15,"which I just think when farmers do that, you're ruining your crops, right?"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"Yeah, they do it to bring in tourists and stuff, don't they?"
00:27:18,00:27:19,Dragonly make that up.
00:27:19,00:27:22,"Well, I mean, let's all go and see John Kerry's massive face."
00:27:22,00:27:23,"Yeah, massive drawer."
00:27:23,00:27:29,In a place formally known as Pleasant Grove.
00:27:29,00:27:34,"By studying sheep in mazes, they've found that when left to their own devices,"
00:27:34,00:27:37,sheep tends to turn to the left.
00:27:37,00:27:41,"When they're left to their own devices, when they're not constantly being bothered."
00:27:41,00:27:45,Would you just leave me alone for a bit so I can think?
00:27:45,00:27:47,"OK, I'm going to go to the left."
00:27:50,00:27:57,You can make an infinite maze in a finite room if you use virtual reality.
00:27:57,00:28:00,And they've made these particular types of virtual reality.
00:28:00,00:28:01,"It is, but it's quite clever."
00:28:01,00:28:04,They've made these particular types of virtual reality.
00:28:04,00:28:07,And the illusion is so strong that people keep walking around.
00:28:07,00:28:10,And they don't realize they're going around in circles.
00:28:10,00:28:14,"So you're walking around in one room, but it feels like you've walked miles, but actually,"
00:28:14,00:28:14,you haven't.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"That's OK, that is really clever, isn't it?"
00:28:16,00:28:18,That's really cool.
00:28:18,00:28:23,That's because I saw a thing online about a Japanese janitor who had drawn a maze.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Did you read about this?
00:28:24,00:28:25,"Oh, yeah, do kind of remember it."
00:28:25,00:28:29,"His daughter dug it up in amongst his papers, just found it."
00:28:29,00:28:34,"It was a piece of paper, and she put it online, and everyone listening."
00:28:34,00:28:36,"If you want to see something amazing, just go look at it."
00:28:36,00:28:38,"It's the most intricate, and she sells it now."
00:28:38,00:28:41,She sells prints of it because it's so beautiful.
00:28:41,00:28:45,"And when you said infinite and it was in virtual, I kind of thought,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,"oh no, when you look at this, this looks like it just goes on."
00:28:47,00:28:49,You know when people say the coastlines are--
00:28:49,00:28:53,"It's the idea of fractals, so that the closer you look in at something, it just gets more"
00:28:53,00:28:54,and more complicated.
00:28:54,00:28:56,So it's just infinite in terms of--
00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
00:28:57,00:28:57,Wow.
00:28:57,00:29:04,"But to be fair, I bet that the corridors were pretty dirty."
00:29:04,00:29:09,No one can find anything in the school anymore.
00:29:09,00:29:12,I've found out about ways you can navigate if you are lost just in an urban area.
00:29:12,00:29:13,OK.
00:29:13,00:29:17,"One great way of doing it, satellite dishes almost all point in the same direction."
00:29:17,00:29:19,"In Britain, they almost all point to the southeast."
00:29:19,00:29:20,"Oh, wow."
00:29:20,00:29:26,"Also, going downhill is normally towards the river or the coast, if you're in a coastal place."
00:29:26,00:29:30,"And if you're lost in the morning, you can find a station by going against the flow of"
00:29:30,00:29:34,"people, because everyone's going to work from the station if you're in the centre of town."
00:29:34,00:29:35,And if you're lost in the--
00:29:35,00:29:37,"Oh, you might be going towards a huge fire."
00:29:37,00:29:38,Yes.
00:29:38,00:29:39,Yeah.
00:29:39,00:29:42,It's not a perfect system.
00:29:42,00:29:47,But let's end with some stupid reasons for calling 911 or 999.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"There was a man who received a letter asking him to attend a hospital appointment on Tuesday,"
00:29:51,00:29:56,"the 6th of February, and he called 999 to tell them that Tuesday wasn't the 6th."
00:29:56,00:29:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:57,00:30:03,"Oh, yeah, so I think the Cornish police force released a top ten list of the most ridiculous"
00:30:03,00:30:05,emergency calls they'd have.
00:30:05,00:30:07,And I think three of them were bird related.
00:30:07,00:30:11,"And so one of them was a woman saying, ""I can see a really rare bird sitting on top"
00:30:11,00:30:13,of a telegraph pole.
00:30:13,00:30:14,"Who shall I ring?"""
00:30:14,00:30:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:15,00:30:18,I read a thing on-- it's doing the rounds on the internet at the moment.
00:30:18,00:30:22,"It's not particularly funny, because it was a lady in distress, but it was a really interesting"
00:30:22,00:30:23,thing where--
00:30:23,00:30:29,"She called up 999911, and she goes, ""Hi, I'd like to just put in an order for a pizza,"
00:30:29,00:30:30,"ham and cheese."""
00:30:30,00:30:31,"She said, ""Signing pepperoni."""
00:30:31,00:30:32,"And they go, ""Sorry, ma'am."
00:30:32,00:30:33,"This is the police."""
00:30:33,00:30:34,"And she goes, ""Yeah, I know."
00:30:34,00:30:37,"I'd love to get a ham and cheese pizza, please."""
00:30:37,00:30:38,"And they go, ""What?"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"Sorry, you know this is the police?"""
00:30:40,00:30:45,"Yeah, so do you need me to tell you my location or do you know-- do you know-- is there something"
00:30:45,00:30:46,going on there?
00:30:46,00:30:47,"Yes, there is."
00:30:47,00:30:48,Yep.
00:30:48,00:30:49,How long will that be?
00:30:49,00:30:50,"Okay, ma'am."
00:30:50,00:30:51,We'll just find your location.
00:30:51,00:30:52,We'll be there very soon.
00:30:52,00:30:53,"Yep, quick, hurry."
00:30:53,00:30:54,We're very hungry.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Kind of thing.
00:30:55,00:30:56,Like she kept--
00:30:56,00:30:57,"Oh, really?"
00:30:57,00:30:58,It's me.
00:30:58,00:30:59,It's me.
00:30:59,00:31:00,It's a famous phone call that the guy who took the phone call released.
00:31:00,00:31:01,That's nice.
00:31:01,00:31:02,It was a domestic abuse call.
00:31:02,00:31:03,Right.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"And they tracked it, and they worked out that that guy had gotten trouble before twice"
00:31:06,00:31:07,for a domestic abuse.
00:31:07,00:31:10,"And they were like, ""This is definitely a sincere call."""
00:31:10,00:31:11,Right.
00:31:11,00:31:12,That is really--
00:31:12,00:31:13,"And well done for the operators, realising--"
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Yes, yeah."
