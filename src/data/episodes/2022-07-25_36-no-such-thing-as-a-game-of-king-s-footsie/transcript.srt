1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,760
 Yeah, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,600
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,720
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:22,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Ani Chazinski, and James Harkin.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,360
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here they are.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,560
 Chazinski, fact number one.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,600
 My point is that if you got into an argument in 18th century Aversinia,

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,400
 you could resolve it by blaming everything on the camel.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,480
 The camel.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,440
 On the camel, yeah.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,400
 Well, all arguments about who had eaten the hay.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,760
 I think it's another all crimes, but yeah, we're perpetrated by camels.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,440
 Blamed on the camel too much, he's bound to get the hump.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
 Hey, how long have you been planning that?

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,160
 Yeah, so this was first recorded in Bruce's travels into Aversinia to discover the source of the

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,640
 Nile. And this book was written between 1768 and 1773, and it was his travels around Africa,

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,920
 trying to find the source of the Nile.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
 And he observed this tradition.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,040
 Wow.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,120
 So what exactly does it involve?

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,400
 What he said was, he came across a town where the townspeople had been fighting for several days

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,200
 when it was agreed upon by the elders of both parties that nobody had been to blame on either side,

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,520
 but the whole wrong was the work of a camel.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,800
 And so the townspeople rounded up this camel, they chose a camel around him, I guess.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,320
 You can't round up one camel.

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
 Well, it was a very clever camel.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,000
 It was a criminal camel.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,600
 It was seized and everyone in the town gathered around and one by one, they speared the camel.

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 And he recalled that they upgraded the camel with all the wrongs done.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
 So they told the camel everything had done wrong, shouted at it for a while.

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,480
 Each one of them speared it, and then apparently it retired fully satisfied as to the wrongs

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
 they had received from the camel.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
 So yeah, there's quite a long history of blaming things on animals, isn't it?

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,400
 Like scapegoat, for instance, famous one.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,800
 There was a case in St. Kilda, I think, where a great orc was accused of being responsible for a storm

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,680
 that had ravaged St. Kilda. It was captured and put on trial and found guilty and stoned to death.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,960
 This is a real animal, presumably. Or it was like a bird, right?

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
 A UK is a bird, it's nuts.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,680
 No, it's extinct. That was one of the first things I ever researched with QI was the Great Orcs,

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,880
 I joined during the G-Series.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,520
 They used them for everything on St. Kilda, didn't they?

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,040
 Yes, they used filmers and gannets and orcs and they ate porridge for breakfast, which was,

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,400
 you know, sprinkled with great orc shavings and they had, they had, yeah.

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
 They used to go and kill them in their thousands, and the men would just walk around because they're

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,480
 flightless. They would go to the islands where they flocked, and they would just go around clubbing

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,880
 them to death because it saved ammunition, so you didn't have to waste bullets killing them.

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,080
 And then the last one was seen, you know, floating out at sea in the mid-19th century.

54
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,840
 And that was it, it's never been seen since.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,640
 Wow.

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,440
 Awkward.

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
 Oh my god.

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,240
 Ancient Egyptians used to, when, like, they felt they'd been particularly simple,

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,640
 used to sacrifice an animal and lump all their sins onto this animal and sacrifice it,

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,160
 and then they'd sell it to foreigners.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,160
 They'd sell it to great foreigners because they didn't want to eat the sin non.

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,680
 Classic to use the foreigner joke.

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,320
 So this was where we got the scapegoat from, is that right?

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,320
 Now the scapegoat is from the Torah, from Jewish folklore, I think, and what they would do is

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,840
 on the day of atonement, the Jewish high priest would lay his hands on alive goats, confess all the sins

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,440
 of the children of Israel and then send it away into the wilderness.

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,000
 There's like a Santa Claus who just gets the naughty list, but then has to deal with it.

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,760
 The ancient Greeks used people for this kind of purpose, didn't they?

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,960
 So they would have a person, I think it was often a disabled person, who they would, again,

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,000
 they'd pile all their sins upon this person and send him into exile.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
 And that would be that person taking their sins away.

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,480
 And he was called a pharma cos, which is where we get pharmacy.

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,120
 Pharmaceuticals is from, because he would remedy the sins of a community.

74
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
 Yes, it's amazing.

75
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,600
 Yeah, it's quite a cool word origin and sort of unpleasant.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,760
 Was there a reward for it beforehand? Did you live quite well before you were cast out?

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,760
 Yes, you did. You used to be treated as kind of a blessed and cursed.

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,640
 So they'd be preserved and they'd be, like, they'd be hosted around the village.

79
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,520
 Does that not make it worse? Because, like, the difference between being sent into the wilderness

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,280
 and just having a normal life is one thing, but the difference between that and having a really

81
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,640
 great life is even worse.

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,440
 Yeah.

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
 Well, Tom Hanks explores this theme in the film "Jo versus the Volcano," I believe.

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
 If you remember that one. I've seen that, no.

85
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,920
 I didn't know that was a great philosophical, three times of a film.

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,960
 And the QIs gain was news that reviews lots was there.

87
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,520
 Camels? Does anyone have anything about camels?

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,240
 I do.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,720
 Go on.

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,680
 Google, you know, Google Maps.

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,400
 I do, yeah.

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
 Yeah, so Street View?

93
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,400
 Yeah.

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
 They've had one camel with a camera on its back walking the Liwad Desert.

95
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,080
 That's good.

96
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
 Yeah, it's basically a camel who's mapped one of the deserts, one of the great deserts.

97
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,320
 One camel.

98
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,200
 Just one camel.

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,480
 That's a lot for a camel to do.

100
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,920
 Yeah. His name's Raffia.

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,640
 That's a great name.

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,520
 Yeah.

103
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
 150 kilometers southwest of Abu Dhabi.

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
 And, yeah, just went through it.

105
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,640
 Is it on its own?

106
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,520
 How do they know?

107
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,480
 How do they direct it?

108
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,440
 Well, in the picture that I've seen online, there's a dude walking it.

109
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,120
 You can train camels to go in certain directions by giving them food if they go in one way,

110
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
 and then they'll keep going there because they think that's where they'll find food.

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
 And that's a way that they transport drugs across the Sahara.

112
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,320
 Oh, yeah.

113
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,080
 They train these camels to walk from Western Africa all the way up to the Mediterranean.

114
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
 They train them and train them and train them.

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,160
 And then they put the drugs on the back of the camels and they don't need any human assistance at all.

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,760
 So if they get caught, if the camels get caught by the police, then there's no humans too.

117
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,080
 No, but again, camels getting blamed because they're the camels going to be the one that takes the rap.

118
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,960
 Camel milk is more nutritious than camel, isn't it?

119
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,440
 Is it?

120
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,920
 Yeah, I don't know why they don't drink it in Australia, for instance,

121
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
 where they've got more camels than anywhere else.

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
 Or they're all feral.

123
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
 They started selling in America.

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
 Why wouldn't you?

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,120
 Yeah, they do.

126
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,200
 And I think they're trying to make it into a baby milk as well.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,000
 Australia sells camels to Saudi Arabia.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
 Does it?

129
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,760
 Yeah.

130
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,800
 Saudi Arabia also imports sand for use in construction.

131
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,280
 Exactly.

132
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,960
 So the Saudi sand isn't good for construction, whereas the Australian one is.

133
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,840
 And also the Saudi camels are for breeding and racing,

134
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
 whereas the Australian ones are good for meat.

135
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,640
 I've got, I was looking into just general excuses because I do like that.

136
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,720
 That's the scapegoat, but it is also just a fantastic excuse to sort of say,

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 let's no longer argue about this stuff.

138
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,880
 And so, okay, so some of my favorite sporting excuses.

139
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
 Yeah, this one comes from US sprinter, Lachon Merritt.

140
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,560
 Oh, yeah.

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,240
 He was banned because he did a drug called DHEA.

142
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,320
 I'm not going to try and pronounce the longer version of that word.

143
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,600
 But he claims it wasn't to improve his performance.

144
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,880
 He claims, this is a quote, I was trying to make my penis bigger.

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,480
 It's he didn't realize that they had this kind of drug in it.

146
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,080
 It was to improve his performance, but it's just not an interesting one.

147
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,320
 Yeah, it would probably not help his spotting performance at all, would it?

148
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,160
 It's still, it could be where it could be a high jumper.

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,880
 This is an interesting one.

150
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
 I don't know, you know how high jump works.

151
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,640
 Yeah, you leave that behind, yeah.

152
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,840
 Here's another one.

153
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,360
 So, okay, there's a cyclist called Tyler Hamilton,

154
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
 who, do you know about this one?

155
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,160
 I know him.

156
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,040
 Okay, so he got busted because they'd found someone else's red blood cells.

157
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,760
 Oh, yeah, which suggested that there was all this thing about replacing your blood and stuff.

158
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,200
 His claim was that it was his unborn twin.

159
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,960
 He said that his mother had a twin who died.

160
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,760
 Weirdly, medical authorities have said that that's plausible.

161
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,720
 That could definitely happen.

162
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,640
 Yeah, it's called chimeraism, isn't it?

163
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,120
 How's it?

164
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,200
 And the idea is that you had two babies and then at a very, very early stage, one of them

165
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
 was enveloped into the other one.

166
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
 It could be even just when it's a few cells.

167
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,320
 And it means that you can sometimes people who have one eye, which is different color,

168
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,480
 that could be cut due to chimeraism.

169
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,960
 But also, yeah, it's really interesting actually.

170
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,280
 Yeah.

171
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,200
 Okay, so blaming people.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,560
 Blaming your mistakes on other people is socially contagious in the same way that a yarn is.

173
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,240
 So, they've done studies and they found that when you watch someone else blaming someone,

174
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,560
 then you will blame someone yourself.

175
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
 And that's more likely to happen.

176
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,480
 Wow.

177
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,240
 So, there can be a culture of blame.

178
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,920
 Yeah, that's amazing.

179
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,000
 Also, you just mentioned in your name because it made me yarn now.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,960
 So, thank you for that.

181
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,400
 Actually, I think it was probably that sort.

182
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,720
 Okay, time to move on to fact number two.

183
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,960
 And fact number two is my fact.

184
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,360
 My fact this week is that in ancient Greece, they used to play with yo-yos.

185
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,760
 Now, I know that everyone in this room is not surprised by that as I am.

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
 But I just find it amazing.

187
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,000
 It's incredible.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
 Yeah, eyes amazing.

189
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,440
 Oh, okay.

190
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
 Because James and Anna seem to know that.

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,920
 But I saw this.

192
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,120
 I went to a Wikipedia page.

193
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
 Yeah, I thought they just played with Xboxes.

194
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,920
 There's actually called them Kai boxes.

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
 Exciting, exciting.

196
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
 Very good.

197
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,320
 There's a vase and there's an illustration on this vase of someone from ancient Greece,

198
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
 a boy playing with the yo-yo.

199
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,480
 And I looked at that and I was like, what the hell is that doing there?

200
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,280
 It's really weird.

201
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,720
 It's so out of place in time for me.

202
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,880
 I'll say to James earlier, I feel like that's like, if I was looking for evidence of time travel.

203
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,400
 And I didn't know stuff about history, which now I know it's not time travel.

204
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
 But I didn't know that that was...

205
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,600
 I think that's the only one there is that jar, I think.

206
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,880
 And I don't think we have written evidence of it.

207
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,200
 So, and I don't think yo-yos reappeared until quite a lot later.

208
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
 So maybe he was a time traveler.

209
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
 Wow, and he made onto a vase.

210
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,400
 It makes you think as well that if you did get put back in ancient Greece as a time traveler,

211
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 then I know I have no uses.

212
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,760
 But I do know how to walk the dog and rock a cradle in yo-yos.

213
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
 I would instantly be Mr. Popular.

214
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,800
 You'd be on all the vases.

215
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
 I'd be on a planet.

216
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,880
 To be fair though, we only have that one vase,

217
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,080
 because almost all the vases in the world have been smashed from that time.

218
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
 So, yo-yos, by you.

219
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,040
 So maybe it's that maybe every single vase...

220
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,920
 How do yo-yos?

221
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
 ...in a piece of yo-yos on it.

222
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 But they do think they do think it appeared in ancient China way before.

223
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,920
 There's three locations that they kind of say it could belong to.

224
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,800
 Ancient Greece, ancient China and the Philippines.

225
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
 The Philippines is less so of a strong argument,

226
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
 except for the fact that they call it the yo-yo.

227
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,480
 And that's where America adopted the word yo-yo from.

228
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,880
 But in Philippines, they used it as a weapon.

229
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,680
 We thought on QI, certainly, that yo-yos were never used as weapons.

230
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,720
 And we got quite close to running it as a general ignorance on the show.

231
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
 And I don't think we did in the end.

232
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,680
 But then I read something by President Acquino III of the Philippines,

233
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
 and he reckons that they do have evidence that it was used as a weapon after all.

234
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,520
 So according to the president, it's true, but we still really don't think it.

235
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,400
 He said that their version that they used was large and with sharp edges and studs

236
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,720
 and attached to thick 20-foot ropes for flinging attendees or prey.

237
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,960
 I've heard a different etymology for yo-yo, which is the...

238
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,640
 It was known in France in the late 18th century as the Juju de Normandie,

239
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
 which just means a little toy.

240
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
 So that's another possible one.

241
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,480
 Okay.

242
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
 It's one that's, again, you look into the history of it,

243
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,040
 and suddenly it starts appearing everywhere.

244
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,520
 Napoleon's army, it says online, the...

245
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,640
 Fort with yo-yos.

246
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
 No, just used to play with them in the kind of downfall.

247
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,840
 Yeah, I read that Napoleon played.

248
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,680
 I mean, surely that's a myth.

249
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,200
 There are paintings of, yeah, the Napoleonic army, aren't there, with yo-yos.

250
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,000
 Almost all pictures of people playing with yo-yos in the 18th, 17th centuries are adults.

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
 And it was a really fashionable thing to do.

252
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,400
 You get Parisian ladies in the 18th century playing with yo-yos.

253
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,440
 It's so cool.

254
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
 As they're walking along with their parasols and their smart clothes.

255
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,920
 I think it was quite trendy.

256
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's so great. I just didn't know it was such a big deal, the yo-yo.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
 It was a big deal when I was a kid.

258
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,400
 Yeah, me too.

259
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,040
 Between the eighties, late eighties when I was a kid,

260
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
 it was massive in school.

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
 We all had yo-yos.

262
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
 Same in the nineties.

263
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,840
 It was when it was voted the biggest fad toy of the 20th century,

264
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,520
 because every childhood has had a yo-yo being a big part of it.

265
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,000
 Yeah, there was a massive one in 1988.

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,640
 And they, the company that made this particular type of yo-yo sold a couple of hundred in 1987

267
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,800
 and more than half a million in 1988.

268
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
 How come?

269
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,440
 It just became a massive fad and everyone in every school had to have one.

270
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,320
 The company that made them was called PMS International.

271
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,880
 It's a really pissed off woman looking for something to occupy her kids.

272
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,040
 You used to be able to become rich and famous for scale-extric in America.

273
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,240
 Yeah, it was massively popular in the 1960s.

274
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,040
 They used to show live tournaments on US TV.

275
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,920
 And there were more slot car facilities and there were bowling alleys in America.

276
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,120
 That's in the 1960s.

277
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,400
 And today, there are none.

278
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,680
 No way, yeah.

279
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
 What's a slot car?

280
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
 So it's like, you know, scale-extric.

281
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,960
 It's the same thing, it's just like...

282
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,840
 It just slots in on a little sort of plugs into the track.

283
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,600
 Another famous toy car, maybe the most famous toy car.

284
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
 Yeah, go on.

285
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,640
 Brum.

286
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,840
 Brum.

287
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,280
 Oh, wow, he's a cartoon from the Netherlands.

288
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,760
 Brum, the little car who goes on adventures.

289
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,560
 He's not a toy.

290
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,440
 What's the toy, you know?

291
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
 What about Hot Wheels?

292
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,520
 They were quite famous.

293
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,280
 Yeah, I was going for bigger.

294
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,080
 I was going for the Kozy Coop, you know, the one I mean, right?

295
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,040
 No, it's for the car.

296
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
 Is the red and yellow car...

297
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
 Oh, yes, you're all kids.

298
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,560
 You have that as a kid, yeah.

299
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,840
 There's a kid that you sit inside.

300
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,040
 Eyes for a kid.

301
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,840
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

302
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,880
 Yeah, one of those.

303
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
 So that has been the best-selling car in the US.

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
 It was throughout the '90s.

305
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
 And last time, the last also happened from 2008.

306
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,280
 In the US and the UK, it sells more than any other make-of-car.

307
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,000
 That's great.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
 That'd be great if that was the rescue plan for General Motors.

309
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,440
 Well, we've actually got a new model.

310
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
 We are very excited.

311
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,720
 And it's going to reinvigorate the American car in the street.

312
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
 Well, it's not a long way from smart cars, are they?

313
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
 No, that's true.

314
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
 Yeah, but they're closer to flinstone cars as well.

315
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,680
 Well, that's similar to the fact that Lego is supposed to be the largest

316
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,960
 tire manufacturer.

317
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,440
 Yeah.

318
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
 You know you can buy a Lego Nazi concentration camp.

319
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,640
 It's just been...

320
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,360
 Yeah, you can.

321
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,480
 Yeah, it was designed by an artist.

322
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,760
 And I think it was bought by the Warsaw Jewish Memorial Museum

323
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,320
 or something.

324
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
 And so it's not meant to be...

325
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
 Right, so it's not a commercial product?

326
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,280
 I don't think so.

327
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,160
 They've said that Lego people are getting angrier

328
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,520
 as the years go on out there.

329
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,000
 Yeah.

330
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,040
 You have expressions.

331
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,320
 Can I tell you about Twister?

332
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,120
 Yes, I love Twister.

333
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,560
 I love Twister so much.

334
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,360
 Did it in ancient times?

335
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
 This is not an ancient Greek game.

336
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,040
 No, no.

337
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,360
 That'll be correct.

338
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,200
 Yeah, it's on the other side of the bars where they've never lived.

339
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,040
 Well, they have ancient Persian rugs with the circles on that line of Greek.

340
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,640
 So, okay, the inventor is a guy called Reign Goya.

341
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,240
 Reign Goya, I think, is his name.

342
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
 I don't know how to pronounce it.

343
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
 But he wanted to call it pretzel.

344
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,840
 Although one of his initial names for it was King's FTSE.

345
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,120
 But the thing is it tanked when they first sold it

346
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
 because people thought it was risqué.

347
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
 Did they sell it a sex in the box or something like that?

348
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 Well, other people complained, supposedly,

349
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,640
 that other manufacturers, or possibly the bosses at the other firm, which made it.

350
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,480
 And they were going to give up.

351
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
 Sears didn't want it for their catalog.

352
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,600
 And one last ditch attempt they had was to get it on a TV show.

353
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,080
 And the PR firm pushing Twister got it onto the tonight show with Johnny Carson.

354
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,720
 And he played a round of it with Eva Gabor,

355
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
 who was a sex symbol at the time.

356
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,320
 And the next morning, the queue was 50 deep.

357
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,640
 And they sold 3 million that year.

358
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,040
 Wow.

359
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,120
 And it suddenly took off because that won appearance on TV.

360
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
 It's weird because toys, if they take off, they really take off.

361
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,320
 Yeah, especially toy helicopters.

362
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,360
 My little, I went to see my little niece recently.

363
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,400
 It was her birthday.

364
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,680
 And I was shocked that there's a whole new toy

365
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,320
 that's dominating everything in its looms.

366
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
 Looming is the biggest thing.

367
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
 Is that kind of like loom bands?

368
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,080
 Giant, weaving looms.

369
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,560
 Yes.

370
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,440
 And you use rubber bands, and you loom bands around your wrist.

371
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
 You make necklaces.

372
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,280
 All that.

373
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,400
 It's the biggest go.

374
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,080
 Walk by any kid's shop at the moment.

375
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,960
 Look in the window.

376
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,240
 It's all looms on display.

377
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
 Get this.

378
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
 In 2008, the National Toy Hall of Fame awarded

379
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
 oldest toy to the stick.

380
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,280
 Also, the cardboard boxes in that hall of fame.

381
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,760
 Is it?

382
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,240
 Yeah.

383
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,560
 Oh, I imagine that Christmas and your parents go,

384
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,440
 "Good news, we bought you something from the Toy Hall of Fame."

385
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,880
 Time for backing number three, and that is Andy.

386
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,000
 My fact this week is that most honey bee hives in the USA

387
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,560
 live on trucks, on flatbed trucks.

388
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,840
 They do not live in fields where you might think

389
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,600
 or in stationary apuries.

390
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
 Most bees in the USA are driven around

391
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,640
 and rented out so that they can pollinate plants.

392
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
 They never find a home.

393
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,040
 They just, the truck is their home.

394
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,600
 I think some, I don't know about how it happens during winter,

395
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
 but I think during the summer season,

396
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,000
 there are billions of bees being driven all over America.

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,120
 And they stop and they're released to pollinate a crop.

398
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,360
 And then they go back to the hive in the evening,

399
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,120
 or whenever it is they finish doing all the pollinating,

400
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,320
 and then away they go.

401
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,080
 They're dressed as a colony collapse.

402
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,680
 It's partly because of that.

403
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,920
 Yeah, although colony collapse has slowed down.

404
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,720
 They're not sure why.

405
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,160
 But even so, a third of all bees in America die each year.

406
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,920
 They think it's because of these chemicals

407
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,760
 used called neonicotinoids.

408
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
 I thought bees would die within a year.

409
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
 The lifespan is really variable,

410
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
 depending on how hard they work.

411
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 So I think as with people, I think we're all in our late 80s.

412
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,560
 I think worker bees in hot weather,

413
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,400
 where I think they have to work harder,

414
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,080
 and have a lifespan of about six weeks.

415
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
 And then if it's a cold year,

416
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,280
 then they can last about 10 months.

417
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
 They move around slowly, then they're sort of sluggish.

418
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
 The other thing I read about old bees

419
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,160
 is if you give them a job that normally young bees do,

420
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
 then their brains stop aging, or even reverse aging.

421
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,720
 They get younger, then.

422
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,480
 They're like doing Sudoku for them.

423
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,320
 Yeah, apart from I don't think the young people

424
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,680
 are doing Sudoku these days.

425
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,280
 If you started playing with looms,

426
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
 then your brain would go down.

427
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,480
 Or if you teach an old bee to play call of duty advanced warfare.

428
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
 Yeah, cool.

429
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
 And the brain chemistry can change, can't it?

430
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
 So I think honey bees do lots of jobs.

431
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,120
 So there are certain worker bees, adjust workers,

432
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,840
 and drone bees, et cetera.

433
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,520
 But honey bees do lots of jobs.

434
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,040
 And when they switch from one job to another,

435
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,880
 their actual brain chemistry changes.

436
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,440
 And I think they're one of the only animals it's known to do that

437
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
 in order to adapt them to the other job.

438
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,760
 But they do, so we do need them to pollinate our crops, do we?

439
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
 I think pollinate a third of the world's crops.

440
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,080
 They're responsible for $20 billion worth of food production

441
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,600
 in America alone, I think.

442
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,880
 Don't flies pollinate flowers more than bees do?

443
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,440
 No.

444
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
 Well, lots of other things do as well.

445
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,800
 So there are 20,000 species of bee,

446
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,520
 which know, and the honey bee is the one that gets all the press.

447
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
 So the agave plant, which tequila is made out of,

448
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,920
 is pollinated by bats.

449
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,880
 Yeah.

450
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,680
 The cocoa plant is pollinated by midges.

451
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,560
 Yeah, midges.

452
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,920
 But we're about to go through all the plants.

453
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
 That's what they pollinate.

454
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,320
 This is my, this is my last chance.

455
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,360
 This is my last chance.

456
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,720
 This is my last chance.

457
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
 I've never been invited to a party again.

458
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,960
 Are you drinking tequila?

459
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,840
 Oh, I can't help it.

460
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,040
 Noticing you're eating an orange.

461
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,520
 I wonder if I can tell you about the pull-in action of the orange.

462
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
 It's a peanut, fuck up.

463
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,680
 There is a bat.

464
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,080
 If you're listening to this, stop what you're doing

465
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,320
 in Google, the tube-lipped nectar bat,

466
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,200
 because it has the longest tongue proportional

467
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,880
 to its body look of any animal.

468
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,560
 It's longer, I think, than the animal itself,

469
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,320
 or it's 2/3 of the animal's length.

470
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
 And it has such a long tongue.

471
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
 It has to keep a bit of it in its rib cage.

472
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
 And they specialize in pollinating and drinking the nectar from

473
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,840
 these flowers with incredibly long trumpets.

474
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
 So that's what they have to do.

475
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
 They have to have this unbelievable tongue.

476
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
 Wow.

477
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
 I found a great headline to do with the trucks carrying all the bees.

478
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,320
 Oh, yeah.

479
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,280
 And the headline is this.

480
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
 It's someone who made a connection.

481
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
 Why are so many bee carrying trucks crashing?

482
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
 Apparently, in the last few years,

483
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,240
 there's been serious problems with these trucks

484
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,800
 that are carrying the bees overturning on the road,

485
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,640
 smashing down and releasing millions of bees into the road.

486
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,560
 Just millions swarming everywhere.

487
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,800
 Presumably, that happens mostly not on motorways,

488
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,520
 but on b-roads.

489
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
 I enjoyed that.

490
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,800
 So they crash, they crash.

491
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,760
 Yeah, they crash.

492
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,880
 And they release all these bees.

493
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
 It caused us hell for them.

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,960
 There was a really funny thing of there's been, like,

495
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,560
 2 to 3 of these major crashes, millions of bees throughout.

496
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,400
 At one time, another truck came along that crashed,

497
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
 but it wasn't carrying bees.

498
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,800
 It was carrying honey.

499
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,080
 And it spilled, so you're like, 200 gallons of honey,

500
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,760
 which attracted just thousands of swarms of bees.

501
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
 And so they had another bee crisis on their hand.

502
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
 And then you have to get them,

503
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,120
 the right ones back onto the truck, when you fix the truck,

504
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,560
 and you have to separate them.

505
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,600
 Plenty had a theory that if honey bees were caught outdoors at night,

506
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,520
 and they had to camp out, basically,

507
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,480
 and they would sleep on their backs to protect their wings from the dew.

508
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
 But in many ways--

509
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,360
 Which was rubbish, right?

510
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,280
 It was rubbish, yes, it was, and remains rubbish.

511
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,080
 Oh, god, see, that's hell.

512
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,360
 That's hell.

513
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,400
 Interesting.

514
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,600
 I was like, "But not true."

515
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,400
 That means--

516
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
 Have you heard of the superhero, the Red Bee?

517
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,840
 No, he's one of the worst superheroes of all time.

518
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
 I just-- I love him.

519
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
 And his identity is Rick Raleigh.

520
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,000
 He's an assistant district attorney in Oregon.

521
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,800
 And his motorcycle brandy is to put on a red and yellow costume.

522
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
 And he has trained bees with which he fights Nazis.

523
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,560
 And this is from the Wikipedia page for the Red Bee.

524
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,800
 His favorite bee is named Michael,

525
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,920
 and lives inside his belt buckle for use in special circumstance.

526
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,120
 This is so hard.

527
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,760
 OK, time for a final fact.

528
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,520
 And that is James.

529
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,120
 OK, my fact this week is the Sacramento Police Department

530
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,920
 get at least one call a week from people stuck in the world's largest corn maze.

531
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,720
 That's really funny.

532
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,920
 Wow.

533
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,120
 I could tell by the way you laughed.

534
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,040
 No, it was-- I just like the thought of it,

535
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
 of just the phone ringing in the station.

536
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,160
 So how big is this corn maze?

537
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,960
 It's 63 acres in size.

538
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,200
 So what do the police do when they're called?

539
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
 Often the police will get into the maze,

540
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,600
 and then they themselves will have to call it the bigger police.

541
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,480
 Yeah, until it's kind of like a conger line that they can actually find.

542
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
 Yeah, I think they just calm them down really,

543
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,320
 because it's mostly that people are like freaking out a little bit because they're stuck.

544
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,960
 OK.

545
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,960
 And then presumably the owners of the maze and can then go in and sort it out.

546
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
 There was-- it must be a nightmare of being like,

547
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,000
 OK, we shot at six.

548
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,160
 Kind of clock now, there's something there.

549
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,840
 We shot at six, but last entry is at 9.30 in the morning.

550
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,480
 That's when you know you're in a serious--

551
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,320
 There was a guy in England who had a maze.

552
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
 It was quite-- it wasn't like a big like corn one.

553
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,000
 It was a small one.

554
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,680
 And he was mowing it.

555
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,880
 He was mowing the path.

556
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
 And he got to about halfway through.

557
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,280
 And then he realized he had to go to his daughter's school thing.

558
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
 And so he had to leave.

559
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
 But he couldn't get out of his own maze.

560
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,520
 And so he just used his lawn mower and just plowed straight through

561
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,960
 and gave himself an exit.

562
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,560
 Oh, that's the worst maze now.

563
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,960
 Yeah, exactly. He said-- I've just found the article.

564
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,720
 He said, "I'd already had feedback suggesting the maze was tricky to negotiate

565
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
 before I became lost myself.

566
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
 Next year, I think I'll make it a bit easier."

567
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,280
 Next year, I'll listen to the bloody feedback.

568
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,080
 But yeah, mazes, in general, they're pretty good on that.

569
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,240
 I love mazes. I've been on mazes for ages.

570
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,360
 I don't think I've ever been to a maze.

571
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,160
 Really? I don't know.

572
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,120
 Let's all get a Hampton Court.

573
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,560
 In Germany, mazes are called "Irgarten" or "Era Gardens."

574
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,360
 Oh, yeah.

575
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,000
 How good is that?

576
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,600
 Yeah. That's good.

577
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
 But they used to be-- so mazes grow out of labyrinths, is that right?

578
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,840
 Yeah, so labyrinth is a maze with only one entrance and exit.

579
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,040
 So you can't get lost in it.

580
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,880
 You just go straight and you come straight back out.

581
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,360
 Well, lots of mazes have surely got only one exit and entrance.

582
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,560
 Do you mean-- Sorry, they're half.

583
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
 No, no, no, no.

584
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,840
 Yeah, so you walk in and you keep walking.

585
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,160
 Yeah.

586
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
 You get to the middle and then you get back out again.

587
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
 And there's no way you can't turn left or right.

588
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,360
 You just have to go in that direction.

589
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
 I see.

590
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
 Because yeah, there's all the stuff about the labyrinth

591
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,200
 that greet with thesis in the mind at all.

592
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
 But you wouldn't get lost in that.

593
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
 You wouldn't even need a thread.

594
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,680
 So labyrinth just effectively a more complicated walk.

595
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,360
 What was the purpose behind it?

596
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,600
 So actually, it does look nice.

597
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,400
 But people used it for like religious reasons sometimes

598
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,640
 or because it's a very particular pattern.

599
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,840
 One way that you could do it is you would walk in and on the way

600
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,200
 into the center of the labyrinth.

601
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,920
 You would be thinking about your problems

602
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,240
 and then the way out you would think about your solutions.

603
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,560
 It's also the contemplative thing.

604
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,960
 Apparently like also Norwegian sailors would go through

605
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,360
 these mazes just before they went.

606
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,200
 They would be good luck.

607
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,960
 So they used it as a charm thing sometimes as well.

608
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,000
 I read another theory either symbolising

609
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,840
 the hard life of an early Christian

610
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,720
 or showing the entanglements of sin or my favourite.

611
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,960
 You would be like doing a mini pilgrimage

612
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,600
 if you were committed to small sin.

613
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,440
 Go to Hampton course.

614
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,560
 But like, it's cheating because labyrinths are quite fun.

615
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,640
 Or mazes are quite fun.

616
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,560
 But I think it's like go and have a long walk

617
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,360
 and think about what you've done.

618
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,560
 I suppose so.

619
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,840
 Yeah, that's it.

620
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,440
 Gone a long walk, but stay within this.

621
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,320
 Stay within sight of me.

622
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,280
 We close at six.

623
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,760
 I think they've found a maze in Peru

624
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,680
 that's more than 3,000 years old, I think.

625
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,560
 So it's in the Peruvian Andes

626
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,480
 and it's beneath Chavinda Huantar,

627
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,320
 which is this ancient site.

628
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,080
 And the whole maze is underground

629
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
 and they think that it has a ceremonial

630
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
 like massive and disorienting acoustic chamber.

631
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,760
 Because if you go down into it,

632
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,040
 the way that it's built means that your voice bounces off the walls

633
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,160
 madly and like if someone else in another part of the maze,

634
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
 you can never find them and you think

635
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,600
 they're coming from a different direction.

636
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,160
 And if you're above the maze, it sounds absolutely terrifying.

637
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,120
 And they found at this site all these kind of trumpet things.

638
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,960
 And if you blow the trumpets, it sounds like a torture thing.

639
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,320
 Yeah, I think so, yeah.

640
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,840
 So you get lost in this maze and also sounds are coming from everywhere.

641
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,160
 There's an old Scandinavian punishment

642
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,120
 called the Cave of Roses.

643
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,960
 And that was, you would go into a dark cave

644
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,720
 and then they would throw a load of poisonous animals at you

645
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,200
 and you'd just have to stay there for a while

646
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,840
 and then come out and hopefully not be bitten.

647
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,680
 Really?

648
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,520
 It's a bit like I'm a celebrity kind of.

649
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,440
 Yeah.

650
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
 Cave of Roses is a misleading title.

651
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
 It looks.

652
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,560
 They all have misleading names, torture equipments,

653
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
 because you very rarely get one

654
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,520
 called the incruciating footcutter-offer thing.

655
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,000
 There's one called the pair of anguish, which is a piece of metal, right?

656
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,080
 And it gets put into your mouth and then I think it's expanded

657
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,360
 and it hurts your door terribly, or it's heated and, you know, it's all--

658
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,000
 But the pair, you know, oh, pair.

659
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,480
 Oh, I have a pair of anguish, not so good.

660
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,960
 If a judge has a bit of a knife

661
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,800
 for the amateur dramatic side of things, he's sent.

662
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,600
 I sent it to you to eat a pair of anguish.

663
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,040
 People make noises and do weird things.

664
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,480
 And finally, I think I said you something recently,

665
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,480
 down of Brian Blatt's face was turned into a maze slash a circle thing.

666
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,160
 That's right, yes.

667
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,880
 It's pretty great.

668
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,600
 Yeah.

669
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,720
 In the November, 2004, election in America, a farmer carved giant faces

670
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,720
 of John Kerry and President Bush into his cornfield in Pleasant Grove, in Utah,

671
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,520
 which I just think when farmers do that, you're ruining your crops, right?

672
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,880
 Yeah, they do it to bring in tourists and stuff, don't they?

673
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
 Dragonly make that up.

674
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,400
 Well, I mean, let's all go and see John Kerry's massive face.

675
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,480
 Yeah, massive drawer.

676
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,600
 In a place formally known as Pleasant Grove.

677
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,400
 By studying sheep in mazes, they've found that when left to their own devices,

678
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,800
 sheep tends to turn to the left.

679
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,960
 When they're left to their own devices, when they're not constantly being bothered.

680
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,520
 Would you just leave me alone for a bit so I can think?

681
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,920
 OK, I'm going to go to the left.

682
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:57,040
 You can make an infinite maze in a finite room if you use virtual reality.

683
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,280
 And they've made these particular types of virtual reality.

684
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,880
 It is, but it's quite clever.

685
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,440
 They've made these particular types of virtual reality.

686
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,920
 And the illusion is so strong that people keep walking around.

687
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,160
 And they don't realize they're going around in circles.

688
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,080
 So you're walking around in one room, but it feels like you've walked miles, but actually,

689
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,600
 you haven't.

690
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 That's OK, that is really clever, isn't it?

691
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,200
 That's really cool.

692
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,440
 That's because I saw a thing online about a Japanese janitor who had drawn a maze.

693
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,200
 Did you read about this?

694
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,760
 Oh, yeah, do kind of remember it.

695
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,280
 His daughter dug it up in amongst his papers, just found it.

696
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,120
 It was a piece of paper, and she put it online, and everyone listening.

697
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,480
 If you want to see something amazing, just go look at it.

698
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,960
 It's the most intricate, and she sells it now.

699
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,880
 She sells prints of it because it's so beautiful.

700
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,040
 And when you said infinite and it was in virtual, I kind of thought,

701
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,480
 oh no, when you look at this, this looks like it just goes on.

702
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,960
 You know when people say the coastlines are--

703
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,920
 It's the idea of fractals, so that the closer you look in at something, it just gets more

704
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
 and more complicated.

705
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,440
 So it's just infinite in terms of--

706
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
 Yeah.

707
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,440
 Wow.

708
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,920
 But to be fair, I bet that the corridors were pretty dirty.

709
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,160
 No one can find anything in the school anymore.

710
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,840
 I've found out about ways you can navigate if you are lost just in an urban area.

711
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
 OK.

712
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,440
 One great way of doing it, satellite dishes almost all point in the same direction.

713
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,920
 In Britain, they almost all point to the southeast.

714
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
 Oh, wow.

715
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,600
 Also, going downhill is normally towards the river or the coast, if you're in a coastal place.

716
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,800
 And if you're lost in the morning, you can find a station by going against the flow of

717
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,520
 people, because everyone's going to work from the station if you're in the centre of town.

718
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
 And if you're lost in the--

719
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,680
 Oh, you might be going towards a huge fire.

720
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
 Yes.

721
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
 Yeah.

722
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,920
 It's not a perfect system.

723
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,680
 But let's end with some stupid reasons for calling 911 or 999.

724
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,960
 There was a man who received a letter asking him to attend a hospital appointment on Tuesday,

725
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,200
 the 6th of February, and he called 999 to tell them that Tuesday wasn't the 6th.

726
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
 [LAUGHTER]

727
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,680
 Oh, yeah, so I think the Cornish police force released a top ten list of the most ridiculous

728
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
 emergency calls they'd have.

729
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,640
 And I think three of them were bird related.

730
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,720
 And so one of them was a woman saying, "I can see a really rare bird sitting on top

731
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,040
 of a telegraph pole.

732
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,600
 Who shall I ring?"

733
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
 [LAUGHTER]

734
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,080
 I read a thing on-- it's doing the rounds on the internet at the moment.

735
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,400
 It's not particularly funny, because it was a lady in distress, but it was a really interesting

736
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
 thing where--

737
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,760
 She called up 999911, and she goes, "Hi, I'd like to just put in an order for a pizza,

738
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
 ham and cheese."

739
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
 She said, "Signing pepperoni."

740
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
 And they go, "Sorry, ma'am.

741
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
 This is the police."

742
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
 And she goes, "Yeah, I know.

743
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,000
 I'd love to get a ham and cheese pizza, please."

744
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And they go, "What?

745
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Sorry, you know this is the police?"

746
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,740
 Yeah, so do you need me to tell you my location or do you know-- do you know-- is there something

747
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
 going on there?

748
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
 Yes, there is.

749
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
 Yep.

750
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
 How long will that be?

751
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
 Okay, ma'am.

752
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
 We'll just find your location.

753
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
 We'll be there very soon.

754
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
 Yep, quick, hurry.

755
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
 We're very hungry.

756
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
 Kind of thing.

757
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
 Like she kept--

758
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
 Oh, really?

759
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,740
 It's me.

760
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
 It's me.

761
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,740
 It's a famous phone call that the guy who took the phone call released.

762
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
 That's nice.

763
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
 It was a domestic abuse call.

764
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,740
 Right.

765
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,440
 And they tracked it, and they worked out that that guy had gotten trouble before twice

766
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
 for a domestic abuse.

767
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,160
 And they were like, "This is definitely a sincere call."

768
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
 Right.

769
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
 That is really--

770
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
 And well done for the operators, realising--

771
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
 Yes, yeah.

772
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
 Yeah.

773
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,400
 In June of this year, a woman in Birmingham, phone 999, because she was unhappy with how many sprinkles

774
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,760
 she had been given on her ice cream, and they were all on the wrong side, as well.

775
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,720
 Maybe she found 99.

776
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,720
 Okay, that's it.

777
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
 That's all of our facts.

778
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,200

 We're going to be back again next week with another episode.

787
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
 No such thing as a push.

788
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
 We'll catch you then.

789
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
 Good bye.
