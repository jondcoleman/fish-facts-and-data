00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:17,00:00:21,"of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:21,00:00:24,this week coming to you live from Redding.
00:00:24,00:00:27,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:31,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:31,00:00:33,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:41,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:41,00:00:44,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:44,00:00:48,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:48,00:00:51,"- My fact is that the 1890s Irish rugby captain,"
00:00:51,00:00:55,"D.B. Walkington, would play wearing a monocle,"
00:00:55,00:00:57,but he took it out if he had to tackle anyone.
00:00:57,00:00:58,(audience laughing)
00:00:58,00:01:01,This is a real person.
00:01:01,00:01:04,"He was called Dollaway Bell Walkington, born in 1867."
00:01:04,00:01:06,He played for Ireland eight times.
00:01:06,00:01:07,"He was the captain twice,"
00:01:07,00:01:08,and he wore a monocle while he was playing.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"He was extremely short-sighted,"
00:01:10,00:01:13,"and he'd just pop it in, pop along, pop it out,"
00:01:13,00:01:15,"make a tackle, pop it back in."
00:01:15,00:01:16,What a hero.
00:01:16,00:01:19,"- Yeah, this guy was a great player,"
00:01:19,00:01:20,"wasn't he, for Ireland?"
00:01:20,00:01:24,"He played in the first ever team to beat Wales in 1888,"
00:01:24,00:01:25,although the Welsh team all claimed
00:01:25,00:01:28,to have had sea sickness on the day.
00:01:28,00:01:29,(audience laughing)
00:01:29,00:01:31,And they played so badly in that game
00:01:31,00:01:34,that eight of the team never represented Wales ever again.
00:01:34,00:01:36,- Wow. - Oh my God.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"- He played in the 1887 team that beat England,"
00:01:39,00:01:42,so that was the first Ireland team ever to beat England.
00:01:42,00:01:45,And there was another guy in that team called John Macaulay.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"And John Macaulay, so they had to go to England"
00:01:47,00:01:50,"to play the game, but he couldn't get the time off work,"
00:01:50,00:01:54,"and so he said to his work, ""I'm gonna go and get married."""
00:01:54,00:01:55,"And they said, ""Are you?"""
00:01:55,00:01:57,"And they went, ""Okay, I'm gonna have to get married now."""
00:01:57,00:02:00,So he got married just so that he could get two weeks off
00:02:00,00:02:02,so he could play this game.
00:02:02,00:02:03,Oh my God.
00:02:03,00:02:04,- Wow. - Isn't that amazing?
00:02:04,00:02:05,- That's incredible.
00:02:05,00:02:07,- Did he get married just to a randomer?
00:02:07,00:02:09,"- No, to his future wife."
00:02:09,00:02:10,"- I mean, I know."
00:02:10,00:02:12,(audience laughing)
00:02:12,00:02:13,I know that.
00:02:13,00:02:16,- She was happy with the arrangement.
00:02:16,00:02:16,- They were going out.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"They were seeing each other. - They were going out, yeah."
00:02:18,00:02:18,"They were a couple, right?"
00:02:18,00:02:21,"- But rugby players, especially 19th century rugby players,"
00:02:21,00:02:24,just seemed like really interesting and fun people.
00:02:24,00:02:26,Have you heard of Edward Pegg?
00:02:26,00:02:27,- No.
00:02:27,00:02:30,- Pegg was a Welsh player and he once missed the team train.
00:02:30,00:02:32,They were going to Devon to play a match.
00:02:32,00:02:33,He missed the train.
00:02:33,00:02:35,So what do you think he did?
00:02:35,00:02:36,"- Well, got the next train."
00:02:36,00:02:38,- He chartered a special train to catch up
00:02:38,00:02:40,with the previous train.
00:02:40,00:02:45,- Was it like two men just pumping up and down?
00:02:45,00:02:46,- Yeah.
00:02:46,00:02:50,"- But did he, he didn't jump onto the train in front of us?"
00:02:50,00:02:51,"- No, he wasn't the Indiana Jones."
00:02:51,00:02:52,"- Yeah, right. - No, he was, yeah, yeah."
00:02:52,00:02:54,"- Yeah, it was, I mean, because back then"
00:02:54,00:02:56,"the rules were all a bit wishy washy, weren't they?"
00:02:56,00:02:58,So like there was a famous match in the 1884
00:02:58,00:03:00,home nations championship.
00:03:00,00:03:01,It was Wales versus Ireland.
00:03:01,00:03:04,Ireland went over to play the Welsh.
00:03:04,00:03:05,"When they got there though,"
00:03:05,00:03:07,they didn't have enough men to play the match.
00:03:07,00:03:09,So the Welsh team had to loan them
00:03:09,00:03:12,two of their players to play the game.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"- Did they, did they win?"
00:03:13,00:03:15,"'Cause you would have thought those two players,"
00:03:15,00:03:18,"if they're gentlemen, they'll play well."
00:03:18,00:03:19,"And if they're not, they'll jeopardize your chances."
00:03:19,00:03:21,"- Yeah, no, the Welsh won that match."
00:03:21,00:03:23,So even though the Irish got the two.
00:03:23,00:03:25,"- That's what you'd expect. - Yeah, the Welsh still won."
00:03:25,00:03:27,- The first international between England and Scotland
00:03:27,00:03:28,was in 1871.
00:03:28,00:03:30,It was quite a boring affair.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"It came down, it was quite close as well towards the end."
00:03:33,00:03:35,And Scotland scored the only try of the match
00:03:35,00:03:37,towards the second half.
00:03:37,00:03:39,But the English team were not happy.
00:03:39,00:03:41,"They were like, this is not fair."
00:03:41,00:03:42,And so there was a massive argument
00:03:42,00:03:45,between the referee and the two teams.
00:03:45,00:03:48,Eventually the referee gave the try to Scotland.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"And afterwards, when they asked him about it,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"the referee, Dr. Rowland, he was called."
00:03:52,00:03:55,"He said, ""I do not know whether my decision was correct."""
00:03:55,00:03:57,"He said, ""But when an umpire is in doubt,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,"""I think he is justified in deciding against the team"
00:04:00,00:04:02,"""which makes the most noise."""
00:04:02,00:04:05,(LAUGHTER)
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Good point. - That's fair.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"The days before Hawkeye,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,he had to have something else to judge.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"In 1889, the Kiwis came over."
00:04:12,00:04:13,So it's kind of amazing.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"Even back then, you know, it was already big enough"
00:04:15,00:04:17,that people were making these international trips.
00:04:17,00:04:19,And it was New Zealand versus England.
00:04:19,00:04:20,It was in Blackheath.
00:04:20,00:04:24,And there was this incident where an English player was tackled
00:04:24,00:04:26,and his shorts got ripped off accidentally.
00:04:26,00:04:29,"- And it was very awkward for him. - Oi, oi."
00:04:29,00:04:31,- The Kiwi players... - And he's put his monocle in.
00:04:31,00:04:32,What's going on here?
00:04:32,00:04:35,(LAUGHTER)
00:04:35,00:04:37,"'Cause the good, honest players,"
00:04:37,00:04:40,"the Kiwis surrounded him, making him a little changing room"
00:04:40,00:04:42,"so that he could put his pants back on again,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,his shorts back on again.
00:04:43,00:04:47,"As this was happening, all the other English players continued to play."
00:04:47,00:04:50,"One of them, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try,"
00:04:50,00:04:54,"completely unopposed, 'cause the Kiwi players are protecting that guy."
00:04:54,00:04:58,"And then the Kiwi players understandably stormed off,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,"bit pissed off, and had to apologise afterwards"
00:05:00,00:05:02,for abandoning the game.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"- Wow! - Oh, wow!"
00:05:03,00:05:06,- That was not a good game for them. - Yeah.
00:05:06,00:05:07,I've found someone who I think might be the most
00:05:07,00:05:11,historically significant rugby player of all time.
00:05:11,00:05:13,- Ooh! - Not because of anything he did on the pitch.
00:05:13,00:05:17,"He was called Charles Kathcart, and he was a Scotland player."
00:05:17,00:05:19,He had a brief career playing for Scotland.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"Then he became a doctor, and then a surgeon,"
00:05:21,00:05:24,"and then a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons,"
00:05:24,00:05:25,who was very senior and eminent.
00:05:25,00:05:31,"And what he did was, he pioneered the use of sphagnum moss."
00:05:31,00:05:34,- Jesus! - To dress wounds!
00:05:34,00:05:35,And that was used in the First World War.
00:05:35,00:05:38,There were a million wounds dressed per month
00:05:38,00:05:40,"at the height of the First World War,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,thanks to his innovation that it could soak up so much liquid.
00:05:42,00:05:45,"- And that is my rugby fact. - I was like,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"""Finally, a fact about sport."""
00:05:47,00:05:50,"You can start talking about sport, and not fucking moss."
00:05:50,00:05:52,"Sorry, but that's... I mean, it's so interesting."
00:05:52,00:05:56,"All the early rugby players, particularly the Irish team"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"and the in that late 1800s,"
00:05:57,00:06:01,went on to become quite prominent scientists.
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Like, if you look at that team,"
00:06:02,00:06:05,so there was a guy called Sir Thomas Rankin-Lyle.
00:06:05,00:06:08,He was an Aussie/Irish who moved to Australia.
00:06:08,00:06:10,One of the awards that gets given in science
00:06:10,00:06:13,to this day in Australia is named after him.
00:06:13,00:06:15,He was a real pioneer in science.
00:06:15,00:06:17,There was a guy called Daniel Frederick Rambout.
00:06:17,00:06:19,He played again in the 1800s.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"He was an Irish psychiatrist,"
00:06:21,00:06:24,"and he was one of the pioneers, a modern psychiatry."
00:06:24,00:06:26,"All of these guys, like, a big portion of them"
00:06:26,00:06:29,went on to be game changers in the world of medicine.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"That guy, Daniel Rambo, he had the nickname"
00:06:31,00:06:33,"""The Fat Little Fellow."""
00:06:33,00:06:34,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:34,00:06:37,And he played in the same team as the Monocle guy.
00:06:37,00:06:42,"And he played rugby, international rugby, for Ireland,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,but never told his parents.
00:06:44,00:06:45,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:45,00:06:48,Isn't that amazing? His parents didn't know.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"Why? Because he was worried that if he told them,"
00:06:50,00:06:51,"they might stop him from doing it,"
00:06:51,00:06:54,cos they thought they would kind of interfere with his studies.
00:06:54,00:06:56,Oh. So he just refused to tell them.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"Was he funny or so funny? Where have you been, nowhere?"
00:06:59,00:07:00,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:00,00:07:01,Why are you covered in mud?
00:07:01,00:07:04,Whose monocle is that? No one's.
00:07:04,00:07:07,Where are your pants? (LAUGHTER)
00:07:07,00:07:09,Wasn't there one player on the team who had one hand?
00:07:09,00:07:11,I think there was on the same team.
00:07:11,00:07:13,Thomas Gisborne Gordon. Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:15,Only ever players have played international rugby
00:07:15,00:07:16,"with only one hand. Wow, really?"
00:07:16,00:07:19,"He was really so funny. There is a thing in rugby called a hand-off,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"where you kind of push someone away,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,but he literally had his hand-off.
00:07:23,00:07:26,Do you think he just misinterpreted that rule
00:07:26,00:07:28,in the changing room before the match?
00:07:28,00:07:31,I found a guy who I think Dan might like.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"Oh, yeah. So this is..."
00:07:32,00:07:36,This was a story in The Times about great old rugby players
00:07:36,00:07:39,"by Alistair Reed, and it was a rugby player called Graham Donald."
00:07:39,00:07:41,"He played for Scotland, and then the First World War broke out,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"cutting short his career, but he signed up."
00:07:43,00:07:44,He was in the RAF.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"And he was, I think, on a training flight,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,and he was doing a loop-the-loop in his plane.
00:07:49,00:07:51,"Oh! Jesus, man!"
00:07:51,00:07:53,"And what? Safety belt snapped. Oh, my God!"
00:07:53,00:07:56,"Oh, no. Come on. And he fell out of the plane."
00:07:56,00:07:58,"No, no, no, no. This is amazing."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"He fell 2,000 feet."
00:08:00,00:08:03,He landed on the top wing of his own plane.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"Yeah, yeah. This is okay."
00:08:05,00:08:06,Never happened. Never happened.
00:08:06,00:08:09,I said this a long time ago. I've been given shit about it.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"I swear it's true. I've read multiple accounts,"
00:08:11,00:08:14,"so he was doing the loop-the-loop at the top, seatbelt snaps,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"he plummets down, but, fortunately,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"his plane is continuing the loop-the-loop,"
00:08:18,00:08:23,"comes back around, and he lands back in it, and he survives."
00:08:23,00:08:25,No. It's not going to make us believe it more
00:08:25,00:08:28,just because Andy's now also said it.
00:08:28,00:08:32,Two out of four. Come back in a couple of years.
00:08:32,00:08:34,No chance. You'll get us eventually.
00:08:34,00:08:37,"In Samoa, they play a lot of rugby,"
00:08:37,00:08:41,and the Samoan Times in 1926 reported on an international match
00:08:41,00:08:44,"against Tonga, one of the early matches they played,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"and the report went like this,"
00:08:46,00:08:49,"""Apologies, our rugby correspondent has failed us this week"
00:08:49,00:08:52,"""and owing to a previous engagement at a hopscotch match"
00:08:52,00:08:56,"""near the market hall, did not see the rugby game."""
00:08:56,00:08:59,"Oh, my God."
00:08:59,00:09:04,"Was rugby underappreciated, then, or was hopscotch a huge sport?"
00:09:04,00:09:06,"Guys, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:09:06,00:09:08,"Can I get one more player? Yeah, go for it."
00:09:08,00:09:10,"This guy called Tom Youngs from this year,"
00:09:10,00:09:14,"a modern rugby player, plays for Leicester,"
00:09:14,00:09:17,"and he plays, you know, in the front line of the scrum"
00:09:17,00:09:18,"that you've got, is it what?"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"Two props, and the hooker is the position in the middle"
00:09:20,00:09:23,because you hook the ball back with your foot is the idea.
00:09:23,00:09:26,And he was in the news for some reason.
00:09:26,00:09:28,He was being charged with some disciplinary action.
00:09:28,00:09:30,But an American news website writing it up
00:09:30,00:09:33,"seems to have had some auto-replacement software on,"
00:09:33,00:09:38,"because it wrote, ""Lester Tiger's prostitute charged by RFU."""
00:09:38,00:09:44,We don't know that he wasn't a prostitute.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"No, that's true."
00:09:46,00:09:48,And this keeps happening.
00:09:48,00:09:51,"There's a player called Ross Batty, who also plays as a hooker,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"and they wrote about him,"
00:09:53,00:09:59,"""Barth Hall announces medical retirement from a matter of running."""
00:09:59,00:10:02,"All right, look, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:10:02,00:10:05,"It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:10:05,00:10:07,My fact this week is that the engineers
00:10:07,00:10:11,who sent the first woman into space forgot to give her two things.
00:10:11,00:10:17,"One, a toothbrush, and two, the ability to return back to Earth."
00:10:17,00:10:19,(LAUGHTER)
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Wow, so she's still out there?"
00:10:21,00:10:24,-Still there? -Boasting around with rotten tea.
00:10:24,00:10:27,So this was a cosmonaut called Valentina Tereshkova.
00:10:27,00:10:31,"She went up into space in 1963, first woman ever to do it."
00:10:31,00:10:37,"And the program inside the craft had in it the program to ascend,"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"but not to descend, not to come back into Earth."
00:10:40,00:10:43,And she was hours up there when she suddenly noticed
00:10:43,00:10:46,"that she had no ability to get back to Earth,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"had to call back down to Earth and say,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"""Hey, uh..."""
00:10:50,00:10:52,-Tiny thing. -Tiny thing.
00:10:52,00:10:55,We'll get to the toothbrush later.
00:10:55,00:10:57,But can you give me the code to get back to Earth?
00:10:57,00:11:00,"And they had to send it up to her, and she had to plug it back in."
00:11:00,00:11:03,"And fortunately, it worked, and she was able to come back down."
00:11:03,00:11:06,"But had they not had the ability for her to reprogram it,"
00:11:06,00:11:08,she would have just been stuck up there.
00:11:08,00:11:12,"Yeah, it was like literally the difference between going up or going down, wasn't it?"
00:11:12,00:11:15,"It was like she pressed, ""Okay, go back to Earth now."""
00:11:15,00:11:18,"-And they just get in further and further away. -Oh, that's so stressful."
00:11:18,00:11:23,It's like being on an inflatable and just bobbing a bit far out to sea.
00:11:23,00:11:25,-Yeah. -It's a bit like that.
00:11:25,00:11:28,Maybe it's even more stressful than that. I don't know.
00:11:28,00:11:32,That's in the interview. That's exactly what she said.
00:11:32,00:11:36,"She was like, ""Oh, you know Andy, when he was on holiday, it was like that, only not as bad."""
00:11:36,00:11:40,"And even worse, it really rubbed salt in the toothbrush wound, I guess."
00:11:40,00:11:44,"Because if you know you were going to be without a toothbrush for three days or whatever, however long it was,"
00:11:44,00:11:45,that's kind of okay.
00:11:45,00:11:47,But when you know it's going to be forever.
00:11:47,00:11:49,-Yeah. -That's way worse.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"So she was up there orbiting the Earth for three days,"
00:11:52,00:11:57,and then the way it worked back in the day was there was no exact science to where you were going to land.
00:11:57,00:12:01,"So what you had to do was you descended back into Earth, you came down,"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"and you literally ejected yourself at a good height with a parachute,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,and then you just landed wherever you landed.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"And she landed in a small town in Kazakhstan,"
00:12:10,00:12:14,"and some local villagers came, found her, got her out of her suit,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,because it's really hard to get out of.
00:12:16,00:12:19,"-And then she just had... -Whoa, God, you need to brush those teeth."
00:12:19,00:12:22,Put that helmet back on now.
00:12:22,00:12:26,"Yeah, and then she just had dinner with them while, I guess, everyone with the space agency"
00:12:26,00:12:27,was just trying to locate her.
00:12:27,00:12:30,"She got in a lot of trouble for that, Tereshka, actually,"
00:12:30,00:12:35,because they didn't know if she'd caught some space cooties or something while she was out there.
00:12:35,00:12:41,So coming down and going straight to see these peasants was a real no-no.
00:12:41,00:12:42,"Yeah, wow."
00:12:42,00:12:47,She logged in that flight more flight time than the combined times of all other American astronauts
00:12:47,00:12:50,who had been in space up to that date.
00:12:50,00:12:51,"Up to that date, right."
00:12:51,00:12:54,And the weird thing about it is another woman didn't go to space for 20 years.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"-So odd, isn't it? -She used up all the flight time."
00:12:57,00:12:58,That was it.
00:12:58,00:12:59,-Selfish? -Selfish.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"Shouldn't have demanded that extension, should she?"
00:13:01,00:13:04,The other thing about when she landed is...
00:13:04,00:13:08,"So she did land, and then she went to see these people and had dinner with them."
00:13:08,00:13:11,"But obviously, the Soviet Union had propaganda to sort out, right?"
00:13:11,00:13:12,And so what they did was...
00:13:12,00:13:15,And she had a bruise on her face because it was quite a tough landing.
00:13:15,00:13:18,"So they came and gave her a load of makeup, shoved her back into the capsule,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,"and said, ""Okay, let's get some actors here."""
00:13:20,00:13:23,"And they got some actors to open the door and say,"
00:13:23,00:13:26,"""Ah, Valentina Toreshkova, you are back on there."""
00:13:26,00:13:27,That's amazing.
00:13:27,00:13:28,That's so funny.
00:13:28,00:13:29,It was very managed.
00:13:29,00:13:34,"Like, I think the government sort of arranged her marriage after this, right?"
00:13:34,00:13:38,"Or strongly encouraged her to marry another astronaut, basically."
00:13:38,00:13:41,"Yeah, the difference between arranged marriage and Khrushchev saying to you,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,"""I think you should get married."""
00:13:43,00:13:44,-Yeah. -There's not much difference.
00:13:44,00:13:47,It's tight. And Khrushchev officiated.
00:13:47,00:13:48,"I thought he had better things to do,"
00:13:48,00:13:52,"but Khrushchev's there as the priest, basically, marrying them to each other."
00:13:52,00:13:54,That's not weird.
00:13:54,00:13:55,"I don't know if you did that online thing,"
00:13:55,00:13:59,where you get your credentials in advance the night before.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"That's so interesting, because I always thought..."
00:14:01,00:14:03,"So she was up in the Vostok 6, it was called."
00:14:03,00:14:06,"And she often does talks around the world,"
00:14:06,00:14:08,and they bring the actual capsule to different places.
00:14:08,00:14:10,And she really loves it.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"She always strokes it, and she said of it,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"""My lovely one, my best and most beautiful friend,"
00:14:15,00:14:16,"my best and most beautiful man."""
00:14:16,00:14:17,And I always...
00:14:17,00:14:20,"You know those people who, like, marry the Berlin Wall?"
00:14:20,00:14:21,I always get...
00:14:21,00:14:23,"When you say people, it was one time..."
00:14:23,00:14:25,"Well, there's somebody married a rollercoaster"
00:14:25,00:14:28,in the Berlin Wall and the Eiffel Tower as well.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"I feel like Valentina's, you know, one of them."
00:14:31,00:14:32,She's on the path.
00:14:32,00:14:35,Did she stay married to the human she married?
00:14:35,00:14:36,No.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"No, she was caught in bed with the Vostok 6."
00:14:38,00:14:41,She was ready to mingle.
00:14:41,00:14:43,"Actually, one thing that she had in common"
00:14:43,00:14:45,with a rugby player we mentioned before
00:14:45,00:14:48,is that she never told her mother that she was going into space.
00:14:48,00:14:51,And her mother only found out when she saw it on the news.
00:14:51,00:14:52,What?
00:14:52,00:14:53,Whoa.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"Yeah, because it was really classified."
00:14:54,00:14:56,"Like, the Soviet Union didn't tell anyone"
00:14:56,00:15:00,"that it was happening, possibly in case things went wrong, right?"
00:15:00,00:15:02,"But when she went to the place to do it,"
00:15:02,00:15:05,"everyone said that she was doing, like, a parachute jump."
00:15:05,00:15:05,And she kept it up.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"She said, ""No, I'm just doing a parachute jump."
00:15:07,00:15:08,"I'm just doing a parachute jump."""
00:15:08,00:15:10,"But actually, this was what she was doing."
00:15:10,00:15:11,"I guess, at the end of it, she was."
00:15:11,00:15:15,"She was a very, very big, with a three-day run-up."
00:15:15,00:15:16,Wow.
00:15:16,00:15:18,But I tell my family so much stuff.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"I tell my family, you know, when I've had a cup of tea."
00:15:20,00:15:22,I don't think I could keep secret that I was going to be a tea.
00:15:22,00:15:23,The first.
00:15:23,00:15:24,They don't ring back.
00:15:24,00:15:26,"Yeah, they've stopped answering in recent years."
00:15:26,00:15:27,Yeah.
00:15:27,00:15:31,My wife never told her parents when she became a helicopter pilot
00:15:31,00:15:32,until after she'd done it.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"And she's Russian, so maybe it's in the jeans."
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Yeah, because actually, she also kept the parachuting secret."
00:15:37,00:15:40,"In fact, the two first women in space,"
00:15:40,00:15:41,"both of whom were Russian,"
00:15:41,00:15:42,both basically went to space
00:15:42,00:15:44,because they were really into parachute jumps.
00:15:44,00:15:46,I genuinely think it was for the thrill of that final bit
00:15:46,00:15:47,where you parachute out.
00:15:47,00:15:49,And they were both parachuting surreptitiously
00:15:49,00:15:51,without telling their parents.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"I don't know what Russian parents are like,"
00:15:52,00:15:57,that they bound their children from jumping from high things.
00:15:57,00:16:01,"Well, put it this way, the first time I met my in-laws,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,"I was in my mid-30s,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,"and they wouldn't stop telling me to put a hat on,"
00:16:05,00:16:06,otherwise I'll be cold.
00:16:06,00:16:11,"For the listener at home, James is wearing a hat right now."
00:16:11,00:16:12,Took it to heart.
00:16:12,00:16:15,You never know where those Russians are watching.
00:16:16,00:16:21,"So, China are currently building a new space station,"
00:16:21,00:16:24,and they have sent recently a very clear signal
00:16:24,00:16:27,that one of the crew is going to be a woman.
00:16:27,00:16:29,I don't know if you can guess what the sign is.
00:16:29,00:16:30,"It's not an announcement or anything,"
00:16:30,00:16:31,but they've announced--
00:16:31,00:16:32,They painted it pink.
00:16:32,00:16:35,They've announced the lineup of stuff
00:16:35,00:16:37,"that's going to be put in the payload to go up there,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,"and it includes 30 bottles of face cream,"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"30 of serum, and 60 bottles of toner."
00:16:42,00:16:43,So that is the indication.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Toner, not for a printer."
00:16:45,00:16:48,"Not for a printer, for a human face."
00:16:48,00:16:51,And I don't know any more than that about what toner does.
00:16:51,00:16:53,"Tones you up, I imagine."
00:16:53,00:16:54,"I guess, yeah."
00:16:54,00:16:55,"Yeah, probably that."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"They had a lot of weird stipulations, didn't they?"
00:16:57,00:16:59,The Chinese about the female astronauts.
00:16:59,00:17:00,They had to be married.
00:17:00,00:17:01,They've had to have given birth.
00:17:01,00:17:02,"Oh, really?"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"This might be the old Tyconauts,"
00:17:04,00:17:07,as opposed to this new batch that you were talking about.
00:17:07,00:17:10,"That's weird, because it was the having children element"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"of women, that inconvenient element of females"
00:17:13,00:17:15,that put Russia off sending any more women
00:17:15,00:17:16,into space.
00:17:16,00:17:19,"So when the first one went up, came back down,"
00:17:19,00:17:20,"and then Russia went, actually, this is super dangerous,"
00:17:20,00:17:21,and you might have kids.
00:17:21,00:17:25,So they thought it's not fair on the potential children
00:17:25,00:17:25,that were around.
00:17:25,00:17:26,"Like radiation, or this kind of thing."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"No, more like you might die in space."
00:17:28,00:17:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:28,00:17:30,And then you definitely can't get pregnant
00:17:30,00:17:31,and have kids after that.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Yeah.
00:17:32,00:17:33,"Yeah, very good point."
00:17:33,00:17:35,"If you already have children, they'll be upset."
00:17:35,00:17:36,They'll be sad.
00:17:36,00:17:37,Especially if you didn't tell them you were going
00:17:37,00:17:38,in the first place.
00:17:38,00:17:40,They thought you were just doing a parachute jump.
00:17:40,00:17:42,One other thing about Toreshkova
00:17:42,00:17:44,is that she was really sick when she went up.
00:17:44,00:17:46,And there are a few reasons that she might have been sick.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"And if you look at different sources,"
00:17:48,00:17:49,it's different things.
00:17:49,00:17:52,So some people think it was because she was on her period
00:17:52,00:17:54,and she felt really ill when she went up there.
00:17:54,00:17:56,Some people thought it was because she'd eaten
00:17:56,00:17:59,some tinned fish and lemon pie on the way up.
00:17:59,00:17:59,And that's why she felt ill.
00:17:59,00:18:01,The nicest combination of foods in the world.
00:18:01,00:18:05,"Tinned fish followed by some lemon pie, nice and quickly."
00:18:05,00:18:07,"But I read in one Russian source that she,"
00:18:07,00:18:10,"when she was sick, she didn't want the people on the ground"
00:18:10,00:18:11,to know she was sick.
00:18:11,00:18:13,So she hid her vomit behind some panels.
00:18:13,00:18:15,And the space station.
00:18:15,00:18:17,What is this woman's thing with secrecy?
00:18:17,00:18:20,Why is she telling anyone anything?
00:18:20,00:18:21,I didn't see that in any of the stars.
00:18:21,00:18:22,It might not be true.
00:18:22,00:18:24,But her vomit fried the electrics on the spaceship
00:18:24,00:18:26,and then she couldn't get home.
00:18:26,00:18:27,This woman is a liability.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"But you know, we're saying like the Russian and the Chinese,"
00:18:30,00:18:33,"the Americans were very much, you know,"
00:18:33,00:18:36,19 years after Valentina went to space
00:18:36,00:18:37,is when someone else went up.
00:18:37,00:18:39,And that includes the Americans.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"And famously, earlier with Jeff Bezos,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,"Wally Funk went to space,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,finally after a lifetime of wanting to go to space.
00:18:46,00:18:48,And she was part of the original astronauts
00:18:48,00:18:50,that were training with the Mercury.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"So John Glenn and so on,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,who went up in orbit to the world.
00:18:53,00:18:56,She did everything that they did and she did it perfect.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"So the things she had to do is the preparation included,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,she had to swallow three feet of rubber hose.
00:19:01,00:19:02,She had to drink a pint.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Yeah.
00:19:03,00:19:05,It's not some kind of hazing ceremony you have
00:19:05,00:19:07,when you get on the spaceship.
00:19:07,00:19:07,Why?
00:19:07,00:19:10,"I guess you should have read up on that, really."
00:19:10,00:19:11,That is an odd sentence.
00:19:12,00:19:14,Three feet is a lot.
00:19:14,00:19:15,Three feet is a lot.
00:19:15,00:19:16,"This is a lot, that."
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Yeah, because you had to..."
00:19:17,00:19:19,That's coming out the other end.
00:19:19,00:19:20,That's tough.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"Like a weird dental floss thing, yeah."
00:19:22,00:19:25,What?
00:19:25,00:19:27,It's a huge enema.
00:19:27,00:19:27,Right.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"So three feet, she swallowed three feet of rubber."
00:19:30,00:19:33,She drank a pint of radioactive water again.
00:19:33,00:19:36,Should have read up on what reason that was for.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"And she did this thing, which is extraordinary."
00:19:38,00:19:43,"She stayed in an isolation tank for 10 and a half hours,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,"which was a record time,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,even for the other male astronauts that were doing it.
00:19:47,00:19:48,And she was chilled.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"And when they checked in on her, she was basically like,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,has it been 10 and a half hours?
00:19:52,00:19:52,"Oh, keep me in."
00:19:52,00:19:53,I'm fine.
00:19:53,00:19:54,"Oh, you mean chilled?"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"Sorry, I thought you meant chilled like in a fridge or something."
00:19:56,00:20:00,She was in complete darkness and silence.
00:20:00,00:20:02,She passed every single test.
00:20:02,00:20:03,"And it was basically John Glenn,"
00:20:03,00:20:06,"who was the first person to orbit the earth as an American,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"said, I don't think women should do this."
00:20:08,00:20:11,It's the only reason that Wally Funk wasn't allowed.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"Took, I mean, to give them their due,"
00:20:13,00:20:16,the Soviets were a bit better in some areas
00:20:16,00:20:19,of gender equality than the Americans.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"Yeah, it was equally shit for everyone in the Soviet Union."
00:20:21,00:20:22,It was equally shit.
00:20:22,00:20:24,"Like they, there certainly just seemed to be a sense"
00:20:24,00:20:26,that women weren't quite expected to fulfill
00:20:26,00:20:28,that very stereotypical female role
00:20:28,00:20:31,that women were expected to perform in America.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"And so like the second woman in space,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,the second woman in space was Russian as well.
00:20:36,00:20:39,And was Svetlana Savitskaya.
00:20:39,00:20:40,And she was awesome.
00:20:40,00:20:43,She led an all-female team to victory
00:20:43,00:20:46,in the World Aerobatic Championships in 1970.
00:20:46,00:20:47,"Oh, that's amazing."
00:20:47,00:20:50,No woman had ever really flown aerobatically like that before.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"And it was a full female team, thrashed all the men."
00:20:52,00:20:53,That's amazing.
00:20:53,00:20:55,And then did they do that thing when you do a loop the loop
00:20:55,00:20:57,and you kind of fall out halfway around?
00:20:57,00:20:58,Such a good move.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"That's the main one, isn't it?"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"But Donald, yeah."
00:21:01,00:21:03,"All right, well, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:21:03,00:21:05,So we're going to move on to fact number three.
00:21:05,00:21:07,And that is James.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:21:10,00:21:13,"in the Toda Society of Southern India,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,milkmen are not allowed to have sex.
00:21:15,00:21:21,Was this brought in after an incident?
00:21:21,00:21:26,They've just been fathering too many goddamn kids.
00:21:26,00:21:27,It was not that.
00:21:27,00:21:28,Okay.
00:21:28,00:21:34,So this is a society from the Tamil Nadu area.
00:21:34,00:21:36,And all their traditions are centered around the buffalo.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"Okay, so all the rituals around the buffalo."
00:21:39,00:21:42,"So like whenever they do any dairy activity,"
00:21:42,00:21:43,there's loads of rituals.
00:21:43,00:21:44,"Whenever they're looking after the herds,"
00:21:44,00:21:45,there's loads of rituals.
00:21:45,00:21:49,And they have this guy in their society called the holy milkman.
00:21:49,00:21:51,And he is basically a priest.
00:21:51,00:21:52,He does all of these things.
00:21:52,00:21:56,And it's a really tough job being the holy milkman.
00:21:56,00:21:59,"So he has to be celibate, as I said, the whole time."
00:21:59,00:22:03,He's never allowed to visit his family while he's the milkman.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"Like you can stop being the milkman at some stage if you want,"
00:22:05,00:22:07,"but while you're the milkman, you're not allowed to visit your family."
00:22:07,00:22:10,Except for when you're leaving milk outside the door.
00:22:10,00:22:15,"Well, no one's even allowed to talk to you if you're the milkman."
00:22:15,00:22:17,"Well, it's so early in the morning, isn't it, you know?"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"They're allowed to approach you two days a week,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,Mondays and Thursdays.
00:22:22,00:22:24,They're allowed to come over to you and chat to you.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"But any other day, if you want to speak to the holy milkman,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,you have to stand on the other side of the street
00:22:29,00:22:30,"or the other side of the field and go,"
00:22:30,00:22:32,"""How's it going over there?"""
00:22:32,00:22:34,"Can we change to three pints, please?"
00:22:34,00:22:37,"The next week, thank you."
00:22:37,00:22:39,"Yeah, and if there's like a funeral in his family"
00:22:39,00:22:40,"and he needs to go to the funeral,"
00:22:40,00:22:43,"or there's a real reason that he has to go back to his family,"
00:22:43,00:22:44,he has to resign as the milkman.
00:22:44,00:22:47,"Well, also, if someone touches him by accident,"
00:22:47,00:22:48,"he has to give up office,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,which feels that's quite risky as a job.
00:22:51,00:22:53,I'd ask someone to do it immediately.
00:22:53,00:22:55,It's the shittest job.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"I think they liked it, though, right?"
00:22:56,00:22:57,"I don't know, man."
00:22:57,00:22:59,It sounds really rough.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"Even to qualify to become one of these priests,"
00:23:02,00:23:03,"which, as I say, is very undesirable."
00:23:03,00:23:05,"You can't really spend time with anyone, ever."
00:23:05,00:23:09,"You, to qualify, you have to do this massive fast"
00:23:09,00:23:10,"of starve yourself for a while,"
00:23:10,00:23:13,and then you're sent off to sleep in the forest naked and alone
00:23:13,00:23:15,for several nights in succession.
00:23:15,00:23:17,"And there are tigers around,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,and other things that can happen to you.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"And it is quite cold, because it's quite high up."
00:23:22,00:23:25,"So, yeah, I don't know about days lying naked."
00:23:25,00:23:26,But you get status.
00:23:26,00:23:28,You do get big status.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"So there was an account of the milkman,"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"and he was asked whether the toaders salute the sun,"
00:23:34,00:23:37,whether it's a sun worshipping religion.
00:23:37,00:23:40,"And he said, ""Those poor fellows do,"
00:23:40,00:23:42,"i.e. the other members of the toadah group,"
00:23:42,00:23:46,"but I, I, a God, why should I salute the sun?"""
00:23:46,00:23:49,"So you get, it's a status bump, definitely."
00:23:49,00:23:53,"A perk, not having to salute the sun."
00:23:53,00:23:56,"Can't ever have sex again, but we know how to salute the sun."
00:23:56,00:23:58,So... Do they live with the buffalo?
00:23:58,00:24:00,Because they live in what's called the sacred dairy.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"And the... Yes, oh, the kind of they do."
00:24:03,00:24:09,"So, basically, each family lives in a kind of a barrel-shaped house."
00:24:09,00:24:12,"And in that kind of community,"
00:24:12,00:24:14,"there's quite a few families all live together,"
00:24:14,00:24:17,and that group all have the buffaloes that they kind of look after.
00:24:17,00:24:20,But there's one guy who's in charge of the milking.
00:24:20,00:24:23,"Yeah, there was a TV series about that."
00:24:23,00:24:24,"Exactly, it was Billy Piper was in it."
00:24:24,00:24:26,It was called the Sacred Dairy of a Coal Girl.
00:24:26,00:24:27,I don't know if you saw it.
00:24:27,00:24:33,"Oh, wow."
00:24:33,00:24:37,That was actually a misprint because she was actually playing rugby.
00:24:37,00:24:39,She was a Coal Girl after all.
00:24:39,00:24:44,They have a lot of change about the toadah.
00:24:44,00:24:47,And one of the things from back in the day is that
00:24:47,00:24:52,the women of the toadah used to practice fraternal polyandry.
00:24:52,00:24:56,"So, they would have to marry all the brothers of one family,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,and that would be the husbands.
00:24:57,00:24:58,"Wow. Yeah, exactly."
00:24:58,00:25:01,"And like you say, this doesn't really happen anymore."
00:25:01,00:25:03,"The milkman stuff still does,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,but a lot of the old stuff doesn't really happen.
00:25:05,00:25:08,"But it used to be that when a toadah woman was pregnant,"
00:25:08,00:25:11,"and she had all of these different husbands who were all brothers,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,so you knew who was the father.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"They would give her a toy bow and arrow,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,and the husband would give them that.
00:25:18,00:25:20,That's how you would know that he was the father of the child.
00:25:20,00:25:22,But you know the weird thing about the bow and arrow?
00:25:22,00:25:22,No.
00:25:22,00:25:24,They had no idea what it was for.
00:25:24,00:25:25,Really?
00:25:25,00:25:27,"They, so this is, people were astonished when,"
00:25:27,00:25:31,"I guess they were studied to be studied in the late 19th centuries,"
00:25:31,00:25:33,"and bows and arrows, and bows especially,"
00:25:33,00:25:37,have a hugely significant place symbolically in their society.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"They used in weddings and funerals,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,and they have no idea that they're actually weapons.
00:25:41,00:25:42,"They don't, they don't hunt."
00:25:42,00:25:43,They don't use them for hunting.
00:25:43,00:25:45,They've just got defunct bows and arrows.
00:25:45,00:25:46,There must be accidents happening all the time
00:25:46,00:25:47,if you don't know that it's a weapon.
00:25:48,00:25:51,"Because you wouldn't know to put the arrow in the bow, would you?"
00:25:51,00:25:52,That's a good point.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"Yes, because, yeah, you're right, they're pastoral,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,so they're really only bothered about the buffalo
00:25:56,00:25:58,"and getting all the stuff from the buffalo,"
00:25:58,00:25:59,"and then they trade that for the meat,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,"so they don't, they're not hunters."
00:26:01,00:26:01,Wow.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
00:26:02,00:26:05,They actually were sort of a very hierarchical society.
00:26:05,00:26:09,"Back in the 19th century, they were king of the hill, literally."
00:26:09,00:26:12,So the toad are basically in charge of a bunch of other tribes
00:26:12,00:26:13,all around them.
00:26:13,00:26:16,It's in the Nilgeary mountain area.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"And like James says, all they're doing is making milk."
00:26:18,00:26:21,And they basically made everyone else give them everything else.
00:26:21,00:26:25,"So other tribes would have to pay deference to them,"
00:26:25,00:26:26,"taxes to them, basically."
00:26:26,00:26:31,"So the Vadakas tribe would have to pay 10% of their vegetables,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,they grew each year to them in rent.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"And yeah, it was, it's impressive."
00:26:35,00:26:39,They sort of made people happily subservient to them.
00:26:39,00:26:39,It is impressive.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Another impressive thing about them is their language,"
00:26:41,00:26:42,the toda language.
00:26:42,00:26:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:43,00:26:47,The toda language has six trills that know what the language has.
00:26:47,00:26:49,"So you know, like when you roll your r's, that kind of thing."
00:26:49,00:26:51,Don't say that to the milkman.
00:26:51,00:26:53,He's not allowed to reply.
00:26:53,00:26:58,I read a paper in the Journal of International Phonetic Association
00:26:58,00:27:00,by Sinisha Spijic.
00:27:00,00:27:03,"And they say, you know, you need to get all these trills right."
00:27:03,00:27:06,"Otherwise, you're not going to be able to say the words right."
00:27:06,00:27:08,"The first paragraph of that paper ends,"
00:27:08,00:27:13,toda is a rich source for trill-seeking phoneticians.
00:27:13,00:27:13,Brilliant.
00:27:13,00:27:14,Nice.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Brilliant.
00:27:15,00:27:17,More people have probably heard that joke now
00:27:17,00:27:20,than have ever heard that joke since it was written in the academic paper.
00:27:20,00:27:23,You have been the super spreader for that joke.
00:27:23,00:27:24,That is really nice.
00:27:24,00:27:25,It's a great joke.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"If you want to get married in the toda society as a man,"
00:27:28,00:27:32,you have to lift a 120 kilogram stone.
00:27:32,00:27:33,"And if you don't lift it,"
00:27:33,00:27:36,then you won't be able to get married to someone.
00:27:36,00:27:39,"120 kilos stone, in case you don't know,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,is just over twice as heavy as Emma Stone.
00:27:41,00:27:44,That puts it into context.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"It puts it into context, that, doesn't it?"
00:27:46,00:27:48,Milkman?
00:27:48,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:50,Let's have some milkman.
00:27:50,00:27:53,Some American houses back in the day had a milk door.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Isn't that cool?
00:27:54,00:27:55,Was it a normal sized door?
00:27:55,00:27:58,Or was it a tiny little like cat flap?
00:27:58,00:27:59,It's a tiny cat flap sized door.
00:27:59,00:28:00,"Don't mix it up with a cat flap though,"
00:28:00,00:28:03,because don't leave your milk where the cat's going to go in.
00:28:03,00:28:03,"Danger, yeah."
00:28:03,00:28:04,Danger.
00:28:04,00:28:08,"But it was just a way of getting your milk without talking to the milkman,"
00:28:08,00:28:09,if you didn't want to.
00:28:09,00:28:10,Is that right?
00:28:10,00:28:11,Yeah.
00:28:11,00:28:13,"But that sounds like in the UK,"
00:28:13,00:28:15,"that that was a thing anyway,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"that you used to just leave your windows open,"
00:28:17,00:28:18,"or your doors open,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,"and during the middle of the night,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,the milkman would sneak in.
00:28:21,00:28:21,The milkman.
00:28:21,00:28:21,Man.
00:28:21,00:28:24,And he would fill up your jug.
00:28:24,00:28:25,"And then he would sneak back out again,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,and you'd never know he'd come down.
00:28:26,00:28:30,You've been watching some soft porn films from the 1970s.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Sorsy.
00:28:31,00:28:32,I never get to the sex.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"I'm just like, rewind that."
00:28:33,00:28:35,This milkman bit's fucking amazing.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"But the milk door, sometimes it would be a separate,"
00:28:39,00:28:40,"so there's a door on the outside of your house,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,"with a little ledge,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,"where the milkman puts the milk,"
00:28:43,00:28:44,"and then he closes the door,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,and then you open it from the other side.
00:28:46,00:28:47,There's another door on the other side.
00:28:47,00:28:48,"But the clever thing is,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,"on the milkman's side of the milk door,"
00:28:50,00:28:55,"there is a dial where you could adjust the milk meter,"
00:28:55,00:28:56,and you could show the milkman
00:28:56,00:28:59,how much milk you wanted in your milk door every morning.
00:28:59,00:29:01,I wonder if that was used as a euphemism very often.
00:29:01,00:29:02,I bet it was.
00:29:02,00:29:05,I bet that was mostly used by housewives
00:29:05,00:29:07,when their husbands had gone to work.
00:29:07,00:29:08,It's a green or a red light.
00:29:08,00:29:12,The milk meter is set to full fat today.
00:29:13,00:29:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:17,00:29:19,Have you guys heard of Sean Garvey?
00:29:19,00:29:20,"You must have done, right?"
00:29:20,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:21,That's Sean Garvey.
00:29:21,00:29:23,"Sean Garvey, milkman of the year 2004."
00:29:23,00:29:24,Right.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Actually.
00:29:25,00:29:27,"Oh, well, he won milkman of the year in 2004,"
00:29:27,00:29:30,after he rescued a 92-year-old customer
00:29:30,00:29:32,from a gas-filled kitchen.
00:29:32,00:29:32,"Oh, okay."
00:29:32,00:29:33,Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:35,Have you guys heard of Ian Beardwell?
00:29:35,00:29:35,"Definitely, yeah."
00:29:35,00:29:36,"Milkman of the year 2007, right?"
00:29:36,00:29:38,I think he was a milkman of the year.
00:29:38,00:29:39,I just can't remember the year.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"I remember the year, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:40,00:29:41,"2018, of course."
00:29:41,00:29:42,"2018, yeah, yeah."
00:29:42,00:29:42,Yeah.
00:29:42,00:29:45,He kind of was chasing car thieves.
00:29:45,00:29:48,He returned and lost laptop after finding it on the road.
00:29:48,00:29:50,"So, yeah, he won milkman of the year."
00:29:50,00:29:51,"Wait, sorry, what's that got to do with milk?"
00:29:51,00:29:54,"That sounds like he's a milkman by day,"
00:29:54,00:29:55,but a Superman vigilante by night.
00:29:55,00:29:57,He's a milkman by night.
00:29:57,00:29:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:58,00:29:58,Okay.
00:29:58,00:30:00,Have you heard of Steve Leach?
00:30:00,00:30:00,No.
00:30:00,00:30:01,What year?
00:30:01,00:30:02,What do you know what?
00:30:02,00:30:04,What year did he win milkman of the year?
00:30:04,00:30:05,"Oh, he didn't win milkman of the year."
00:30:05,00:30:05,"Oh, gosh."
00:30:05,00:30:07,He won milkman of the millennium.
00:30:07,00:30:10,[GASPING]
00:30:10,00:30:11,That's huge.
00:30:11,00:30:11,It's huge.
00:30:11,00:30:17,"In 2002, when he put out a raging fire with 320 pints of milk,"
00:30:17,00:30:24,"he said, ""I kicked the door in and started pouring milk everywhere."""
00:30:24,00:30:28,It was hard work opening all those bottles
00:30:28,00:30:30,as they have tamper-proof lids.
00:30:30,00:30:34,It was even harder trying to explain to my boss
00:30:34,00:30:35,where all the milk had gone.
00:30:35,00:30:36,What?
00:30:36,00:30:37,That is insane.
00:30:37,00:30:39,I don't buy this story.
00:30:39,00:30:39,I think that--
00:30:39,00:30:42,This is crazier than the fucking guy falling out of the plane.
00:30:42,00:30:46,"That-- I was thinking when you said 2002,"
00:30:46,00:30:47,"""You're a milkman of the millennium."""
00:30:47,00:30:49,"I thought, ""That's a bit early to be dishing it out."
00:30:49,00:30:51,"There are 998 years left to order."""
00:30:51,00:30:52,"I say, ""Give it to him."""
00:30:52,00:30:53,That's incredible.
00:30:53,00:30:55,That's insane.
00:30:55,00:30:59,"Hey, listen, we need to move on to our final fact of the show,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,and that is Anna.
00:31:01,00:31:03,My fact this week is that George Lucas
00:31:03,00:31:06,"owns four ranches in the Lucas Valley,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,which is named after a completely different Lucas.
00:31:09,00:31:14,Did he go to the Lucas Valley because it was named that?
00:31:14,00:31:15,I don't believe so.
00:31:15,00:31:16,No.
00:31:16,00:31:18,It is a beautiful valley in California
00:31:18,00:31:20,"where a lot of people like George Lucas hang out,"
00:31:20,00:31:21,so I think that helped.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"But yeah, I was reading about his ranches,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,"which are pretty cool,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,and realized it was in Lucas Valley
00:31:26,00:31:28,"and thought, ""Surely that's named after him."""
00:31:28,00:31:28,But it's not.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"It's named after John Lucas,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"who I'm sure you've all heard of,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,the 19th century rancher who was--
00:31:35,00:31:37,"He won Milkman of the Year, didn't he?"
00:31:37,00:31:38,"1879, yeah, yeah."
00:31:38,00:31:40,Exactly.
00:31:40,00:31:43,"There's not much on John Lucas on the internet, is there?"
00:31:43,00:31:45,"No, he was roped into running the ranch,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,"as far as I could tell, by his uncle,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"who dragged him over from Ireland,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,"but then wasn't really into it,"
00:31:51,00:31:52,because he was a bit uppity.
00:31:52,00:31:54,"And so I think his wife, Maria,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,basically ran the whole estate for a long time.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"Yeah, he was roped into it a lot"
00:31:58,00:32:00,because his uncle died and left it to him.
00:32:00,00:32:02,That was a lot of it.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"His uncle was called Timothy Murphy,"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"and he first got the area,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,because it was owned by Mexico in those days.
00:32:09,00:32:13,And Mexico had a rule that if you were Roman Catholic
00:32:13,00:32:14,"and you had a Spanish name,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,then they would give you some free land.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"But this guy was called Timothy Murphy,"
00:32:19,00:32:22,so he changed his name to Dom Timateo Murphy.
00:32:22,00:32:23,Nice.
00:32:23,00:32:23,Very nice.
00:32:23,00:32:28,"There is a place from San Rafael,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,which is the area that Lucas Valley is in.
00:32:30,00:32:33,There is a Native American group from there called the Miwok.
00:32:34,00:32:37,"No, it sounds a little bit like Ewok,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"which is some of the things,"
00:32:39,00:32:40,and they're the teddy bears and stuff.
00:32:40,00:32:42,"Yeah, yeah, but that's not a coincidence, though."
00:32:42,00:32:43,"Oh, is it not?"
00:32:43,00:32:44,"No, it's not a coincidence."
00:32:44,00:32:45,"And they're not teddy bears, but they..."
00:32:45,00:32:51,"Yeah, and now in a weird kind of full circle thing"
00:32:51,00:32:52,"with Lucas,"
00:32:52,00:32:53,"because he has the Skywalker Ranch there,"
00:32:53,00:32:54,which is where...
00:32:54,00:32:56,Which is named after a completely different skywalker.
00:32:56,00:32:57,"Exactly, so weird."
00:32:57,00:33:02,"But there is now in this Miwok territory a lake,"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"which they made, a man-made lake,"
00:33:05,00:33:06,which is called Lake Ewok.
00:33:06,00:33:08,"Yeah, he did name, just to clarify,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,"the Ewoks sort of after the Miwok people,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"but it also happened that it is Wookiee backwards,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,"so which is another sort of teddy bear, isn't it?"
00:33:15,00:33:16,But a bigger teddy bear.
00:33:16,00:33:21,"Yeah, sometimes you can just feel the emails and tweets coming in."
00:33:21,00:33:28,"But he liked naming places, particularly for Star Wars,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,with things that were relative to the places he was
00:33:31,00:33:32,or that he wanted to go to.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"So Tatooine, which is where Luke Skywalker is from,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,"is actually named of the town Tatooine in Tunisia,"
00:33:38,00:33:39,"so he picked that up, yeah."
00:33:39,00:33:42,"Was that like, that's where they filmed it, didn't they?"
00:33:42,00:33:43,"Yeah, exactly."
00:33:43,00:33:44,In Tunisia.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"R2-D2, that was when he was working on his previous film,"
00:33:47,00:33:48,American Graffiti.
00:33:48,00:33:49,There was an editor who's shorthand
00:33:49,00:33:52,for what was real to dialogue to.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"He would say R2-D2, and that just stuck in his head."
00:33:54,00:33:54,Oh.
00:33:54,00:33:57,"And then here's a weird one, but I'm a Star Wars fan,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,"and this might be quite obvious to Star Wars fans,"
00:33:59,00:34:00,but I'd never heard it.
00:34:00,00:34:04,"Luke Skywalker is Luke S, Lucas."
00:34:04,00:34:05,Okay.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"Oh, that's a weird mountainous entity."
00:34:07,00:34:08,"Oh, he's called George Lucas."
00:34:08,00:34:09,"Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:09,00:34:11,He's named the hero of his whole thing.
00:34:11,00:34:12,That's interesting.
00:34:12,00:34:14,"After a self, Lucas."
00:34:14,00:34:15,"So it's like Luke Skywalker,"
00:34:15,00:34:16,do you think it's based on him?
00:34:16,00:34:18,"He's like, he wrote himself into it."
00:34:18,00:34:19,"Possibly, yeah."
00:34:19,00:34:21,He definitely wrote his dog into it.
00:34:21,00:34:22,Did he?
00:34:22,00:34:25,"Yeah, so Chewbacca, who's the big teddy bear,"
00:34:25,00:34:28,was based partly on his dog.
00:34:28,00:34:31,"He had Malamute, I think it's pronounced like this,"
00:34:31,00:34:32,great big shaggy dog.
00:34:32,00:34:34,"But get this, that dog has inspired two"
00:34:34,00:34:36,"of the greatest cinematic creations ever,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,"because he had this dog, which was named Indiana."
00:34:39,00:34:44,"Yeah, Chewy and Indy are both named after one dog."
00:34:44,00:34:45,That's amazing.
00:34:45,00:34:46,The dog was the inspiration for both of them.
00:34:46,00:34:49,"He sounds like an unimaginative egotist so far,"
00:34:49,00:34:50,doesn't he?
00:34:50,00:34:51,Wow.
00:34:51,00:34:51,Ouch!
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Right, so I like the guy, but just based on this."
00:34:54,00:34:56,"While we're on names very quickly,"
00:34:56,00:34:59,"there's obviously Star Wars was George Lucas' thing,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,and then it turned into this giant empire.
00:35:01,00:35:04,"And there's comic books, and there's animations,"
00:35:04,00:35:07,and all new characters are created all the time.
00:35:07,00:35:10,So there's a big encyclopedia of all the different Jedi masters
00:35:10,00:35:12,and Siths and all that.
00:35:12,00:35:16,"And there was someone who was working for the Lucas company,"
00:35:16,00:35:19,"and he created a Jedi, which he did as a bit of a joke."
00:35:19,00:35:23,"He was called Soon Bates, and Soon Bates was a Jedi master."
00:35:23,00:35:25,"And he wanted to get it as a joke, but it made it through."
00:35:25,00:35:28,"So there is now a Jedi called Master Bates,"
00:35:28,00:35:33,"who is an official Jedi, and created by a guy called Randy."
00:35:33,00:35:36,No kidding.
00:35:36,00:35:40,"And it made it past the editors, and they regret it so much."
00:35:40,00:35:42,"So he has to appear, because he is canon"
00:35:42,00:35:44,"in the official encyclopedia,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,but he's one of the only Jedi's who just does not appear.
00:35:46,00:35:48,"He's in his bedroom most of the time, isn't he?"
00:35:51,00:35:55,And I am unaware of most of the things in Star Wars.
00:35:55,00:35:58,But do you guys know something?
00:35:58,00:36:00,"If I say this, tell me if this makes sense."
00:36:00,00:36:02,"So in one of the films, there is a resistance base"
00:36:02,00:36:07,"on the planet of Dakar, and it's the scene of an epic battle"
00:36:07,00:36:10,"between the resistance and the first order on Star Killer Base,"
00:36:10,00:36:12,and was featured in the scene where Rey heads off
00:36:12,00:36:14,to find an iconic Luke Skywalker.
00:36:14,00:36:16,Have you thought about doing the audiobooks?
00:36:16,00:36:19,I don't know what any of that means.
00:36:19,00:36:23,This is the latest batch of Star Wars.
00:36:23,00:36:26,"But it was filmed in a place called Greenham Common,"
00:36:26,00:36:29,"which is in Berkshire, which is just down the road from here."
00:36:29,00:36:32,"And what is amazing about Greenham Common,"
00:36:32,00:36:35,"and back more onto my kind of territory,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"is that there was a protest there in the 80s,"
00:36:37,00:36:40,and they were going to put a load of nuclear weapons there.
00:36:40,00:36:44,"And in 1982, 250 women decided to protest,"
00:36:44,00:36:46,and said that we don't want this here.
00:36:46,00:36:49,"And they decided specifically it had to be just women,"
00:36:49,00:36:51,"because they wanted to say, well, this is our children."
00:36:51,00:36:55,We don't want our children to have nuclear weapons in our area.
00:36:55,00:36:57,So it started with 250 women.
00:36:57,00:37:00,All the media outlets just really vilified them.
00:37:00,00:37:02,They called it a witch's cover and all this kind of stuff.
00:37:02,00:37:04,That was in 1982.
00:37:04,00:37:07,"But by 1983, another protest happened there,"
00:37:07,00:37:11,"and there were 50,000 women in this protest."
00:37:11,00:37:13,It was insane.
00:37:13,00:37:17,They held hands for 14 miles all the way from their camp
00:37:17,00:37:18,to a place called Older Mastin.
00:37:18,00:37:20,Isn't that amazing?
00:37:20,00:37:22,And that's why no one has nuclear weapons anymore.
00:37:22,00:37:27,"Well, that is why they don't have nuclear weapons in Berkshire anymore."
00:37:27,00:37:31,"You know, it may the fourth be with you"
00:37:31,00:37:33,"when it's May the Fourth and it's Star Wars Day,"
00:37:33,00:37:34,and we all say that.
00:37:34,00:37:35,Maybe you all say that.
00:37:35,00:37:36,People say that.
00:37:36,00:37:38,Only a few times a day.
00:37:38,00:37:41,Once a year.
00:37:41,00:37:42,And it's a cool thing.
00:37:42,00:37:45,Does everyone know where that came from?
00:37:45,00:37:47,You'll never say it again.
00:37:47,00:37:49,"Yeah, someone knows it."
00:37:49,00:37:52,It was Margaret Thatcher who was the reason for it.
00:37:52,00:37:54,It was when she won the election in 1979.
00:37:54,00:37:55,It was her first day in office.
00:37:55,00:37:57,It was May the Fourth.
00:37:57,00:38:00,And so the conservatives put a congratulatory advert
00:38:00,00:38:02,"in the paper the next day,"
00:38:02,00:38:04,"saying, ""May the Fourth be with you, Maggie."
00:38:04,00:38:05,"Congratulations."""
00:38:05,00:38:09,"So, yeah."
00:38:09,00:38:11,"And in one fell swoop, we've killed that saying forever."
00:38:11,00:38:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:14,00:38:16,You know the Star Wars merch?
00:38:16,00:38:18,This is a huge element of the thing.
00:38:18,00:38:21,So George Lucas wrote the...
00:38:21,00:38:24,He was given the chance to try and haggle upwards on his fee
00:38:24,00:38:26,"because he made a film called American Graffiti,"
00:38:26,00:38:28,which became a huge hit.
00:38:28,00:38:29,And he'd already signed up to Star Wars
00:38:29,00:38:31,"and he was sort of thinking about,"
00:38:31,00:38:32,"""Well, should I go for more of it?"""
00:38:32,00:38:34,"And he said, ""No, I'll take more of the merchandise rights."
00:38:34,00:38:37,"Some big percentage of the merchandise sales."""
00:38:37,00:38:39,Which didn't really exist for films at the time.
00:38:39,00:38:40,"You know, there wasn't much..."
00:38:40,00:38:42,"You know, there wasn't George's merch"
00:38:42,00:38:44,in the way that there is Star Wars merch.
00:38:44,00:38:46,And the merchandise was so popular
00:38:46,00:38:49,"that the firm he got to do it, a firm called Kenner,"
00:38:49,00:38:51,they belonged to General Foods.
00:38:51,00:38:53,They were so taken by surprise.
00:38:53,00:38:55,The film came out in 1977.
00:38:55,00:38:56,"Christmas, 1977."
00:38:56,00:38:59,It had been out for months and months in the USA.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"It was, I think, just out in the UK."
00:39:01,00:39:03,Kenner was so short of stock
00:39:03,00:39:06,"that what they sold, an early bird certification package,"
00:39:06,00:39:11,"which was basically an IOU saying, ""We do not have these toys,"
00:39:11,00:39:13,"but if you send in a form,"
00:39:13,00:39:17,"we will give them to you between February and June next year."""
00:39:17,00:39:19,And it was the hit of the Christmas.
00:39:19,00:39:21,An IOU. There were no toys.
00:39:21,00:39:23,There were some stickers and a form.
00:39:23,00:39:24,Wow. Yeah.
00:39:24,00:39:29,"These empty boxes now sell for up to, you know, $8,000 on eBay."
00:39:29,00:39:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:29,00:39:33,"If you have an unopened IOU box with no toy, it's mad."
00:39:33,00:39:35,"It was the equivalent of, like,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"when you're trying to book Glastonbury tickets,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,and you're in that queue where you see the man
00:39:39,00:39:41,"walking towards the tickets, it's like, ""Okay, I'm there."
00:39:41,00:39:43,"I'm there in the queue. I've got my box."""
00:39:43,00:39:44,I don't know how it'll look at me.
00:39:44,00:39:46,I've never tried to buy Glastonbury tickets in my life.
00:39:46,00:39:48,Is it like when you try to buy Glymborn tickets?
00:39:48,00:39:50,Yeah. Got it.
00:39:50,00:39:50,Thank you.
00:39:50,00:39:54,Do you guys know Michael Leeder?
00:39:54,00:39:56,Is he a milkman?
00:39:56,00:39:57,"God, for God's sake."
00:39:57,00:39:59,"Yes, he is a milkman."
00:39:59,00:40:01,"Is it put on the desert planet or blah, blah?"
00:40:01,00:40:03,"No, in EastEnders."
00:40:03,00:40:05,He's a milkman in the TV show EastEnders.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"No, is he really milkman?"
00:40:06,00:40:10,"Yeah, he was 16 years on EastEnders as a milkman"
00:40:10,00:40:14,before he ever uttered his first bit of dialogue in the show.
00:40:14,00:40:15,"No, I'm not allowed to have sex."
00:40:15,00:40:21,He spoke to a cabbie called Charlie Slater.
00:40:21,00:40:23,"Oh, yeah, I know that part."
00:40:23,00:40:24,"His line is, ""Is this your squire?"""
00:40:24,00:40:28,That was his big break after 16 years of being the milkman
00:40:28,00:40:30,on EastEnders.
00:40:30,00:40:33,"Prior to his career as a milkman there,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,he was in Star Wars as a stormtrooper.
00:40:35,00:40:36,"Oh, really?"
00:40:36,00:40:40,"Now, very hard to pick out your stormtroopers in Star Wars,"
00:40:40,00:40:42,but it just so happens that he's possibly
00:40:42,00:40:44,one of the most famous stormtroopers
00:40:44,00:40:46,"that the series ever produced,"
00:40:46,00:40:50,because a few people in the audience might recognize this.
00:40:50,00:40:52,There's a scene where stormtroopers
00:40:52,00:40:53,"are running through the Death Star,"
00:40:53,00:40:56,and one clumsy stormtrooper cracks his head
00:40:56,00:40:58,on the side of an archway.
00:40:58,00:41:00,It's become a famous scene to the point
00:41:00,00:41:03,"where in 2004, when they re-released the DVDs,"
00:41:03,00:41:06,they added a thud so you could hear.
00:41:06,00:41:06,Was it?
00:41:06,00:41:07,So he ran into it and went...
00:41:07,00:41:17,"Maybe we need to wrap up the show on that note, right?"
00:41:17,00:41:19,What?
00:41:19,00:41:21,How the fuck are we going to top that?
00:41:21,00:41:22,"Okay, that is it."
00:41:22,00:41:23,That is all of our facts.
