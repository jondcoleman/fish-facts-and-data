00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.020
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.560
 this week coming to you live from Redding.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.420
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.800
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.560
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.240
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.560
 - My fact is that the 1890s Irish rugby captain,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.000
 D.B. Walkington, would play wearing a monocle,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.320
 but he took it out if he had to tackle anyone.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.720
 (audience laughing)

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.520
 This is a real person.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.960
 He was called Dollaway Bell Walkington, born in 1867.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.480
 He played for Ireland eight times.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 He was the captain twice,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.960
 and he wore a monocle while he was playing.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 He was extremely short-sighted,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.680
 and he'd just pop it in, pop along, pop it out,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.760
 make a tackle, pop it back in.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.600
 What a hero.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.560
 - Yeah, this guy was a great player,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.600
 wasn't he, for Ireland?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.360
 He played in the first ever team to beat Wales in 1888,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.960
 although the Welsh team all claimed

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.000
 to have had sea sickness on the day.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.280
 (audience laughing)

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.040
 And they played so badly in that game

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.440
 that eight of the team never represented Wales ever again.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.480
 - Wow. - Oh my God.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.440
 - He played in the 1887 team that beat England,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.200
 so that was the first Ireland team ever to beat England.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.400
 And there was another guy in that team called John Macaulay.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.960
 And John Macaulay, so they had to go to England

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 to play the game, but he couldn't get the time off work,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 and so he said to his work, "I'm gonna go and get married."

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.880
 And they said, "Are you?"

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.760
 And they went, "Okay, I'm gonna have to get married now."

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.960
 So he got married just so that he could get two weeks off

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.240
 so he could play this game.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.600
 Oh my God.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.640
 - Wow. - Isn't that amazing?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.480
 - That's incredible.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.520
 - Did he get married just to a randomer?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.280
 - No, to his future wife.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.120
 - I mean, I know.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.760
 (audience laughing)

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.600
 I know that.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.120
 - She was happy with the arrangement.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.960
 - They were going out.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.000
 They were seeing each other. - They were going out, yeah.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.960
 They were a couple, right?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.800
 - But rugby players, especially 19th century rugby players,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.880
 just seemed like really interesting and fun people.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.520
 Have you heard of Edward Pegg?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.360
 - No.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.560
 - Pegg was a Welsh player and he once missed the team train.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.280
 They were going to Devon to play a match.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.320
 He missed the train.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.120
 So what do you think he did?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.080
 - Well, got the next train.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.920
 - He chartered a special train to catch up

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 with the previous train.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 - Was it like two men just pumping up and down?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.680
 - Yeah.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.000
 - But did he, he didn't jump onto the train in front of us?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.520
 - No, he wasn't the Indiana Jones.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.760
 - Yeah, right. - No, he was, yeah, yeah.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.320
 - Yeah, it was, I mean, because back then

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.240
 the rules were all a bit wishy washy, weren't they?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.920
 So like there was a famous match in the 1884

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.240
 home nations championship.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.840
 It was Wales versus Ireland.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.000
 Ireland went over to play the Welsh.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.160
 When they got there though,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.720
 they didn't have enough men to play the match.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.240
 So the Welsh team had to loan them

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240
 two of their players to play the game.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.520
 - Did they, did they win?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.360
 'Cause you would have thought those two players,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.000
 if they're gentlemen, they'll play well.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.960
 And if they're not, they'll jeopardize your chances.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.640
 - Yeah, no, the Welsh won that match.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.520
 So even though the Irish got the two.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.000
 - That's what you'd expect. - Yeah, the Welsh still won.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.280
 - The first international between England and Scotland

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.720
 was in 1871.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.080
 It was quite a boring affair.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.080
 It came down, it was quite close as well towards the end.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.880
 And Scotland scored the only try of the match

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.160
 towards the second half.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.400
 But the English team were not happy.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.080
 They were like, this is not fair.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.640
 And so there was a massive argument

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.200
 between the referee and the two teams.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.480
 Eventually the referee gave the try to Scotland.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.640
 And afterwards, when they asked him about it,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.480
 the referee, Dr. Rowland, he was called.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.520
 He said, "I do not know whether my decision was correct."

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.800
 He said, "But when an umpire is in doubt,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.880
 "I think he is justified in deciding against the team

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.360
 "which makes the most noise."

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.200
 - Good point. - That's fair.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.400
 The days before Hawkeye,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.360
 he had to have something else to judge.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.040
 In 1889, the Kiwis came over.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.000
 So it's kind of amazing.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.200
 Even back then, you know, it was already big enough

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 that people were making these international trips.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.560
 And it was New Zealand versus England.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.880
 It was in Blackheath.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.040
 And there was this incident where an English player was tackled

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.960
 and his shorts got ripped off accidentally.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.200
 - And it was very awkward for him. - Oi, oi.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.640
 - The Kiwi players... - And he's put his monocle in.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.960
 What's going on here?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.040
 (LAUGHTER)

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040
 'Cause the good, honest players,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.040
 the Kiwis surrounded him, making him a little changing room

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.320
 so that he could put his pants back on again,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.920
 his shorts back on again.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.560
 As this was happening, all the other English players continued to play.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.200
 One of them, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.480
 completely unopposed, 'cause the Kiwi players are protecting that guy.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.080
 And then the Kiwi players understandably stormed off,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.840
 bit pissed off, and had to apologise afterwards

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.000
 for abandoning the game.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.440
 - Wow! - Oh, wow!

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.000
 - That was not a good game for them. - Yeah.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.920
 I've found someone who I think might be the most

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.040
 historically significant rugby player of all time.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.760
 - Ooh! - Not because of anything he did on the pitch.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.440
 He was called Charles Kathcart, and he was a Scotland player.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.480
 He had a brief career playing for Scotland.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.880
 Then he became a doctor, and then a surgeon,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.240
 and then a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.840
 who was very senior and eminent.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.160
 And what he did was, he pioneered the use of sphagnum moss.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.000
 - Jesus! - To dress wounds!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.800
 And that was used in the First World War.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.840
 There were a million wounds dressed per month

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.200
 at the height of the First World War,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.960
 thanks to his innovation that it could soak up so much liquid.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.200
 - And that is my rugby fact. - I was like,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.200
 "Finally, a fact about sport."

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.480
 You can start talking about sport, and not fucking moss.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.800
 Sorry, but that's... I mean, it's so interesting.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.080
 All the early rugby players, particularly the Irish team

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.920
 and the in that late 1800s,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.080
 went on to become quite prominent scientists.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.600
 Like, if you look at that team,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.280
 so there was a guy called Sir Thomas Rankin-Lyle.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.480
 He was an Aussie/Irish who moved to Australia.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.680
 One of the awards that gets given in science

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.080
 to this day in Australia is named after him.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.280
 He was a real pioneer in science.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.600
 There was a guy called Daniel Frederick Rambout.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.360
 He played again in the 1800s.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.720
 He was an Irish psychiatrist,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.360
 and he was one of the pioneers, a modern psychiatry.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.920
 All of these guys, like, a big portion of them

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.080
 went on to be game changers in the world of medicine.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.600
 That guy, Daniel Rambo, he had the nickname

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.360
 "The Fat Little Fellow."

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.760
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.400
 And he played in the same team as the Monocle guy.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 And he played rugby, international rugby, for Ireland,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.160
 but never told his parents.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.720
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.040
 Isn't that amazing? His parents didn't know.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.120
 Why? Because he was worried that if he told them,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.320
 they might stop him from doing it,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.440
 cos they thought they would kind of interfere with his studies.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.640
 Oh. So he just refused to tell them.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.320
 Was he funny or so funny? Where have you been, nowhere?

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.880
 Why are you covered in mud?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.440
 Whose monocle is that? No one's.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.880
 Where are your pants? (LAUGHTER)

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.960
 Wasn't there one player on the team who had one hand?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.200
 I think there was on the same team.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.200
 Thomas Gisborne Gordon. Yeah.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.360
 Only ever players have played international rugby

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.840
 with only one hand. Wow, really?

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.960
 He was really so funny. There is a thing in rugby called a hand-off,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.280
 where you kind of push someone away,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.000
 but he literally had his hand-off.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.200
 Do you think he just misinterpreted that rule

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.800
 in the changing room before the match?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.360
 I found a guy who I think Dan might like.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.480
 Oh, yeah. So this is...

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.200
 This was a story in The Times about great old rugby players

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.120
 by Alistair Reed, and it was a rugby player called Graham Donald.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.600
 He played for Scotland, and then the First World War broke out,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.480
 cutting short his career, but he signed up.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.920
 He was in the RAF.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.360
 And he was, I think, on a training flight,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.080
 and he was doing a loop-the-loop in his plane.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.680
 Oh! Jesus, man!

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.640
 And what? Safety belt snapped. Oh, my God!

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.600
 Oh, no. Come on. And he fell out of the plane.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.320
 No, no, no, no. This is amazing.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.520
 He fell 2,000 feet.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.560
 He landed on the top wing of his own plane.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.480
 Yeah, yeah. This is okay.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.920
 Never happened. Never happened.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.160
 I said this a long time ago. I've been given shit about it.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.280
 I swear it's true. I've read multiple accounts,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.360
 so he was doing the loop-the-loop at the top, seatbelt snaps,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.720
 he plummets down, but, fortunately,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.960
 his plane is continuing the loop-the-loop,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.080
 comes back around, and he lands back in it, and he survives.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.440
 No. It's not going to make us believe it more

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.600
 just because Andy's now also said it.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.080
 Two out of four. Come back in a couple of years.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.280
 No chance. You'll get us eventually.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.120
 In Samoa, they play a lot of rugby,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.480
 and the Samoan Times in 1926 reported on an international match

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.600
 against Tonga, one of the early matches they played,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.120
 and the report went like this,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.680
 "Apologies, our rugby correspondent has failed us this week

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.600
 "and owing to a previous engagement at a hopscotch match

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.320
 "near the market hall, did not see the rugby game."

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.800
 Oh, my God.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.840
 Was rugby underappreciated, then, or was hopscotch a huge sport?

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.720
 Guys, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.920
 Can I get one more player? Yeah, go for it.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.680
 This guy called Tom Youngs from this year,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.440
 a modern rugby player, plays for Leicester,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.680
 and he plays, you know, in the front line of the scrum

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.800
 that you've got, is it what?

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.640
 Two props, and the hooker is the position in the middle

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.760
 because you hook the ball back with your foot is the idea.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.080
 And he was in the news for some reason.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.440
 He was being charged with some disciplinary action.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.520
 But an American news website writing it up

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.680
 seems to have had some auto-replacement software on,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.360
 because it wrote, "Lester Tiger's prostitute charged by RFU."

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.080
 We don't know that he wasn't a prostitute.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.960
 No, that's true.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.160
 And this keeps happening.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.680
 There's a player called Ross Batty, who also plays as a hooker,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.240
 and they wrote about him,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:59.320
 "Barth Hall announces medical retirement from a matter of running."

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.040
 All right, look, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.080
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.440
 My fact this week is that the engineers

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.960
 who sent the first woman into space forgot to give her two things.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.600
 One, a toothbrush, and two, the ability to return back to Earth.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.040
 Wow, so she's still out there?

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.240
 -Still there? -Boasting around with rotten tea.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.800
 So this was a cosmonaut called Valentina Tereshkova.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.960
 She went up into space in 1963, first woman ever to do it.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.760
 And the program inside the craft had in it the program to ascend,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.840
 but not to descend, not to come back into Earth.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.520
 And she was hours up there when she suddenly noticed

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.120
 that she had no ability to get back to Earth,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.320
 had to call back down to Earth and say,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.640
 "Hey, uh..."

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.360
 -Tiny thing. -Tiny thing.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.040
 We'll get to the toothbrush later.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.440
 But can you give me the code to get back to Earth?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.840
 And they had to send it up to her, and she had to plug it back in.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.640
 And fortunately, it worked, and she was able to come back down.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.760
 But had they not had the ability for her to reprogram it,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.360
 she would have just been stuck up there.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.960
 Yeah, it was like literally the difference between going up or going down, wasn't it?

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.560
 It was like she pressed, "Okay, go back to Earth now."

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.920
 -And they just get in further and further away. -Oh, that's so stressful.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.760
 It's like being on an inflatable and just bobbing a bit far out to sea.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.360
 -Yeah. -It's a bit like that.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.600
 Maybe it's even more stressful than that. I don't know.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.120
 That's in the interview. That's exactly what she said.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.960
 She was like, "Oh, you know Andy, when he was on holiday, it was like that, only not as bad."

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.640
 And even worse, it really rubbed salt in the toothbrush wound, I guess.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.200
 Because if you know you were going to be without a toothbrush for three days or whatever, however long it was,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.480
 that's kind of okay.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.880
 But when you know it's going to be forever.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.960
 -Yeah. -That's way worse.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.680
 So she was up there orbiting the Earth for three days,

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.960
 and then the way it worked back in the day was there was no exact science to where you were going to land.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.160
 So what you had to do was you descended back into Earth, you came down,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160
 and you literally ejected yourself at a good height with a parachute,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.240
 and then you just landed wherever you landed.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.520
 And she landed in a small town in Kazakhstan,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.520
 and some local villagers came, found her, got her out of her suit,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.040
 because it's really hard to get out of.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.720
 -And then she just had... -Whoa, God, you need to brush those teeth.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.280
 Put that helmet back on now.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.680
 Yeah, and then she just had dinner with them while, I guess, everyone with the space agency

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.960
 was just trying to locate her.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.120
 She got in a lot of trouble for that, Tereshka, actually,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.720
 because they didn't know if she'd caught some space cooties or something while she was out there.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:41.160
 So coming down and going straight to see these peasants was a real no-no.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.280
 Yeah, wow.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.960
 She logged in that flight more flight time than the combined times of all other American astronauts

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.040
 who had been in space up to that date.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.000
 Up to that date, right.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.280
 And the weird thing about it is another woman didn't go to space for 20 years.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.400
 -So odd, isn't it? -She used up all the flight time.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.680
 That was it.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.960
 -Selfish? -Selfish.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.800
 Shouldn't have demanded that extension, should she?

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.520
 The other thing about when she landed is...

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.040
 So she did land, and then she went to see these people and had dinner with them.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.400
 But obviously, the Soviet Union had propaganda to sort out, right?

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.600
 And so what they did was...

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.480
 And she had a bruise on her face because it was quite a tough landing.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.920
 So they came and gave her a load of makeup, shoved her back into the capsule,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.760
 and said, "Okay, let's get some actors here."

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.240
 And they got some actors to open the door and say,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.040
 "Ah, Valentina Toreshkova, you are back on there."

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.080
 That's amazing.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.520
 That's so funny.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.880
 It was very managed.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.440
 Like, I think the government sort of arranged her marriage after this, right?

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.280
 Or strongly encouraged her to marry another astronaut, basically.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.960
 Yeah, the difference between arranged marriage and Khrushchev saying to you,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.480
 "I think you should get married."

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.680
 -Yeah. -There's not much difference.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.400
 It's tight. And Khrushchev officiated.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.680
 I thought he had better things to do,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.920
 but Khrushchev's there as the priest, basically, marrying them to each other.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.120
 That's not weird.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.480
 I don't know if you did that online thing,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.480
 where you get your credentials in advance the night before.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.080
 That's so interesting, because I always thought...

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.800
 So she was up in the Vostok 6, it was called.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.200
 And she often does talks around the world,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.920
 and they bring the actual capsule to different places.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.120
 And she really loves it.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.520
 She always strokes it, and she said of it,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.080
 "My lovely one, my best and most beautiful friend,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.920
 my best and most beautiful man."

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.480
 And I always...

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.120
 You know those people who, like, marry the Berlin Wall?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.080
 I always get...

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.320
 When you say people, it was one time...

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.880
 Well, there's somebody married a rollercoaster

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.520
 in the Berlin Wall and the Eiffel Tower as well.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.560
 I feel like Valentina's, you know, one of them.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.440
 She's on the path.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.800
 Did she stay married to the human she married?

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.360
 No.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.280
 No, she was caught in bed with the Vostok 6.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.880
 She was ready to mingle.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.560
 Actually, one thing that she had in common

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.320
 with a rugby player we mentioned before

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.840
 is that she never told her mother that she was going into space.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.800
 And her mother only found out when she saw it on the news.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.520
 What?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.080
 Whoa.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.840
 Yeah, because it was really classified.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.680
 Like, the Soviet Union didn't tell anyone

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.200
 that it was happening, possibly in case things went wrong, right?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.680
 But when she went to the place to do it,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.080
 everyone said that she was doing, like, a parachute jump.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.880
 And she kept it up.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.480
 She said, "No, I'm just doing a parachute jump.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.520
 I'm just doing a parachute jump."

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.280
 But actually, this was what she was doing.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.800
 I guess, at the end of it, she was.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.640
 She was a very, very big, with a three-day run-up.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.120
 Wow.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.360
 But I tell my family so much stuff.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.520
 I tell my family, you know, when I've had a cup of tea.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.840
 I don't think I could keep secret that I was going to be a tea.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.480
 The first.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.360
 They don't ring back.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.920
 Yeah, they've stopped answering in recent years.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.880
 Yeah.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.160
 My wife never told her parents when she became a helicopter pilot

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.360
 until after she'd done it.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.520
 And she's Russian, so maybe it's in the jeans.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.640
 Yeah, because actually, she also kept the parachuting secret.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.120
 In fact, the two first women in space,

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.160
 both of whom were Russian,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.600
 both basically went to space

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.120
 because they were really into parachute jumps.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.200
 I genuinely think it was for the thrill of that final bit

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.560
 where you parachute out.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.960
 And they were both parachuting surreptitiously

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.240
 without telling their parents.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.920
 I don't know what Russian parents are like,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.000
 that they bound their children from jumping from high things.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.080
 Well, put it this way, the first time I met my in-laws,

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.400
 I was in my mid-30s,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.480
 and they wouldn't stop telling me to put a hat on,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.440
 otherwise I'll be cold.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.000
 For the listener at home, James is wearing a hat right now.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.840
 Took it to heart.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.720
 You never know where those Russians are watching.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.960
 So, China are currently building a new space station,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.440
 and they have sent recently a very clear signal

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.320
 that one of the crew is going to be a woman.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.320
 I don't know if you can guess what the sign is.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.600
 It's not an announcement or anything,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.720
 but they've announced--

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.680
 They painted it pink.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.880
 They've announced the lineup of stuff

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.640
 that's going to be put in the payload to go up there,

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.640
 and it includes 30 bottles of face cream,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.520
 30 of serum, and 60 bottles of toner.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.800
 So that is the indication.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.400
 Toner, not for a printer.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.600
 Not for a printer, for a human face.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.320
 And I don't know any more than that about what toner does.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.560
 Tones you up, I imagine.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.440
 I guess, yeah.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.080
 Yeah, probably that.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.240
 They had a lot of weird stipulations, didn't they?

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.240
 The Chinese about the female astronauts.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.520
 They had to be married.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.880
 They've had to have given birth.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.680
 Oh, really?

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.680
 This might be the old Tyconauts,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.480
 as opposed to this new batch that you were talking about.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.120
 That's weird, because it was the having children element

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.400
 of women, that inconvenient element of females

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.080
 that put Russia off sending any more women

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.120
 into space.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.160
 So when the first one went up, came back down,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.840
 and then Russia went, actually, this is super dangerous,

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.960
 and you might have kids.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.080
 So they thought it's not fair on the potential children

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:25.480
 that were around.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.680
 Like radiation, or this kind of thing.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.280
 No, more like you might die in space.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:28.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.360
 And then you definitely can't get pregnant

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.320
 and have kids after that.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.760
 Yeah.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.560
 Yeah, very good point.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.960
 If you already have children, they'll be upset.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.520
 They'll be sad.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.960
 Especially if you didn't tell them you were going

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.600
 in the first place.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 They thought you were just doing a parachute jump.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.200
 One other thing about Toreshkova

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.440
 is that she was really sick when she went up.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.920
 And there are a few reasons that she might have been sick.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.360
 And if you look at different sources,

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.800
 it's different things.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.200
 So some people think it was because she was on her period

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.360
 and she felt really ill when she went up there.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.520
 Some people thought it was because she'd eaten

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.000
 some tinned fish and lemon pie on the way up.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.960
 And that's why she felt ill.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.880
 The nicest combination of foods in the world.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.080
 Tinned fish followed by some lemon pie, nice and quickly.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.880
 But I read in one Russian source that she,

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.280
 when she was sick, she didn't want the people on the ground

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.080
 to know she was sick.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.880
 So she hid her vomit behind some panels.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.000
 And the space station.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.640
 What is this woman's thing with secrecy?

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.040
 Why is she telling anyone anything?

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.480
 I didn't see that in any of the stars.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.200
 It might not be true.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.760
 But her vomit fried the electrics on the spaceship

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.040
 and then she couldn't get home.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.480
 This woman is a liability.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.600
 But you know, we're saying like the Russian and the Chinese,

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.800
 the Americans were very much, you know,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.120
 19 years after Valentina went to space

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.480
 is when someone else went up.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.000
 And that includes the Americans.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.600
 And famously, earlier with Jeff Bezos,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.040
 Wally Funk went to space,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.360
 finally after a lifetime of wanting to go to space.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.520
 And she was part of the original astronauts

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.040
 that were training with the Mercury.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.480
 So John Glenn and so on,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.160
 who went up in orbit to the world.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.040
 She did everything that they did and she did it perfect.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.160
 So the things she had to do is the preparation included,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.320
 she had to swallow three feet of rubber hose.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.680
 She had to drink a pint.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.400
 Yeah.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.640
 It's not some kind of hazing ceremony you have

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.240
 when you get on the spaceship.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.800
 Why?

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.840
 I guess you should have read up on that, really.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.720
 That is an odd sentence.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.280
 Three feet is a lot.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.320
 Three feet is a lot.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.040
 This is a lot, that.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.880
 Yeah, because you had to...

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.400
 That's coming out the other end.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.280
 That's tough.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.120
 Like a weird dental floss thing, yeah.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.960
 What?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.320
 It's a huge enema.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.640
 Right.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.600
 So three feet, she swallowed three feet of rubber.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.800
 She drank a pint of radioactive water again.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.040
 Should have read up on what reason that was for.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.920
 And she did this thing, which is extraordinary.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.160
 She stayed in an isolation tank for 10 and a half hours,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.080
 which was a record time,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.720
 even for the other male astronauts that were doing it.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.680
 And she was chilled.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.920
 And when they checked in on her, she was basically like,

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.200
 has it been 10 and a half hours?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.920
 Oh, keep me in.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.640
 I'm fine.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.440
 Oh, you mean chilled?

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.520
 Sorry, I thought you meant chilled like in a fridge or something.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.600
 She was in complete darkness and silence.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.040
 She passed every single test.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.400
 And it was basically John Glenn,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.600
 who was the first person to orbit the earth as an American,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.280
 said, I don't think women should do this.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.000
 It's the only reason that Wally Funk wasn't allowed.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Took, I mean, to give them their due,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.520
 the Soviets were a bit better in some areas

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.000
 of gender equality than the Americans.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.480
 Yeah, it was equally shit for everyone in the Soviet Union.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.680
 It was equally shit.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.760
 Like they, there certainly just seemed to be a sense

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.680
 that women weren't quite expected to fulfill

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.680
 that very stereotypical female role

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.560
 that women were expected to perform in America.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.560
 And so like the second woman in space,

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.720
 the second woman in space was Russian as well.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.000
 And was Svetlana Savitskaya.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.680
 And she was awesome.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.720
 She led an all-female team to victory

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.680
 in the World Aerobatic Championships in 1970.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.800
 Oh, that's amazing.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.360
 No woman had ever really flown aerobatically like that before.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.680
 And it was a full female team, thrashed all the men.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.240
 That's amazing.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.720
 And then did they do that thing when you do a loop the loop

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.240
 and you kind of fall out halfway around?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.040
 Such a good move.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.960
 That's the main one, isn't it?

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.240
 But Donald, yeah.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.480
 All right, well, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.560
 So we're going to move on to fact number three.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.960
 And that is James.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.120
 Okay, my fact this week is that

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.400
 in the Toda Society of Southern India,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.480
 milkmen are not allowed to have sex.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.000
 Was this brought in after an incident?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.520
 They've just been fathering too many goddamn kids.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.960
 It was not that.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.280
 Okay.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.200
 So this is a society from the Tamil Nadu area.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.920
 And all their traditions are centered around the buffalo.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.400
 Okay, so all the rituals around the buffalo.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.040
 So like whenever they do any dairy activity,

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.400
 there's loads of rituals.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.680
 Whenever they're looking after the herds,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.960
 there's loads of rituals.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.160
 And they have this guy in their society called the holy milkman.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.400
 And he is basically a priest.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.600
 He does all of these things.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.120
 And it's a really tough job being the holy milkman.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.000
 So he has to be celibate, as I said, the whole time.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.160
 He's never allowed to visit his family while he's the milkman.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.640
 Like you can stop being the milkman at some stage if you want,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.880
 but while you're the milkman, you're not allowed to visit your family.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.520
 Except for when you're leaving milk outside the door.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.080
 Well, no one's even allowed to talk to you if you're the milkman.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.000
 Well, it's so early in the morning, isn't it, you know?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.320
 They're allowed to approach you two days a week,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.520
 Mondays and Thursdays.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.200
 They're allowed to come over to you and chat to you.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.920
 But any other day, if you want to speak to the holy milkman,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.320
 you have to stand on the other side of the street

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.840
 or the other side of the field and go,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.360
 "How's it going over there?"

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.920
 Can we change to three pints, please?

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.080
 The next week, thank you.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.480
 Yeah, and if there's like a funeral in his family

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.760
 and he needs to go to the funeral,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.240
 or there's a real reason that he has to go back to his family,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.840
 he has to resign as the milkman.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.240
 Well, also, if someone touches him by accident,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.440
 he has to give up office,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.560
 which feels that's quite risky as a job.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.640
 I'd ask someone to do it immediately.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.080
 It's the shittest job.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.600
 I think they liked it, though, right?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.800
 I don't know, man.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.320
 It sounds really rough.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.200
 Even to qualify to become one of these priests,

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.800
 which, as I say, is very undesirable.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.880
 You can't really spend time with anyone, ever.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.400
 You, to qualify, you have to do this massive fast

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.520
 of starve yourself for a while,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.880
 and then you're sent off to sleep in the forest naked and alone

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.560
 for several nights in succession.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.000
 And there are tigers around,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.560
 and other things that can happen to you.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.200
 And it is quite cold, because it's quite high up.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.240
 So, yeah, I don't know about days lying naked.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.840
 But you get status.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.040
 You do get big status.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.280
 So there was an account of the milkman,

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.840
 and he was asked whether the toaders salute the sun,

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.880
 whether it's a sun worshipping religion.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.360
 And he said, "Those poor fellows do,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.440
 i.e. the other members of the toadah group,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.760
 but I, I, a God, why should I salute the sun?"

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.960
 So you get, it's a status bump, definitely.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.080
 A perk, not having to salute the sun.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.200
 Can't ever have sex again, but we know how to salute the sun.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.360
 So... Do they live with the buffalo?

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.680
 Because they live in what's called the sacred dairy.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.960
 And the... Yes, oh, the kind of they do.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:09.240
 So, basically, each family lives in a kind of a barrel-shaped house.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.520
 And in that kind of community,

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.280
 there's quite a few families all live together,

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.800
 and that group all have the buffaloes that they kind of look after.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.120
 But there's one guy who's in charge of the milking.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.080
 Yeah, there was a TV series about that.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.680
 Exactly, it was Billy Piper was in it.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.440
 It was called the Sacred Dairy of a Coal Girl.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.240
 I don't know if you saw it.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.000
 Oh, wow.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.800
 That was actually a misprint because she was actually playing rugby.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.240
 She was a Coal Girl after all.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.600
 They have a lot of change about the toadah.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.400
 And one of the things from back in the day is that

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.280
 the women of the toadah used to practice fraternal polyandry.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.280
 So, they would have to marry all the brothers of one family,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.960
 and that would be the husbands.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.840
 Wow. Yeah, exactly.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.880
 And like you say, this doesn't really happen anymore.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.080
 The milkman stuff still does,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.320
 but a lot of the old stuff doesn't really happen.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.920
 But it used to be that when a toadah woman was pregnant,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.640
 and she had all of these different husbands who were all brothers,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.800
 so you knew who was the father.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.120
 They would give her a toy bow and arrow,

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.040
 and the husband would give them that.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.360
 That's how you would know that he was the father of the child.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.280
 But you know the weird thing about the bow and arrow?

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.600
 No.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.120
 They had no idea what it was for.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.080
 Really?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.480
 They, so this is, people were astonished when,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.240
 I guess they were studied to be studied in the late 19th centuries,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.720
 and bows and arrows, and bows especially,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.400
 have a hugely significant place symbolically in their society.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.160
 They used in weddings and funerals,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.400
 and they have no idea that they're actually weapons.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.600
 They don't, they don't hunt.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.720
 They don't use them for hunting.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.080
 They've just got defunct bows and arrows.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.520
 There must be accidents happening all the time

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.560
 if you don't know that it's a weapon.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.160
 Because you wouldn't know to put the arrow in the bow, would you?

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.120
 That's a good point.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.360
 Yes, because, yeah, you're right, they're pastoral,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.840
 so they're really only bothered about the buffalo

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.440
 and getting all the stuff from the buffalo,

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.960
 and then they trade that for the meat,

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.560
 so they don't, they're not hunters.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:01.960
 Wow.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.520
 Yeah.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.960
 They actually were sort of a very hierarchical society.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.080
 Back in the 19th century, they were king of the hill, literally.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.920
 So the toad are basically in charge of a bunch of other tribes

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.640
 all around them.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.120
 It's in the Nilgeary mountain area.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.600
 And like James says, all they're doing is making milk.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.960
 And they basically made everyone else give them everything else.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.000
 So other tribes would have to pay deference to them,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.280
 taxes to them, basically.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.240
 So the Vadakas tribe would have to pay 10% of their vegetables,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.000
 they grew each year to them in rent.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.640
 And yeah, it was, it's impressive.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.080
 They sort of made people happily subservient to them.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:39.720
 It is impressive.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.800
 Another impressive thing about them is their language,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.760
 the toda language.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.160
 The toda language has six trills that know what the language has.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.480
 So you know, like when you roll your r's, that kind of thing.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.880
 Don't say that to the milkman.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.800
 He's not allowed to reply.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.360
 I read a paper in the Journal of International Phonetic Association

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.360
 by Sinisha Spijic.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.880
 And they say, you know, you need to get all these trills right.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.200
 Otherwise, you're not going to be able to say the words right.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.680
 The first paragraph of that paper ends,

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.080
 toda is a rich source for trill-seeking phoneticians.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.560
 Brilliant.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.920
 Nice.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.880
 Brilliant.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.720
 More people have probably heard that joke now

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.680
 than have ever heard that joke since it was written in the academic paper.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.640
 You have been the super spreader for that joke.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.200
 That is really nice.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.560
 It's a great joke.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.760
 If you want to get married in the toda society as a man,

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.120
 you have to lift a 120 kilogram stone.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.800
 And if you don't lift it,

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.200
 then you won't be able to get married to someone.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.080
 120 kilos stone, in case you don't know,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.480
 is just over twice as heavy as Emma Stone.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.920
 That puts it into context.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.360
 It puts it into context, that, doesn't it?

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.040
 Milkman?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.760
 Yeah.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.280
 Let's have some milkman.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.240
 Some American houses back in the day had a milk door.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.600
 Isn't that cool?

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.880
 Was it a normal sized door?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.040
 Or was it a tiny little like cat flap?

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.640
 It's a tiny cat flap sized door.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.840
 Don't mix it up with a cat flap though,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.000
 because don't leave your milk where the cat's going to go in.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.640
 Danger, yeah.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.200
 Danger.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.440
 But it was just a way of getting your milk without talking to the milkman,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.080
 if you didn't want to.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.920
 Is that right?

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.720
 Yeah.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.400
 But that sounds like in the UK,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.160
 that that was a thing anyway,

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.800
 that you used to just leave your windows open,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.760
 or your doors open,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.880
 and during the middle of the night,

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.080
 the milkman would sneak in.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.400
 The milkman.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:21.880
 Man.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.280
 And he would fill up your jug.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.800
 And then he would sneak back out again,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.680
 and you'd never know he'd come down.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.440
 You've been watching some soft porn films from the 1970s.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.000
 Sorsy.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.840
 I never get to the sex.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.880
 I'm just like, rewind that.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.800
 This milkman bit's fucking amazing.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.160
 But the milk door, sometimes it would be a separate,

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.520
 so there's a door on the outside of your house,

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.640
 with a little ledge,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.080
 where the milkman puts the milk,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.280
 and then he closes the door,

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.040
 and then you open it from the other side.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.080
 There's another door on the other side.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.280
 But the clever thing is,

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.840
 on the milkman's side of the milk door,

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.400
 there is a dial where you could adjust the milk meter,

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.680
 and you could show the milkman

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.480
 how much milk you wanted in your milk door every morning.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.480
 I wonder if that was used as a euphemism very often.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.120
 I bet it was.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.880
 I bet that was mostly used by housewives

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.480
 when their husbands had gone to work.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.760
 It's a green or a red light.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.520
 The milk meter is set to full fat today.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.240
 Have you guys heard of Sean Garvey?

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.040
 You must have done, right?

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.520
 Yeah.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.480
 That's Sean Garvey.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.480
 Sean Garvey, milkman of the year 2004.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.360
 Right.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.000
 Actually.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.880
 Oh, well, he won milkman of the year in 2004,

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.600
 after he rescued a 92-year-old customer

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.040
 from a gas-filled kitchen.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.520
 Oh, okay.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.160
 Yeah.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.080
 Have you guys heard of Ian Beardwell?

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.960
 Definitely, yeah.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.840
 Milkman of the year 2007, right?

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.120
 I think he was a milkman of the year.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.080
 I just can't remember the year.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.200
 I remember the year, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.160
 2018, of course.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.120
 2018, yeah, yeah.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.840
 Yeah.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.160
 He kind of was chasing car thieves.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.040
 He returned and lost laptop after finding it on the road.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.360
 So, yeah, he won milkman of the year.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.960
 Wait, sorry, what's that got to do with milk?

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.360
 That sounds like he's a milkman by day,

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.640
 but a Superman vigilante by night.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.320
 He's a milkman by night.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:58.920
 Okay.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.600
 Have you heard of Steve Leach?

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:00.840
 No.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.880
 What year?

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.680
 What do you know what?

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.200
 What year did he win milkman of the year?

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.240
 Oh, he didn't win milkman of the year.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.880
 Oh, gosh.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.400
 He won milkman of the millennium.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.040
 [GASPING]

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.080
 That's huge.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.880
 It's huge.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:17.800
 In 2002, when he put out a raging fire with 320 pints of milk,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:24.680
 he said, "I kicked the door in and started pouring milk everywhere."

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.440
 It was hard work opening all those bottles

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.120
 as they have tamper-proof lids.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.040
 It was even harder trying to explain to my boss

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.640
 where all the milk had gone.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.520
 What?

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.800
 That is insane.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.000
 I don't buy this story.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.560
 I think that--

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.200
 This is crazier than the fucking guy falling out of the plane.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.360
 That-- I was thinking when you said 2002,

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.640
 "You're a milkman of the millennium."

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.800
 I thought, "That's a bit early to be dishing it out.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.880
 There are 998 years left to order."

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.760
 I say, "Give it to him."

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.560
 That's incredible.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.880
 That's insane.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.000
 Hey, listen, we need to move on to our final fact of the show,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 and that is Anna.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.640
 My fact this week is that George Lucas

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.840
 owns four ranches in the Lucas Valley,

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.320
 which is named after a completely different Lucas.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.600
 Did he go to the Lucas Valley because it was named that?

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.720
 I don't believe so.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.280
 No.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.520
 It is a beautiful valley in California

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.200
 where a lot of people like George Lucas hang out,

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.320
 so I think that helped.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.400
 But yeah, I was reading about his ranches,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.840
 which are pretty cool,

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.280
 and realized it was in Lucas Valley

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.360
 and thought, "Surely that's named after him."

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:28.840
 But it's not.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.680
 It's named after John Lucas,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.040
 who I'm sure you've all heard of,

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.080
 the 19th century rancher who was--

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.080
 He won Milkman of the Year, didn't he?

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.600
 1879, yeah, yeah.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.280
 Exactly.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.160
 There's not much on John Lucas on the internet, is there?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.640
 No, he was roped into running the ranch,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.400
 as far as I could tell, by his uncle,

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.080
 who dragged him over from Ireland,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.000
 but then wasn't really into it,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.840
 because he was a bit uppity.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.440
 And so I think his wife, Maria,

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.680
 basically ran the whole estate for a long time.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.040
 Yeah, he was roped into it a lot

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.200
 because his uncle died and left it to him.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.040
 That was a lot of it.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.680
 His uncle was called Timothy Murphy,

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.560
 and he first got the area,

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.720
 because it was owned by Mexico in those days.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.160
 And Mexico had a rule that if you were Roman Catholic

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.920
 and you had a Spanish name,

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.000
 then they would give you some free land.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.240
 But this guy was called Timothy Murphy,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.680
 so he changed his name to Dom Timateo Murphy.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.080
 Nice.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.640
 Very nice.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.040
 There is a place from San Rafael,

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.440
 which is the area that Lucas Valley is in.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.480
 There is a Native American group from there called the Miwok.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.320
 No, it sounds a little bit like Ewok,

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.080
 which is some of the things,

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.440
 and they're the teddy bears and stuff.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.680
 Yeah, yeah, but that's not a coincidence, though.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.400
 Oh, is it not?

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.120
 No, it's not a coincidence.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.640
 And they're not teddy bears, but they...

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:51.640
 Yeah, and now in a weird kind of full circle thing

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.200
 with Lucas,

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.800
 because he has the Skywalker Ranch there,

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.280
 which is where...

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.280
 Which is named after a completely different skywalker.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.160
 Exactly, so weird.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.920
 But there is now in this Miwok territory a lake,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.080
 which they made, a man-made lake,

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.920
 which is called Lake Ewok.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.760
 Yeah, he did name, just to clarify,

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.000
 the Ewoks sort of after the Miwok people,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.320
 but it also happened that it is Wookiee backwards,

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.240
 so which is another sort of teddy bear, isn't it?

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.200
 But a bigger teddy bear.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:21.320
 Yeah, sometimes you can just feel the emails and tweets coming in.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:28.520
 But he liked naming places, particularly for Star Wars,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.640
 with things that were relative to the places he was

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.760
 or that he wanted to go to.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.560
 So Tatooine, which is where Luke Skywalker is from,

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.680
 is actually named of the town Tatooine in Tunisia,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.720
 so he picked that up, yeah.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.760
 Was that like, that's where they filmed it, didn't they?

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.120
 In Tunisia.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.000
 R2-D2, that was when he was working on his previous film,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.120
 American Graffiti.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.720
 There was an editor who's shorthand

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.200
 for what was real to dialogue to.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.600
 He would say R2-D2, and that just stuck in his head.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:54.920
 Oh.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.240
 And then here's a weird one, but I'm a Star Wars fan,

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.240
 and this might be quite obvious to Star Wars fans,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.520
 but I'd never heard it.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.200
 Luke Skywalker is Luke S, Lucas.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.240
 Okay.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.000
 Oh, that's a weird mountainous entity.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.040
 Oh, he's called George Lucas.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.320
 Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.720
 He's named the hero of his whole thing.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.360
 That's interesting.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.040
 After a self, Lucas.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.560
 So it's like Luke Skywalker,

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.920
 do you think it's based on him?

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.840
 He's like, he wrote himself into it.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.800
 Possibly, yeah.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.560
 He definitely wrote his dog into it.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.200
 Did he?

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.000
 Yeah, so Chewbacca, who's the big teddy bear,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.600
 was based partly on his dog.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.160
 He had Malamute, I think it's pronounced like this,

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.440
 great big shaggy dog.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.360
 But get this, that dog has inspired two

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.600
 of the greatest cinematic creations ever,

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.960
 because he had this dog, which was named Indiana.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.200
 Yeah, Chewy and Indy are both named after one dog.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.320
 That's amazing.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.920
 The dog was the inspiration for both of them.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.880
 He sounds like an unimaginative egotist so far,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.600
 doesn't he?

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.240
 Wow.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:51.880
 Ouch!

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.120
 Right, so I like the guy, but just based on this.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.680
 While we're on names very quickly,

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.720
 there's obviously Star Wars was George Lucas' thing,

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.560
 and then it turned into this giant empire.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.680
 And there's comic books, and there's animations,

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.320
 and all new characters are created all the time.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.840
 So there's a big encyclopedia of all the different Jedi masters

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.360
 and Siths and all that.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.520
 And there was someone who was working for the Lucas company,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.000
 and he created a Jedi, which he did as a bit of a joke.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.080
 He was called Soon Bates, and Soon Bates was a Jedi master.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.960
 And he wanted to get it as a joke, but it made it through.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.840
 So there is now a Jedi called Master Bates,

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.960
 who is an official Jedi, and created by a guy called Randy.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.840
 No kidding.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.280
 And it made it past the editors, and they regret it so much.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.600
 So he has to appear, because he is canon

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.120
 in the official encyclopedia,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.600
 but he's one of the only Jedi's who just does not appear.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.520
 He's in his bedroom most of the time, isn't he?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.240
 And I am unaware of most of the things in Star Wars.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.600
 But do you guys know something?

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.520
 If I say this, tell me if this makes sense.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.920
 So in one of the films, there is a resistance base

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.160
 on the planet of Dakar, and it's the scene of an epic battle

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.600
 between the resistance and the first order on Star Killer Base,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.760
 and was featured in the scene where Rey heads off

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.520
 to find an iconic Luke Skywalker.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.440
 Have you thought about doing the audiobooks?

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.320
 I don't know what any of that means.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.400
 This is the latest batch of Star Wars.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.440
 But it was filmed in a place called Greenham Common,

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.320
 which is in Berkshire, which is just down the road from here.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.600
 And what is amazing about Greenham Common,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.320
 and back more onto my kind of territory,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.880
 is that there was a protest there in the 80s,

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.760
 and they were going to put a load of nuclear weapons there.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.760
 And in 1982, 250 women decided to protest,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.680
 and said that we don't want this here.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.480
 And they decided specifically it had to be just women,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.640
 because they wanted to say, well, this is our children.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.240
 We don't want our children to have nuclear weapons in our area.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.720
 So it started with 250 women.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.200
 All the media outlets just really vilified them.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.920
 They called it a witch's cover and all this kind of stuff.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.440
 That was in 1982.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.480
 But by 1983, another protest happened there,

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.480
 and there were 50,000 women in this protest.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.000
 It was insane.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 They held hands for 14 miles all the way from their camp

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.600
 to a place called Older Mastin.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.680
 Isn't that amazing?

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.360
 And that's why no one has nuclear weapons anymore.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.800
 Well, that is why they don't have nuclear weapons in Berkshire anymore.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.000
 You know, it may the fourth be with you

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.080
 when it's May the Fourth and it's Star Wars Day,

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.280
 and we all say that.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.560
 Maybe you all say that.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.600
 People say that.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.680
 Only a few times a day.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.480
 Once a year.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.600
 And it's a cool thing.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.000
 Does everyone know where that came from?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.880
 You'll never say it again.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.000
 Yeah, someone knows it.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.120
 It was Margaret Thatcher who was the reason for it.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.520
 It was when she won the election in 1979.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.800
 It was her first day in office.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.000
 It was May the Fourth.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.680
 And so the conservatives put a congratulatory advert

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.200
 in the paper the next day,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.120
 saying, "May the Fourth be with you, Maggie.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.000
 Congratulations."

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 So, yeah.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.400
 And in one fell swoop, we've killed that saying forever.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.040
 You know the Star Wars merch?

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.680
 This is a huge element of the thing.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.160
 So George Lucas wrote the...

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.520
 He was given the chance to try and haggle upwards on his fee

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.440
 because he made a film called American Graffiti,

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.040
 which became a huge hit.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.640
 And he'd already signed up to Star Wars

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.000
 and he was sort of thinking about,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.280
 "Well, should I go for more of it?"

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.920
 And he said, "No, I'll take more of the merchandise rights.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.240
 Some big percentage of the merchandise sales."

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.480
 Which didn't really exist for films at the time.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.840
 You know, there wasn't much...

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.280
 You know, there wasn't George's merch

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.360
 in the way that there is Star Wars merch.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.760
 And the merchandise was so popular

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.480
 that the firm he got to do it, a firm called Kenner,

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.720
 they belonged to General Foods.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.240
 They were so taken by surprise.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.320
 The film came out in 1977.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.920
 Christmas, 1977.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.240
 It had been out for months and months in the USA.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.240
 It was, I think, just out in the UK.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.240
 Kenner was so short of stock

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.760
 that what they sold, an early bird certification package,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.160
 which was basically an IOU saying, "We do not have these toys,

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.640
 but if you send in a form,

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.000
 we will give them to you between February and June next year."

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.800
 And it was the hit of the Christmas.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.560
 An IOU. There were no toys.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.240
 There were some stickers and a form.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.600
 Wow. Yeah.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:29.400
 These empty boxes now sell for up to, you know, $8,000 on eBay.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:29.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.960
 If you have an unopened IOU box with no toy, it's mad.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.240
 It was the equivalent of, like,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.000
 when you're trying to book Glastonbury tickets,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.080
 and you're in that queue where you see the man

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.800
 walking towards the tickets, it's like, "Okay, I'm there.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.480
 I'm there in the queue. I've got my box."

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.280
 I don't know how it'll look at me.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.600
 I've never tried to buy Glastonbury tickets in my life.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.760
 Is it like when you try to buy Glymborn tickets?

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.360
 Yeah. Got it.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:50.680
 Thank you.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.920
 Do you guys know Michael Leeder?

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.120
 Is he a milkman?

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.880
 God, for God's sake.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.080
 Yes, he is a milkman.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.960
 Is it put on the desert planet or blah, blah?

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.240
 No, in EastEnders.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.160
 He's a milkman in the TV show EastEnders.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.520
 No, is he really milkman?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.280
 Yeah, he was 16 years on EastEnders as a milkman

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.040
 before he ever uttered his first bit of dialogue in the show.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.560
 No, I'm not allowed to have sex.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:21.880
 He spoke to a cabbie called Charlie Slater.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.000
 Oh, yeah, I know that part.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.920
 His line is, "Is this your squire?"

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.680
 That was his big break after 16 years of being the milkman

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.200
 on EastEnders.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.400
 Prior to his career as a milkman there,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.880
 he was in Star Wars as a stormtrooper.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.920
 Oh, really?

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.760
 Now, very hard to pick out your stormtroopers in Star Wars,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.840
 but it just so happens that he's possibly

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.760
 one of the most famous stormtroopers

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.920
 that the series ever produced,

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.200
 because a few people in the audience might recognize this.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.200
 There's a scene where stormtroopers

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.880
 are running through the Death Star,

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.920
 and one clumsy stormtrooper cracks his head

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.360
 on the side of an archway.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.680
 It's become a famous scene to the point

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.560
 where in 2004, when they re-released the DVDs,

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.200
 they added a thud so you could hear.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:06.840
 Was it?

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.960
 So he ran into it and went...

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:17.800
 Maybe we need to wrap up the show on that note, right?

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.320
 What?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.160
 How the fuck are we going to top that?

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.440
 Okay, that is it.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.720
 That is all of our facts.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.240

 to one of the members of our crowd.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.120
 This is for a 10-year-old in our crowd called Jamie.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.640
 There you go, Jamie.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.560
 Hope you enjoy it.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.920
 Thank you so much, Redding.
