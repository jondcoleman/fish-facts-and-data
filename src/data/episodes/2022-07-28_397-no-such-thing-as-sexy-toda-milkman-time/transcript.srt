1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,020
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,560
 this week coming to you live from Redding.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,560
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,420
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky,

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,800
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,560
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,800
 And in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,240
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,560
 - My fact is that the 1890s Irish rugby captain,

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,000
 D.B. Walkington, would play wearing a monocle,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,320
 but he took it out if he had to tackle anyone.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,720
 (audience laughing)

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,520
 This is a real person.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
 He was called Dollaway Bell Walkington, born in 1867.

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,480
 He played for Ireland eight times.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,560
 He was the captain twice,

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,960
 and he wore a monocle while he was playing.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,520
 He was extremely short-sighted,

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,680
 and he'd just pop it in, pop along, pop it out,

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,760
 make a tackle, pop it back in.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,600
 What a hero.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,560
 - Yeah, this guy was a great player,

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,600
 wasn't he, for Ireland?

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,360
 He played in the first ever team to beat Wales in 1888,

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,960
 although the Welsh team all claimed

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,000
 to have had sea sickness on the day.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
 (audience laughing)

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
 And they played so badly in that game

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,440
 that eight of the team never represented Wales ever again.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,480
 - Wow. - Oh my God.

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,440
 - He played in the 1887 team that beat England,

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,200
 so that was the first Ireland team ever to beat England.

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,400
 And there was another guy in that team called John Macaulay.

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,960
 And John Macaulay, so they had to go to England

39
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,880
 to play the game, but he couldn't get the time off work,

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,920
 and so he said to his work, "I'm gonna go and get married."

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,880
 And they said, "Are you?"

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,760
 And they went, "Okay, I'm gonna have to get married now."

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,960
 So he got married just so that he could get two weeks off

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
 so he could play this game.

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
 Oh my God.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
 - Wow. - Isn't that amazing?

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
 - That's incredible.

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,520
 - Did he get married just to a randomer?

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
 - No, to his future wife.

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
 - I mean, I know.

51
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,760
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,600
 I know that.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,120
 - She was happy with the arrangement.

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
 - They were going out.

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
 They were seeing each other. - They were going out, yeah.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
 They were a couple, right?

57
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,800
 - But rugby players, especially 19th century rugby players,

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,880
 just seemed like really interesting and fun people.

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,520
 Have you heard of Edward Pegg?

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
 - No.

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
 - Pegg was a Welsh player and he once missed the team train.

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,280
 They were going to Devon to play a match.

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,320
 He missed the train.

64
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,120
 So what do you think he did?

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,080
 - Well, got the next train.

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,920
 - He chartered a special train to catch up

67
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,440
 with the previous train.

68
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 - Was it like two men just pumping up and down?

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,680
 - Yeah.

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,000
 - But did he, he didn't jump onto the train in front of us?

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
 - No, he wasn't the Indiana Jones.

72
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,760
 - Yeah, right. - No, he was, yeah, yeah.

73
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,320
 - Yeah, it was, I mean, because back then

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,240
 the rules were all a bit wishy washy, weren't they?

75
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,920
 So like there was a famous match in the 1884

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
 home nations championship.

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,840
 It was Wales versus Ireland.

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
 Ireland went over to play the Welsh.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,160
 When they got there though,

80
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,720
 they didn't have enough men to play the match.

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
 So the Welsh team had to loan them

82
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,240
 two of their players to play the game.

83
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
 - Did they, did they win?

84
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
 'Cause you would have thought those two players,

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
 if they're gentlemen, they'll play well.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,960
 And if they're not, they'll jeopardize your chances.

87
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,640
 - Yeah, no, the Welsh won that match.

88
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,520
 So even though the Irish got the two.

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,000
 - That's what you'd expect. - Yeah, the Welsh still won.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,280
 - The first international between England and Scotland

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,720
 was in 1871.

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
 It was quite a boring affair.

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,080
 It came down, it was quite close as well towards the end.

94
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,880
 And Scotland scored the only try of the match

95
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,160
 towards the second half.

96
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,400
 But the English team were not happy.

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,080
 They were like, this is not fair.

98
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,640
 And so there was a massive argument

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
 between the referee and the two teams.

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,480
 Eventually the referee gave the try to Scotland.

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
 And afterwards, when they asked him about it,

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,480
 the referee, Dr. Rowland, he was called.

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,520
 He said, "I do not know whether my decision was correct."

104
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,800
 He said, "But when an umpire is in doubt,

105
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,880
 "I think he is justified in deciding against the team

106
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,360
 "which makes the most noise."

107
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,200
 (LAUGHTER)

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
 - Good point. - That's fair.

109
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
 The days before Hawkeye,

110
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,360
 he had to have something else to judge.

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,040
 In 1889, the Kiwis came over.

112
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,000
 So it's kind of amazing.

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
 Even back then, you know, it was already big enough

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 that people were making these international trips.

115
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,560
 And it was New Zealand versus England.

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,880
 It was in Blackheath.

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,040
 And there was this incident where an English player was tackled

118
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,960
 and his shorts got ripped off accidentally.

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,200
 - And it was very awkward for him. - Oi, oi.

120
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,640
 - The Kiwi players... - And he's put his monocle in.

121
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,960
 What's going on here?

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
 (LAUGHTER)

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
 'Cause the good, honest players,

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,040
 the Kiwis surrounded him, making him a little changing room

125
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,320
 so that he could put his pants back on again,

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,920
 his shorts back on again.

127
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,560
 As this was happening, all the other English players continued to play.

128
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,200
 One of them, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try,

129
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,480
 completely unopposed, 'cause the Kiwi players are protecting that guy.

130
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,080
 And then the Kiwi players understandably stormed off,

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,840
 bit pissed off, and had to apologise afterwards

132
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,000
 for abandoning the game.

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,440
 - Wow! - Oh, wow!

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,000
 - That was not a good game for them. - Yeah.

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,920
 I've found someone who I think might be the most

136
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,040
 historically significant rugby player of all time.

137
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,760
 - Ooh! - Not because of anything he did on the pitch.

138
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,440
 He was called Charles Kathcart, and he was a Scotland player.

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,480
 He had a brief career playing for Scotland.

140
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,880
 Then he became a doctor, and then a surgeon,

141
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,240
 and then a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons,

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
 who was very senior and eminent.

143
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,160
 And what he did was, he pioneered the use of sphagnum moss.

144
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,000
 - Jesus! - To dress wounds!

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
 And that was used in the First World War.

146
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,840
 There were a million wounds dressed per month

147
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,200
 at the height of the First World War,

148
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,960
 thanks to his innovation that it could soak up so much liquid.

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,200
 - And that is my rugby fact. - I was like,

150
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
 "Finally, a fact about sport."

151
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,480
 You can start talking about sport, and not fucking moss.

152
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,800
 Sorry, but that's... I mean, it's so interesting.

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,080
 All the early rugby players, particularly the Irish team

154
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,920
 and the in that late 1800s,

155
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,080
 went on to become quite prominent scientists.

156
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,600
 Like, if you look at that team,

157
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,280
 so there was a guy called Sir Thomas Rankin-Lyle.

158
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,480
 He was an Aussie/Irish who moved to Australia.

159
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,680
 One of the awards that gets given in science

160
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,080
 to this day in Australia is named after him.

161
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,280
 He was a real pioneer in science.

162
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
 There was a guy called Daniel Frederick Rambout.

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,360
 He played again in the 1800s.

164
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,720
 He was an Irish psychiatrist,

165
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,360
 and he was one of the pioneers, a modern psychiatry.

166
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,920
 All of these guys, like, a big portion of them

167
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,080
 went on to be game changers in the world of medicine.

168
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,600
 That guy, Daniel Rambo, he had the nickname

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,360
 "The Fat Little Fellow."

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,760
 (LAUGHTER)

171
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,400
 And he played in the same team as the Monocle guy.

172
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,120
 And he played rugby, international rugby, for Ireland,

173
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
 but never told his parents.

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,720
 (LAUGHTER)

175
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,040
 Isn't that amazing? His parents didn't know.

176
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,120
 Why? Because he was worried that if he told them,

177
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
 they might stop him from doing it,

178
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,440
 cos they thought they would kind of interfere with his studies.

179
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,640
 Oh. So he just refused to tell them.

180
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,320
 Was he funny or so funny? Where have you been, nowhere?

181
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,400
 (LAUGHTER)

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,880
 Why are you covered in mud?

183
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,440
 Whose monocle is that? No one's.

184
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,880
 Where are your pants? (LAUGHTER)

185
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,960
 Wasn't there one player on the team who had one hand?

186
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,200
 I think there was on the same team.

187
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
 Thomas Gisborne Gordon. Yeah.

188
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,360
 Only ever players have played international rugby

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,840
 with only one hand. Wow, really?

190
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,960
 He was really so funny. There is a thing in rugby called a hand-off,

191
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,280
 where you kind of push someone away,

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,000
 but he literally had his hand-off.

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,200
 Do you think he just misinterpreted that rule

194
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
 in the changing room before the match?

195
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
 I found a guy who I think Dan might like.

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
 Oh, yeah. So this is...

197
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,200
 This was a story in The Times about great old rugby players

198
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,120
 by Alistair Reed, and it was a rugby player called Graham Donald.

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,600
 He played for Scotland, and then the First World War broke out,

200
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,480
 cutting short his career, but he signed up.

201
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
 He was in the RAF.

202
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,360
 And he was, I think, on a training flight,

203
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,080
 and he was doing a loop-the-loop in his plane.

204
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,680
 Oh! Jesus, man!

205
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
 And what? Safety belt snapped. Oh, my God!

206
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,600
 Oh, no. Come on. And he fell out of the plane.

207
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,320
 No, no, no, no. This is amazing.

208
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,520
 He fell 2,000 feet.

209
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,560
 He landed on the top wing of his own plane.

210
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,480
 Yeah, yeah. This is okay.

211
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,920
 Never happened. Never happened.

212
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,160
 I said this a long time ago. I've been given shit about it.

213
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,280
 I swear it's true. I've read multiple accounts,

214
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,360
 so he was doing the loop-the-loop at the top, seatbelt snaps,

215
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,720
 he plummets down, but, fortunately,

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,960
 his plane is continuing the loop-the-loop,

217
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,080
 comes back around, and he lands back in it, and he survives.

218
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,440
 No. It's not going to make us believe it more

219
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,600
 just because Andy's now also said it.

220
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,080
 Two out of four. Come back in a couple of years.

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,280
 No chance. You'll get us eventually.

222
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,120
 In Samoa, they play a lot of rugby,

223
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,480
 and the Samoan Times in 1926 reported on an international match

224
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,600
 against Tonga, one of the early matches they played,

225
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
 and the report went like this,

226
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,680
 "Apologies, our rugby correspondent has failed us this week

227
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,600
 "and owing to a previous engagement at a hopscotch match

228
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,320
 "near the market hall, did not see the rugby game."

229
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,800
 Oh, my God.

230
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,840
 Was rugby underappreciated, then, or was hopscotch a huge sport?

231
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,720
 Guys, we need to move on to our next fact.

232
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,920
 Can I get one more player? Yeah, go for it.

233
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,680
 This guy called Tom Youngs from this year,

234
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,440
 a modern rugby player, plays for Leicester,

235
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,680
 and he plays, you know, in the front line of the scrum

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,800
 that you've got, is it what?

237
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
 Two props, and the hooker is the position in the middle

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,760
 because you hook the ball back with your foot is the idea.

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
 And he was in the news for some reason.

240
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,440
 He was being charged with some disciplinary action.

241
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,520
 But an American news website writing it up

242
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,680
 seems to have had some auto-replacement software on,

243
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,360
 because it wrote, "Lester Tiger's prostitute charged by RFU."

244
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,080
 We don't know that he wasn't a prostitute.

245
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,960
 No, that's true.

246
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,160
 And this keeps happening.

247
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,680
 There's a player called Ross Batty, who also plays as a hooker,

248
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,240
 and they wrote about him,

249
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,320
 "Barth Hall announces medical retirement from a matter of running."

250
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,040
 All right, look, we need to move on to our next fact.

251
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,080
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

252
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,440
 My fact this week is that the engineers

253
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,960
 who sent the first woman into space forgot to give her two things.

254
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,600
 One, a toothbrush, and two, the ability to return back to Earth.

255
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
 (LAUGHTER)

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
 Wow, so she's still out there?

257
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
 -Still there? -Boasting around with rotten tea.

258
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,800
 So this was a cosmonaut called Valentina Tereshkova.

259
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,960
 She went up into space in 1963, first woman ever to do it.

260
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,760
 And the program inside the craft had in it the program to ascend,

261
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,840
 but not to descend, not to come back into Earth.

262
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,520
 And she was hours up there when she suddenly noticed

263
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,120
 that she had no ability to get back to Earth,

264
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,320
 had to call back down to Earth and say,

265
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,640
 "Hey, uh..."

266
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,360
 -Tiny thing. -Tiny thing.

267
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,040
 We'll get to the toothbrush later.

268
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
 But can you give me the code to get back to Earth?

269
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,840
 And they had to send it up to her, and she had to plug it back in.

270
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,640
 And fortunately, it worked, and she was able to come back down.

271
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,760
 But had they not had the ability for her to reprogram it,

272
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
 she would have just been stuck up there.

273
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,960
 Yeah, it was like literally the difference between going up or going down, wasn't it?

274
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,560
 It was like she pressed, "Okay, go back to Earth now."

275
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,920
 -And they just get in further and further away. -Oh, that's so stressful.

276
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,760
 It's like being on an inflatable and just bobbing a bit far out to sea.

277
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,360
 -Yeah. -It's a bit like that.

278
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,600
 Maybe it's even more stressful than that. I don't know.

279
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,120
 That's in the interview. That's exactly what she said.

280
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,960
 She was like, "Oh, you know Andy, when he was on holiday, it was like that, only not as bad."

281
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,640
 And even worse, it really rubbed salt in the toothbrush wound, I guess.

282
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,200
 Because if you know you were going to be without a toothbrush for three days or whatever, however long it was,

283
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,480
 that's kind of okay.

284
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,880
 But when you know it's going to be forever.

285
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,960
 -Yeah. -That's way worse.

286
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,680
 So she was up there orbiting the Earth for three days,

287
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,960
 and then the way it worked back in the day was there was no exact science to where you were going to land.

288
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,160
 So what you had to do was you descended back into Earth, you came down,

289
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,160
 and you literally ejected yourself at a good height with a parachute,

290
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,240
 and then you just landed wherever you landed.

291
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,520
 And she landed in a small town in Kazakhstan,

292
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,520
 and some local villagers came, found her, got her out of her suit,

293
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,040
 because it's really hard to get out of.

294
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,720
 -And then she just had... -Whoa, God, you need to brush those teeth.

295
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,280
 Put that helmet back on now.

296
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,680
 Yeah, and then she just had dinner with them while, I guess, everyone with the space agency

297
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,960
 was just trying to locate her.

298
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,120
 She got in a lot of trouble for that, Tereshka, actually,

299
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,720
 because they didn't know if she'd caught some space cooties or something while she was out there.

300
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,160
 So coming down and going straight to see these peasants was a real no-no.

301
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,280
 Yeah, wow.

302
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,960
 She logged in that flight more flight time than the combined times of all other American astronauts

303
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,040
 who had been in space up to that date.

304
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,000
 Up to that date, right.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,280
 And the weird thing about it is another woman didn't go to space for 20 years.

306
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,400
 -So odd, isn't it? -She used up all the flight time.

307
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,680
 That was it.

308
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,960
 -Selfish? -Selfish.

309
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,800
 Shouldn't have demanded that extension, should she?

310
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,520
 The other thing about when she landed is...

311
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,040
 So she did land, and then she went to see these people and had dinner with them.

312
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,400
 But obviously, the Soviet Union had propaganda to sort out, right?

313
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
 And so what they did was...

314
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,480
 And she had a bruise on her face because it was quite a tough landing.

315
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,920
 So they came and gave her a load of makeup, shoved her back into the capsule,

316
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,760
 and said, "Okay, let's get some actors here."

317
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,240
 And they got some actors to open the door and say,

318
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,040
 "Ah, Valentina Toreshkova, you are back on there."

319
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,080
 That's amazing.

320
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,520
 That's so funny.

321
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,880
 It was very managed.

322
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,440
 Like, I think the government sort of arranged her marriage after this, right?

323
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,280
 Or strongly encouraged her to marry another astronaut, basically.

324
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,960
 Yeah, the difference between arranged marriage and Khrushchev saying to you,

325
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,480
 "I think you should get married."

326
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,680
 -Yeah. -There's not much difference.

327
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,400
 It's tight. And Khrushchev officiated.

328
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,680
 I thought he had better things to do,

329
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,920
 but Khrushchev's there as the priest, basically, marrying them to each other.

330
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,120
 That's not weird.

331
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,480
 I don't know if you did that online thing,

332
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,480
 where you get your credentials in advance the night before.

333
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,080
 That's so interesting, because I always thought...

334
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,800
 So she was up in the Vostok 6, it was called.

335
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,200
 And she often does talks around the world,

336
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,920
 and they bring the actual capsule to different places.

337
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,120
 And she really loves it.

338
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,520
 She always strokes it, and she said of it,

339
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,080
 "My lovely one, my best and most beautiful friend,

340
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,920
 my best and most beautiful man."

341
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,480
 And I always...

342
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,120
 You know those people who, like, marry the Berlin Wall?

343
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,080
 I always get...

344
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,320
 When you say people, it was one time...

345
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,880
 Well, there's somebody married a rollercoaster

346
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,520
 in the Berlin Wall and the Eiffel Tower as well.

347
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,560
 I feel like Valentina's, you know, one of them.

348
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
 She's on the path.

349
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,800
 Did she stay married to the human she married?

350
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,360
 No.

351
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,280
 No, she was caught in bed with the Vostok 6.

352
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,880
 She was ready to mingle.

353
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,560
 Actually, one thing that she had in common

354
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,320
 with a rugby player we mentioned before

355
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,840
 is that she never told her mother that she was going into space.

356
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,800
 And her mother only found out when she saw it on the news.

357
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,520
 What?

358
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,080
 Whoa.

359
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,840
 Yeah, because it was really classified.

360
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,680
 Like, the Soviet Union didn't tell anyone

361
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,200
 that it was happening, possibly in case things went wrong, right?

362
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,680
 But when she went to the place to do it,

363
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,080
 everyone said that she was doing, like, a parachute jump.

364
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,880
 And she kept it up.

365
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,480
 She said, "No, I'm just doing a parachute jump.

366
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,520
 I'm just doing a parachute jump."

367
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,280
 But actually, this was what she was doing.

368
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
 I guess, at the end of it, she was.

369
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,640
 She was a very, very big, with a three-day run-up.

370
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,120
 Wow.

371
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,360
 But I tell my family so much stuff.

372
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,520
 I tell my family, you know, when I've had a cup of tea.

373
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,840
 I don't think I could keep secret that I was going to be a tea.

374
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,480
 The first.

375
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,360
 They don't ring back.

376
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,920
 Yeah, they've stopped answering in recent years.

377
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,880
 Yeah.

378
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,160
 My wife never told her parents when she became a helicopter pilot

379
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,360
 until after she'd done it.

380
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,520
 And she's Russian, so maybe it's in the jeans.

381
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,640
 Yeah, because actually, she also kept the parachuting secret.

382
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,120
 In fact, the two first women in space,

383
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,160
 both of whom were Russian,

384
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,600
 both basically went to space

385
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,120
 because they were really into parachute jumps.

386
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,200
 I genuinely think it was for the thrill of that final bit

387
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,560
 where you parachute out.

388
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,960
 And they were both parachuting surreptitiously

389
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,240
 without telling their parents.

390
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,920
 I don't know what Russian parents are like,

391
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,000
 that they bound their children from jumping from high things.

392
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,080
 Well, put it this way, the first time I met my in-laws,

393
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,400
 I was in my mid-30s,

394
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,480
 and they wouldn't stop telling me to put a hat on,

395
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,440
 otherwise I'll be cold.

396
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,000
 For the listener at home, James is wearing a hat right now.

397
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,840
 Took it to heart.

398
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,720
 You never know where those Russians are watching.

399
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,960
 So, China are currently building a new space station,

400
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,440
 and they have sent recently a very clear signal

401
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,320
 that one of the crew is going to be a woman.

402
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 I don't know if you can guess what the sign is.

403
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,600
 It's not an announcement or anything,

404
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,720
 but they've announced--

405
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,680
 They painted it pink.

406
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,880
 They've announced the lineup of stuff

407
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,640
 that's going to be put in the payload to go up there,

408
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
 and it includes 30 bottles of face cream,

409
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,520
 30 of serum, and 60 bottles of toner.

410
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,800
 So that is the indication.

411
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
 Toner, not for a printer.

412
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,600
 Not for a printer, for a human face.

413
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,320
 And I don't know any more than that about what toner does.

414
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,560
 Tones you up, I imagine.

415
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,440
 I guess, yeah.

416
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,080
 Yeah, probably that.

417
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,240
 They had a lot of weird stipulations, didn't they?

418
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
 The Chinese about the female astronauts.

419
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,520
 They had to be married.

420
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,880
 They've had to have given birth.

421
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,680
 Oh, really?

422
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 This might be the old Tyconauts,

423
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,480
 as opposed to this new batch that you were talking about.

424
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,120
 That's weird, because it was the having children element

425
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,400
 of women, that inconvenient element of females

426
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,080
 that put Russia off sending any more women

427
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,120
 into space.

428
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,160
 So when the first one went up, came back down,

429
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,840
 and then Russia went, actually, this is super dangerous,

430
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,960
 and you might have kids.

431
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,080
 So they thought it's not fair on the potential children

432
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,480
 that were around.

433
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,680
 Like radiation, or this kind of thing.

434
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,280
 No, more like you might die in space.

435
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,920
 Oh, yeah.

436
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,360
 And then you definitely can't get pregnant

437
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,320
 and have kids after that.

438
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,760
 Yeah.

439
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,560
 Yeah, very good point.

440
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,960
 If you already have children, they'll be upset.

441
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,520
 They'll be sad.

442
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,960
 Especially if you didn't tell them you were going

443
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,600
 in the first place.

444
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 They thought you were just doing a parachute jump.

445
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,200
 One other thing about Toreshkova

446
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,440
 is that she was really sick when she went up.

447
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,920
 And there are a few reasons that she might have been sick.

448
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,360
 And if you look at different sources,

449
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
 it's different things.

450
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,200
 So some people think it was because she was on her period

451
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,360
 and she felt really ill when she went up there.

452
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,520
 Some people thought it was because she'd eaten

453
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,000
 some tinned fish and lemon pie on the way up.

454
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,960
 And that's why she felt ill.

455
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,880
 The nicest combination of foods in the world.

456
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,080
 Tinned fish followed by some lemon pie, nice and quickly.

457
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,880
 But I read in one Russian source that she,

458
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,280
 when she was sick, she didn't want the people on the ground

459
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,080
 to know she was sick.

460
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,880
 So she hid her vomit behind some panels.

461
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
 And the space station.

462
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
 What is this woman's thing with secrecy?

463
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,040
 Why is she telling anyone anything?

464
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,480
 I didn't see that in any of the stars.

465
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,200
 It might not be true.

466
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,760
 But her vomit fried the electrics on the spaceship

467
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,040
 and then she couldn't get home.

468
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,480
 This woman is a liability.

469
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,600
 But you know, we're saying like the Russian and the Chinese,

470
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,800
 the Americans were very much, you know,

471
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,120
 19 years after Valentina went to space

472
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,480
 is when someone else went up.

473
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,000
 And that includes the Americans.

474
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,600
 And famously, earlier with Jeff Bezos,

475
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,040
 Wally Funk went to space,

476
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,360
 finally after a lifetime of wanting to go to space.

477
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,520
 And she was part of the original astronauts

478
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,040
 that were training with the Mercury.

479
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,480
 So John Glenn and so on,

480
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,160
 who went up in orbit to the world.

481
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,040
 She did everything that they did and she did it perfect.

482
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,160
 So the things she had to do is the preparation included,

483
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,320
 she had to swallow three feet of rubber hose.

484
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,680
 She had to drink a pint.

485
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,400
 Yeah.

486
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,640
 It's not some kind of hazing ceremony you have

487
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,240
 when you get on the spaceship.

488
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,800
 Why?

489
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,840
 I guess you should have read up on that, really.

490
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,720
 That is an odd sentence.

491
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,280
 Three feet is a lot.

492
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,320
 Three feet is a lot.

493
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,040
 This is a lot, that.

494
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,880
 Yeah, because you had to...

495
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,400
 That's coming out the other end.

496
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,280
 That's tough.

497
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,120
 Like a weird dental floss thing, yeah.

498
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,960
 What?

499
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,320
 It's a huge enema.

500
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,640
 Right.

501
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,600
 So three feet, she swallowed three feet of rubber.

502
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,800
 She drank a pint of radioactive water again.

503
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,040
 Should have read up on what reason that was for.

504
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,920
 And she did this thing, which is extraordinary.

505
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,160
 She stayed in an isolation tank for 10 and a half hours,

506
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,080
 which was a record time,

507
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,720
 even for the other male astronauts that were doing it.

508
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
 And she was chilled.

509
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
 And when they checked in on her, she was basically like,

510
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,200
 has it been 10 and a half hours?

511
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,920
 Oh, keep me in.

512
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,640
 I'm fine.

513
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,440
 Oh, you mean chilled?

514
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,520
 Sorry, I thought you meant chilled like in a fridge or something.

515
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,600
 She was in complete darkness and silence.

516
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,040
 She passed every single test.

517
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,400
 And it was basically John Glenn,

518
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,600
 who was the first person to orbit the earth as an American,

519
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,280
 said, I don't think women should do this.

520
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's the only reason that Wally Funk wasn't allowed.

521
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Took, I mean, to give them their due,

522
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,520
 the Soviets were a bit better in some areas

523
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,000
 of gender equality than the Americans.

524
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,480
 Yeah, it was equally shit for everyone in the Soviet Union.

525
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,680
 It was equally shit.

526
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,760
 Like they, there certainly just seemed to be a sense

527
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,680
 that women weren't quite expected to fulfill

528
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
 that very stereotypical female role

529
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,560
 that women were expected to perform in America.

530
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
 And so like the second woman in space,

531
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,720
 the second woman in space was Russian as well.

532
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,000
 And was Svetlana Savitskaya.

533
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,680
 And she was awesome.

534
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,720
 She led an all-female team to victory

535
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,680
 in the World Aerobatic Championships in 1970.

536
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,800
 Oh, that's amazing.

537
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,360
 No woman had ever really flown aerobatically like that before.

538
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,680
 And it was a full female team, thrashed all the men.

539
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,240
 That's amazing.

540
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,720
 And then did they do that thing when you do a loop the loop

541
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,240
 and you kind of fall out halfway around?

542
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,040
 Such a good move.

543
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,960
 That's the main one, isn't it?

544
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,240
 But Donald, yeah.

545
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,480
 All right, well, we need to move on to our next fact.

546
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,560
 So we're going to move on to fact number three.

547
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,960
 And that is James.

548
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,120
 Okay, my fact this week is that

549
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,400
 in the Toda Society of Southern India,

550
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,480
 milkmen are not allowed to have sex.

551
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,000
 Was this brought in after an incident?

552
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,520
 They've just been fathering too many goddamn kids.

553
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,960
 It was not that.

554
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,280
 Okay.

555
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,200
 So this is a society from the Tamil Nadu area.

556
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,920
 And all their traditions are centered around the buffalo.

557
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,400
 Okay, so all the rituals around the buffalo.

558
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,040
 So like whenever they do any dairy activity,

559
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,400
 there's loads of rituals.

560
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,680
 Whenever they're looking after the herds,

561
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,960
 there's loads of rituals.

562
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,160
 And they have this guy in their society called the holy milkman.

563
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,400
 And he is basically a priest.

564
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,600
 He does all of these things.

565
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,120
 And it's a really tough job being the holy milkman.

566
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,000
 So he has to be celibate, as I said, the whole time.

567
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,160
 He's never allowed to visit his family while he's the milkman.

568
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,640
 Like you can stop being the milkman at some stage if you want,

569
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,880
 but while you're the milkman, you're not allowed to visit your family.

570
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,520
 Except for when you're leaving milk outside the door.

571
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,080
 Well, no one's even allowed to talk to you if you're the milkman.

572
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,000
 Well, it's so early in the morning, isn't it, you know?

573
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,320
 They're allowed to approach you two days a week,

574
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,520
 Mondays and Thursdays.

575
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,200
 They're allowed to come over to you and chat to you.

576
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,920
 But any other day, if you want to speak to the holy milkman,

577
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,320
 you have to stand on the other side of the street

578
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,840
 or the other side of the field and go,

579
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,360
 "How's it going over there?"

580
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,920
 Can we change to three pints, please?

581
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,080
 The next week, thank you.

582
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,480
 Yeah, and if there's like a funeral in his family

583
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,760
 and he needs to go to the funeral,

584
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,240
 or there's a real reason that he has to go back to his family,

585
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,840
 he has to resign as the milkman.

586
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,240
 Well, also, if someone touches him by accident,

587
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,440
 he has to give up office,

588
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,560
 which feels that's quite risky as a job.

589
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,640
 I'd ask someone to do it immediately.

590
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,080
 It's the shittest job.

591
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,600
 I think they liked it, though, right?

592
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
 I don't know, man.

593
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,320
 It sounds really rough.

594
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,200
 Even to qualify to become one of these priests,

595
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,800
 which, as I say, is very undesirable.

596
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,880
 You can't really spend time with anyone, ever.

597
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,400
 You, to qualify, you have to do this massive fast

598
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,520
 of starve yourself for a while,

599
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,880
 and then you're sent off to sleep in the forest naked and alone

600
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,560
 for several nights in succession.

601
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,000
 And there are tigers around,

602
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,560
 and other things that can happen to you.

603
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,200
 And it is quite cold, because it's quite high up.

604
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,240
 So, yeah, I don't know about days lying naked.

605
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,840
 But you get status.

606
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,040
 You do get big status.

607
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,280
 So there was an account of the milkman,

608
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,840
 and he was asked whether the toaders salute the sun,

609
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,880
 whether it's a sun worshipping religion.

610
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,360
 And he said, "Those poor fellows do,

611
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,440
 i.e. the other members of the toadah group,

612
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,760
 but I, I, a God, why should I salute the sun?"

613
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,960
 So you get, it's a status bump, definitely.

614
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,080
 A perk, not having to salute the sun.

615
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,200
 Can't ever have sex again, but we know how to salute the sun.

616
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,360
 So... Do they live with the buffalo?

617
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,680
 Because they live in what's called the sacred dairy.

618
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,960
 And the... Yes, oh, the kind of they do.

619
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,240
 So, basically, each family lives in a kind of a barrel-shaped house.

620
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,520
 And in that kind of community,

621
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,280
 there's quite a few families all live together,

622
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,800
 and that group all have the buffaloes that they kind of look after.

623
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,120
 But there's one guy who's in charge of the milking.

624
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,080
 Yeah, there was a TV series about that.

625
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,680
 Exactly, it was Billy Piper was in it.

626
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,440
 It was called the Sacred Dairy of a Coal Girl.

627
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,240
 I don't know if you saw it.

628
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,000
 Oh, wow.

629
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,800
 That was actually a misprint because she was actually playing rugby.

630
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,240
 She was a Coal Girl after all.

631
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,600
 They have a lot of change about the toadah.

632
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,400
 And one of the things from back in the day is that

633
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,280
 the women of the toadah used to practice fraternal polyandry.

634
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,280
 So, they would have to marry all the brothers of one family,

635
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,960
 and that would be the husbands.

636
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,840
 Wow. Yeah, exactly.

637
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,880
 And like you say, this doesn't really happen anymore.

638
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,080
 The milkman stuff still does,

639
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,320
 but a lot of the old stuff doesn't really happen.

640
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,920
 But it used to be that when a toadah woman was pregnant,

641
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,640
 and she had all of these different husbands who were all brothers,

642
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,800
 so you knew who was the father.

643
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,120
 They would give her a toy bow and arrow,

644
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,040
 and the husband would give them that.

645
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,360
 That's how you would know that he was the father of the child.

646
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,280
 But you know the weird thing about the bow and arrow?

647
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,600
 No.

648
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,120
 They had no idea what it was for.

649
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,080
 Really?

650
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,480
 They, so this is, people were astonished when,

651
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,240
 I guess they were studied to be studied in the late 19th centuries,

652
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,720
 and bows and arrows, and bows especially,

653
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,400
 have a hugely significant place symbolically in their society.

654
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,160
 They used in weddings and funerals,

655
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,400
 and they have no idea that they're actually weapons.

656
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,600
 They don't, they don't hunt.

657
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,720
 They don't use them for hunting.

658
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,080
 They've just got defunct bows and arrows.

659
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,520
 There must be accidents happening all the time

660
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,560
 if you don't know that it's a weapon.

661
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,160
 Because you wouldn't know to put the arrow in the bow, would you?

662
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,120
 That's a good point.

663
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,360
 Yes, because, yeah, you're right, they're pastoral,

664
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,840
 so they're really only bothered about the buffalo

665
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,440
 and getting all the stuff from the buffalo,

666
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,960
 and then they trade that for the meat,

667
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,560
 so they don't, they're not hunters.

668
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,960
 Wow.

669
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,520
 Yeah.

670
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,960
 They actually were sort of a very hierarchical society.

671
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,080
 Back in the 19th century, they were king of the hill, literally.

672
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,920
 So the toad are basically in charge of a bunch of other tribes

673
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,640
 all around them.

674
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,120
 It's in the Nilgeary mountain area.

675
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,600
 And like James says, all they're doing is making milk.

676
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,960
 And they basically made everyone else give them everything else.

677
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,000
 So other tribes would have to pay deference to them,

678
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,280
 taxes to them, basically.

679
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,240
 So the Vadakas tribe would have to pay 10% of their vegetables,

680
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,000
 they grew each year to them in rent.

681
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,640
 And yeah, it was, it's impressive.

682
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,080
 They sort of made people happily subservient to them.

683
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,720
 It is impressive.

684
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,800
 Another impressive thing about them is their language,

685
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,760
 the toda language.

686
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,640
 Oh, yeah.

687
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,160
 The toda language has six trills that know what the language has.

688
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,480
 So you know, like when you roll your r's, that kind of thing.

689
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,880
 Don't say that to the milkman.

690
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,800
 He's not allowed to reply.

691
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,360
 I read a paper in the Journal of International Phonetic Association

692
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 by Sinisha Spijic.

693
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,880
 And they say, you know, you need to get all these trills right.

694
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,200
 Otherwise, you're not going to be able to say the words right.

695
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,680
 The first paragraph of that paper ends,

696
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,080
 toda is a rich source for trill-seeking phoneticians.

697
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,560
 Brilliant.

698
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,920
 Nice.

699
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,880
 Brilliant.

700
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,720
 More people have probably heard that joke now

701
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,680
 than have ever heard that joke since it was written in the academic paper.

702
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,640
 You have been the super spreader for that joke.

703
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,200
 That is really nice.

704
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,560
 It's a great joke.

705
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,760
 If you want to get married in the toda society as a man,

706
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,120
 you have to lift a 120 kilogram stone.

707
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,800
 And if you don't lift it,

708
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,200
 then you won't be able to get married to someone.

709
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,080
 120 kilos stone, in case you don't know,

710
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,480
 is just over twice as heavy as Emma Stone.

711
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,920
 That puts it into context.

712
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,360
 It puts it into context, that, doesn't it?

713
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,040
 Milkman?

714
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,760
 Yeah.

715
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,280
 Let's have some milkman.

716
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,240
 Some American houses back in the day had a milk door.

717
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,600
 Isn't that cool?

718
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,880
 Was it a normal sized door?

719
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,040
 Or was it a tiny little like cat flap?

720
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,640
 It's a tiny cat flap sized door.

721
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
 Don't mix it up with a cat flap though,

722
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,000
 because don't leave your milk where the cat's going to go in.

723
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,640
 Danger, yeah.

724
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,200
 Danger.

725
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,440
 But it was just a way of getting your milk without talking to the milkman,

726
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,080
 if you didn't want to.

727
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,920
 Is that right?

728
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,720
 Yeah.

729
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,400
 But that sounds like in the UK,

730
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,160
 that that was a thing anyway,

731
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,800
 that you used to just leave your windows open,

732
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,760
 or your doors open,

733
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,880
 and during the middle of the night,

734
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,080
 the milkman would sneak in.

735
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,400
 The milkman.

736
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,880
 Man.

737
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,280
 And he would fill up your jug.

738
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,800
 And then he would sneak back out again,

739
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,680
 and you'd never know he'd come down.

740
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,440
 You've been watching some soft porn films from the 1970s.

741
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,000
 Sorsy.

742
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,840
 I never get to the sex.

743
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,880
 I'm just like, rewind that.

744
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,800
 This milkman bit's fucking amazing.

745
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,160
 But the milk door, sometimes it would be a separate,

746
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,520
 so there's a door on the outside of your house,

747
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,640
 with a little ledge,

748
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,080
 where the milkman puts the milk,

749
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,280
 and then he closes the door,

750
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,040
 and then you open it from the other side.

751
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,080
 There's another door on the other side.

752
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,280
 But the clever thing is,

753
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
 on the milkman's side of the milk door,

754
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,400
 there is a dial where you could adjust the milk meter,

755
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,680
 and you could show the milkman

756
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,480
 how much milk you wanted in your milk door every morning.

757
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
 I wonder if that was used as a euphemism very often.

758
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,120
 I bet it was.

759
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,880
 I bet that was mostly used by housewives

760
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,480
 when their husbands had gone to work.

761
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,760
 It's a green or a red light.

762
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,520
 The milk meter is set to full fat today.

763
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,000
 [LAUGHTER]

764
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,240
 Have you guys heard of Sean Garvey?

765
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,040
 You must have done, right?

766
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,520
 Yeah.

767
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,480
 That's Sean Garvey.

768
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
 Sean Garvey, milkman of the year 2004.

769
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,360
 Right.

770
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,000
 Actually.

771
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,880
 Oh, well, he won milkman of the year in 2004,

772
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,600
 after he rescued a 92-year-old customer

773
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,040
 from a gas-filled kitchen.

774
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,520
 Oh, okay.

775
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,160
 Yeah.

776
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,080
 Have you guys heard of Ian Beardwell?

777
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,960
 Definitely, yeah.

778
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,840
 Milkman of the year 2007, right?

779
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,120
 I think he was a milkman of the year.

780
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,080
 I just can't remember the year.

781
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,200
 I remember the year, yeah, yeah, yeah.

782
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,160
 2018, of course.

783
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,120
 2018, yeah, yeah.

784
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,840
 Yeah.

785
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,160
 He kind of was chasing car thieves.

786
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,040
 He returned and lost laptop after finding it on the road.

787
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,360
 So, yeah, he won milkman of the year.

788
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
 Wait, sorry, what's that got to do with milk?

789
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,360
 That sounds like he's a milkman by day,

790
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,640
 but a Superman vigilante by night.

791
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,320
 He's a milkman by night.

792
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,280
 [LAUGHTER]

793
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,920
 Okay.

794
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,600
 Have you heard of Steve Leach?

795
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:00,840
 No.

796
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,880
 What year?

797
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,680
 What do you know what?

798
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,200
 What year did he win milkman of the year?

799
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,240
 Oh, he didn't win milkman of the year.

800
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,880
 Oh, gosh.

801
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,400
 He won milkman of the millennium.

802
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,040
 [GASPING]

803
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,080
 That's huge.

804
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,880
 It's huge.

805
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,800
 In 2002, when he put out a raging fire with 320 pints of milk,

806
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:24,680
 he said, "I kicked the door in and started pouring milk everywhere."

807
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,440
 It was hard work opening all those bottles

808
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,120
 as they have tamper-proof lids.

809
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,040
 It was even harder trying to explain to my boss

810
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,640
 where all the milk had gone.

811
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,520
 What?

812
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,800
 That is insane.

813
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
 I don't buy this story.

814
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,560
 I think that--

815
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,200
 This is crazier than the fucking guy falling out of the plane.

816
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,360
 That-- I was thinking when you said 2002,

817
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,640
 "You're a milkman of the millennium."

818
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,800
 I thought, "That's a bit early to be dishing it out.

819
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,880
 There are 998 years left to order."

820
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,760
 I say, "Give it to him."

821
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,560
 That's incredible.

822
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,880
 That's insane.

823
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,000
 Hey, listen, we need to move on to our final fact of the show,

824
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 and that is Anna.

825
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,640
 My fact this week is that George Lucas

826
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,840
 owns four ranches in the Lucas Valley,

827
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,320
 which is named after a completely different Lucas.

828
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,600
 Did he go to the Lucas Valley because it was named that?

829
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,720
 I don't believe so.

830
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,280
 No.

831
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,520
 It is a beautiful valley in California

832
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,200
 where a lot of people like George Lucas hang out,

833
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,320
 so I think that helped.

834
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,400
 But yeah, I was reading about his ranches,

835
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,840
 which are pretty cool,

836
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,280
 and realized it was in Lucas Valley

837
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,360
 and thought, "Surely that's named after him."

838
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,840
 But it's not.

839
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,680
 It's named after John Lucas,

840
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,040
 who I'm sure you've all heard of,

841
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,080
 the 19th century rancher who was--

842
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
 He won Milkman of the Year, didn't he?

843
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,600
 1879, yeah, yeah.

844
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,280
 Exactly.

845
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,160
 There's not much on John Lucas on the internet, is there?

846
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,640
 No, he was roped into running the ranch,

847
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,400
 as far as I could tell, by his uncle,

848
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,080
 who dragged him over from Ireland,

849
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,000
 but then wasn't really into it,

850
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,840
 because he was a bit uppity.

851
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,440
 And so I think his wife, Maria,

852
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,680
 basically ran the whole estate for a long time.

853
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,040
 Yeah, he was roped into it a lot

854
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,200
 because his uncle died and left it to him.

855
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,040
 That was a lot of it.

856
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,680
 His uncle was called Timothy Murphy,

857
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,560
 and he first got the area,

858
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,720
 because it was owned by Mexico in those days.

859
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,160
 And Mexico had a rule that if you were Roman Catholic

860
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,920
 and you had a Spanish name,

861
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,000
 then they would give you some free land.

862
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,240
 But this guy was called Timothy Murphy,

863
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,680
 so he changed his name to Dom Timateo Murphy.

864
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,080
 Nice.

865
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,640
 Very nice.

866
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,040
 There is a place from San Rafael,

867
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,440
 which is the area that Lucas Valley is in.

868
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,480
 There is a Native American group from there called the Miwok.

869
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,320
 No, it sounds a little bit like Ewok,

870
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,080
 which is some of the things,

871
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,440
 and they're the teddy bears and stuff.

872
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,680
 Yeah, yeah, but that's not a coincidence, though.

873
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,400
 Oh, is it not?

874
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,120
 No, it's not a coincidence.

875
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,640
 And they're not teddy bears, but they...

876
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,640
 Yeah, and now in a weird kind of full circle thing

877
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,200
 with Lucas,

878
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
 because he has the Skywalker Ranch there,

879
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,280
 which is where...

880
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
 Which is named after a completely different skywalker.

881
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,160
 Exactly, so weird.

882
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,920
 But there is now in this Miwok territory a lake,

883
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,080
 which they made, a man-made lake,

884
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,920
 which is called Lake Ewok.

885
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,760
 Yeah, he did name, just to clarify,

886
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,000
 the Ewoks sort of after the Miwok people,

887
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,320
 but it also happened that it is Wookiee backwards,

888
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,240
 so which is another sort of teddy bear, isn't it?

889
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,200
 But a bigger teddy bear.

890
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,320
 Yeah, sometimes you can just feel the emails and tweets coming in.

891
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:28,520
 But he liked naming places, particularly for Star Wars,

892
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,640
 with things that were relative to the places he was

893
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,760
 or that he wanted to go to.

894
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,560
 So Tatooine, which is where Luke Skywalker is from,

895
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,680
 is actually named of the town Tatooine in Tunisia,

896
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
 so he picked that up, yeah.

897
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,760
 Was that like, that's where they filmed it, didn't they?

898
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,240
 Yeah, exactly.

899
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,120
 In Tunisia.

900
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,000
 R2-D2, that was when he was working on his previous film,

901
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,120
 American Graffiti.

902
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,720
 There was an editor who's shorthand

903
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,200
 for what was real to dialogue to.

904
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,600
 He would say R2-D2, and that just stuck in his head.

905
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:54,920
 Oh.

906
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,240
 And then here's a weird one, but I'm a Star Wars fan,

907
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
 and this might be quite obvious to Star Wars fans,

908
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,520
 but I'd never heard it.

909
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,200
 Luke Skywalker is Luke S, Lucas.

910
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,240
 Okay.

911
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,000
 Oh, that's a weird mountainous entity.

912
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,040
 Oh, he's called George Lucas.

913
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
 Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

914
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,720
 He's named the hero of his whole thing.

915
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,360
 That's interesting.

916
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,040
 After a self, Lucas.

917
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,560
 So it's like Luke Skywalker,

918
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,920
 do you think it's based on him?

919
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,840
 He's like, he wrote himself into it.

920
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,800
 Possibly, yeah.

921
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,560
 He definitely wrote his dog into it.

922
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,200
 Did he?

923
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,000
 Yeah, so Chewbacca, who's the big teddy bear,

924
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,600
 was based partly on his dog.

925
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,160
 He had Malamute, I think it's pronounced like this,

926
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,440
 great big shaggy dog.

927
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,360
 But get this, that dog has inspired two

928
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,600
 of the greatest cinematic creations ever,

929
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,960
 because he had this dog, which was named Indiana.

930
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,200
 Yeah, Chewy and Indy are both named after one dog.

931
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,320
 That's amazing.

932
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,920
 The dog was the inspiration for both of them.

933
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,880
 He sounds like an unimaginative egotist so far,

934
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,600
 doesn't he?

935
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,240
 Wow.

936
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,880
 Ouch!

937
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,120
 Right, so I like the guy, but just based on this.

938
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,680
 While we're on names very quickly,

939
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,720
 there's obviously Star Wars was George Lucas' thing,

940
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,560
 and then it turned into this giant empire.

941
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,680
 And there's comic books, and there's animations,

942
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,320
 and all new characters are created all the time.

943
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,840
 So there's a big encyclopedia of all the different Jedi masters

944
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,360
 and Siths and all that.

945
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,520
 And there was someone who was working for the Lucas company,

946
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,000
 and he created a Jedi, which he did as a bit of a joke.

947
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,080
 He was called Soon Bates, and Soon Bates was a Jedi master.

948
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,960
 And he wanted to get it as a joke, but it made it through.

949
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,840
 So there is now a Jedi called Master Bates,

950
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,960
 who is an official Jedi, and created by a guy called Randy.

951
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,840
 No kidding.

952
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,280
 And it made it past the editors, and they regret it so much.

953
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,600
 So he has to appear, because he is canon

954
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,120
 in the official encyclopedia,

955
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,600
 but he's one of the only Jedi's who just does not appear.

956
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,520
 He's in his bedroom most of the time, isn't he?

957
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,240
 And I am unaware of most of the things in Star Wars.

958
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,600
 But do you guys know something?

959
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,520
 If I say this, tell me if this makes sense.

960
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,920
 So in one of the films, there is a resistance base

961
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,160
 on the planet of Dakar, and it's the scene of an epic battle

962
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,600
 between the resistance and the first order on Star Killer Base,

963
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,760
 and was featured in the scene where Rey heads off

964
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,520
 to find an iconic Luke Skywalker.

965
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,440
 Have you thought about doing the audiobooks?

966
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,320
 I don't know what any of that means.

967
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,400
 This is the latest batch of Star Wars.

968
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,440
 But it was filmed in a place called Greenham Common,

969
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,320
 which is in Berkshire, which is just down the road from here.

970
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,600
 And what is amazing about Greenham Common,

971
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,320
 and back more onto my kind of territory,

972
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,880
 is that there was a protest there in the 80s,

973
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,760
 and they were going to put a load of nuclear weapons there.

974
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,760
 And in 1982, 250 women decided to protest,

975
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,680
 and said that we don't want this here.

976
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,480
 And they decided specifically it had to be just women,

977
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,640
 because they wanted to say, well, this is our children.

978
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,240
 We don't want our children to have nuclear weapons in our area.

979
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,720
 So it started with 250 women.

980
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,200
 All the media outlets just really vilified them.

981
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,920
 They called it a witch's cover and all this kind of stuff.

982
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,440
 That was in 1982.

983
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,480
 But by 1983, another protest happened there,

984
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,480
 and there were 50,000 women in this protest.

985
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,000
 It was insane.

986
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 They held hands for 14 miles all the way from their camp

987
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
 to a place called Older Mastin.

988
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,680
 Isn't that amazing?

989
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,360
 And that's why no one has nuclear weapons anymore.

990
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,800
 Well, that is why they don't have nuclear weapons in Berkshire anymore.

991
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,000
 You know, it may the fourth be with you

992
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,080
 when it's May the Fourth and it's Star Wars Day,

993
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,280
 and we all say that.

994
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,560
 Maybe you all say that.

995
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,600
 People say that.

996
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,680
 Only a few times a day.

997
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,480
 Once a year.

998
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,600
 And it's a cool thing.

999
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,000
 Does everyone know where that came from?

1000
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,880
 You'll never say it again.

1001
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,000
 Yeah, someone knows it.

1002
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,120
 It was Margaret Thatcher who was the reason for it.

1003
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,520
 It was when she won the election in 1979.

1004
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,800
 It was her first day in office.

1005
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,000
 It was May the Fourth.

1006
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,680
 And so the conservatives put a congratulatory advert

1007
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,200
 in the paper the next day,

1008
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,120
 saying, "May the Fourth be with you, Maggie.

1009
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,000
 Congratulations."

1010
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 So, yeah.

1011
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,400
 And in one fell swoop, we've killed that saying forever.

1012
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,840
 [LAUGHTER]

1013
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,040
 You know the Star Wars merch?

1014
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,680
 This is a huge element of the thing.

1015
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,160
 So George Lucas wrote the...

1016
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,520
 He was given the chance to try and haggle upwards on his fee

1017
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,440
 because he made a film called American Graffiti,

1018
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,040
 which became a huge hit.

1019
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,640
 And he'd already signed up to Star Wars

1020
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,000
 and he was sort of thinking about,

1021
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,280
 "Well, should I go for more of it?"

1022
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,920
 And he said, "No, I'll take more of the merchandise rights.

1023
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,240
 Some big percentage of the merchandise sales."

1024
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,480
 Which didn't really exist for films at the time.

1025
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,840
 You know, there wasn't much...

1026
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,280
 You know, there wasn't George's merch

1027
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,360
 in the way that there is Star Wars merch.

1028
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,760
 And the merchandise was so popular

1029
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,480
 that the firm he got to do it, a firm called Kenner,

1030
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,720
 they belonged to General Foods.

1031
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,240
 They were so taken by surprise.

1032
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,320
 The film came out in 1977.

1033
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,920
 Christmas, 1977.

1034
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,240
 It had been out for months and months in the USA.

1035
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,240
 It was, I think, just out in the UK.

1036
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
 Kenner was so short of stock

1037
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,760
 that what they sold, an early bird certification package,

1038
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,160
 which was basically an IOU saying, "We do not have these toys,

1039
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,640
 but if you send in a form,

1040
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,000
 we will give them to you between February and June next year."

1041
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,800
 And it was the hit of the Christmas.

1042
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,560
 An IOU. There were no toys.

1043
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,240
 There were some stickers and a form.

1044
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,600
 Wow. Yeah.

1045
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,400
 These empty boxes now sell for up to, you know, $8,000 on eBay.

1046
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,880
 Oh, yeah.

1047
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,960
 If you have an unopened IOU box with no toy, it's mad.

1048
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,240
 It was the equivalent of, like,

1049
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,000
 when you're trying to book Glastonbury tickets,

1050
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,080
 and you're in that queue where you see the man

1051
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,800
 walking towards the tickets, it's like, "Okay, I'm there.

1052
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,480
 I'm there in the queue. I've got my box."

1053
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,280
 I don't know how it'll look at me.

1054
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,600
 I've never tried to buy Glastonbury tickets in my life.

1055
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,760
 Is it like when you try to buy Glymborn tickets?

1056
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,360
 Yeah. Got it.

1057
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,680
 Thank you.

1058
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,920
 Do you guys know Michael Leeder?

1059
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,120
 Is he a milkman?

1060
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,880
 God, for God's sake.

1061
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,080
 Yes, he is a milkman.

1062
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,960
 Is it put on the desert planet or blah, blah?

1063
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,240
 No, in EastEnders.

1064
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,160
 He's a milkman in the TV show EastEnders.

1065
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
 No, is he really milkman?

1066
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,280
 Yeah, he was 16 years on EastEnders as a milkman

1067
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,040
 before he ever uttered his first bit of dialogue in the show.

1068
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,560
 No, I'm not allowed to have sex.

1069
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,880
 He spoke to a cabbie called Charlie Slater.

1070
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,000
 Oh, yeah, I know that part.

1071
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,920
 His line is, "Is this your squire?"

1072
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,680
 That was his big break after 16 years of being the milkman

1073
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,200
 on EastEnders.

1074
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,400
 Prior to his career as a milkman there,

1075
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,880
 he was in Star Wars as a stormtrooper.

1076
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,920
 Oh, really?

1077
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,760
 Now, very hard to pick out your stormtroopers in Star Wars,

1078
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,840
 but it just so happens that he's possibly

1079
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,760
 one of the most famous stormtroopers

1080
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,920
 that the series ever produced,

1081
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,200
 because a few people in the audience might recognize this.

1082
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
 There's a scene where stormtroopers

1083
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,880
 are running through the Death Star,

1084
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,920
 and one clumsy stormtrooper cracks his head

1085
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,360
 on the side of an archway.

1086
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,680
 It's become a famous scene to the point

1087
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,560
 where in 2004, when they re-released the DVDs,

1088
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,200
 they added a thud so you could hear.

1089
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,840
 Was it?

1090
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,960
 So he ran into it and went...

1091
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:17,800
 Maybe we need to wrap up the show on that note, right?

1092
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,320
 What?

1093
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,160
 How the fuck are we going to top that?

1094
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,440
 Okay, that is it.

1095
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,720
 That is all of our facts.

1096
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,240

 There you go, Jamie.

1120
