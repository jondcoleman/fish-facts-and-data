1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
 You know what I'm talking about, right, isn't it?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,480
 You know what I'm talking about, right, isn't it?

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
 You know what I'm talking about, right, isn't it?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,880
 (audience cheering and clapping)

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,540
 Uh-oh!

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,840
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,880
 or weekly podcast, this week coming to you

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,040
 from the Soho Theatre in Central London.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,480
 I'm sitting with the three regular elves.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,720
 It's James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Aniches Zinsky.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,160
 And once again, we've got around the microphone

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,320
 and in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,960
 Starting with you, Andy.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
 My fact this week is that finished budget meatballs

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,520
 have so little meat in them

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,960
 that they have had to be renamed "Balls".

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
 (audience laughing)

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,720
 In Finnish Piori Kuita,

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
 probably pronouncing it wrong,

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,760
 which translates as "Balls".

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,560
 (audience laughing)

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,280
 But the thing is, this is not entirely fair.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,040
 It's due to European labeling requirements.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,360
 Basically, all the meat has already been cut off the animal,

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,200
 and the stuff they use to make the cheap meatballs

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,440
 is, you know, a recost-ituted,

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,440
 mechanically reclaimed meat, but they are 50% animal.

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,160
 They're just not 50% stuff

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,960
 which you can genuinely call meat.

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
 (audience laughing)

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,400
 Like a chop, so they have had to rename them.

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,960
 - I didn't realize meat stops being actual meat.

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,720
 I thought, as soon as it's from an animal,

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,960
 that's it, you'll meet for life.

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,800
 - I know.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
 - Yeah.

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
 - So Finland has the world's oldest piece of chewing gum,

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
 as well, doesn't it?

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,720
 Or it had, that was where it was found.

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,840
 It's a 5,000-year-old piece of chewing gum.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
 - Wow.

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,240
 - It's made from tar made of birch bark,

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,160
 and it was found by a 23-year-old archeology student.

46
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,640
 It's sad teeth marks in it.

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
 - Wow.

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,320
 - Yeah.

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
 - Did they say where it was found?

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
 - In Finland.

51
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,760
 - I was hoping it would be on the bottom of the world's oldest

53
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,080
 chew or something like that.

54
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,400
 (audience laughing)

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,560
 - Did you guys know that in weird ingredients in food,

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,440
 sand is in a lot of what you eat.

57
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
 - Oh, it's good.

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,600
 - And it's just, if you look at the sand, which is--

59
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,760
 - I've never thought that.

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
 (audience laughing)

61
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,120
 - Not them.

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
 - No.

63
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
 (audience laughing)

64
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
 - Soup.

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,640
 - If you have a soup sandwich--

66
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,480
 - Sure.

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,320
 - Oh, yeah.

68
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
 - And then soup.

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
 - If anything, so it's down to silicon dioxide,

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
 which I guess we kind of all know is sand,

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
 but you never really think about it.

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 So it's put on the ingredients list.

73
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,600
 I checked my soup in my cupboard as anti-caking agent,

74
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,160
 brackets, silicon dioxide.

75
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
 And it's just sand.

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,640
 And they put it in like--

77
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,520
 - Yeah, I'll be liking a grated cheese,

78
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,080
 so it doesn't stick together on that side.

79
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
 - Yeah, exactly.

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,920
 - There was a guy, an artist from Chile called Marco Evaristi,

81
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,240
 and he mixed fat, removed from his body

82
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,200
 by liposuction with ground meat to make meatballs.

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,840
 - Did he--

84
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,680
 - What?

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,920
 - I bet trading standards got involved, didn't I?

86
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,760
 Did he eat them?

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
 What did he say to someone else?

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
 - I believe he definitely displayed them in a gallery

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
 'cause he's an artist.

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,040
 I'm feeling he might have fed them to his friends.

91
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200
 - Oh, wow.

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
 - Did he tell his friends?

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
 - Yeah, I think they knew.

94
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
 - Right.

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,880
 - Yeah. - Otherwise that would be

96
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
 a bit of a bad trick, wouldn't they?

97
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,720
 - Yeah.

98
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
 - Well, as end of friendship.

99
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,720
 - Why have we had no Christmas card this year?

100
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
 - We haven't seen them since May when I fed them my own body.

101
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,080
 Grounded up with meat that I found.

102
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,600
 - I found a few things on--

103
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 When you said this fact, I just--

104
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,680
 I love whenever someone is forced into having to rename themselves

105
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,720
 something new because the thing they were saying was not true

106
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
 or as just they were stuck in a thing.

107
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
 There's a great one.

108
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,080
 It's actually in one of the QI books of the fact books,

109
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,720
 which is that there's a place in Australia called "Shark Bay."

110
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,720
 But it was renamed "Safety Beach" to attract more tourists to it.

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,720
 First, they changed the name from "Shark Bay" to "Shark Beach."

112
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
 And they still weren't getting many people in.

113
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 Guys, maybe it wasn't the Bay Beach thing that was putting people--

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 Well, what else could it be, Frank?

115
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 - I was reading an interview with a Greek brewer,

116
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 a Greek beer brewer, who was complaining about that.

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,720
 His beer that he's trying to brew keeps her being pushed out of the market

118
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,720
 by Heineken, which basically dominates the Greek beer market.

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
 And his beer only has 5.5% of the market in Greece at the moment.

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
 And it's called "Vagina Beer."

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 And it's just confusing.

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
 Is this interview going to mention at any point in the fact

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,720
 that perhaps a bit of rebranding might work?

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
 - Another one that's a favourite of mine.

125
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,720
 There was a sushi bar in Montreal that got forced to change its name.

126
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
 By a judge, a high court judge.

127
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
 So the name that they gave it was "Fuck yo sushi."

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 "Fuk yo sushi."

129
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,720
 And it looked like there was a moment where they were going to try and defend it

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,720
 because it's a genuine Japanese word.

131
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,720
 You know, it means good fortune in Japanese.

132
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 It's also sort of a karate stance, apparently.

133
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 It's also the main complaint that people give at the restaurant when they have it like a food.

134
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,720
 But they, yeah, so their downfall was the fact that they have a Facebook page

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,720
 and they started saying we have other ideas for bits on the menu that we want to put up.

136
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 And this really was their downfall because the other bits on the menu were a "Fuck you to roll."

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
 "Fuck me roll."

138
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 "Fuck you all roll."

139
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,720
 And my favourite, the "Fuck yo mama roll."

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 Wow, they've changed it.

141
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,720
 - I like that. So we're embracing it, trying to embrace it.

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
 - I think it was a joke from the beginning.

143
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
 - Yeah.

144
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,720
 - Okay, back to bowls. - Sorry.

145
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,720
 - Okay, in the early 20s there was a law case between Uncle Luke's mint bowls.

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,720
 These guys who made these little confectionery things.

147
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
 And Uncle Jack's mint bowls.

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 And Uncle Luke was saying Uncle Jack shouldn't be making mint bowls, et cetera, et cetera.

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
 And the judge decided that the term "Uncle" could not be copyrighted

150
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 as there are millions of uncles around the world.

151
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:10,720
 And he said, "Uncle Jack is just as entitled to offer his bowls to the public as Uncle Luke."

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
 - Wow.

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
 - My parents are in tonight.

154
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 - So it's the facts about Finland?

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
 - Oh, why not?

156
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
 - Finland is a brilliant place.

157
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 - So the facts, that's my fact.

158
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
 - Damn, and I had that one too.

159
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,720
 - They like strange competitions in Finland.

160
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,720
 So they have the mobile phone throwing world championships,

161
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
 the World Air Guitar Championships, the Wife Carrying World Championships,

162
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,720
 Swamp Soccer, and the finals of that are called the SS World Championships.

163
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 And I think it's too late for that one.

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 - Actually, there was just speaking of SS.

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
 Do you remember "South End On Sea"?

166
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 Their traffic wardens, I think, had a uniform which had SS on it.

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 I don't know how to change it because there's too many complaints.

168
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,720
 - Yeah, they could have had SOS very easily.

169
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
 That's why I'm paying attention to the odd.

170
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 - Finland's also got an ant nest sitting competition that you do.

171
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
 - What?

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
 - It's basically the idea behind it is there's a bunch of ant nest,

173
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,720
 and you take your trousers down, you sit on it, and then you wait.

174
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,720
 The last person to leave is the winner.

175
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
 - Wow.

176
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 - There's one of the champions of the mobile phone throwing competition

177
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,720
 is also a hammer thrower, which I quite like as if you're hammer throwing

178
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
 you don't know what to do in your office season.

179
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,720
 You've just got to move off throwing championships.

180
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 But also in the Wife Carrying Championships, then there are various different positions

181
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,720
 in which you can carry your wife, and people debate over which one is the most efficient.

182
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 And there's one which is Estonian style, which is if you have the wife's legs over your shoulders

183
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,720
 and hanging down, which makes you wonder what kind of weird racism was happening

184
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720
 are the Estonian sexual practices, whatever that was named.

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,720
 - I think it was because the first people to do it were Estonian.

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,720
 But it is the most populous, it is the most populous style,

187
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
 and it's the one that the winners always use these days.

188
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
 It's the best one.

189
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
 - The first brief flop of Wife Carrying.

190
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 - Yeah.

191
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
 - It must be every year someone comes in with a rogue new position.

192
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 They've got their wife in.

193
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 And everyone gets nervous going, what does he know that we don't?

194
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
 - And then they fail every single year.

195
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
 - Yeah.

196
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
 - Like Estonia's going, oh yes, we did it.

197
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
 That was a good Estonian impression, either way.

198
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 There's a boot throwing world championships, also held in Finland.

199
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,720
 And for an interview, they asked the two time organizer, not the two time winner,

200
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 the two time organizer of the championships.

201
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,720
 And they have their own official throwing boot.

202
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 So you can't use another boot, you can't use a non-regulation boot.

203
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 And they have all kinds of, they have anti-doping regulations

204
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 and people being kicked out of a boot throwing competition for drugs infractions.

205
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
 - booting out.

206
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
 - Yeah.

207
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 - They also have a mosquito killing championships.

208
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 That is how many mosquitoes you can kill in five minutes using only your hand.

209
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 - Wow.

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
 - Are you allowed to use your other hand?

211
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
 - Would it just...

212
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
 - I think you have to go and find them.

213
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 Because it's like, there's a lot of mosquitoes in the arts academy.

214
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 - Yeah, do you have a tiny, tiny gun dog to go and retrieve the corpses when you've killed them?

215
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 - No, you're being silly, I think.

216
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 - They must have so many gold, like, potential gold meblists in Finland

217
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
 who, like, have the Olympics brought up the Wifecat notice?

218
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,720
 Like, Finland would wipe the Olympics clean if these were allowed in.

219
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
 - Yeah.

220
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
 - And if they didn't just have normal spots in the Olympics.

221
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 - Well, there's a word in the news reports of, like,

222
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
 whoever's won the mobile phone, carrying all the Wifecaring or whatever,

223
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,720
 it's always, it was won by a Finnish man this year,

224
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,720
 as if anyone else is really going there.

225
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 - Also, you can't call your friends to tell me you've won,

226
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
 which is a bit of a nightmare.

227
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,720
 Oh, James and I met a guy just speaking of throwing things.

228
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
 We met a guy two days ago who, he's a scientist who,

229
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,720
 part of his major study and he published a paper on this

230
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
 and he's really proud of it, is that he throws snails for a living.

231
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

232
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,720
 - So he shuts them over his garden fence,

233
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 and then he waits two years to see if they come back.

234
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
 - And he knows if they've come back because he puts

235
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
 Tipex dots all over them.

236
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
 - And then he trucks them.

237
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,720
 - He puts one Tipex on, whenever he gets one in his garden,

238
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
 he throws it over into there's like a railway that goes next to him,

239
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 so he throws them over onto the rails.

240
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
 - He's onto the tracks.

241
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
 - But then every time they come back,

242
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
 he puts another dot in another dot in another dot.

243
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
 And I think there was like one with 17 dots on it in the end

244
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 because he just kept coming back and coming back.

245
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
 - Oh.

246
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
 - And he doesn't use slugs because the Tipex doesn't hold on that.

247
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
 - So he has no way of doing it.

248
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 Sorry, we're gonna have to move on, but yeah, do you want to?

249
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 - Another cool thing they have in Finland is fines.

250
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
 All of their fines are dependent on your salary or your income.

251
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,720
 And so there was a Nokia executive in 2002, for instance,

252
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,720
 who was fined 116,000 euros for going at about 40 miles an hour

253
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,720
 and a 30 mile an hour speed limit or something.

254
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,720
 - It feels like the mobile phone throwing was invented by Nokia,

255
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 don't you think?

256
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
 Because he's like throwing it away.

257
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 Are you gonna have to buy another phone now?

258
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 - Do you know what Nokia used to make?

259
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 They used to make gas masks.

260
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
 - Really? - Yeah.

261
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,720
 The Finnish army used Nokia gas masks until 1995.

262
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
 - That's cool. - That is good.

263
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 - Can you imagine?

264
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
 - You've got your gas mask on.

265
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
 - Do do do do do do.

266
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
 - We need to move on.

267
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 I just got one last thing, which is that the movie,

268
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
 just going back to Meatballs,

269
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 the movie "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" in Israel

270
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
 was retitled, "It's raining for luffle."

271
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 (audience laughing)

272
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 If you could...

273
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,720
 In Finland, they've renamed it "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs."

274
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,720
 (audience laughing)

275
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

276
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
 And that is Juzinski.

277
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,720
 - Yeah, my fact is that Queen Victoria's acquaintance

278
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 once had to apologise to her after her pet jaguar

279
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,720
 killed three of the Queen's pet deer.

280
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
 - Wow.

281
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
 - Which I just think would have been a really awkward moment.

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,720
 - It's bad planning though, isn't it?

283
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
 Where can I leave the jaguar?

284
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
 Just put him in with the deer.

285
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 (audience laughing)

286
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 You're not going to believe what happened.

287
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
 (audience laughing)

288
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
 - Yeah, I do, it's an amazing sentence.

289
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
 That is the closer sentence to the kind of other

290
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
 worldliness of royalty.

291
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 - Yeah.

292
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
 - When you're having to apologise that your jaguar.

293
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 (audience laughing)

294
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
 - But this one was, she wasn't a raya was she?

295
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
 - No, she was by weird coincidence.

296
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
 She was Bozie's aunt.

297
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,720
 You guys know Bozie, like Oscar Wilde's aunt.

298
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 And she was an amazing character.

299
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
 She's called Lady Florence Dixie.

300
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
 She was an explorer.

301
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 She was a raging 19th century feminist.

302
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
 She picked up the jaguar in Patagonia

303
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,720
 when she was chased up a tree by a jaguar mother.

304
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 And she was in this tree.

305
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
 And she had to shoot the jaguar mother dead.

306
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
 And then she felt bad for the baby jaguar.

307
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
 And so she brought it home.

308
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,720
 And she recounted all this in a letter to Charles Darwin, in fact.

309
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
 - Wow.

310
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
 - But they were correspondence.

311
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
 She did correct so.

312
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
 - This is such a name drop of a sword.

313
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
 (audience laughing)

314
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,720
 - I was at Queen Victoria's because my son is dating Oscar Wilde.

315
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 And anyway, Darwin.

316
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
 - The thing is, is that it's...

317
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
 Could you put any more...

318
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
 - She was well connected.

319
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
 - Yeah, wow.

320
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 - What I love about her is the guy who she married.

321
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
 You know this guy.

322
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 He was called, "Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie."

323
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,720
 And his nickname was ABCD.

324
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,720
 (audience laughing)

325
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
 - Oh!

326
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
 - God, I don't...

327
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
 - I know it's not one of his nicknames, actually.

328
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 So they were known in court circles, apparently, as sometimes a lady always drunk.

329
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,720
 (audience laughing)

330
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
 I think she enjoyed a good time.

331
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
 I actually don't think Queen Victoria would have liked her very much,

332
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 because, hey, her jaguar killed me Victoria's beloved pet deer.

333
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
 And was then sent to a zoo.

334
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
 But also her...

335
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,720
 You know, John Brown, Queen Victoria's lover of her later years.

336
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,720
 Lady Florence Dixie claimed that she'd been attacked by Irish transvestites

337
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 in the grounds of Windsor Palace.

338
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
 And demanded that that be investigated.

339
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
 And so John Brown was sent out into the wet cold.

340
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
 And he died about six months later of a cold he caught out doing that.

341
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
 - Oh, really?

342
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
 - Six months later of a cold he caught, wow.

343
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
 That is a big cold.

344
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 - Not going to be the same.

345
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
 - Mega Manflue.

346
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
 (audience laughing)

347
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,720
 - So I've never looked into Queen Victoria before.

348
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
 She was such a badass.

349
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 She was so good.

350
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 Yeah, she wore crotchless underwear.

351
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
 - What?

352
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 - She did.

353
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
 - She wore quite a suit.

354
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
 - I think you might be googling the wrong person.

355
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 (audience laughing)

356
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 - Are you googling Victoria's secret?

357
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
 (audience laughing)

358
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
 - No, she...

359
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
 - How is that badass?

360
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
 Does any badass, if you're horse riding, also think?

361
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
 - I just...

362
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
 (audience laughing)

363
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 - I'm still like hard.

364
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
 (audience laughing)

365
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 - I'm playing it fast and lose it.

366
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
 - I was building up to the more badass.

367
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 - All right, go on.

368
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
 - Hey, I saw that Fiona Bruce on Antique's Roadshow.

369
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
 They were showing that they were selling them

370
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 and they were like, this is a crotchless bit of underwear.

371
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
 - So what happened was when she died,

372
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
 her underwear was auctioned off to people, I think.

373
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 And she had enormous bloomers like she was very big

374
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
 by the end of her life.

375
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
 - In fact, this is a conference of Queen Victoria's waist

376
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,720
 by the time she died was larger than her height.

377
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
 - Wow.

378
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
 - Which is quite impressive.

379
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
 - So she was technically the wrong way up.

380
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
 For the last years of her life.

381
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 (audience laughing)

382
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,720
 - Very sad.

383
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
 Very sad.

384
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 (audience laughing)

385
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 - She did the first thing she did after her

386
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,720
 exhausting five hour coronation ceremony.

387
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,720
 She ran upstairs to wash her spaniel.

388
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 (audience laughing)

389
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
 - She had a spaniel called Dash or Dashy

390
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
 and she loved it so much.

391
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
 She loved all her animals.

392
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 A huge amount actually.

393
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 When one of her dogs died, she had to be sedated.

394
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
 She was so upset.

395
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
 And she had a parent called Coco,

396
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 which could sing God Save the Queen,

397
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 which was a fun trick.

398
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
 - That is the most arrogant thing I've ever heard of anyone

399
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
 doing with their pet.

400
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,720
 - I think her family taught it to sing God Save the Queen.

401
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,720
 And then they revealed it to her and she was delighted.

402
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
 - Okay, fine.

403
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 - She and I had huge arguments as well.

404
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,720
 They had not, they're painted as having had a very, very

405
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 rosy marriage, but actually she was very angry with him.

406
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
 She was having children all the time.

407
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
 She at one point had nine children under 15 years old,

408
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
 which is a lot.

409
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
 And she was just constantly busy having children.

410
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,720
 And so Albert had a lot of the responsibilities of state

411
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
 found out to him.

412
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
 So he did a lot of dealing with parliament in his life.

413
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
 But she was very angry about that.

414
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 He had to go and put notes under the door apologizing

415
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
 when he'd wielded too much power.

416
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
 - She has the reputation of the famous quote

417
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 of we are not amused.

418
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,720
 And so it's attributed to her, but there is no direct evidence

419
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
 that she ever said it.

420
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
 And the thing that we have from her staff and family,

421
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,720
 they are on record as saying that she didn't say it

422
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,720
 and that she was, in fact, immensely amused.

423
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
 (laughing)

424
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
 - That's such a lovely PR push.

425
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
 - Actually, she was immensely amused.

426
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
 (laughing)

427
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 - No further questions.

428
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
 - Yeah.

429
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
 - Okay, some things on pets maybe?

430
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
 - Okay, yeah.

431
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,720
 - Okay, so Rudolph, the second, the Habsburg Emperor,

432
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
 and King of Hungary, he had a pet lion.

433
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,720
 And he had his horoscope read by Tyco Brahi,

434
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 a friend of the show, (laughing)

435
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 who told him that the King and the lion had the same star sign.

436
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
 And so when the lion died, Rudolph shuts himself

437
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 in his room, was convinced he was going to die as well.

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 And he died three days later.

439
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
 - Oh really?

440
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
 - Yeah.

441
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
 - Because Tyco Brahi, we've talked about him before,

442
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
 but he was a serious scientist who understood

443
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 that astrology was all complete follow-ups.

444
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
 But it was how he made all his money, wasn't it?

445
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
 So he kept on poor guys from life having to feed these guys' lives.

446
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
 - He should have got a pet tortoise or something.

447
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
 (laughing)

448
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 But you can't throw someone to the tortoise, can you?

449
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
 (laughing)

450
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 - During the Civil War, another friend of the show,

451
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
 Prince Rupert of the Rhine.

452
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
 (laughing)

453
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
 - We're very popular, isn't it?

454
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
 - Den people.

455
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 - No, he had a poodle called Bye,

456
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,720
 who he trains to cock his leg and urinate on cue,

457
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
 whenever the name of his enemy, Commander Pym was spoken.

458
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 So whenever he said his enemy, the dog would urinate.

459
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,720
 And the people thought that he was satin in disguise

460
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 this dog, the enemy thought that.

461
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 And they thought he was immune to bullets

462
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 and could catch bullets fired at Rupert in his mouth.

463
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
 (laughing)

464
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 - That's Rupert's had some good PR.

465
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 - Really good PR, isn't it?

466
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
 - People didn't believe him.

467
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
 Amazing nonsense, didn't they?

468
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
 Back in the day.

469
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 - Yeah, it wasn't true.

470
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 - It wasn't true.

471
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
 - No, no.

472
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
 - I'm sorry, you're good.

473
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
 - Dali used to have a pet otolot,

474
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
 who he took everywhere with him.

475
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
 And if the otolot urinated on one of his paintings,

476
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
 when he was painting it, he would charge the Bion more for it.

477
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 - You would charge the Bion more?

478
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
 - Charge the Bion more.

479
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 - Oh, right.

480
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 - When he saw the painting, he'd be like,

481
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
 "My otolot weed on this."

482
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,720
 So that's 10% increase on the price.

483
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
 - Jike work.

484
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 - Wow.

485
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 - The first budgees cost as much as a house.

486
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,720
 (laughing)

487
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 - Budge your house, Budge.

488
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 Dali, I really think we need to go over the house.

489
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 - Come on, we've got to get on the budgey ladder.

490
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 (laughing)

491
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 - In the 19th century, in 1845,

492
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
 they cost about 50 quid,

493
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
 which for a working man was an annual salary.

494
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
 And there was a budgey boom as well.

495
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
 Well, that value shot up,

496
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 'cause demand outstrip supplies so much,

497
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 'cause they have to be brought over from Australia.

498
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
 Do you know what I found out,

499
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
 the budgey costing as much as a house thing?

500
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
 - Capes, former Britain's strongest man competitor,

501
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 Jeff Capes, now keeps budgees.

502
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
 He's the president of the budgey society.

503
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 - Oh, wow, yeah.

504
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
 I was looking into royals with pets,

505
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 because I just say it's so bizarre,

506
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,720
 because they do get given a lot of presents

507
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 which end up being exotic animals and stuff.

508
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
 And Henry the third of France,

509
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 he had this thing where he used to carry,

510
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
 so he had pets, he had three dogs,

511
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
 and he used to carry them in a basket around his neck,

512
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
 like a big bit of bling.

513
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 He used to bark at people they didn't trust,

514
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 and he'd be like, get away from me.

515
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,720
 If they didn't like the person, the dogs would bark them away.

516
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 But I looked into the Tower of London,

517
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
 because I've met through standup,

518
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,720
 a guy who is the raven master of the Tower of London,

519
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
 who does stand up as well.

520
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
 - It's crazy, he looks after the ravens,

521
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
 he lives there, that's his job.

522
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 He does stand up, he has dick jokes, it's amazing, right?

523
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,720
 But basically, the Tower of London has extraordinary animals,

524
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
 or at least did, back in the day.

525
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,720
 It was a white bear, no one knows for sure,

526
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
 I can't see anyone who's apparently used to swimming in the turments, right?

527
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
 - Yeah, it was kept on a long,

528
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 but that was Henry the third of England, wasn't it?

529
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
 - Yeah, it was kept on a deliberately long lead,

530
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
 so it could go for a swim.

531
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
 - I went to the Tower of London.

532
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 - To the Tower in those days.

533
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
 It's very confusing, because it sounds like the animals had a lot of liberties.

534
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 I went to the Tower of London's website,

535
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,720
 and they have a whole page on the animals that used to live there,

536
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
 and they included, they had monkeys,

537
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 which the monkeys were actually, they lived in a furnished room,

538
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
 so you could go and visit these monkeys,

539
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 and it says be amused by their antics and human-like behavior,

540
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
 but they've removed eventually,

541
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,720
 because one of them tore a boy's leg off in a dangerous manner.

542
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,720
 Which makes it sound like the first time they did it,

543
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
 it was kind of quite funny.

544
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
 - Oh, you did it safely this time,

545
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 so we're gonna keep the boys coming into the room,

546
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
 but you are in the warning now.

547
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,720
 - We're gonna have to move on, but any last minutes.

548
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
 - I just have pet facts.

549
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,720
 In 2004, a man called Jake Perry owned the Guinness World Record holder

550
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
 for the world's oldest cat.

551
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,720
 In 2005, that record was broken by another one of Jake Perry's cats.

552
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
 - Oh.

553
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
 - This man has owned the two oldest cats by chance.

554
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
 - Oh, he's lying about how old they are.

555
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 - Oh, he painted the first one a different colour.

556
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 - The other one died.

557
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
 - The other one died.

558
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
 - They counted the number of rings.

559
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
 - They were old.

560
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 - It's terribly sad they have to drop the cats down

561
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 to find out how old they were.

562
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
 - That's all the first one died.

563
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,720
 And yeah, he said he feeds his cat's bacon, eggs,

564
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 asparagus, broccoli, and a cup of coffee every morning.

565
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
 - And they smoke 40 a day.

566
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
 - They've just been along the lift.

567
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 - It just fills the spirit.

568
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 - We're going to have to move on to fact number three.

569
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
 And that's my fact.

570
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,720
 My fact this week is that the Statue of Liberty originally wore a head scarf.

571
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,720
 So the Statue of Liberty was originally designed for Egypt.

572
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,720
 And it was originally meant to be at the mouth of the Sui's Canal.

573
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,720
 It was going to be standing there with a torch on hand.

574
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 It was going to be a peasant lady.

575
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
 And it was all designed.

576
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
 It was already.

577
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 And then Egypt had a financial situation where they couldn't afford it anymore.

578
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,720
 And the guy who was called Bartholdy, he was an architect,

579
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
 he was so distressed that he had this colossal thing that was going to be built.

580
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
 That was no longer built.

581
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
 He went back to France, he was French.

582
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,720
 And he then said, why don't we make a new similar, very similar look in the back for America.

583
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
 And that became the Statue of Liberty.

584
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,720
 So originally it was meant to be a peasant woman standing at the Sui's Canal.

585
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
 - He said touch in hand, actually, the head of Egypt.

586
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
 When he agreed to it, wanted the church on the head rather than the hand.

587
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
 Which would have looked a bit weird, wouldn't it?

588
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,720
 - It's interesting because it represents so much for America.

589
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,720
 And this guy, obviously when he was trying to get it made in America as well,

590
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,720
 he had to deny so much about the fact that it was originally meant to be for Egypt.

591
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
 And everyone was like, but it feels like you were definitely pitching this in Egypt.

592
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
 - No, totally not.

593
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
 Totally different.

594
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
 - Yeah.

595
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
 - And so they kept bringing up stuff like, well, okay, how about the fact that when you've now repitched it to us,

596
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,720
 you still want the Statue of Liberty, not on what we now know is the classic stand that the Statue of Liberty is on.

597
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,720
 He wanted it on a pyramid.

598
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 They just did a really bad job of losing the Egypt connection.

599
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,720
 And then they said, but it's literally the same design.

600
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
 You've got a torch being held up.

601
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
 And he was like, oh, okay, sure.

602
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,720
 So how the hell am I meant to design a lighthouse effectively without a torch being up there for the light?

603
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,720
 For getting to point out that in both of the designs, the lighthouse element of it was in the head.

604
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,720
 So again, he just kept shooting himself in the foot.

605
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 - Yeah, you talked about the, you talked about the kind of plimp that it's on.

606
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 - Yes.

607
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
 - That was paid for by America, right?

608
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
 - Yeah.

609
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
 - So France paid for the statue and America paid for the plimp.

610
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
 By America couldn't get any money for the plimp.

611
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,720
 And so they had a big sort of campaigns trying to get it.

612
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:41,720
 And there was a company called Castoria, who made laxatives, who offered to give all the money if the name of the laxative would be displayed on the top of the statue.

613
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
 - Wow.

614
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
 - Really?

615
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,720
 - It's a very different kind of liberty, isn't it?

616
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,720
 - Free and easy movements.

617
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,720
 So the original sort of garment, the peasant garment, she was designed to be a slave.

618
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,720
 But the slave was called the word for it is a fella, right?

619
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:07,720
 And one of the main conspiracy theories about the statue of liberty, I'm straying into your territory here, Dan, is that the model for it was a man.

620
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
 And we don't really know.

621
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:16,720
 A lot of people say that the model was either a buttoldies mother, or the face was a model on his mother, but we don't know.

622
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,720
 - And what you're saying is that they heard that it was a fella, and they thought...

623
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
 - Yes, that's what I think it's come from.

624
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 - That's cool.

625
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 There was a really good book written last year, I think, about the statue of liberty, and I can't remember what it's called.

626
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 But the woman who wrote that did hypothesize that he based the face on his brother who committed suicide, I think.

627
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
 - Wow.

628
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 - Who he really loved.

629
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,720
 And it does feel like a very masculine face, if you look at it, it's a man.

630
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
 - Oh, I wouldn't say that.

631
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
 - So a man in a dress.

632
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:56,720
 - But the only evidence, actually, as far as I could find that it was based on his mother, is the fact that someone later on after it had been built, went to the opera, or went to a big sort of arts event with him and his mother.

633
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,720
 And when his mother came in, this guy was like, and I turned around, and I was like, "Whoa, it's the statue of liberty!"

634
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,720
 And then he said that to people, and they're like, "Oh, that must be it."

635
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
 So I don't know how credible he is.

636
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,720
 - The idea of the statue of liberty was actually by a guy called Labouly, who was a friend of Batoldi.

637
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:21,720
 And he said in a dinner, and this was in a newspaper article of someone who was at that dinner, that it should be a statue that can be seen from the shores of America to the coast of France.

638
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
 - That's big.

639
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 - That is a big, big statue.

640
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:35,720
 - So some of the guys at qi.com/talk, positive and zziggy, works out how high it would have to be in order that you'd be able to see it from France.

641
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,720
 And it would have to be more than 3,000 kilometers high.

642
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
 - How high?

643
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
 - I'm an idiot, how high is that?

644
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
 - So the international space station, for instance.

645
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 - Yeah, the ISS goes around what, like, three or four hundred kilometers high, so it's like another ten times that much.

646
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
 - It's massive, yeah.

647
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 - Thomas Edison of electricity fame.

648
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:17,720
 - He suggested putting a massive disk inside the statue, so it could deliver speeches from inside it all across New York.

649
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
 - It's like it's talking to you, exactly.

650
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
 - And now I'm talking about it, thankfully.

651
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:29,720
 - It's weird to think of her as it, as originally brown or kind of golden, yellowish brown for the first 25 years.

652
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,720
 Obviously being made of copper, it was supposed to be this shining golden statue, because we so obviously picture green.

653
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
 And Bartoldy wanted her to be gilded in solid gold.

654
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,720
 I think at first he tried to petition the American people to raise loads of money to do that.

655
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 And I think they said we've already raised quite a lot of money, thanks very much.

656
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,720
 He had real trouble funding it. He tried to get her image copyrighted, so that every single image of her that appeared, he'd get money for it.

657
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,720
 Which was quite in the 1880s, was quite a modern thing to try and do when he failed.

658
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,720
 - Do you know, you used to be able to, they had fundraising dinners as well, where they would try, desperately try and raise money.

659
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:11,720
 Because all they need, they had the statue, all they needed was the pedestal, and you could buy a meter tall version made of ice cream at these dinners.

660
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:20,720
 Fun. He sold his signature, Bartoldy sold it 3,000 times to raise money for it.

661
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
 And the only way they eventually got the money was by crowdfunding basically.

662
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 They printed in Joseph Pulitzer printed in his paper the name of everyone who gave, even if you gave a penny to it, they would print your name in the paper.

663
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,720
 So it raised a huge amount of money and B, people bought the paper because they wanted to see their name in it.

664
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:46,720
 It's a circulation block, it's quite clever. - This guy sounds amazing, it sounds like he started copyright laws, kickstarter, this is really advanced thinking.

665
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,720
 So I went on to trip advisors to see what people thought of the statue of Liberty.

666
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,720
 And there was one guy called H. Jammah, and he didn't like it very much actually.

667
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 He said, "It was bad because I don't like the sight, it's just a statue, nothing else."

668
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,720
 The tall was bad, and I owed a food at the cart, and the person sneezed on my burger.

669
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,720
 I really don't get it, this was the worst trip ever, one star.

670
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,720
 We're going to have to move on to our final fact. Do you guys got anything more that you want to add to that?

671
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,720
 No, that's me. - Time for our final facts of the evening, and that is James Harkin.

672
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:38,720
 Okay, my fact this week is that a poll moment takes 42.5 minutes to dissolve if you stick it up your nose.

673
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,720
 And first hand, QI research is the best time on research.

674
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
 I actually, when I read that, I stopped on the way to get poll moments.

675
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 So, for the rest of the show, I might have won 50 minutes left, so just have half.

676
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,720
 While he's doing that, I'll explain the points of this fact.

677
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 This, it was a fact given to me by my mum, actually, which is quite nice.

678
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,720
 She found this study, it was by a guy called Dan Leppard, and he's an ENT specialist at the University Hospital of Wales.

679
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:14,720
 And he wanted to see how long it took for people at home, Dan is inserting candy into his nose, and being put off here.

680
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,720
 Now, he studied five different popular sweets, favored by children, and saw how long it took to dissolve in the nose.

681
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 And the idea is, he put them up his own nose, and the idea is that when children get things stuck up their noses, it's kind of hard to get it out, and it's quite, you know, not very nice thing.

682
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,720
 But he thought, if they dissolve quickly, then maybe you don't have to go through that whole thing, you just let nature do its thing.

683
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,720
 So, actually, it's quite an important study, even though it's a bit dumb.

684
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
 I like that. How's that going over there?

685
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,720
 Everything smells great.

686
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 Actually, it's actually quite, I know that's not the point of it, but actually it's making my nose feel like I'm getting more air.

687
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:03,720
 Okay, so other sweets, Skittles take 37.5 minutes to dissolve in your nose, Smarties 32.5, and Tic Tacs 27.5.

688
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:13,720
 I'm now extremely skeptical about this study, because one of my friends is here who stuck a sour-skissled up her nose once on the day towards us.

689
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
 Not for a day, actually, just for fun, I think.

690
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 And apparently, it was extremely painful, so I'd exploded in her nose. She tried to push it out, and it ended up in her eyes.

691
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:35,720
 All the weird sour acid was streaming out of her nose and bits of her eye socket were falling out of her face and stuff, and she managed to get to A&E, I think, which implies that it does take longer than that.

692
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
 Maybe sour-skittles have a difference as well.

693
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
 You might be right.

694
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,720
 I don't think this is really important to say at this point, but don't try this at home.

695
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,720
 Although, quick update, it feels smaller.

696
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:56,720
 I can feel the tight and smaller. So about polos, do you know that if you snap a polo in open in the dark, then it glows.

697
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,720
 I didn't know this, and I couldn't try it at home, because it was daytime when I read this.

698
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,720
 And nobody knows why, so it's a thing called Triboluminescence.

699
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,720
 If you turn on the lights out, snap a polo. They think it's about electrons suddenly rushing to a certain point of the polo.

700
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:19,720
 And it happens with polos, it also happens with cellotate. If you whip cellotate off its roll really fast in the dark, then it will glow at the point where it's being whipped off.

701
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 And it also emits x-rays, and they did an experiment last year where they managed to get an x-ray of a researcher's finger by just the x-rays emitted by cellotate.

702
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,720
 You just put a cellotate, and he managed to get an x-ray through that off his own finger.

703
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
 How cool is that?

704
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:44,720
 It's cool. So when you get a hospital in future, they'll just have a massive roll of cellotate, just standing in front of the cellotate thing.

705
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 I have something about smelling things.

706
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:55,720
 So when people who are asthmatic smell something that they think is going to cause them an allergic reaction, they will have an allergic reaction.

707
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 Even if the thing they're smelling doesn't cause an allergic reaction.

708
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,720
 Oh wow, right. Yeah, and it's because from when you smell something, it goes to your brain before it goes to your lungs, as it were, the signals of what you've smelled.

709
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,720
 And they tested 17 asthmatics, exposing them to a rose smelling chemical for a quarter of an hour.

710
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,720
 And neither of them were told it would irritate their asthma, and the rest were told that it would calm them down.

711
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
 And that's exactly what happened, even though it was the same stuff.

712
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
 Really? How cool is that?

713
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
 The allergies are all in the mind.

714
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
 No.

715
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,720
 These people should stop me and stop. No.

716
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
 With their epiphan.

717
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,720
 It's the opposite.

718
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,720
 It's the opposite of that.

719
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
 It isn't the mind, but the mind is also a real thing, basically.

720
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,720
 In some people, yeah.

721
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:55,720
 They have my, another one of my friends, is a pediatric nurse, and she recently changed hospitals, and as part of the showing her around the new war, she worked an A&E, part of showing her on the new war.

722
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
 They were like, "And this is where we keep the metal detector."

723
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,720
 And they have now, in a lot of pediatric A&E wars, metal detectors, because it's much easier way, and that's expensive way than an X-ray.

724
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,720
 If a kick comes in and says, "I've eaten like 17 marbles."

725
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,720
 Not marbles, things are made of metal.

726
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,720
 That's called a marble bartering, yeah.

727
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,720
 You just go down the body.

728
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:28,720
 That's clever, because in this paper of the polo thing, they did say that if a child states they have inserted a suite into their nose, and it cannot be visualized, one must believe that there is indeed a suite, and not an inorganic or corrosive object.

729
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
 In other words, you have to trust the kid otherwise.

730
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,720
 If he says it's a suite, and actually it's something bad.

731
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,720
 But I also want to know what these mystery suites are, that no one can visualize.

732
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,720
 When they're in your nose, there's kind of a suite before.

733
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
 Can you describe it?

734
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,720
 No.

735
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:54,720
 So, I read a report that there was originally we thought that the nose had about 10,000 ways of smelling.

736
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,720
 We could smell 10,000 different things, and that recently they looked into it again and like, "Oh, we got the number a bit wrong. It's actually a trillion."

737
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,720
 It's a bit of a discrepancy.

738
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
 At the moment, obviously.

739
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
 All of us except Mike.

740
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,720
 How can we know that? It seems like such a high number.

741
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
 I have no idea.

742
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,720
 I have no idea, but we thank it only smell mint at the moment.

743
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,720
 Second update? Definitely getting smaller.

744
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 Wondering if it might just fall out on its own accord.

745
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
 Stay tuned.

746
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:39,720
 I got me thinking about how, because I've always thought, you know, they test people for how good their hearing is.

747
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
 And an eyesight, you can see quite well.

748
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,720
 And I thought, "Smell, we must have humans who have amazing smell."

749
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,720
 And there's a guy actually who is job.

750
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,720
 And it's one of the most important jobs in the world, I think.

751
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,720
 This is his job title. He's NASA's sniffer.

752
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,720
 NASA has a sniffer who smells everything before it goes into space.

753
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 This is how powerful his nostrils are.

754
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
 If he doesn't like the smell, it doesn't go.

755
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,720
 Literally, his nostrils are the gateway to all planet activity.

756
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,720
 Because if you put something up into the International Space Station

757
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,720
 and it starts to smell after a few months, then that can be...

758
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
 You can't open a window. You can't open a window. You can't get it out.

759
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,720
 So his nose has the ability to smell the tiniest of smell.

760
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,720
 So he can see if that smell exists, and if it's there, it can then eventually turn into something bigger.

761
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,720
 But so his job is tested every four months to see with a bunch of tiny little test tubes

762
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
 and some of them have no smell and some have the tiniest of smell.

763
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,720
 And if he fails, he loses his job. He still has a job.

764
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
 He's got the best nostrils on earth.

765
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,720
 Do you think he can smell all trillion things in the world?

766
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
 I don't know. I just don't know how you...

767
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
 I mean, maybe they can try very, very similar things.

768
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,720
 I have some things about things that get stuck up the rectum.

769
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
 Oh, God.

770
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,720
 Which, down your look, this wasn't my actual fact, otherwise...

771
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,720
 That would be in a very different experiment.

772
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,720
 The 1995 IG Nobel Prize in Literature was given to two surgeons

773
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,720
 who made a study called Rectal Foreign Bodies, Case Reports,

774
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
 and a Comprehensive Review of the World's Literature.

775
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,720
 And here are some of the things that they found that people would put up their bottoms.

776
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,720
 I might... I'll stop halfway through this, I think, when it gets too much.

777
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,720
 But seven light bulbs, a knife sharpener, two flashlights, a wire spring, a snuff box...

778
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
 Sorry, was this the second flashlight to try and find the first?

779
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,720
 We've just got dozens up there now.

780
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,720
 This is not the same rectum.

781
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
 These are different rectum.

782
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,720
 So, 11 different forms of fruits, vegetables, and other food stuff.

783
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:52,720
 Of jewelers saw a frozen pig's tail, and then one patient's remarkable ensemble collection,

784
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,720
 including spectacles, a suitcase key, a tobacco pouch, and a magazine...

785
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
 Oh, magazine?

786
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,720
 If you forget your handbag, I mean...

787
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,720
 It does sound like he was going on a journey, but he's got everything he needs.

788
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,720
 Mike, there's your bag. I don't need a bag.

789
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,720
 Why does he need a suitcase key if his rectum is axiom? Is he suitcase, boy?

790
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,720
 That must be the key inside the case again.

791
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,720
 We'll have to be the best day of your life if you're one of those immigration officers

792
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,720
 who puts the glove on and heads in to fight some drugs.

793
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,720
 It's like, let's see if you can even marry Poppins.

794
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,720
 That's no version of the Mary Poppins I've seen.

795
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
 Goodness me.

796
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,720
 We're going to have to wrap up very briefly this morning.

797
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,720
 Okay, one way that you could get out of being in the army was to pretend that you had polyps of the nose,

798
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
 and this is like a little tumour inside your nose, and if you had it, you wouldn't get in the army.

799
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,720
 So people pretended, and here's a quote.

800
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:02,720
 Attempts have been made to simulate this affection of the nose by introducing the testes of a cock,

801
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,720
 or the kidneys of a rabbit into the nostril, and retaining them there by means of a small piece of sponge,

802
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,720
 which is sometimes impregnated with fetid juices.

803
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
 But if it's that old war, you know.

804
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,720
 I'll fight in the war.

805
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
 Frontline Murray.

806
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,720
 I'm not a violent man, but I'll take the war, please.

807
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,720
 And another thing, we talked about the Ignaudal prizes before, and we're currently doing a bit of a talk with Mark,

808
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
 and we Mark Abrahams, who's in charge of those.

809
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,720
 And so I asked him about this, and he sent me a paper from the Journal of Medical Hypothesies,

810
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:44,720
 called "Ejaculation as a potential treatment of nasal congestion in mature males."

811
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,720
 Where are you ejaculating?

812
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:58,720
 Well, apparently, according to the abstract, its emission phase provides vasoconstriction and nasal decongestion,

813
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,720
 which I must say have never noticed myself.

814
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
 You'll lose clears up when you're having sex.

815
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
 And that's what this is saying, yeah.

816
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,720
 You do have erectile tissue in your nose, so maybe it's that.

817
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
 Speak for yourself.

818
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
 I have a normal nose.

819
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,720
 Maybe this bit adolescence listening, that's good excuse for when the mum walks in.

820
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,720
 I would just have to blocked up nose.

821
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,720
 We've already established that Andy's mum is here tonight, suddenly.

822
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,720
 It's like I have a blocked up nose. Oh, that's what all the tissues are for.

823
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
 Okay, we're going to have to wrap up.

824
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,720
 Should we quickly find out how my polo is doing in my nose?

825
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
 All right, so...

826
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
 God.

827
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
 Talk amongst yourselves.

828
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
 It's still here.

829
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
 It's still massive.

830
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
 Oh, okay.

831
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,720
 Okay.

832
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
 That's all our facts.

833
