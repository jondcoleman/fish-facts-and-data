00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 You know what I'm talking about, right, isn't it?

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 You know what I'm talking about, right, isn't it?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.880
 You know what I'm talking about, right, isn't it?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.880
 (audience cheering and clapping)

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.540
 Uh-oh!

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.840
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.880
 or weekly podcast, this week coming to you

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.040
 from the Soho Theatre in Central London.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.480
 I'm sitting with the three regular elves.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.720
 It's James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Aniches Zinsky.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.160
 And once again, we've got around the microphone

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.320
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.960
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.280
 My fact this week is that finished budget meatballs

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.520
 have so little meat in them

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 that they have had to be renamed "Balls".

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 (audience laughing)

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.720
 In Finnish Piori Kuita,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 probably pronouncing it wrong,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.760
 which translates as "Balls".

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.560
 (audience laughing)

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.280
 But the thing is, this is not entirely fair.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.040
 It's due to European labeling requirements.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.360
 Basically, all the meat has already been cut off the animal,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.200
 and the stuff they use to make the cheap meatballs

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.440
 is, you know, a recost-ituted,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.440
 mechanically reclaimed meat, but they are 50% animal.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.160
 They're just not 50% stuff

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.960
 which you can genuinely call meat.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 (audience laughing)

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.400
 Like a chop, so they have had to rename them.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.960
 - I didn't realize meat stops being actual meat.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.720
 I thought, as soon as it's from an animal,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.960
 that's it, you'll meet for life.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.800
 - I know.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.640
 - Yeah.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.680
 - So Finland has the world's oldest piece of chewing gum,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.520
 as well, doesn't it?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.720
 Or it had, that was where it was found.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.840
 It's a 5,000-year-old piece of chewing gum.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.680
 - Wow.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.240
 - It's made from tar made of birch bark,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.160
 and it was found by a 23-year-old archeology student.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.640
 It's sad teeth marks in it.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.480
 - Wow.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.320
 - Yeah.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 - Did they say where it was found?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.160
 - In Finland.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 (audience laughing)

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.760
 - I was hoping it would be on the bottom of the world's oldest

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.080
 chew or something like that.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.400
 (audience laughing)

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.560
 - Did you guys know that in weird ingredients in food,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.440
 sand is in a lot of what you eat.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.280
 - Oh, it's good.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.600
 - And it's just, if you look at the sand, which is--

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.760
 - I've never thought that.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 (audience laughing)

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.120
 - Not them.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.960
 - No.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.960
 (audience laughing)

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.800
 - Soup.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.640
 - If you have a soup sandwich--

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.480
 - Sure.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.320
 - Oh, yeah.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.160
 - And then soup.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.040
 - If anything, so it's down to silicon dioxide,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.480
 which I guess we kind of all know is sand,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.760
 but you never really think about it.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.760
 So it's put on the ingredients list.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.600
 I checked my soup in my cupboard as anti-caking agent,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.160
 brackets, silicon dioxide.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160
 And it's just sand.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.640
 And they put it in like--

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.520
 - Yeah, I'll be liking a grated cheese,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.080
 so it doesn't stick together on that side.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 - There was a guy, an artist from Chile called Marco Evaristi,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.240
 and he mixed fat, removed from his body

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.200
 by liposuction with ground meat to make meatballs.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.840
 - Did he--

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 - What?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.920
 - I bet trading standards got involved, didn't I?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.760
 Did he eat them?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.360
 What did he say to someone else?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.560
 - I believe he definitely displayed them in a gallery

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.680
 'cause he's an artist.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.040
 I'm feeling he might have fed them to his friends.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.200
 - Oh, wow.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 - Did he tell his friends?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.240
 - Yeah, I think they knew.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.080
 - Right.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.880
 - Yeah. - Otherwise that would be

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880
 a bit of a bad trick, wouldn't they?

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.720
 - Yeah.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.560
 - Well, as end of friendship.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.720
 - Why have we had no Christmas card this year?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.720
 - We haven't seen them since May when I fed them my own body.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.080
 Grounded up with meat that I found.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.600
 - I found a few things on--

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600
 When you said this fact, I just--

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.680
 I love whenever someone is forced into having to rename themselves

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.720
 something new because the thing they were saying was not true

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.720
 or as just they were stuck in a thing.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.560
 There's a great one.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.080
 It's actually in one of the QI books of the fact books,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.720
 which is that there's a place in Australia called "Shark Bay."

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.720
 But it was renamed "Safety Beach" to attract more tourists to it.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.720
 First, they changed the name from "Shark Bay" to "Shark Beach."

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.720
 And they still weren't getting many people in.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.720
 Guys, maybe it wasn't the Bay Beach thing that was putting people--

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.720
 Well, what else could it be, Frank?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.720
 - I was reading an interview with a Greek brewer,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.720
 a Greek beer brewer, who was complaining about that.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.720
 His beer that he's trying to brew keeps her being pushed out of the market

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.720
 by Heineken, which basically dominates the Greek beer market.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.720
 And his beer only has 5.5% of the market in Greece at the moment.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720
 And it's called "Vagina Beer."

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 And it's just confusing.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.720
 Is this interview going to mention at any point in the fact

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.720
 that perhaps a bit of rebranding might work?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.720
 - Another one that's a favourite of mine.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.720
 There was a sushi bar in Montreal that got forced to change its name.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.720
 By a judge, a high court judge.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.720
 So the name that they gave it was "Fuck yo sushi."

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.720
 "Fuk yo sushi."

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.720
 And it looked like there was a moment where they were going to try and defend it

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.720
 because it's a genuine Japanese word.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.720
 You know, it means good fortune in Japanese.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.720
 It's also sort of a karate stance, apparently.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.720
 It's also the main complaint that people give at the restaurant when they have it like a food.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.720
 But they, yeah, so their downfall was the fact that they have a Facebook page

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.720
 and they started saying we have other ideas for bits on the menu that we want to put up.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.720
 And this really was their downfall because the other bits on the menu were a "Fuck you to roll."

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.720
 "Fuck me roll."

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 "Fuck you all roll."

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.720
 And my favourite, the "Fuck yo mama roll."

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720
 Wow, they've changed it.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.720
 - I like that. So we're embracing it, trying to embrace it.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720
 - I think it was a joke from the beginning.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720
 - Yeah.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.720
 - Okay, back to bowls. - Sorry.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.720
 - Okay, in the early 20s there was a law case between Uncle Luke's mint bowls.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.720
 These guys who made these little confectionery things.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.720
 And Uncle Jack's mint bowls.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.720
 And Uncle Luke was saying Uncle Jack shouldn't be making mint bowls, et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.720
 And the judge decided that the term "Uncle" could not be copyrighted

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.720
 as there are millions of uncles around the world.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:10.720
 And he said, "Uncle Jack is just as entitled to offer his bowls to the public as Uncle Luke."

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.720
 - Wow.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.720
 - My parents are in tonight.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
 - So it's the facts about Finland?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720
 - Oh, why not?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.720
 - Finland is a brilliant place.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 - So the facts, that's my fact.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720
 - Damn, and I had that one too.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.720
 - They like strange competitions in Finland.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.720
 So they have the mobile phone throwing world championships,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.720
 the World Air Guitar Championships, the Wife Carrying World Championships,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.720
 Swamp Soccer, and the finals of that are called the SS World Championships.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.720
 And I think it's too late for that one.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720
 - Actually, there was just speaking of SS.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.720
 Do you remember "South End On Sea"?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.720
 Their traffic wardens, I think, had a uniform which had SS on it.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.720
 I don't know how to change it because there's too many complaints.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.720
 - Yeah, they could have had SOS very easily.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.720
 That's why I'm paying attention to the odd.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.720
 - Finland's also got an ant nest sitting competition that you do.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.720
 - What?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.720
 - It's basically the idea behind it is there's a bunch of ant nest,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.720
 and you take your trousers down, you sit on it, and then you wait.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.720
 The last person to leave is the winner.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.720
 - Wow.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.720
 - There's one of the champions of the mobile phone throwing competition

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.720
 is also a hammer thrower, which I quite like as if you're hammer throwing

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.720
 you don't know what to do in your office season.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.720
 You've just got to move off throwing championships.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.720
 But also in the Wife Carrying Championships, then there are various different positions

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.720
 in which you can carry your wife, and people debate over which one is the most efficient.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.720
 And there's one which is Estonian style, which is if you have the wife's legs over your shoulders

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.720
 and hanging down, which makes you wonder what kind of weird racism was happening

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.720
 are the Estonian sexual practices, whatever that was named.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.720
 - I think it was because the first people to do it were Estonian.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.720
 But it is the most populous, it is the most populous style,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.720
 and it's the one that the winners always use these days.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.720
 It's the best one.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.720
 - The first brief flop of Wife Carrying.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.720
 - Yeah.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.720
 - It must be every year someone comes in with a rogue new position.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720
 They've got their wife in.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.720
 And everyone gets nervous going, what does he know that we don't?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.720
 - And then they fail every single year.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.720
 - Yeah.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.720
 - Like Estonia's going, oh yes, we did it.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.720
 That was a good Estonian impression, either way.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.720
 There's a boot throwing world championships, also held in Finland.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720
 And for an interview, they asked the two time organizer, not the two time winner,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.720
 the two time organizer of the championships.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.720
 And they have their own official throwing boot.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.720
 So you can't use another boot, you can't use a non-regulation boot.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 And they have all kinds of, they have anti-doping regulations

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.720
 and people being kicked out of a boot throwing competition for drugs infractions.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.720
 - booting out.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.720
 - Yeah.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.720
 - They also have a mosquito killing championships.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.720
 That is how many mosquitoes you can kill in five minutes using only your hand.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.720
 - Wow.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.720
 - Are you allowed to use your other hand?

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.720
 - Would it just...

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.720
 - I think you have to go and find them.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.720
 Because it's like, there's a lot of mosquitoes in the arts academy.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.720
 - Yeah, do you have a tiny, tiny gun dog to go and retrieve the corpses when you've killed them?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.720
 - No, you're being silly, I think.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.720
 - They must have so many gold, like, potential gold meblists in Finland

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.720
 who, like, have the Olympics brought up the Wifecat notice?

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.720
 Like, Finland would wipe the Olympics clean if these were allowed in.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.720
 - Yeah.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720
 - And if they didn't just have normal spots in the Olympics.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.720
 - Well, there's a word in the news reports of, like,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.720
 whoever's won the mobile phone, carrying all the Wifecaring or whatever,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.720
 it's always, it was won by a Finnish man this year,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.720
 as if anyone else is really going there.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.720
 - Also, you can't call your friends to tell me you've won,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.720
 which is a bit of a nightmare.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.720
 Oh, James and I met a guy just speaking of throwing things.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.720
 We met a guy two days ago who, he's a scientist who,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.720
 part of his major study and he published a paper on this

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.720
 and he's really proud of it, is that he throws snails for a living.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.720
 - So he shuts them over his garden fence,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.720
 and then he waits two years to see if they come back.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.720
 - And he knows if they've come back because he puts

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.720
 Tipex dots all over them.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.720
 - And then he trucks them.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.720
 - He puts one Tipex on, whenever he gets one in his garden,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.720
 he throws it over into there's like a railway that goes next to him,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.720
 so he throws them over onto the rails.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.720
 - He's onto the tracks.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.720
 - But then every time they come back,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.720
 he puts another dot in another dot in another dot.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.720
 And I think there was like one with 17 dots on it in the end

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.720
 because he just kept coming back and coming back.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.720
 - Oh.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.720
 - And he doesn't use slugs because the Tipex doesn't hold on that.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.720
 - So he has no way of doing it.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.720
 Sorry, we're gonna have to move on, but yeah, do you want to?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.720
 - Another cool thing they have in Finland is fines.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.720
 All of their fines are dependent on your salary or your income.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.720
 And so there was a Nokia executive in 2002, for instance,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.720
 who was fined 116,000 euros for going at about 40 miles an hour

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.720
 and a 30 mile an hour speed limit or something.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.720
 - It feels like the mobile phone throwing was invented by Nokia,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720
 don't you think?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720
 Because he's like throwing it away.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.720
 Are you gonna have to buy another phone now?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.720
 - Do you know what Nokia used to make?

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.720
 They used to make gas masks.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.720
 The Finnish army used Nokia gas masks until 1995.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.720
 - That's cool. - That is good.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720
 - Can you imagine?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720
 - You've got your gas mask on.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720
 - Do do do do do do.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.720
 - We need to move on.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.720
 I just got one last thing, which is that the movie,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720
 just going back to Meatballs,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.720
 the movie "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" in Israel

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.720
 was retitled, "It's raining for luffle."

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.720
 (audience laughing)

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.720
 If you could...

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.720
 In Finland, they've renamed it "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs."

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.720
 (audience laughing)

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.720
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.720
 And that is Juzinski.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.720
 - Yeah, my fact is that Queen Victoria's acquaintance

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720
 once had to apologise to her after her pet jaguar

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.720
 killed three of the Queen's pet deer.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720
 - Wow.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.720
 - Which I just think would have been a really awkward moment.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.720
 - It's bad planning though, isn't it?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.720
 Where can I leave the jaguar?

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.720
 Just put him in with the deer.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720
 (audience laughing)

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.720
 You're not going to believe what happened.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
 (audience laughing)

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.720
 - Yeah, I do, it's an amazing sentence.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.720
 That is the closer sentence to the kind of other

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.720
 worldliness of royalty.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.720
 - Yeah.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.720
 - When you're having to apologise that your jaguar.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
 (audience laughing)

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.720
 - But this one was, she wasn't a raya was she?

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.720
 - No, she was by weird coincidence.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.720
 She was Bozie's aunt.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.720
 You guys know Bozie, like Oscar Wilde's aunt.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.720
 And she was an amazing character.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720
 She's called Lady Florence Dixie.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720
 She was an explorer.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.720
 She was a raging 19th century feminist.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.720
 She picked up the jaguar in Patagonia

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.720
 when she was chased up a tree by a jaguar mother.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.720
 And she was in this tree.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.720
 And she had to shoot the jaguar mother dead.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.720
 And then she felt bad for the baby jaguar.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.720
 And so she brought it home.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.720
 And she recounted all this in a letter to Charles Darwin, in fact.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720
 - Wow.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720
 - But they were correspondence.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720
 She did correct so.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.720
 - This is such a name drop of a sword.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.720
 (audience laughing)

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.720
 - I was at Queen Victoria's because my son is dating Oscar Wilde.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.720
 And anyway, Darwin.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.720
 - The thing is, is that it's...

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.720
 Could you put any more...

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.720
 - She was well connected.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720
 - Yeah, wow.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.720
 - What I love about her is the guy who she married.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720
 You know this guy.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.720
 He was called, "Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie."

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.720
 And his nickname was ABCD.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.720
 (audience laughing)

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.720
 - Oh!

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720
 - God, I don't...

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.720
 - I know it's not one of his nicknames, actually.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.720
 So they were known in court circles, apparently, as sometimes a lady always drunk.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.720
 (audience laughing)

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.720
 I think she enjoyed a good time.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720
 I actually don't think Queen Victoria would have liked her very much,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.720
 because, hey, her jaguar killed me Victoria's beloved pet deer.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720
 And was then sent to a zoo.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720
 But also her...

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.720
 You know, John Brown, Queen Victoria's lover of her later years.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.720
 Lady Florence Dixie claimed that she'd been attacked by Irish transvestites

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.720
 in the grounds of Windsor Palace.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.720
 And demanded that that be investigated.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.720
 And so John Brown was sent out into the wet cold.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.720
 And he died about six months later of a cold he caught out doing that.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.720
 - Oh, really?

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720
 - Six months later of a cold he caught, wow.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720
 That is a big cold.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720
 - Not going to be the same.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.720
 - Mega Manflue.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.720
 (audience laughing)

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.720
 - So I've never looked into Queen Victoria before.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.720
 She was such a badass.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720
 She was so good.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.720
 Yeah, she wore crotchless underwear.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720
 - What?

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720
 - She did.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720
 - She wore quite a suit.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.720
 - I think you might be googling the wrong person.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720
 (audience laughing)

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.720
 - Are you googling Victoria's secret?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.720
 (audience laughing)

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720
 - No, she...

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720
 - How is that badass?

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.720
 Does any badass, if you're horse riding, also think?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720
 - I just...

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720
 (audience laughing)

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720
 - I'm still like hard.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.720
 (audience laughing)

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.720
 - I'm playing it fast and lose it.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.720
 - I was building up to the more badass.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720
 - All right, go on.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.720
 - Hey, I saw that Fiona Bruce on Antique's Roadshow.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.720
 They were showing that they were selling them

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.720
 and they were like, this is a crotchless bit of underwear.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.720
 - So what happened was when she died,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.720
 her underwear was auctioned off to people, I think.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.720
 And she had enormous bloomers like she was very big

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720
 by the end of her life.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.720
 - In fact, this is a conference of Queen Victoria's waist

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.720
 by the time she died was larger than her height.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720
 - Wow.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.720
 - Which is quite impressive.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720
 - So she was technically the wrong way up.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720
 For the last years of her life.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.720
 (audience laughing)

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.720
 - Very sad.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.720
 Very sad.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.720
 (audience laughing)

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.720
 - She did the first thing she did after her

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.720
 exhausting five hour coronation ceremony.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.720
 She ran upstairs to wash her spaniel.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.720
 (audience laughing)

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.720
 - She had a spaniel called Dash or Dashy

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720
 and she loved it so much.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720
 She loved all her animals.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.720
 A huge amount actually.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.720
 When one of her dogs died, she had to be sedated.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.720
 She was so upset.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.720
 And she had a parent called Coco,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.720
 which could sing God Save the Queen,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.720
 which was a fun trick.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.720
 - That is the most arrogant thing I've ever heard of anyone

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720
 doing with their pet.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.720
 - I think her family taught it to sing God Save the Queen.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.720
 And then they revealed it to her and she was delighted.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.720
 - Okay, fine.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.720
 - She and I had huge arguments as well.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.720
 They had not, they're painted as having had a very, very

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.720
 rosy marriage, but actually she was very angry with him.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.720
 She was having children all the time.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.720
 She at one point had nine children under 15 years old,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.720
 which is a lot.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.720
 And she was just constantly busy having children.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.720
 And so Albert had a lot of the responsibilities of state

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.720
 found out to him.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.720
 So he did a lot of dealing with parliament in his life.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720
 But she was very angry about that.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.720
 He had to go and put notes under the door apologizing

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.720
 when he'd wielded too much power.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.720
 - She has the reputation of the famous quote

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.720
 of we are not amused.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.720
 And so it's attributed to her, but there is no direct evidence

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.720
 that she ever said it.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.720
 And the thing that we have from her staff and family,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.720
 they are on record as saying that she didn't say it

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.720
 and that she was, in fact, immensely amused.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720
 (laughing)

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.720
 - That's such a lovely PR push.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.720
 - Actually, she was immensely amused.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.720
 (laughing)

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.720
 - No further questions.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.720
 - Yeah.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.720
 - Okay, some things on pets maybe?

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.720
 - Okay, yeah.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.720
 - Okay, so Rudolph, the second, the Habsburg Emperor,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.720
 and King of Hungary, he had a pet lion.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.720
 And he had his horoscope read by Tyco Brahi,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.720
 a friend of the show, (laughing)

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.720
 who told him that the King and the lion had the same star sign.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.720
 And so when the lion died, Rudolph shuts himself

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.720
 in his room, was convinced he was going to die as well.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.720
 And he died three days later.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720
 - Oh really?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.720
 - Yeah.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.720
 - Because Tyco Brahi, we've talked about him before,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.720
 but he was a serious scientist who understood

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.720
 that astrology was all complete follow-ups.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720
 But it was how he made all his money, wasn't it?

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.720
 So he kept on poor guys from life having to feed these guys' lives.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.720
 - He should have got a pet tortoise or something.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.720
 (laughing)

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.720
 But you can't throw someone to the tortoise, can you?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.720
 (laughing)

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720
 - During the Civil War, another friend of the show,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.720
 Prince Rupert of the Rhine.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720
 (laughing)

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.720
 - We're very popular, isn't it?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720
 - Den people.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.720
 - No, he had a poodle called Bye,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.720
 who he trains to cock his leg and urinate on cue,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.720
 whenever the name of his enemy, Commander Pym was spoken.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 So whenever he said his enemy, the dog would urinate.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.720
 And the people thought that he was satin in disguise

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720
 this dog, the enemy thought that.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.720
 And they thought he was immune to bullets

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.720
 and could catch bullets fired at Rupert in his mouth.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.720
 (laughing)

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.720
 - That's Rupert's had some good PR.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720
 - Really good PR, isn't it?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.720
 - People didn't believe him.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.720
 Amazing nonsense, didn't they?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720
 Back in the day.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720
 - Yeah, it wasn't true.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720
 - It wasn't true.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720
 - No, no.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720
 - I'm sorry, you're good.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.720
 - Dali used to have a pet otolot,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720
 who he took everywhere with him.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.720
 And if the otolot urinated on one of his paintings,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.720
 when he was painting it, he would charge the Bion more for it.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.720
 - You would charge the Bion more?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720
 - Charge the Bion more.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720
 - Oh, right.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.720
 - When he saw the painting, he'd be like,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.720
 "My otolot weed on this."

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.720
 So that's 10% increase on the price.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720
 - Jike work.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720
 - Wow.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.720
 - The first budgees cost as much as a house.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.720
 (laughing)

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720
 - Budge your house, Budge.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720
 Dali, I really think we need to go over the house.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.720
 - Come on, we've got to get on the budgey ladder.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.720
 (laughing)

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.720
 - In the 19th century, in 1845,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.720
 they cost about 50 quid,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.720
 which for a working man was an annual salary.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.720
 And there was a budgey boom as well.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720
 Well, that value shot up,

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.720
 'cause demand outstrip supplies so much,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.720
 'cause they have to be brought over from Australia.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720
 Do you know what I found out,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.720
 the budgey costing as much as a house thing?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.720
 - Capes, former Britain's strongest man competitor,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.720
 Jeff Capes, now keeps budgees.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.720
 He's the president of the budgey society.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720
 - Oh, wow, yeah.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.720
 I was looking into royals with pets,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.720
 because I just say it's so bizarre,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.720
 because they do get given a lot of presents

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.720
 which end up being exotic animals and stuff.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.720
 And Henry the third of France,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.720
 he had this thing where he used to carry,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.720
 so he had pets, he had three dogs,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.720
 and he used to carry them in a basket around his neck,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.720
 like a big bit of bling.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.720
 He used to bark at people they didn't trust,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720
 and he'd be like, get away from me.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.720
 If they didn't like the person, the dogs would bark them away.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.720
 But I looked into the Tower of London,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.720
 because I've met through standup,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.720
 a guy who is the raven master of the Tower of London,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.720
 who does stand up as well.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.720
 - It's crazy, he looks after the ravens,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720
 he lives there, that's his job.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.720
 He does stand up, he has dick jokes, it's amazing, right?

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.720
 But basically, the Tower of London has extraordinary animals,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.720
 or at least did, back in the day.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.720
 It was a white bear, no one knows for sure,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.720
 I can't see anyone who's apparently used to swimming in the turments, right?

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.720
 - Yeah, it was kept on a long,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.720
 but that was Henry the third of England, wasn't it?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.720
 - Yeah, it was kept on a deliberately long lead,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.720
 so it could go for a swim.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720
 - I went to the Tower of London.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.720
 - To the Tower in those days.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.720
 It's very confusing, because it sounds like the animals had a lot of liberties.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.720
 I went to the Tower of London's website,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.720
 and they have a whole page on the animals that used to live there,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720
 and they included, they had monkeys,

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.720
 which the monkeys were actually, they lived in a furnished room,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.720
 so you could go and visit these monkeys,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.720
 and it says be amused by their antics and human-like behavior,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.720
 but they've removed eventually,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.720
 because one of them tore a boy's leg off in a dangerous manner.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.720
 Which makes it sound like the first time they did it,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720
 it was kind of quite funny.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.720
 - Oh, you did it safely this time,

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.720
 so we're gonna keep the boys coming into the room,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.720
 but you are in the warning now.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.720
 - We're gonna have to move on, but any last minutes.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.720
 - I just have pet facts.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.720
 In 2004, a man called Jake Perry owned the Guinness World Record holder

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.720
 for the world's oldest cat.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.720
 In 2005, that record was broken by another one of Jake Perry's cats.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.720
 - Oh.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.720
 - This man has owned the two oldest cats by chance.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.720
 - Oh, he's lying about how old they are.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.720
 - Oh, he painted the first one a different colour.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.720
 - The other one died.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.720
 - The other one died.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.720
 - They counted the number of rings.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.720
 - They were old.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.720
 - It's terribly sad they have to drop the cats down

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.720
 to find out how old they were.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.720
 - That's all the first one died.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.720
 And yeah, he said he feeds his cat's bacon, eggs,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.720
 asparagus, broccoli, and a cup of coffee every morning.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.720
 - And they smoke 40 a day.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.720
 - They've just been along the lift.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.720
 - It just fills the spirit.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.720
 - We're going to have to move on to fact number three.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720
 And that's my fact.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.720
 My fact this week is that the Statue of Liberty originally wore a head scarf.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.720
 So the Statue of Liberty was originally designed for Egypt.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.720
 And it was originally meant to be at the mouth of the Sui's Canal.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.720
 It was going to be standing there with a torch on hand.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.720
 It was going to be a peasant lady.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.720
 And it was all designed.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720
 It was already.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.720
 And then Egypt had a financial situation where they couldn't afford it anymore.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.720
 And the guy who was called Bartholdy, he was an architect,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.720
 he was so distressed that he had this colossal thing that was going to be built.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720
 That was no longer built.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.720
 He went back to France, he was French.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.720
 And he then said, why don't we make a new similar, very similar look in the back for America.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.720
 And that became the Statue of Liberty.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.720
 So originally it was meant to be a peasant woman standing at the Sui's Canal.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.720
 - He said touch in hand, actually, the head of Egypt.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.720
 When he agreed to it, wanted the church on the head rather than the hand.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720
 Which would have looked a bit weird, wouldn't it?

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.720
 - It's interesting because it represents so much for America.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.720
 And this guy, obviously when he was trying to get it made in America as well,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.720
 he had to deny so much about the fact that it was originally meant to be for Egypt.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.720
 And everyone was like, but it feels like you were definitely pitching this in Egypt.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.720
 - No, totally not.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720
 Totally different.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.720
 - And so they kept bringing up stuff like, well, okay, how about the fact that when you've now repitched it to us,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.720
 you still want the Statue of Liberty, not on what we now know is the classic stand that the Statue of Liberty is on.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.720
 He wanted it on a pyramid.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.720
 They just did a really bad job of losing the Egypt connection.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.720
 And then they said, but it's literally the same design.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.720
 You've got a torch being held up.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.720
 And he was like, oh, okay, sure.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.720
 So how the hell am I meant to design a lighthouse effectively without a torch being up there for the light?

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.720
 For getting to point out that in both of the designs, the lighthouse element of it was in the head.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.720
 So again, he just kept shooting himself in the foot.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.720
 - Yeah, you talked about the, you talked about the kind of plimp that it's on.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.720
 - Yes.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720
 - That was paid for by America, right?

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720
 - Yeah.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.720
 - So France paid for the statue and America paid for the plimp.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.720
 By America couldn't get any money for the plimp.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.720
 And so they had a big sort of campaigns trying to get it.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:41.720
 And there was a company called Castoria, who made laxatives, who offered to give all the money if the name of the laxative would be displayed on the top of the statue.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.720
 - Wow.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.720
 - Really?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.720
 - It's a very different kind of liberty, isn't it?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.720
 - Free and easy movements.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.720
 So the original sort of garment, the peasant garment, she was designed to be a slave.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.720
 But the slave was called the word for it is a fella, right?

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:07.720
 And one of the main conspiracy theories about the statue of liberty, I'm straying into your territory here, Dan, is that the model for it was a man.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720
 And we don't really know.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:16.720
 A lot of people say that the model was either a buttoldies mother, or the face was a model on his mother, but we don't know.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.720
 - And what you're saying is that they heard that it was a fella, and they thought...

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.720
 - Yes, that's what I think it's come from.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720
 - That's cool.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.720
 There was a really good book written last year, I think, about the statue of liberty, and I can't remember what it's called.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:33.720
 But the woman who wrote that did hypothesize that he based the face on his brother who committed suicide, I think.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720
 - Wow.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720
 - Who he really loved.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.720
 And it does feel like a very masculine face, if you look at it, it's a man.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.720
 - Oh, I wouldn't say that.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.720
 - So a man in a dress.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:56.720
 - But the only evidence, actually, as far as I could find that it was based on his mother, is the fact that someone later on after it had been built, went to the opera, or went to a big sort of arts event with him and his mother.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.720
 And when his mother came in, this guy was like, and I turned around, and I was like, "Whoa, it's the statue of liberty!"

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.720
 And then he said that to people, and they're like, "Oh, that must be it."

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.720
 So I don't know how credible he is.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.720
 - The idea of the statue of liberty was actually by a guy called Labouly, who was a friend of Batoldi.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:21.720
 And he said in a dinner, and this was in a newspaper article of someone who was at that dinner, that it should be a statue that can be seen from the shores of America to the coast of France.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720
 - That's big.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.720
 - That is a big, big statue.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:35.720
 - So some of the guys at qi.com/talk, positive and zziggy, works out how high it would have to be in order that you'd be able to see it from France.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:41.720
 And it would have to be more than 3,000 kilometers high.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720
 - How high?

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.720
 - I'm an idiot, how high is that?

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.720
 - So the international space station, for instance.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:53.720
 - Yeah, the ISS goes around what, like, three or four hundred kilometers high, so it's like another ten times that much.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720
 - It's massive, yeah.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:05.720
 - Thomas Edison of electricity fame.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:17.720
 - He suggested putting a massive disk inside the statue, so it could deliver speeches from inside it all across New York.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.720
 - It's like it's talking to you, exactly.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.720
 - And now I'm talking about it, thankfully.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:29.720
 - It's weird to think of her as it, as originally brown or kind of golden, yellowish brown for the first 25 years.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:36.720
 Obviously being made of copper, it was supposed to be this shining golden statue, because we so obviously picture green.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.720
 And Bartoldy wanted her to be gilded in solid gold.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.720
 I think at first he tried to petition the American people to raise loads of money to do that.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.720
 And I think they said we've already raised quite a lot of money, thanks very much.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:53.720
 He had real trouble funding it. He tried to get her image copyrighted, so that every single image of her that appeared, he'd get money for it.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.720
 Which was quite in the 1880s, was quite a modern thing to try and do when he failed.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.720
 - Do you know, you used to be able to, they had fundraising dinners as well, where they would try, desperately try and raise money.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:11.720
 Because all they need, they had the statue, all they needed was the pedestal, and you could buy a meter tall version made of ice cream at these dinners.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:20.720
 Fun. He sold his signature, Bartoldy sold it 3,000 times to raise money for it.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.720
 And the only way they eventually got the money was by crowdfunding basically.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:31.720
 They printed in Joseph Pulitzer printed in his paper the name of everyone who gave, even if you gave a penny to it, they would print your name in the paper.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.720
 So it raised a huge amount of money and B, people bought the paper because they wanted to see their name in it.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:46.720
 It's a circulation block, it's quite clever. - This guy sounds amazing, it sounds like he started copyright laws, kickstarter, this is really advanced thinking.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.720
 So I went on to trip advisors to see what people thought of the statue of Liberty.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.720
 And there was one guy called H. Jammah, and he didn't like it very much actually.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:02.720
 He said, "It was bad because I don't like the sight, it's just a statue, nothing else."

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:09.720
 The tall was bad, and I owed a food at the cart, and the person sneezed on my burger.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:16.720
 I really don't get it, this was the worst trip ever, one star.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.720
 We're going to have to move on to our final fact. Do you guys got anything more that you want to add to that?

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.720
 No, that's me. - Time for our final facts of the evening, and that is James Harkin.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:38.720
 Okay, my fact this week is that a poll moment takes 42.5 minutes to dissolve if you stick it up your nose.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.720
 And first hand, QI research is the best time on research.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.720
 I actually, when I read that, I stopped on the way to get poll moments.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.720
 So, for the rest of the show, I might have won 50 minutes left, so just have half.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.720
 While he's doing that, I'll explain the points of this fact.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.720
 This, it was a fact given to me by my mum, actually, which is quite nice.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:05.720
 She found this study, it was by a guy called Dan Leppard, and he's an ENT specialist at the University Hospital of Wales.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:14.720
 And he wanted to see how long it took for people at home, Dan is inserting candy into his nose, and being put off here.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.720
 Now, he studied five different popular sweets, favored by children, and saw how long it took to dissolve in the nose.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:29.720
 And the idea is, he put them up his own nose, and the idea is that when children get things stuck up their noses, it's kind of hard to get it out, and it's quite, you know, not very nice thing.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.720
 But he thought, if they dissolve quickly, then maybe you don't have to go through that whole thing, you just let nature do its thing.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.720
 So, actually, it's quite an important study, even though it's a bit dumb.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.720
 I like that. How's that going over there?

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.720
 Everything smells great.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:53.720
 Actually, it's actually quite, I know that's not the point of it, but actually it's making my nose feel like I'm getting more air.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:31:03.720
 Okay, so other sweets, Skittles take 37.5 minutes to dissolve in your nose, Smarties 32.5, and Tic Tacs 27.5.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:13.720
 I'm now extremely skeptical about this study, because one of my friends is here who stuck a sour-skissled up her nose once on the day towards us.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.720
 Not for a day, actually, just for fun, I think.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:22.720
 And apparently, it was extremely painful, so I'd exploded in her nose. She tried to push it out, and it ended up in her eyes.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:35.720
 All the weird sour acid was streaming out of her nose and bits of her eye socket were falling out of her face and stuff, and she managed to get to A&E, I think, which implies that it does take longer than that.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.720
 Maybe sour-skittles have a difference as well.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.720
 You might be right.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.720
 I don't think this is really important to say at this point, but don't try this at home.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.720
 Although, quick update, it feels smaller.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:56.720
 I can feel the tight and smaller. So about polos, do you know that if you snap a polo in open in the dark, then it glows.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.720
 I didn't know this, and I couldn't try it at home, because it was daytime when I read this.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.720
 And nobody knows why, so it's a thing called Triboluminescence.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:10.720
 If you turn on the lights out, snap a polo. They think it's about electrons suddenly rushing to a certain point of the polo.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:19.720
 And it happens with polos, it also happens with cellotate. If you whip cellotate off its roll really fast in the dark, then it will glow at the point where it's being whipped off.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:30.720
 And it also emits x-rays, and they did an experiment last year where they managed to get an x-ray of a researcher's finger by just the x-rays emitted by cellotate.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.720
 You just put a cellotate, and he managed to get an x-ray through that off his own finger.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720
 How cool is that?

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:44.720
 It's cool. So when you get a hospital in future, they'll just have a massive roll of cellotate, just standing in front of the cellotate thing.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.720
 I have something about smelling things.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:55.720
 So when people who are asthmatic smell something that they think is going to cause them an allergic reaction, they will have an allergic reaction.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.720
 Even if the thing they're smelling doesn't cause an allergic reaction.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:06.720
 Oh wow, right. Yeah, and it's because from when you smell something, it goes to your brain before it goes to your lungs, as it were, the signals of what you've smelled.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:12.720
 And they tested 17 asthmatics, exposing them to a rose smelling chemical for a quarter of an hour.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.720
 And neither of them were told it would irritate their asthma, and the rest were told that it would calm them down.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.720
 And that's exactly what happened, even though it was the same stuff.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.720
 Really? How cool is that?

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.720
 The allergies are all in the mind.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.720
 No.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.720
 These people should stop me and stop. No.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.720
 With their epiphan.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.720
 It's the opposite.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.720
 It's the opposite of that.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.720
 It isn't the mind, but the mind is also a real thing, basically.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.720
 In some people, yeah.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:55.720
 They have my, another one of my friends, is a pediatric nurse, and she recently changed hospitals, and as part of the showing her around the new war, she worked an A&E, part of showing her on the new war.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.720
 They were like, "And this is where we keep the metal detector."

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:03.720
 And they have now, in a lot of pediatric A&E wars, metal detectors, because it's much easier way, and that's expensive way than an X-ray.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.720
 If a kick comes in and says, "I've eaten like 17 marbles."

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.720
 Not marbles, things are made of metal.

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.720
 That's called a marble bartering, yeah.

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.720
 You just go down the body.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:28.720
 That's clever, because in this paper of the polo thing, they did say that if a child states they have inserted a suite into their nose, and it cannot be visualized, one must believe that there is indeed a suite, and not an inorganic or corrosive object.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.720
 In other words, you have to trust the kid otherwise.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.720
 If he says it's a suite, and actually it's something bad.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.720
 But I also want to know what these mystery suites are, that no one can visualize.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.720
 When they're in your nose, there's kind of a suite before.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720
 Can you describe it?

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.720
 No.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:54.720
 So, I read a report that there was originally we thought that the nose had about 10,000 ways of smelling.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:02.720
 We could smell 10,000 different things, and that recently they looked into it again and like, "Oh, we got the number a bit wrong. It's actually a trillion."

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.720
 It's a bit of a discrepancy.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.720
 At the moment, obviously.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.720
 All of us except Mike.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.720
 How can we know that? It seems like such a high number.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.720
 I have no idea.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.720
 I have no idea, but we thank it only smell mint at the moment.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.720
 Second update? Definitely getting smaller.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.720
 Wondering if it might just fall out on its own accord.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.720
 Stay tuned.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:39.720
 I got me thinking about how, because I've always thought, you know, they test people for how good their hearing is.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.720
 And an eyesight, you can see quite well.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.720
 And I thought, "Smell, we must have humans who have amazing smell."

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.720
 And there's a guy actually who is job.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.720
 And it's one of the most important jobs in the world, I think.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.720
 This is his job title. He's NASA's sniffer.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.720
 NASA has a sniffer who smells everything before it goes into space.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.720
 This is how powerful his nostrils are.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.720
 If he doesn't like the smell, it doesn't go.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.720
 Literally, his nostrils are the gateway to all planet activity.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.720
 Because if you put something up into the International Space Station

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.720
 and it starts to smell after a few months, then that can be...

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.720
 You can't open a window. You can't open a window. You can't get it out.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.720
 So his nose has the ability to smell the tiniest of smell.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:27.720
 So he can see if that smell exists, and if it's there, it can then eventually turn into something bigger.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:33.720
 But so his job is tested every four months to see with a bunch of tiny little test tubes

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.720
 and some of them have no smell and some have the tiniest of smell.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.720
 And if he fails, he loses his job. He still has a job.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.720
 He's got the best nostrils on earth.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.720
 Do you think he can smell all trillion things in the world?

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.720
 I don't know. I just don't know how you...

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.720
 I mean, maybe they can try very, very similar things.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.720
 I have some things about things that get stuck up the rectum.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.720
 Oh, God.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.720
 Which, down your look, this wasn't my actual fact, otherwise...

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.720
 That would be in a very different experiment.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.720
 The 1995 IG Nobel Prize in Literature was given to two surgeons

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.720
 who made a study called Rectal Foreign Bodies, Case Reports,

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.720
 and a Comprehensive Review of the World's Literature.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.720
 And here are some of the things that they found that people would put up their bottoms.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.720
 I might... I'll stop halfway through this, I think, when it gets too much.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:26.720
 But seven light bulbs, a knife sharpener, two flashlights, a wire spring, a snuff box...

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.720
 Sorry, was this the second flashlight to try and find the first?

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:35.720
 We've just got dozens up there now.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.720
 This is not the same rectum.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.720
 These are different rectum.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.720
 So, 11 different forms of fruits, vegetables, and other food stuff.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:52.720
 Of jewelers saw a frozen pig's tail, and then one patient's remarkable ensemble collection,

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.720
 including spectacles, a suitcase key, a tobacco pouch, and a magazine...

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.720
 Oh, magazine?

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.720
 If you forget your handbag, I mean...

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.720
 It does sound like he was going on a journey, but he's got everything he needs.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.720
 Mike, there's your bag. I don't need a bag.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.720
 Why does he need a suitcase key if his rectum is axiom? Is he suitcase, boy?

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.720
 That must be the key inside the case again.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.720
 We'll have to be the best day of your life if you're one of those immigration officers

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.720
 who puts the glove on and heads in to fight some drugs.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.720
 It's like, let's see if you can even marry Poppins.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.720
 That's no version of the Mary Poppins I've seen.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.720
 Goodness me.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.720
 We're going to have to wrap up very briefly this morning.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:47.720
 Okay, one way that you could get out of being in the army was to pretend that you had polyps of the nose,

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.720
 and this is like a little tumour inside your nose, and if you had it, you wouldn't get in the army.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.720
 So people pretended, and here's a quote.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:02.720
 Attempts have been made to simulate this affection of the nose by introducing the testes of a cock,

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.720
 or the kidneys of a rabbit into the nostril, and retaining them there by means of a small piece of sponge,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.720
 which is sometimes impregnated with fetid juices.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.720
 But if it's that old war, you know.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.720
 I'll fight in the war.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.720
 Frontline Murray.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.720
 I'm not a violent man, but I'll take the war, please.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:29.720
 And another thing, we talked about the Ignaudal prizes before, and we're currently doing a bit of a talk with Mark,

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.720
 and we Mark Abrahams, who's in charge of those.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:37.720
 And so I asked him about this, and he sent me a paper from the Journal of Medical Hypothesies,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:44.720
 called "Ejaculation as a potential treatment of nasal congestion in mature males."

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.720
 Where are you ejaculating?

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:58.720
 Well, apparently, according to the abstract, its emission phase provides vasoconstriction and nasal decongestion,

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.720
 which I must say have never noticed myself.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.720
 You'll lose clears up when you're having sex.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.720
 And that's what this is saying, yeah.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.720
 You do have erectile tissue in your nose, so maybe it's that.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.720
 Speak for yourself.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.720
 I have a normal nose.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.720
 Maybe this bit adolescence listening, that's good excuse for when the mum walks in.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.720
 I would just have to blocked up nose.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.720
 We've already established that Andy's mum is here tonight, suddenly.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:30.720
 It's like I have a blocked up nose. Oh, that's what all the tissues are for.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.720
 Okay, we're going to have to wrap up.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.720
 Should we quickly find out how my polo is doing in my nose?

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.720
 All right, so...

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720
 God.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.720
 Talk amongst yourselves.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720
 It's still here.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.720
 It's still massive.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.720
 Oh, okay.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:54.720
 Okay.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.720
 That's all our facts.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.720
