00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with"
00:00:26,00:00:31,"Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered"
00:00:31,00:00:36,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:00:36,00:00:43,"order here we go. Starting with you, James. Okay, my fact this week is there is only one"
00:00:43,00:00:51,"mosquito in Iceland. Poor lonely mosquito. How'd it get there? Well, we think it maybe came over"
00:00:51,00:00:58,from Greenland on a plane. Right. Because it was found in the 80s by a guy called Professor
00:00:58,00:01:04,Gisleymar Gislesen from the University of Iceland and I wrote to Professor Gislesen and he wrote back
00:01:04,00:01:11,and he said he boarded a flight at Keflavik Airport in 1986 in June and the plane had come over from
00:01:11,00:01:16,Greenland and it was making a stop in Iceland and it was going to Germany and he was walking down the
00:01:16,00:01:22,passenger cabin and he saw this mosquito and he thought what's that doing here and he's like
00:01:22,00:01:27,I need to catch that mosquito and so he legged it along the aisle chasing this mosquito and he
00:01:27,00:01:33,managed to grab it and then he was going to work at Karlsruhe at the University for three months
00:01:33,00:01:38,but he had this mosquito and he knew it had to go to Iceland so he kept it for three months.
00:01:38,00:01:43,Had he killed it by this point? It was dead. I think it probably died when he grabbed it
00:01:43,00:01:48,so he then kept it in his room in this University for three months and then when he came back to
00:01:48,00:01:53,Iceland he gave the specimen to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History. They put it in
00:01:53,00:01:59,some alcohol and they kept it behind the scenes as this one Icelandic mosquito but and this is
00:01:59,00:02:05,where it takes a Dan Brown kind of twist. In 2016 the New York Times interviewed him and asked him
00:02:05,00:02:09,about the single mosquito and they went to look for it in the Institute of Natural History and
00:02:09,00:02:15,they can't find it. So we know that it exists. We know it's in Iceland somewhere but we don't
00:02:15,00:02:18,know exactly where it is. It's probably in the drawer somewhere but we don't know where it is.
00:02:18,00:02:25,I think the real story here is this guy's eyesight. If you're walking along the aisle of a plane
00:02:25,00:02:29,"and he spots at a distance a mosquito, he calls it as a mosquito not just a fly."
00:02:29,00:02:33,"Exactly. This guy, he smashed it, he's like yeah I know a mosquito when I see one."
00:02:33,00:02:37,But I don't get it because the mosquito was on a connecting flight to Germany
00:02:37,00:02:43,and still went to Germany where they have mosquitoes. So is it because it had landed
00:02:43,00:02:48,initially in Iceland that he thought that counts? I think it definitely it counts because it's in
00:02:48,00:02:54,certainly an Icelandic airspace isn't it? It was in Keflavik Airport. So I've been like you know
00:02:54,00:02:58,when you do this where you count all the countries in the world that you've been to I do that sometimes
00:02:58,00:03:04,to try and beat my wife and the way that I beat her is by counting countries where literally we
00:03:04,00:03:08,just landed and then we took off again and I never got off the plane like Bangladesh.
00:03:08,00:03:11,I went to Bangladesh and I should just stop there. I'd never got off the plane but I count that as
00:03:11,00:03:16,going to the country. So I think this mosquito should do the same. Do you think this mosquito had
00:03:16,00:03:21,one of those scratch maps and you just rub off into your country every time you go?
00:03:21,00:03:27,I'd love to see James your Bangladesh photo album just all shots of the inside of the plane.
00:03:27,00:03:31,Are we sure the mosquito wasn't someone's emotional support animal?
00:03:33,00:03:36,A really good point. It's ruined their trip completely.
00:03:36,00:03:41,Yeah but the thing is there aren't any mosquitoes in Iceland and it's one of the very few countries
00:03:41,00:03:45,where there aren't any. Pretty much every other country in the world has them and that includes
00:03:45,00:03:51,Greenland which is colder and it includes other countries like in a similar area to Iceland such
00:03:51,00:03:54,as Great Britain and things like that. You know all these places have got mosquitoes but Iceland
00:03:54,00:04:00,doesn't and the reason is that they are cold but they're not always cold. They have lots of changes
00:04:00,00:04:05,of climate all the time and so it gets really cold and then it gets kind of not too cold and
00:04:05,00:04:09,then it gets really cold again and stuff and the changes are so rapid that mosquitoes don't have
00:04:09,00:04:14,time to complete their life cycle because they have a particular life cycle whereas in Greenland
00:04:14,00:04:19,it's much colder but then they do have areas that are a more steady climate and they can
00:04:19,00:04:22,survive in places like that. Yeah in Greenland they're massive aren't they?
00:04:22,00:04:28,As in they're massive in size Anna. They're a huge in size and reputation. I think they are
00:04:28,00:04:33,particularly big. I mean they herd deer that's how impressive they are. They herd caribou in
00:04:33,00:04:37,Greenland but they don't really do it deliberately so they're particularly vicious ones apparently
00:04:37,00:04:41,because they don't have access to that much blood so there was one researcher who said
00:04:41,00:04:46,only about 15% ever get a blood meal and they need a blood meal to survive the females do
00:04:46,00:04:53,and so they're super vicious and they harass caribou and if a caribou baby gets attacked by a
00:04:53,00:04:58,load of mozzies it can kill it but the adults they see the mozzies and they run away and actually
00:04:58,00:05:03,apparently this is quite useful because mosquito harassment are red is a big factor in making
00:05:03,00:05:08,sure caribou don't overgraze. They just move them along to stop them overgrazing the land.
00:05:08,00:05:13,Apparently they run to the top of glaciers. They have to go that far to avoid mosquitoes chasing
00:05:13,00:05:16,them. Wow it's quite shaming when you're that big. It's like an elephant in a mouse.
00:05:16,00:05:22,I hadn't realised up until researching this fact how dangerous they have been. A few numbers have
00:05:22,00:05:27,been crunched together and they believe that 52 billion humans nearly half of all of us have
00:05:27,00:05:31,ever lived have been killed by mosquitoes. Half of all humans ever.
00:05:31,00:05:36,I'm unclear but I think that that might be a useful misconception to debunk because I think
00:05:36,00:05:42,that estimate is often stated but I was reading a thing that actually crunched the numbers
00:05:42,00:05:47,and it was basically saying maximum it's probably only about 7% of the population.
00:05:47,00:05:52,That's still a lot. It's a hell of a lot. It's many billion but I don't know. No one really knows
00:05:52,00:05:56,where that original estimate came from so it may have been someone who was doing some better number
00:05:56,00:06:01,"crunching. What the place I was reading about this was in a book called The Mosquito, a human"
00:06:01,00:06:06,"history of our deadliest predator by a guy called Timothy C. Weingard and to be fair,"
00:06:06,00:06:11,"as awesome as the book sounds and as awesome as he is, he does say a few things that make you think"
00:06:11,00:06:17,I think you're giving the mosquito a bit more credit than it deserves. Well he also says the
00:06:17,00:06:21,extinction of the dinosaurs is down to the mosquitoes. Now obviously we've all heard the
00:06:21,00:06:26,famous story about the asteroid hitting the earth but he says up until that moment 70%
00:06:26,00:06:31,of regional dinosaurs had been made extinct by mosquitoes and they probably would have taken
00:06:31,00:06:36,out the rest but the pesky asteroid got in their way. The asteroid just finished the job the mosquito
00:06:36,00:06:41,had started. Is that what he's saying? Took the credit yeah. It's like the Americans swooping in
00:06:41,00:06:48,at the end of the war. He's been plugging away for six years. Yeah they are bastards. They kill
00:06:48,00:06:52,a hell of a lot of us and they've got so many different ways of doing it and I hadn't quite
00:06:52,00:06:57,realized how recently it was that we realized that certain diseases were spread by mosquitoes.
00:06:57,00:07:02,"So it was really the turn of the 20th century. Yellow fever but in humans thousands of years,"
00:07:02,00:07:08,"3,000 years at least and only in 1900 did people put it together that that was mosquitoes."
00:07:08,00:07:13,We used to think that mixomatosis was caused by mosquitoes but that was proved not true in the
00:07:13,00:07:20,60s and it was found not to be true by this amazing entomologist called Dame Miriam Rothschild
00:07:20,00:07:25,and she basically worked out that it was fleas that did it and she did that by just carrying
00:07:25,00:07:30,plastic bags full of fleas around with her in a bedroom in her house. She had just had all these
00:07:30,00:07:35,fleas around and she worked out the life cycle of the flea and then she worked out that it was
00:07:35,00:07:40,controlled by the sex hormone of rabbits which would let it finish its life cycle and that's
00:07:40,00:07:46,where the mixomatosis came from in the rabbits. But she was amazing. She worked in the enigma
00:07:46,00:07:51,project at Bletchley Park during the war. She had a lab in Plymouth with all of her fleas and stuff
00:07:51,00:07:56,and it got bombed and she lost seven years of work. You're going to say she lost seven fleas?
00:07:56,00:08:03,They don't mention that much when they do the statistics in the war do they? The seven fleas
00:08:03,00:08:11,"that were lost? In 1952 she wrote a book called Fleas, Flux and Cuckoos which she started writing"
00:08:11,00:08:17,while pregnant and marooned in the channel due to a storm living off a diet of boiled potatoes
00:08:17,00:08:21,and all she had was a pen and a piece of paper and some boiled potatoes and so she ate the
00:08:21,00:08:26,potatoes and started writing her book and her later book which is called An Atlas of Insect
00:08:26,00:08:31,Tissue which came out in the 80s on the jacket illustration. It has the close-up illustration
00:08:31,00:08:36,of the vagina of a flea which she claimed made it unique in the publishing world.
00:08:36,00:08:40,"It's the only book with the vagina of a flea on the front cover. Yep, seems likely."
00:08:40,00:08:46,How is she stranded in the channel? What's happened there? She was on a boat going either
00:08:46,00:08:51,from the UK to Europe or the other way around and there was a storm and they couldn't go to part.
00:08:51,00:08:55,"And was it stranded for so long that they were reduced to living off potatoes? You know, people"
00:08:55,00:08:59,are reduced to living off certain things when they've been out for weeks. It's true. It feels
00:08:59,00:09:04,"like she was looking for a great origin story for her book. I thought, this is finally a cool"
00:09:04,00:09:09,"enough circumstance. Someone's just brought around the potatoes. It's true. I mean, it does sound like"
00:09:09,00:09:14,"one meal, doesn't it? It sounds like a way to brought around chips on the ferry because they"
00:09:14,00:09:18,were refuelling. Do you know another thing that mosquitoes are responsible for that we can thank
00:09:18,00:09:26,"them for is the creation of Great Britain? Yeah. Now, this is according to Timothy C. Weingard,"
00:09:27,00:09:33,"for Human History of Our Deadliest Predator. Okay. He says that in 1698, Scotland was attempting to"
00:09:33,00:09:39,colonize the Americas and really set themselves up. So they sent out five ships and these ships
00:09:39,00:09:43,"got to Panama and the mosquitoes of Panama gave them all malaria and so on. They got really,"
00:09:43,00:09:49,"really sick and it turned into a huge financial crisis. So England stepped in, offered to pay"
00:09:49,00:09:54,"the Scottish debt and in doing so, Scotland had to forfeit sovereignty and that was when"
00:09:54,00:10:01,"they united with England. Thus, mosquitoes created Great Britain. In fairness to your guide,"
00:10:01,00:10:05,"that one is pretty much true. I'm pretty certain that's true. The Scots, what they were trying to do"
00:10:05,00:10:10,"is like, all the colonial powers around the world like Spain and Portugal and England were all going"
00:10:10,00:10:15,around finding these countries to subjugate and take over and the Scots thought we're going to
00:10:15,00:10:19,"get in on that and they decided to go to this place called Darien, not realizing that it was"
00:10:19,00:10:23,"just full of midges of mosquitoes. And I think there was like some con man who'd gone to Edinburgh,"
00:10:23,00:10:27,"telling everyone that it was this amazing, was it called Gregor McGregor or something?"
00:10:27,00:10:32,And he told everyone that this amazing place that they could all go and live and stuff and
00:10:32,00:10:38,it was just a complete swamp. Such a good story. It's actually really unpleasant for mosquitoes
00:10:38,00:10:43,"feeding off our blood. I know it's quite unpleasant for us as well, but it's really hot"
00:10:43,00:10:47,because they're insects. They actually don't have such good thermoregulation as we do.
00:10:47,00:10:51,"And so when they feed off our blood, which is obviously at our warm, blooded body temperature,"
00:10:51,00:10:57,they get boiling hot. And the only way that they survive it is by urinating all over themselves
00:10:57,00:11:04,as they do it and kind of bleeding on their buns. Really? Yeah. So wait a minute. So the food is too
00:11:04,00:11:09,"hot. Yeah. So you got some hot soup and instead of blowing on the soup, you urinate over your whole"
00:11:09,00:11:16,"body. It's another option, James, just next time you're at a dinner party. It's worth trying."
00:11:16,00:11:20,And it looks cool. You should look it up. So scientists are really confused about why they
00:11:20,00:11:24,waste fresh blood. They'll drink your blood and then you'll see a little droplet of blood
00:11:24,00:11:28,sprouting out of their anus. And they obviously haven't got the nutrients out of it. And that's
00:11:28,00:11:33,because it's getting so hot that they need to excrete some of that liquid so that it evaporates
00:11:33,00:11:39,off them and carries the heat away. It's a bit of a shameful experience. If you're a mosquito
00:11:39,00:11:45,"researcher, do you know how you get mosquitoes to mate with each other? It's very sexy stuff."
00:11:45,00:11:50,"What you have to do, you start off by decapitating the male and then you have to anaesthetize the"
00:11:50,00:11:57,female. Right. And then you have to grab the male and insert his still-presuding genitals into the
00:11:57,00:12:01,female and then they will lock together and sperm will be transferred between the two and the female
00:12:01,00:12:08,will become pregnant. And some people can do that without a microscope. What? How do they be
00:12:08,00:12:13,decapitated? Do they have like a tiny little guillotine? They have to put it through a show
00:12:13,00:12:19,"trial first, though. Also, how come the female's the one that gets the anaesthetic? Isn't the male"
00:12:19,00:12:25,"there going, ""I think sodding decapitated. She's the only anaesthetic."" Yeah, it's a good point."
00:12:25,00:12:29,It's really messed up. I know. It feels like there's a lot going on there where really the
00:12:29,00:12:32,only important bit is you get the male genitals and you put them inside the female.
00:12:32,00:12:37,I don't know why you have to decapitate the male. That's what I think I really don't get.
00:12:38,00:12:41,Feels like a lot of that stuff is being done for fun by the researchers.
00:12:41,00:12:49,We found out a new way of transporting mosquitoes because this is quite important. So let's say
00:12:49,00:12:54,you've got a load of mosquitoes that are sterile and you want to put them in an area where they
00:12:54,00:12:59,have disease problems like malaria or Zika or something and you put the sterile ones in there
00:12:59,00:13:04,and they can outperform the non-sterile ones and then it hopefully stops them from hurting humans.
00:13:04,00:13:09,"But how do you get them from A to B? Because mosquitoes, they don't really go on really"
00:13:09,00:13:16,"long flights unless they get on the IS192 from Gotthav to Keflavik, they do. But normally,"
00:13:16,00:13:21,they only go about 100 meters from where they were born. So we need to get them from one place to
00:13:21,00:13:26,another. A load of researchers have found out that the best way to do it is to squish as many as you
00:13:26,00:13:33,can in a little vial because it turns out they're not that fussed about it and they stay alive.
00:13:33,00:13:38,"Whereas if you put fewer of them in the vial, then they might bash around and stuff like that and"
00:13:38,00:13:45,"they might not survive. Whereas if you put something like 1,200 mosquitoes in the space of a teaspoon,"
00:13:45,00:13:50,"is what I'm talking about, 240 mosquitoes per cubic centimeter and you squish them all right down,"
00:13:50,00:13:56,they have this kind of exoskeleton that can almost fill in all the gaps and so there's no gaps in
00:13:56,00:14:00,"between them all, which means they can't wriggle around, they can't hurt themselves and only maybe"
00:14:00,00:14:03,the ones at the very top and the very bottom would get injured and the rest of them when you let them
00:14:03,00:14:09,"free, they're okay. Nice. It's like a jigsaw. Like a jigsaw, yeah. Or getting the London Underground,"
00:14:09,00:14:13,"I've definitely been in a situation where I've seen jigsaw positions. But it definitely is,"
00:14:13,00:14:16,I thought it was like the London Underground because I remember feeling safe when there are so
00:14:16,00:14:20,"many people you don't need to hang onto the railings, right? Because you're just all sweaty in time"
00:14:20,00:14:25,"against each other, no one can fall. That's why you always went on the tube with 12 really buff"
00:14:25,00:14:29,"bodyguards that you are, who just kind of gathered around you. Yeah, it's very expensive catching"
00:14:29,00:14:35,"the tube, actually. I mean, to pay those salaries. Did you guys know that mosquitoes are responsible"
00:14:35,00:14:43,"for the Magna Carta? Is this another review? Done. According to Timothy C. Winegard, author of the"
00:14:43,00:14:49,"Mosquito, A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator, he says that Louis the Seventh Siege of Damascus"
00:14:49,00:14:55,"was during a malaria season in 1148. The downfall of that, the fact that it couldn't happen, led to"
00:14:55,00:15:01,"his separation from Eleanor of Aquitaine. And that led to her marrying Henry II of England,"
00:15:01,00:15:06,"which then led to the birth of King John, who was then having all those battles with his barons"
00:15:06,00:15:11,"that led to the Magna Carta. So really, mosquitoes, again, have shaped history in ways we've not"
00:15:11,00:15:15,"given them credit for. All right, then, if we're doing tenuous things that we can thank mosquitoes"
00:15:15,00:15:21,"for, we can also thank them for gin and tonic, which I think there may be one fewer connection"
00:15:21,00:15:26,"here. Gin, its reputation was ruined, start of the 19th century, because, you know, all the like,"
00:15:26,00:15:33,"the scummy gin houses, and it was making people behave very badly. And then it became a bit of a"
00:15:33,00:15:38,"heroic drink, because this was round about the time that the Brits were colonising India, and"
00:15:38,00:15:43,they realised that the only way to stave off malaria was with quinine. And so they started
00:15:43,00:15:48,"making tonic water with loads and loads of quinine. And so quinine became this great heroic drink,"
00:15:48,00:15:53,"because it was saving the British colonisers in India from getting malaria, and it was brought"
00:15:53,00:15:58,"home. They chucked it in gin, and suddenly gin went from being a scourge on society to being a"
00:15:58,00:16:03,"patriotic thing to drink when you paired it with tonic water. And thus, the gin and tonic was born."
00:16:03,00:16:05,They also spread Christianity bizarre.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"Dan, you've got to stop reading Timothy C. Weingard."
00:16:08,00:16:11,"Listen, I'm telling you, the mosquito, a human history of our deadliest predator,"
00:16:11,00:16:17,"is fascinating. According to Timothy C. Weingard, it's because people were dying of malaria that"
00:16:17,00:16:21,people who were pushing the Christian faith were going out to help the sick. And in helping the
00:16:21,00:16:27,"sick, they were able to spread the message more. So malaria was leading to actually a huge burst"
00:16:27,00:16:32,"of advertisement. So if people were dying of other stuff, then the Christians would have gone,"
00:16:32,00:16:37,"""No, fuck it. If it's not mosquito related, I'm not interested."" Exactly. Could have been a very"
00:16:37,00:16:42,"different world. But once again, the mosquito has forced the course of history that we've ended on."
00:16:42,00:16:46,"Yeah, they shouldn't call it the butterfly effect, should they? They should call it the mosquito effect."
00:16:46,00:16:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:16:57,00:17:01,"My fact is that in the early 20th century, Japan had secret propaganda underwear,"
00:17:01,00:17:04,which you would only show to your close friends or family.
00:17:04,00:17:14,Okay. Wow. So this is a kind of clothing. They were common in Japan in the early 20th century.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"Basically, there are a kind of kimono. There are lots of different kinds of kimono and also"
00:17:17,00:17:23,"lots of different things to do with kimono. So there are under kimonos. There are Miyamira kimono,"
00:17:23,00:17:28,"which are kind of swaddling kimonos for babies, all sorts of kimonos. And around about 1900,"
00:17:28,00:17:34,"Japan started producing various artisans, started making really stunning modern kimono prints,"
00:17:34,00:17:40,"which were Art Deco, and they were Cubist, and they had all sorts of beautiful,"
00:17:40,00:17:45,modern patterns on them. And they had cities and ocean liners and skyscrapers and trains and planes
00:17:45,00:17:50,"and everything. And they were secret because you wouldn't obviously be flashing your undergarments,"
00:17:50,00:17:54,"or the linings at people, unless it was to people you knew quite well."
00:17:54,00:18:00,"But yeah, to be honest, we probably had known each other three or four months before you started"
00:18:00,00:18:04,flashing your undergarments at me. Exactly. You got into what I call the inner circle.
00:18:04,00:18:11,"Well, I wish you had gotten that. Those things sound not propaganda though. You know, it seems"
00:18:11,00:18:16,"harsh. If you're brandishing some Art Deco, that's all like artistic expression. I think it's more"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"what we call it, isn't it? That's like the term that people call it propaganda kimonos."
00:18:20,00:18:25,They did make a slight twist into more outright propaganda territory when the government became
00:18:25,00:18:31,a bit more militaristic and a bit more fascistic as well. So you could get Mussolini underpants as
00:18:31,00:18:39,"well, or under kimonos as well. Really? Yeah, yeah. They had Hitler ones too, anti-aircraft guns"
00:18:39,00:18:45,"on your under kimonos. So yeah, it did go in that direction. They're seen as slightly embarrassing"
00:18:45,00:18:50,"now, but they didn't start out that way. I bought some pants in Japan once, but they were Godzilla"
00:18:50,00:18:54,"on them. So that's not the same thing as it. Well, they were just still slightly embarrassing."
00:18:56,00:19:01,"These ones, these propaganda ones you were mentioning, Andy, the really interesting one was"
00:19:01,00:19:06,"the one that was made for kids that you mentioned, the Mayamari. That was made for infants that were"
00:19:06,00:19:11,going to a Shinto shrine for the first time to be blessed. And when they were doing the propaganda
00:19:11,00:19:16,"ones, they were quite full on. They had soldiers preparing to dash through a field of exploding"
00:19:16,00:19:22,"shells and children on the garment sleeve. So it was all about children in war, largely when"
00:19:22,00:19:28,you saw these things. It was really pushing the idea that kids should be believing in battle as
00:19:28,00:19:32,"well. Yeah, it definitely went a bit in Goebbels direction, didn't it? They were very much trying"
00:19:32,00:19:37,to suck up to the fascists at one point of their underwear making industry. And there is some
00:19:37,00:19:40,shame attached to it now. This is what I thought was really interesting about the article that you
00:19:40,00:19:45,"sent around, Andy, which I think was an Atlas Obscura piece, was the woman who first revealed it,"
00:19:45,00:19:50,"was this woman called Jacqueline Atkins, who I partly liked that she was a full bright scholar"
00:19:50,00:19:55,"in Japanese textiles, which I didn't realise they did full bright scholarships in. But"
00:19:55,00:20:00,"she tracked them down. She went to Japan and she started seeing these propaganda,"
00:20:00,00:20:05,slightly fascistic kimonos. And she asked people about them and they wouldn't tell her anything.
00:20:05,00:20:09,And she found this woman who had a collection and she really didn't want to speak to her because
00:20:09,00:20:13,"you know, she was like, it's really embarrassing. My family don't know that I have these. No one"
00:20:13,00:20:18,"knows. There's no written records of them. The history has been really suppressed because,"
00:20:18,00:20:22,"you know, it was very militaristic, putting pictures of fighting children on"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"children's underwear. But yeah, so it's only come out recently, hasn't it? This whole thing."
00:20:26,00:20:34,"I love that the kimono itself roughly translate as ""thing to wear"". It hasn't got just such a"
00:20:34,00:20:40,"random and even these propaganda ones that were designed, they were called ""omoshi-rogaras"" and"
00:20:40,00:20:44,"""omoshi-rogara"" just means interesting or amusing design. So just ""thing to wear"" with"
00:20:44,00:20:49,"interesting or amusing design. But these days, like, to get a really good kimono,"
00:20:49,00:20:54,they're unbelievably expensive. We went to a kimono shop when we're in Japan and tried to buy
00:20:54,00:20:59,one thinking that it would be expensive but not that expensive. And they brought you in the shop
00:20:59,00:21:05,"like, you know, you're in a car showroom and they showed you all of these amazing prints and stuff"
00:21:05,00:21:08,and then only at the end told you it was going to be like 20 grand for one of these kimonos.
00:21:08,00:21:13,"I know. And like, you know, you can get them for all different price ranges but if you go to"
00:21:13,00:21:17,"these specialist shops, that can be the amount. They're so expensive."
00:21:17,00:21:20,"Were you like, you were trying to leave the shop but you didn't want to seem like you didn't have"
00:21:20,00:21:24,"the money so you bought something anyway and just went, ""God, you know, I'll just go for those Godzilla"
00:21:24,00:21:29,"underpants"". How much? Five grand?"
00:21:29,00:21:36,"They are really artisan there, aren't they? The people who are designing them. There's one"
00:21:36,00:21:41,family that has been making kimonos and still to this day. And I think they're the last surviving
00:21:41,00:21:47,of the sort of historical makers of it. So they're called Chiso and they were set up in 1555
00:21:47,00:21:53,and it was initially set up by a guy who was making it for some monks. And all these four
00:21:53,00:21:58,"centuries later, they are still making it with the same family. It's a descendants of the same"
00:21:58,00:22:02,family. It's like the pastor we were talking about the other week of just it being handed down.
00:22:02,00:22:08,It's a company that has over 600 people designing these things and putting them together.
00:22:08,00:22:15,"Yet still, they only make 25 kimonos a year. That's how precious and time consuming and"
00:22:15,00:22:20,"dedicated it is. Yeah. They're slow, aren't they? They're slow at making them. I'm sure it's a very"
00:22:20,00:22:24,difficult process. But they say a standard kimono takes three to four months. This is just this
00:22:24,00:22:29,company. But it's not unusual for it to be a year and a half for one kimono. So if you're thinking
00:22:29,00:22:36,"emergency for the party at the weekend, you're not in luck. They once spent 10 years developing one"
00:22:36,00:22:42,specific kimono trying to get the indigo dye exactly right. You might have changed your mind
00:22:42,00:22:45,"about whether you want it by then. I mean, you'll have changed shades. You might have changed"
00:22:45,00:22:50,"like your idea of what colour you want. You're like, actually, you know, I'm not really... I was"
00:22:50,00:22:55,"thinking more violet rather than indigo. The thing is, if you change shape, doesn't matter."
00:22:55,00:23:00,"That's a joy of kimono, right? You can go up to 45, 50 stone and because it just wraps around,"
00:23:00,00:23:04,just wrap it around a bit looser. Everyone looks good in the kimono.
00:23:04,00:23:07,"Washing them is an absolute nightmare, as far as I can tell."
00:23:07,00:23:13,"A, it looks like it's extremely expensive, time consuming, but also you just can't do it on your"
00:23:13,00:23:18,"own. So in order for you to wash a kimono, the whole thing needs to be taken apart into seven"
00:23:18,00:23:24,different parts. And then you need to air dry them and then re-stitch the whole thing back together.
00:23:24,00:23:29,There's special kimono washing stations in order to do it. They have a huge process to do it.
00:23:29,00:23:34,They wash it by hand with soapy water. They then lather it with seaweed paste.
00:23:34,00:23:38,"They hang it on these panels to dry such a long process, but you have to literally take it up."
00:23:38,00:23:43,It's like going to a car wash and then taking your car apart to wash it all in and put it back
00:23:43,00:23:47,together. It's mad. I'm not really surprised if it takes 10 years to make. I would be
00:23:47,00:23:52,staggered if there was a label inside saying just bunging it on 16 for an hour and a half.
00:23:52,00:23:57,That's true. I think just soap under the armpits for a couple of minutes and you're fine.
00:23:58,00:24:04,"When you're putting on your kimono, make sure you always bring the right side over the body first"
00:24:04,00:24:09,and then pull the left side over the right side because the opposite way is the way the Japanese
00:24:09,00:24:14,"dress the dead. And so if you do it that way, it's a big faux pas or someone will just think you've"
00:24:14,00:24:21,"died probably. You've worn one, haven't you, James? You sound as a very fetching image."
00:24:21,00:24:26,"Well, what I'm looking at now and why I said that is because I was given three steps to wearing a"
00:24:26,00:24:31,kimono by the hotel which made us wear these kimonos instead of you don't wear it. You're
00:24:31,00:24:37,not getting dinner this evening. That's what they said. And women would put the sash around the waist
00:24:37,00:24:42,and men would put it over the hip bone slightly lower down. So that's the difference between men
00:24:42,00:24:48,"and women. That's how you tell the difference. Yes, exactly. Is that a live man or a dead woman?"
00:24:48,00:24:54,"You can tell by just looking at the kimono. I was speaking of wearing kimonos during dinner,"
00:24:54,00:24:58,James. I was reading that in order to make sure that you don't have to go and have your kimono
00:24:58,00:25:03,"washed, you often have to do preventative things. For example, wearing it in a kimono, part of that"
00:25:03,00:25:08,is so that it doesn't touch the body and take on the odor. So you have to protect them that way.
00:25:08,00:25:12,"If anything gets onto the kimono, immediately get cleaning on it because obviously the nightmare."
00:25:12,00:25:17,"I know. I'm just thinking actually when I had that dinner, I shouldn't have ordered the spaghetti"
00:25:17,00:25:22,bolognese because I got sauce all over my kimono and it's going to take three years to wash.
00:25:22,00:25:27,"No. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's... I was reading this lady on Quora who said exactly"
00:25:27,00:25:32,"that, that when she sat down to dinner in her kimono, the waiter came over and immediately"
00:25:32,00:25:39,padded her entire body with cows and napkins for fear that she would be getting it dirty.
00:25:39,00:25:43,"James, just say the spike ball is a representation of a traumatic war scene."
00:25:43,00:25:48,"This is the som, okay? What are the questions?"
00:25:48,00:25:52,They used to have magic eye kimonos that you could get and these are 300 years ago. Yeah.
00:25:52,00:25:57,"Okay. Now look, when I say magic eye, no, hang on. Everyone calm down a bit."
00:25:57,00:26:03,"I was just thinking, right, just hear me out here. If you were to have a pair of trousers,"
00:26:03,00:26:08,which were magic eye and then people stared at them and then it looked like a bulge was coming
00:26:08,00:26:12,"out of the groin to make your genitals look bigger. That would be quite clever, wouldn't it?"
00:26:12,00:26:14,That'd be really good if you wanted to be arrested.
00:26:16,00:26:20,Why would I be arrested when people are staring at my genitals?
00:26:20,00:26:22,"Good point. It's not a fair system, James."
00:26:22,00:26:24,"Yeah, that's what the flashers say, don't they?"
00:26:24,00:26:27,Not forcing you to look.
00:26:27,00:26:35,"Sorry. Okay. So when I say magic eye, basically, it's all about the way they change the perspective."
00:26:35,00:26:40,"So there is a kimono from the 18th century, but it has hawks on the bottom half of it,"
00:26:40,00:26:44,"right? It hawks the birds of prey. And on the top, all around the top half of it,"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"there are these Japanese characters, which looks like they're referring to different birds of prey."
00:26:48,00:26:52,"But actually, it can be read in two ways. And actually, if you read it in the other"
00:26:52,00:26:57,"interpretation, it's all about visiting prostitutes. And it's a kind of naughty sex kimono."
00:26:57,00:27:04,I love it. Very cool. I was trying to find other kinds of kimonos. I like going to Wikipedia
00:27:04,00:27:10,"sometimes and pressing the button that gives you their surname as kimono. Anyway, what I found is,"
00:27:10,00:27:14,did you know that there is only one band called Kimono in Iceland?
00:27:14,00:27:21,Nice. That's good. Very strong. Go on. And how did they get there? Were they chased down the
00:27:21,00:27:28,"Isle of a Plain, taken to Germany first? Actually, they're pretty cool. They were formed in 2001,"
00:27:28,00:27:34,"and they've had a bunch of albums. And one of their members actually left them recently,"
00:27:34,00:27:38,"moved to London and joined the Vaccines. Oh, really? Yeah. So one of the Vaccines members"
00:27:38,00:27:45,used to be in kimono in Iceland. Very cool. So here's an interesting kimono. I read about this
00:27:45,00:27:52,"in the New York Times in 2007. This was because in Japan, there is still, and there definitely was,"
00:27:52,00:27:57,a worry of women being assaulted when they're walking down the street. And so this thing was
00:27:57,00:28:03,invented where you would get your kimono and then you would almost turn it inside out. And there
00:28:03,00:28:08,was a few flaps and stuff. And then you could stand by the side of the road and it would make you look
00:28:08,00:28:15,"exactly like a vending machine. So you would walk past and you would think oh, it's just a vending"
00:28:15,00:28:20,"machine. But actually, it was a woman who turned her kimono inside out to make her look like a"
00:28:20,00:28:24,"vending machine. James, I can't believe I'm going to say this to you. What are you talking about?"
00:28:24,00:28:33,"This is a thing it was invented by someone called Ms. Sukioka, who's a 29-year-old fashion designer"
00:28:33,00:28:39,in Tokyo. And that was the idea. I'm not sure. I don't think they would commonly came into use
00:28:39,00:28:45,"after 2007. And if you ever go to Japan, you'll see there are vending machines everywhere. Like,"
00:28:45,00:28:49,"that is one thing about it. So it is a... Well, Arthur, we don't know. Exactly. No vending machine"
00:28:49,00:28:53,"anywhere. That's what I thought. When I went to Japan, I thought there's so many vending machines,"
00:28:53,00:28:59,but no women in this country. Aren't you more likely to be touched by a man who's thinking
00:28:59,00:29:03,he's using a vending machine than you would if you were just standing being a woman?
00:29:03,00:29:09,"That's a really good point. Yeah, I suppose. Maybe your vending machine should look like an"
00:29:09,00:29:14,"empty vending machine, or maybe one of your Twix's should be just hanging off. So anyone who sees it"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"goes, ""Oh, that's the dodgy one that's not going to give me my Twix."" I don't know. If there's one..."
00:29:18,00:29:22,"I mean, the worst-case scenario is when you are a bit cheeky and you stick your hand into the"
00:29:22,00:29:28,"vending machine to try and... I'm just saying, this is going up a lot of possible problems."
00:29:28,00:29:33,"I'm with you. Do you have to bring out 100 Mars bars with you whenever you go out? If you don't,"
00:29:33,00:29:37,do you get people violently shaking you to try and extract what they think they're owed?
00:29:37,00:29:43,I'm not saying it's a flawless system. I'm just saying it's a thing that at least in concept form
00:29:43,00:29:55,"existed. Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:29:55,00:29:59,My fact this week is that fish get the bends if you reel them in too quickly.
00:29:59,00:30:04,"I know. They put all little things, and they get it worse than we do."
00:30:04,00:30:06,Stop really fishing.
00:30:06,00:30:12,"Yeah, or reel them in very slowly. This is a genuine problem because in a lot of recreation"
00:30:12,00:30:15,"or fishing, you throw the fish back into the water. You don't want to deplete the supplies,"
00:30:15,00:30:20,"you don't want to kill the fish. But actually, I read one estimate that in Western Australia,"
00:30:21,00:30:26,70% of certain fish are thrown back into the water. Someone estimated that about 50% of
00:30:26,00:30:32,those will actually die because they've got the bends from being reeled in. The bends is the
00:30:32,00:30:36,"very painful consequence of if you've been diving very, very deep in the water, and then you come"
00:30:36,00:30:41,"up far too quickly, there's this extremely quick decrease in pressure that you undergo,"
00:30:41,00:30:46,"and nitrogen bubbles are released into your system, and it's very painful. It's called the bends"
00:30:46,00:30:53,"because of the position that it renders you into. You're bending over in agony, and fish get it too."
00:30:53,00:30:59,"And with fish, it's more like they often just get bigger and bulgier, and their eyes pop out."
00:30:59,00:31:01,Sometimes their stomach bulges out their mouth.
00:31:01,00:31:07,"Yeah, and there's a few ways to stop it being a problem. So you can vent them if you can somehow"
00:31:07,00:31:13,put a hollow instrument through their body into their swim bladder wall. It can release some of
00:31:13,00:31:17,"the gases. That can help. Unfortunately, you have to be a bit of an expert to do that. Don't"
00:31:17,00:31:21,"just shove a byro in because that's like most people who try and do it, it doesn't work."
00:31:21,00:31:27,I just think it's amazing that method that you can do mini surgery on a fish like a tracheotomy.
00:31:27,00:31:32,It is really amazing that that can happen. The other thing that you can do is you can put them
00:31:32,00:31:38,"in a fish elevator, which is a word for basically a milk crate with a rope attached where you put"
00:31:38,00:31:42,the fish in and very slowly weigh it down so it goes back to where it came from.
00:31:42,00:31:46,"Mason, if you threw the fish back in, it wouldn't know to go back down to the depth."
00:31:46,00:31:51,"No, I don't know if it even knows it's a fish, but it would naturally try and go down to the"
00:31:51,00:31:56,"bottom. But the problem is it's full of this gas, so it can't go anywhere because it's floating."
00:31:56,00:32:03,You need to somehow get the gas out of it or get it back down to where it was before so that the
00:32:03,00:32:07,"gas changes under pressure. That's basically because they have this swim bladder, isn't it?"
00:32:07,00:32:12,"So actually, it's worse because when they have gas bubbles in them, the whole swim bladder inflates"
00:32:12,00:32:16,like it's literally like an inflatable. And so they're just stuck at the top.
00:32:16,00:32:20,"There is another method you can have to bring them down, which is attach a descending device to them,"
00:32:20,00:32:25,"which is basically a weight that you put onto its lip. And you just sort of clamp it on there,"
00:32:25,00:32:30,and it just tugs the fish back down with it. And then it comes off. You can set it to release
00:32:30,00:32:34,at the particular depth that the fish should be swimming around at. I know.
00:32:34,00:32:39,"When Anna, you said that the name the bends comes from when you bend over because you're in so much"
00:32:39,00:32:43,pain. I found this really interesting. It's actually named after something called the Grecian
00:32:43,00:32:49,"bend, which I'm sure you all read about, which is incredible. So people do bend over in pain because"
00:32:49,00:32:55,"they have this. But at the time in the 19th century, there was this thing called the Grecian bend."
00:32:55,00:33:00,And it was a way that women walked where they kind of stuck their thumbs out because they had a big
00:33:00,00:33:05,bustle and they stuck their chest out and they kind of look like they're in a bit of an S shape.
00:33:05,00:33:10,You'll see it if you see like illustrations that are kind of taking the piss out of the way women
00:33:10,00:33:15,"dressed in the 19th century, you'll see that people dress like this. And basically when people"
00:33:15,00:33:21,"started going into mines or diving and they started having this problem, it was around the same time"
00:33:21,00:33:26,"that the Grecian bend was a really fashionable way for women to dress. And so people said, wow,"
00:33:26,00:33:31,"you're, you're bending over like you're doing the Grecian bend. And that's why it's called the bends."
00:33:31,00:33:35,"Those women kind of enjoyed being made fun of though. Oh, they didn't care because it's fashion."
00:33:35,00:33:38,"Like, you don't care if you're fashionable, you don't give a fuck if people are saying,"
00:33:38,00:33:42,"oh, what an idiot. Look at you with your big, you know, Godzilla pants or whatever. You're like,"
00:33:42,00:33:47,"I don't care. These are fashionable, mate. Like, I don't know. I'd be sensitive to it."
00:33:47,00:33:51,If only those women had a way of disguising themselves as some sort of common bit of street
00:33:51,00:33:59,furniture. Just what we're talking about the bends. Did you guys read about John Scott Halden?
00:33:59,00:34:06,"Oh, what a guy. So this is, this is the person who started studying the idea of why you would get"
00:34:06,00:34:12,"the bends as you were coming up. And in 1905, he would tasked with trying to find this out. So"
00:34:12,00:34:16,Halden was a very famous scientist in his day. And actually just a quick bit of background
00:34:16,00:34:21,about this guy. He's someone who helped to create the gas mask that we had at the First World War
00:34:21,00:34:27,by literally going to the front line and finding the gases and diagnosing what they were and then
00:34:27,00:34:32,coming back and making the masks. He was someone who threw himself into experiments to make sure
00:34:32,00:34:37,"he could understand what was going on. In the case of decompression and working out the bends,"
00:34:37,00:34:41,"he was tasked with trying to do that. And he used groups of animals to begin with to try and do it,"
00:34:41,00:34:45,but they all weren't matching humans. So eventually he worked out the goats
00:34:45,00:34:50,"with a perfect match. They weren't quite perfect. It was like 1.7 goats would make up the human,"
00:34:50,00:34:56,"but they were close enough. And so he had 85 goats come to this one spot in London,"
00:34:56,00:35:01,and he would put them in these big chambers and then release them into the fields outside and
00:35:01,00:35:07,watch how they responded. And that's where they started learning about the stages of decompression.
00:35:07,00:35:13,So all these experiments eventually led to Halden working out what we still use today as the standard
00:35:13,00:35:18,decompression stages that you would use if you were a scuba diver still to this day. And it was
00:35:18,00:35:24,based on 85 goats. Just a little note on that. They then moved to live trials on humans and the
00:35:24,00:35:31,ship which they did live trials on was called HMS Spanker. Here's the thing about who might get
00:35:31,00:35:37,the bends sometimes. Scientists now think that ancient sea monsters also got the bends.
00:35:37,00:35:44,"So have you heard of a Mosasaur? It's like a dinosaur, but they were a different kind. They"
00:35:44,00:35:48,"lived in the sea. Like there are pterosaurs, which are those winged ones. It's dinosaur adjacent."
00:35:48,00:35:53,"So scientists have found fossilized vertebrae of Mosasaur, and they were about four or five"
00:35:53,00:35:59,"meters long, really big animals. But they found a strip of dead bone in an otherwise healthy bone."
00:35:59,00:36:03,"Now, I don't understand what that means because it's all obviously fossilized dead bone,"
00:36:03,00:36:07,but they somehow found a bit of the bone is different from the other bone. And they
00:36:07,00:36:12,think that decompression sickness is the only possible cause of why you would have that sudden
00:36:12,00:36:16,"layer all the way through the bone. Interestingly though, if they found the dead bone inside the"
00:36:16,00:36:21,"living bone, that suggests that they had the problem, but then they survived it because then"
00:36:21,00:36:26,"the living bone grew around it, doesn't it? They figured out the decompression stages thousands"
00:36:26,00:36:32,"of years before we did. Well, maybe. I feel like I've been tricked into saying that."
00:36:32,00:36:39,"I think dolphins get it as well, but have actually worked out the decompression stages,"
00:36:39,00:36:44,they believe. So people found something similar in dolphins that have been washed up on a beach
00:36:44,00:36:50,"recently, which was that they had little pockets of air in their blubber, which shows that they"
00:36:50,00:36:54,"obviously are suffering from something like the bends, like the air is accumulating,"
00:36:54,00:36:58,but it is thought that what they do is they come to the surface and if they feel like they've got
00:36:58,00:37:03,"the symptoms, then they dive back down again really deeply to sort of re-equalize and they"
00:37:03,00:37:07,"keep coming up and going down until they don't die, which is sort of how people used to do it"
00:37:07,00:37:12,before halding came along. I believe you just have to dive back down to the bottom and start again
00:37:12,00:37:18,"till it works. That must have been just the worst, wasn't it? When you're in so much pain,"
00:37:18,00:37:21,"they're like, ""Well, you're just going to have to go back down again, mate."" Oh, really?"
00:37:21,00:37:25,"That's what caused the problem in the first place. No, that's the way."
00:37:25,00:37:32,"It's so bad now, though, now that we do know. It's almost as bad if you're diving, right? There's"
00:37:32,00:37:37,"Egyptian diver called Ahmed Gaba, who beat the record for the deepest dive in 2014,"
00:37:37,00:37:45,dove 332.35 meters down. That took him 14 minutes to get to that depth. He then spent 13 and a half
00:37:45,00:37:48,hours getting back up to the surface decompressing along the way.
00:37:48,00:37:54,"When you're going down, if you see a nice shipwreck or a nice load of fish or something,"
00:37:54,00:37:58,"you just don't look at them. You just go down as quick, because otherwise,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,"you're spoiling the whole way back up, aren't you?"
00:38:00,00:38:03,You're right. You've got time on the way back for that title.
00:38:03,00:38:09,But don't they have chambers that you can... I remember watching an episode of Baywatch years
00:38:09,00:38:13,"ago where David Hasselhoff very bravely swam to the bottom of the ocean to save someone,"
00:38:13,00:38:17,"a scuba diver who was trapped, and then brought them right back up. The whole episode is basically"
00:38:17,00:38:22,"him inside a decompression chamber, back on the surface. Now, don't we have those? Can't you just"
00:38:22,00:38:27,"swim up and just get into a... Yeah, but it just is slightly more expensive to provide every amateur"
00:38:27,00:38:31,"diver with an entire decompression chamber. But you're right. For this guy, actually,"
00:38:31,00:38:34,you would have thought you're breaking a record. I agree. Stingy.
00:38:34,00:38:38,"But if you come back up, Dan, wouldn't David Hasselhoff have got the symptoms and then have"
00:38:38,00:38:43,to be put in a decompression chamber to kind of push... You'd have to get Hasselhoff into the
00:38:43,00:38:48,"chamber as quickly as possible, really. Yes. All the time, this nitrogen's trying to get"
00:38:48,00:38:53,"into your body. But if you could get back into pressure as quickly as possible, you might be"
00:38:53,00:38:57,"okay. Yeah. But I mean, that's a tough guy, because you don't want to rush him. He hates famously"
00:38:57,00:39:01,"being hassled, doesn't he? Oh, boy. Being hassled, though. But at the same time,"
00:39:01,00:39:05,Baywatch was a big show back then with a big budget. So they probably could afford one of these
00:39:05,00:39:10,"machines, unlike amateur divers on the lesser production. Home and Away probably couldn't"
00:39:10,00:39:16,afford that. That's why there are so few deep-sea diving plot lines in Home and Away.
00:39:16,00:39:19,"Well, there was that. Do you remember there was the whole nine months of when they were all coming"
00:39:19,00:39:27,"back to the surface? All you just saw, you just saw a flat bit of water with a few bubbles coming"
00:39:27,00:39:40,"up. The show was just called Away for that series, wasn't it? Okay, it's time for our final fact of"
00:39:40,00:39:46,"the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that in 18th century London, professional"
00:39:46,00:39:51,boxers would challenge opponents by publishing requests to fight in the letters columns of
00:39:51,00:39:58,newspapers. So I stumbled on this fact while reading a book called The London Monster by an
00:39:58,00:40:03,"old buddy of ours, John Bondeson, great historian, and has nothing to do with The London Monster,"
00:40:03,00:40:07,"which was all about a sort of precursor to Jack the Ripper. But in there, he was talking about"
00:40:07,00:40:12,interesting things that happened in newspapers at the time. And he mentioned that boxers would
00:40:12,00:40:18,"sort of publish challenges to each other, and they'd would tease opponents, and they would propose"
00:40:18,00:40:22,"fights and where and when and so on, and then would wait for a response to come through,"
00:40:22,00:40:27,"maybe in the next day's newspaper or the following days to say, yes, I accept. And then"
00:40:27,00:40:31,you would know a fight was on. Such a weird way to communicate with each other.
00:40:31,00:40:35,"Were they rude? Would they say, you know, I will be kicking your head in at three o'clock tomorrow?"
00:40:35,00:40:40,"Bondeson says polite, but he also says that they would often put in some barbs and teasers along"
00:40:40,00:40:45,"the way. I think sometimes it was quite insulting. I've read a few of these. There was one, for"
00:40:45,00:40:52,"instance, this was the first ever, I think, really professional fight between two women in the UK."
00:40:52,00:40:58,It was Elizabeth Wilkinson versus Hannah Highfield. And Elizabeth Wilkinson put an
00:40:58,00:41:02,"advertisement in the newspaper saying, I, Elizabeth Wilkinson of Clark and Well,"
00:41:02,00:41:08,having had some words with Hannah Highfield and requiring satisfaction to invite her to
00:41:08,00:41:12,"meet me on the stage and box me. That sounds quite polite. It's quite polite. But maybe for the day,"
00:41:12,00:41:17,"it was a bit unpolite, right? Because there was another one. She was fighting someone called"
00:41:17,00:41:22,"Anne Field, who was an ass driver from Stoke, Newington. And she said in that one, yeah."
00:41:22,00:41:29,"An ass driver? An ass driver. You know what an ass driver is. So like, let's say you've got a donkey"
00:41:29,00:41:35,driver. Yeah. So someone who has a load of asses and wants to get them to market and so has a stick
00:41:35,00:41:38,and kind of walks into market and hits them and makes sure they go in the right direction.
00:41:38,00:41:43,Cool. It just took me a while to put donkey in the meaning when you said ass driver.
00:41:43,00:41:48,That's where I got confused. Yeah. She was trying to get a fight with this
00:41:48,00:41:54,"ass driver from Stoke, Newington called Anne Field. And she told anyone who read the newspaper that"
00:41:54,00:41:59,the blows which I shall present her with will be more difficult for her to digest than any she
00:41:59,00:42:06,"has ever given her asses. Yeah. So, you know, that slam does work better when you say asses"
00:42:06,00:42:10,"instead of donkeys. Well, exactly. It's just an implication of kicking your ass that you need."
00:42:10,00:42:14,That's what she should have said. I'm going to kick you and then I'm going to kick your ass.
00:42:14,00:42:21,"Yeah. Apparently, the Elizabeth, who was one of the people in that fight, she also used to have"
00:42:21,00:42:26,couples fights a bit like couples nights. But when you would have couples would be pitched against
00:42:26,00:42:31,"each other, which sounds quite fun. So cool. But it was mixed doubles, wasn't it? So it was,"
00:42:31,00:42:35,"I think it was men fighting men while the women fight the women. It was very, I don't think it"
00:42:35,00:42:39,"ever happened that men would fight women in the same. It's that's not really like mixed doubles,"
00:42:39,00:42:44,"because in mixed doubles, the man can serve to the woman, right? It's not like you don't just hit"
00:42:44,00:42:50,"it to the man or the woman hits it to the women. So it's like, yeah. I would watch a mixed doubles"
00:42:50,00:42:54,where there were two balls in play at the same time and it can only go between the same sex.
00:42:54,00:43:00,"Yeah. So hang on. She was called Stokes, right? Is it Elizabeth?"
00:43:00,00:43:05,"She's called Elizabeth Wilkinson, also Elizabeth Stokes, because she got married halfway through"
00:43:05,00:43:10,"her career. But she was a... Ney one, Ney Stokes or Ney Wilkinson? I didn't want to say which one"
00:43:10,00:43:16,"was Ney, because I couldn't know. The donkey was the Ney, probably. It was the Bray. But yeah, they"
00:43:16,00:43:22,were like almost professional boxers. And the way that they told the difference between a professional
00:43:22,00:43:28,and a non-professional was that they wouldn't fight topless. So you would have like prostitutes
00:43:28,00:43:33,doing fights where they were all topless. And this would be like a way of making money because
00:43:33,00:43:36,they would get lots of people to watch them and people would bet on it and they would bake money
00:43:36,00:43:41,"and stuff. Whereas these people like Elizabeth Wilkinson, they were more proper boxers, really."
00:43:41,00:43:46,Yeah. I read a description of those more bawdy crazy fights that would happen in the streets.
00:43:46,00:43:52,Yeah. So there was a guy called William Hickey. He wrote about it. He saw a fight in a tavern
00:43:52,00:43:57,in Drury Lane in 1768. And his description of it was the whole room was in uproar. Men and women
00:43:57,00:44:02,"promiscuously mounted upon chairs, tables and benches in order to see a sort of general conflict"
00:44:02,00:44:07,"carried upon the floor. Two she-devils, for they scarce had a human appearance, were engaged in"
00:44:07,00:44:13,"a scratching and boxing match. Their faces entirely covered with blood, bosoms bare, and the clothes"
00:44:13,00:44:17,"nearly torn from their bodies. For several minutes, not a creature interfered between them or seemed"
00:44:17,00:44:22,"to care a straw of what mischief they might do to each other. And this used to happen a lot,"
00:44:22,00:44:28,"apparently, these fights that were going on. But women fighting was a thing that Elizabeth"
00:44:28,00:44:32,"Wilkinson was desperately trying to make normal, because you would almost think that"
00:44:32,00:44:37,"female professional boxing was not a thing back then. But actually, it started in 1722,"
00:44:37,00:44:42,"and it was very popular. And it was not only seen as let's beat each other up, but let's try and"
00:44:42,00:44:48,"empower women. It was a real movement. They even tried to, at the arenas, which would usually be"
00:44:48,00:44:52,"the bear gardens in London, where you would usually go to see a bear fighting a monkey,"
00:44:52,00:44:56,which was a massively popular thing back in the day. They even tried to set up galleries
00:44:56,00:45:01,"where women could go and watch it. So the upper class women could come and see it and say, ""Oh,"
00:45:01,00:45:05,"this is a womanly thing, as well as a male thing."" Wait, so women could go and watch the"
00:45:05,00:45:10,"bears fighting their monkeys, or the women fighting the women? Could any bears and monkeys go and"
00:45:10,00:45:14,watch the bears fighting the monkeys? I think there was a glass bears and monkeys.
00:45:14,00:45:20,"All right, okay. Lord Byron's bear would have gone and say it. I think Stokes had an amphitheatre"
00:45:20,00:45:23,"later in life, as then she must have been really successful, because I think she and her husband"
00:45:23,00:45:27,"ran a boxing theatre. Because I read an advert for it, which advertised that there would be bull,"
00:45:27,00:45:32,"bear, and ass baiting. But also- Sorry, is that like donkey baiting? Is that-"
00:45:32,00:45:39,"That is donkey baiting. Yes. Donkey baiting sounds even more rude, doesn't it? The farmer was caught"
00:45:39,00:45:46,"donkey baiting. But the final event, or I don't know if it's the final event, it's the words of"
00:45:46,00:45:52,"the advert say, ""A dog will be dressed up with fireworks to augment the diversion of the spectators."""
00:45:52,00:45:58,"I mean, it sounds unbelievably cruel. Yeah. We touched on this in our vinyl when we released a"
00:45:58,00:46:02,"vinyl. I think it was James. James's fact, I think, was about fireworks. I went boxing."
00:46:02,00:46:07,"Yeah. Oh, yeah. But you're not going to hear anything else. This is a bit like one of those"
00:46:07,00:46:12,porn sites where you give a 30-second teaser and then you cut them off. You can't know anything
00:46:12,00:46:18,"else about that fact unless you buy the vinyl. Yeah. Or like a trailer for a double movie,"
00:46:18,00:46:23,"a bit like that as well. It's like lots of things. If you want to go high, brah."
00:46:23,00:46:31,Feels like a very pent-up episode of the podcast. We've been in our houses for almost a whole year.
00:46:33,00:46:37,We all need to go away and have a bottle of whiskey each. We should say that it was all
00:46:37,00:46:42,"illegal, right? We keep saying professional boxing, but until quite late, it was all kind"
00:46:42,00:46:45,of illegal even though it happened all over the place. I think the main way you can make a living
00:46:45,00:46:50,"from it was in boxing booths, which I didn't really know about, which is odd because they"
00:46:50,00:46:57,"lasted until the 1970s. And of course, you were born in 1940, Anna, so it's really weird that you"
00:46:57,00:47:02,"weren't there for them. Yeah. Well, they sound fun. These came about in the 1700s and it was a way"
00:47:02,00:47:07,"that boxers, sort of professional, even though it was illegal, would travel around with fairs"
00:47:07,00:47:12,"and anyone who attended the fair would challenge the boxer to a fight. Now, I don't know why anyone"
00:47:12,00:47:15,did this because that's a professional boxer inside the booth and you're just a pleb. But
00:47:15,00:47:22,that's what they did. And you pay a bit of money to do that or to see it. And I think the famous
00:47:22,00:47:29,one was Tom Hickman. He was in the 1820s and he was known as the Gaslight Man because he
00:47:29,00:47:35,told everyone he won when he hadn't actually won. I'm the champion of the world.
00:47:35,00:47:45,"He put your lights out. Oh, very good. Yeah. But actually, boxing booths, the reason that"
00:47:45,00:47:51,"there's a more relevant association with them in the modern day is that in the 1930s,"
00:47:51,00:47:56,"there was a miner who lasted three rounds in a boxing booth with a professional boxer,"
00:47:56,00:48:01,"and so he won a bit of money, used that money to buy a wedding ring for the women he fancied,"
00:48:01,00:48:08,"and they had two sons, Bobby and Jack, and surname Charlton. So without boxing booths,"
00:48:08,00:48:14,"to credit another spurious link, without boxing booths, England would not have won the World Cup."
00:48:14,00:48:18,It's no wine guard connection. I don't think he would have put that in his book.
00:48:19,00:48:25,"Just on betting on whether you could beat boxers, there was one quite weird trick, which was"
00:48:25,00:48:30,"round turn of the 20th century in Texas. There would be a circus would come into town,"
00:48:30,00:48:36,and there would be a woman outside the tent promising $50 to any man who could stay three
00:48:36,00:48:41,"rounds in a boxing ring with her, and then people would go, ""Yeah, no problem,"" and they pay their"
00:48:41,00:48:46,"$5, and then they'd walk into the tent, were very conveniently, all the lights were extremely dim,"
00:48:46,00:48:51,"and you couldn't really see what was going on, and then found themselves in the ring with a"
00:48:51,00:48:56,"mailboxer wearing a dress, who would beat the crap out of them."
00:48:56,00:49:01,"Right. I thought you were going to say that the lights were all extinguished,"
00:49:01,00:49:06,"but she'd been eating carrots from a very young age, so you could see them brilliantly in the dark."
00:49:06,00:49:12,Wow. Have you guys heard of Daniel Mendoza? I'm sure he came across him in your reading.
00:49:12,00:49:14,He was one of the big… Don't recall the name. No.
00:49:14,00:49:22,"He was really famous for his style of boxing. He basically, he was five foot seven, he was"
00:49:22,00:49:26,"about 70 kilos. He was relatively, he was a sort of middleweight rather than a heavyweight,"
00:49:26,00:49:32,"but he was still a champion boxer despite that, and I've read that he basically came up with"
00:49:32,00:49:39,"the idea of avoiding being punched. Before that, you just sort of take the hits and hope that you"
00:49:39,00:49:43,"could hit the other guy harder, and he came up with a style of moving and basically avoiding"
00:49:43,00:49:49,"being hit really hard. That sort of revolutionized boxing. Yeah. And he was really, really tough."
00:49:49,00:49:53,"He wrote his memoirs later in life. He wrote in his memoirs, he was so tough that he once"
00:49:53,00:49:59,"got in three fights on his way to a boxing match, because he was so angry. Firstly,"
00:49:59,00:50:03,"someone cut him up in a carriage, so he got in a fight with them. Then a shopkeeper tried to"
00:50:03,00:50:08,"cheat him, allegedly, and then third, someone just looked at him in a funny way, and so he arrived"
00:50:08,00:50:12,at the boxing match. He sounds lovely. I don't know if you can claim you're so tough if you've
00:50:12,00:50:17,invented the tactic of avoiding being punched. I think he was compensating with that story.
00:50:17,00:50:25,"I was reading about one very famous fight between Bob Fitzsimmons and Jack Sharkey,"
00:50:25,00:50:30,"and this had been organized by William Randolph Hearst, who was the newspaper magnate."
00:50:30,00:50:36,"These two were the biggest boxes of the day. This was going to be a huge, huge fight. The amount"
00:50:36,00:50:41,of money they could win was going to be huge. There was so much gambling on it and everything.
00:50:41,00:50:45,"Then halfway through the fight, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey a low blow,"
00:50:45,00:50:51,"and according to the Associated Press, it left Sharkey lying on the canvas, unable to move his"
00:50:51,00:50:57,"legs, though he clutched spasmodically at his groin with his gloved hand. So he's basically"
00:50:57,00:51:01,"can't carry on because he's been hit below the belt, and it was a really obvious shot."
00:51:01,00:51:06,But the referee apparently didn't see it because we think William Randolph Hearst had
00:51:06,00:51:13,"bet $20,000 on Sharkey to win, and the referee happened to be a friend of his whose name was"
00:51:13,00:51:20,Wyatt Earp. No. The famous Wyatt Earp. Yeah. The Wyatt Earp. The Wyatt Earp actually worked as
00:51:20,00:51:24,"a bodyguard for William Randolph Hearst, and he was like, well, we're going to need someone to"
00:51:24,00:51:30,referee this match who's going to help me to win all my cash with the betting thing.
00:51:30,00:51:34,And so he got Wyatt Earp to be the referee for the match. I'm really shocked because I
00:51:34,00:51:39,thought Wyatt Earp was a good sort of upstanding lawman. I know. Clearly not.
00:51:39,00:51:45,But wasn't that a thing that followed him around more so than the gun battle at the OK Corral?
00:51:45,00:51:51,"It was it was in his obituary. It was sort of he became a byword for if you did something dodgy,"
00:51:51,00:51:55,"you were pulling an Earp or something like that. Yeah, it became like a humongous"
00:51:55,00:52:02,"cause celebra of him being the biggest cheat of all time. And yeah, really, it spoiled his reputation"
00:52:02,00:52:07,"as if that could happen. But yeah, so funny. It used to not be illegal, though, to hit someone"
00:52:07,00:52:11,"or certainly to grab them below the waist. It used to be just, you know, if that's boxing,"
00:52:11,00:52:16,"you could hit people when they were down. That was just not against the rules. I was really,"
00:52:16,00:52:20,"really rough until about the mid 18th century. That's UFC, isn't it? I guess hitting people"
00:52:20,00:52:26,"while they're down. It pretty much is. And, you know, gouging and all sorts of vicious practices"
00:52:26,00:52:31,were just allowed until this guy Jack Broughton came along and he devised the Broughton's rules.
00:52:31,00:52:34,"Some people say it's after he accidentally killed the opponent in the ring. He said,"
00:52:34,00:52:38,"""Maybe we should professionalize this."" And I think that's when gloves were introduced."
00:52:38,00:52:44,"I did read that with Broughton, who actually codified the first boxing rules in 1743. It was"
00:52:44,00:52:48,"actually the case that in most fights, you didn't kick people when they were down. It all punched"
00:52:48,00:52:52,"them when they were down or attacked them when they were down, even though it hadn't been codified."
00:52:52,00:52:57,"But the way that the rules upheld was just by the masses. And so in reports, you'd have,"
00:52:57,00:53:02,"instead of an umpire, this massive crowd around them. And I think in 1726, someone recorded,"
00:53:02,00:53:08,"for instance, that laws were very strictly observed. Because basically, if you didn't obey"
00:53:08,00:53:13,"the unofficial rules, then the entire mob of baying people descended on you and attacked you."
00:53:14,00:53:18,"Well, that's a good way of doing it, isn't it? It's a good way of refereeing a match, yeah."
00:53:18,00:53:27,I got something on modern day boxing. Did you know that there is only one professional male
00:53:27,00:53:35,"boxer in Iceland? Oh, come on. Is that true? Yeah, absolutely true. Wow. He's undefeated in his home"
00:53:35,00:53:41,"nation, isn't he? Which is great. So professional boxing got banned in Iceland, something like 64"
00:53:41,00:53:46,years ago. It's been banned. And so no one has ever done it professionally. But this one guy
00:53:46,00:53:51,"called Colbyn Christensen, he's the only person that has taken it on. And he goes internationally"
00:53:51,00:53:56,to fight people. And he's finding it really hard because he's got no funding. There's only about
00:53:56,00:54:02,"four boxing rings that are in Iceland. How? Wait, wait. How? Yeah. How are the four boxing"
00:54:02,00:54:07,"rings in Iceland? They're handovers. They're handovers. Yeah, but you've got four times more"
00:54:07,00:54:12,boxing rings than you have boxes. He can't find it hard to ring up and get a booking at any of them.
00:54:12,00:54:18,How's your schedule looking? But it only allows amateur boxing. So no one's doing it. No one's
00:54:18,00:54:24,professional. He's doing it professionally. He's setting up matches overseas. He's going to Berlin.
00:54:24,00:54:29,"He's got coaches that he's trying to get. He's having to fund his own matches, which he loses."
00:54:29,00:54:36,"He's not very good. So he's been losing the matches. So he's broke. And yeah, so he's, and he finally"
00:54:36,00:54:42,"was getting on to a roll because he signed up with the trainer of Tyson Fury, who's been looking"
00:54:42,00:54:47,"after him, suddenly getting into it. And he's now gone pro and he's winning all his matches."
00:54:47,00:54:51,And then COVID hit. So he's had to go back to Iceland and just be the only professional boxer
00:54:51,00:54:55,"with no one to punch. Can I just say, what's the name of this guy? Kolbein Christensen. Okay,"
00:54:55,00:55:00,"I just want to say, Mr. Christensen, if you're listening, that dad thinks that you're shit."
00:55:00,00:55:06,But I think you're probably an extremely talented boxer who deserves respect. So if you're
00:55:06,00:55:11,"reading the letters pages of the Icelandic news, you'll see a polite invitation."
00:55:11,00:55:19,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like to"
00:55:19,00:55:23,"get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,"
00:55:23,00:55:28,"we can be found on our Twitter account. I'm on at Shriverland, James. At James Harkin."
00:55:28,00:55:35,"Andy. At Andrew Hunter M. And Anna. You can email podcast@qi.com. Yep, or you can go to our"
00:55:35,00:55:40,"group account, which is at no such thing or our website. No such thing as a fish.com. We've got"
00:55:40,00:55:44,all of our previous episodes up there. There's also links to bits of merchandise that we released
00:55:44,00:55:49,"over the year, like a vinyl. Why not check that out? Anyway, we're going to be back again next week"
00:55:49,00:56:04,with another episode. We'll see you then. Goodbye.
00:56:04,00:56:11,Bye.
