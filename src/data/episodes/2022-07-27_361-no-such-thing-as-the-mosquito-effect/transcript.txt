 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with
 Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
 order here we go. Starting with you, James. Okay, my fact this week is there is only one
 mosquito in Iceland. Poor lonely mosquito. How'd it get there? Well, we think it maybe came over
 from Greenland on a plane. Right. Because it was found in the 80s by a guy called Professor
 Gisleymar Gislesen from the University of Iceland and I wrote to Professor Gislesen and he wrote back
 and he said he boarded a flight at Keflavik Airport in 1986 in June and the plane had come over from
 Greenland and it was making a stop in Iceland and it was going to Germany and he was walking down the
 passenger cabin and he saw this mosquito and he thought what's that doing here and he's like
 I need to catch that mosquito and so he legged it along the aisle chasing this mosquito and he
 managed to grab it and then he was going to work at Karlsruhe at the University for three months
 but he had this mosquito and he knew it had to go to Iceland so he kept it for three months.
 Had he killed it by this point? It was dead. I think it probably died when he grabbed it
 so he then kept it in his room in this University for three months and then when he came back to
 Iceland he gave the specimen to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History. They put it in
 some alcohol and they kept it behind the scenes as this one Icelandic mosquito but and this is
 where it takes a Dan Brown kind of twist. In 2016 the New York Times interviewed him and asked him
 about the single mosquito and they went to look for it in the Institute of Natural History and
 they can't find it. So we know that it exists. We know it's in Iceland somewhere but we don't
 know exactly where it is. It's probably in the drawer somewhere but we don't know where it is.
 I think the real story here is this guy's eyesight. If you're walking along the aisle of a plane
 and he spots at a distance a mosquito, he calls it as a mosquito not just a fly.
 Exactly. This guy, he smashed it, he's like yeah I know a mosquito when I see one.
 But I don't get it because the mosquito was on a connecting flight to Germany
 and still went to Germany where they have mosquitoes. So is it because it had landed
 initially in Iceland that he thought that counts? I think it definitely it counts because it's in
 certainly an Icelandic airspace isn't it? It was in Keflavik Airport. So I've been like you know
 when you do this where you count all the countries in the world that you've been to I do that sometimes
 to try and beat my wife and the way that I beat her is by counting countries where literally we
 just landed and then we took off again and I never got off the plane like Bangladesh.
 I went to Bangladesh and I should just stop there. I'd never got off the plane but I count that as
 going to the country. So I think this mosquito should do the same. Do you think this mosquito had
 one of those scratch maps and you just rub off into your country every time you go?
 I'd love to see James your Bangladesh photo album just all shots of the inside of the plane.
 Are we sure the mosquito wasn't someone's emotional support animal?
 A really good point. It's ruined their trip completely.
 Yeah but the thing is there aren't any mosquitoes in Iceland and it's one of the very few countries
 where there aren't any. Pretty much every other country in the world has them and that includes
 Greenland which is colder and it includes other countries like in a similar area to Iceland such
 as Great Britain and things like that. You know all these places have got mosquitoes but Iceland
 doesn't and the reason is that they are cold but they're not always cold. They have lots of changes
 of climate all the time and so it gets really cold and then it gets kind of not too cold and
 then it gets really cold again and stuff and the changes are so rapid that mosquitoes don't have
 time to complete their life cycle because they have a particular life cycle whereas in Greenland
 it's much colder but then they do have areas that are a more steady climate and they can
 survive in places like that. Yeah in Greenland they're massive aren't they?
 As in they're massive in size Anna. They're a huge in size and reputation. I think they are
 particularly big. I mean they herd deer that's how impressive they are. They herd caribou in
 Greenland but they don't really do it deliberately so they're particularly vicious ones apparently
 because they don't have access to that much blood so there was one researcher who said
 only about 15% ever get a blood meal and they need a blood meal to survive the females do
 and so they're super vicious and they harass caribou and if a caribou baby gets attacked by a
 load of mozzies it can kill it but the adults they see the mozzies and they run away and actually
 apparently this is quite useful because mosquito harassment are red is a big factor in making
 sure caribou don't overgraze. They just move them along to stop them overgrazing the land.
 Apparently they run to the top of glaciers. They have to go that far to avoid mosquitoes chasing
 them. Wow it's quite shaming when you're that big. It's like an elephant in a mouse.
 I hadn't realised up until researching this fact how dangerous they have been. A few numbers have
 been crunched together and they believe that 52 billion humans nearly half of all of us have
 ever lived have been killed by mosquitoes. Half of all humans ever.
 I'm unclear but I think that that might be a useful misconception to debunk because I think
 that estimate is often stated but I was reading a thing that actually crunched the numbers
 and it was basically saying maximum it's probably only about 7% of the population.
 That's still a lot. It's a hell of a lot. It's many billion but I don't know. No one really knows
 where that original estimate came from so it may have been someone who was doing some better number
 crunching. What the place I was reading about this was in a book called The Mosquito, a human
 history of our deadliest predator by a guy called Timothy C. Weingard and to be fair,
 as awesome as the book sounds and as awesome as he is, he does say a few things that make you think
 I think you're giving the mosquito a bit more credit than it deserves. Well he also says the
 extinction of the dinosaurs is down to the mosquitoes. Now obviously we've all heard the
 famous story about the asteroid hitting the earth but he says up until that moment 70%
 of regional dinosaurs had been made extinct by mosquitoes and they probably would have taken
 out the rest but the pesky asteroid got in their way. The asteroid just finished the job the mosquito
 had started. Is that what he's saying? Took the credit yeah. It's like the Americans swooping in
 at the end of the war. He's been plugging away for six years. Yeah they are bastards. They kill
 a hell of a lot of us and they've got so many different ways of doing it and I hadn't quite
 realized how recently it was that we realized that certain diseases were spread by mosquitoes.
 So it was really the turn of the 20th century. Yellow fever but in humans thousands of years,
 3,000 years at least and only in 1900 did people put it together that that was mosquitoes.
 We used to think that mixomatosis was caused by mosquitoes but that was proved not true in the
 60s and it was found not to be true by this amazing entomologist called Dame Miriam Rothschild
 and she basically worked out that it was fleas that did it and she did that by just carrying
 plastic bags full of fleas around with her in a bedroom in her house. She had just had all these
 fleas around and she worked out the life cycle of the flea and then she worked out that it was
 controlled by the sex hormone of rabbits which would let it finish its life cycle and that's
 where the mixomatosis came from in the rabbits. But she was amazing. She worked in the enigma
 project at Bletchley Park during the war. She had a lab in Plymouth with all of her fleas and stuff
 and it got bombed and she lost seven years of work. You're going to say she lost seven fleas?
 They don't mention that much when they do the statistics in the war do they? The seven fleas
 that were lost? In 1952 she wrote a book called Fleas, Flux and Cuckoos which she started writing
 while pregnant and marooned in the channel due to a storm living off a diet of boiled potatoes
 and all she had was a pen and a piece of paper and some boiled potatoes and so she ate the
 potatoes and started writing her book and her later book which is called An Atlas of Insect
 Tissue which came out in the 80s on the jacket illustration. It has the close-up illustration
 of the vagina of a flea which she claimed made it unique in the publishing world.
 It's the only book with the vagina of a flea on the front cover. Yep, seems likely.
 How is she stranded in the channel? What's happened there? She was on a boat going either
 from the UK to Europe or the other way around and there was a storm and they couldn't go to part.
 And was it stranded for so long that they were reduced to living off potatoes? You know, people
 are reduced to living off certain things when they've been out for weeks. It's true. It feels
 like she was looking for a great origin story for her book. I thought, this is finally a cool
 enough circumstance. Someone's just brought around the potatoes. It's true. I mean, it does sound like
 one meal, doesn't it? It sounds like a way to brought around chips on the ferry because they
 were refuelling. Do you know another thing that mosquitoes are responsible for that we can thank
 them for is the creation of Great Britain? Yeah. Now, this is according to Timothy C. Weingard,
 for Human History of Our Deadliest Predator. Okay. He says that in 1698, Scotland was attempting to
 colonize the Americas and really set themselves up. So they sent out five ships and these ships
 got to Panama and the mosquitoes of Panama gave them all malaria and so on. They got really,
 really sick and it turned into a huge financial crisis. So England stepped in, offered to pay
 the Scottish debt and in doing so, Scotland had to forfeit sovereignty and that was when
 they united with England. Thus, mosquitoes created Great Britain. In fairness to your guide,
 that one is pretty much true. I'm pretty certain that's true. The Scots, what they were trying to do
 is like, all the colonial powers around the world like Spain and Portugal and England were all going
 around finding these countries to subjugate and take over and the Scots thought we're going to
 get in on that and they decided to go to this place called Darien, not realizing that it was
 just full of midges of mosquitoes. And I think there was like some con man who'd gone to Edinburgh,
 telling everyone that it was this amazing, was it called Gregor McGregor or something?
 And he told everyone that this amazing place that they could all go and live and stuff and
 it was just a complete swamp. Such a good story. It's actually really unpleasant for mosquitoes
 feeding off our blood. I know it's quite unpleasant for us as well, but it's really hot
 because they're insects. They actually don't have such good thermoregulation as we do.
 And so when they feed off our blood, which is obviously at our warm, blooded body temperature,
 they get boiling hot. And the only way that they survive it is by urinating all over themselves
 as they do it and kind of bleeding on their buns. Really? Yeah. So wait a minute. So the food is too
 hot. Yeah. So you got some hot soup and instead of blowing on the soup, you urinate over your whole
 body. It's another option, James, just next time you're at a dinner party. It's worth trying.
 And it looks cool. You should look it up. So scientists are really confused about why they
 waste fresh blood. They'll drink your blood and then you'll see a little droplet of blood
 sprouting out of their anus. And they obviously haven't got the nutrients out of it. And that's
 because it's getting so hot that they need to excrete some of that liquid so that it evaporates
 off them and carries the heat away. It's a bit of a shameful experience. If you're a mosquito
 researcher, do you know how you get mosquitoes to mate with each other? It's very sexy stuff.
 What you have to do, you start off by decapitating the male and then you have to anaesthetize the
 female. Right. And then you have to grab the male and insert his still-presuding genitals into the
 female and then they will lock together and sperm will be transferred between the two and the female
 will become pregnant. And some people can do that without a microscope. What? How do they be
 decapitated? Do they have like a tiny little guillotine? They have to put it through a show
 trial first, though. Also, how come the female's the one that gets the anaesthetic? Isn't the male
 there going, "I think sodding decapitated. She's the only anaesthetic." Yeah, it's a good point.
 It's really messed up. I know. It feels like there's a lot going on there where really the
 only important bit is you get the male genitals and you put them inside the female.
 I don't know why you have to decapitate the male. That's what I think I really don't get.
 Feels like a lot of that stuff is being done for fun by the researchers.
 We found out a new way of transporting mosquitoes because this is quite important. So let's say
 you've got a load of mosquitoes that are sterile and you want to put them in an area where they
 have disease problems like malaria or Zika or something and you put the sterile ones in there
 and they can outperform the non-sterile ones and then it hopefully stops them from hurting humans.
 But how do you get them from A to B? Because mosquitoes, they don't really go on really
 long flights unless they get on the IS192 from Gotthav to Keflavik, they do. But normally,
 they only go about 100 meters from where they were born. So we need to get them from one place to
 another. A load of researchers have found out that the best way to do it is to squish as many as you
 can in a little vial because it turns out they're not that fussed about it and they stay alive.
 Whereas if you put fewer of them in the vial, then they might bash around and stuff like that and
 they might not survive. Whereas if you put something like 1,200 mosquitoes in the space of a teaspoon,
 is what I'm talking about, 240 mosquitoes per cubic centimeter and you squish them all right down,
 they have this kind of exoskeleton that can almost fill in all the gaps and so there's no gaps in
 between them all, which means they can't wriggle around, they can't hurt themselves and only maybe
 the ones at the very top and the very bottom would get injured and the rest of them when you let them
 free, they're okay. Nice. It's like a jigsaw. Like a jigsaw, yeah. Or getting the London Underground,
 I've definitely been in a situation where I've seen jigsaw positions. But it definitely is,
 I thought it was like the London Underground because I remember feeling safe when there are so
 many people you don't need to hang onto the railings, right? Because you're just all sweaty in time
 against each other, no one can fall. That's why you always went on the tube with 12 really buff
 bodyguards that you are, who just kind of gathered around you. Yeah, it's very expensive catching
 the tube, actually. I mean, to pay those salaries. Did you guys know that mosquitoes are responsible
 for the Magna Carta? Is this another review? Done. According to Timothy C. Winegard, author of the
 Mosquito, A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator, he says that Louis the Seventh Siege of Damascus
 was during a malaria season in 1148. The downfall of that, the fact that it couldn't happen, led to
 his separation from Eleanor of Aquitaine. And that led to her marrying Henry II of England,
 which then led to the birth of King John, who was then having all those battles with his barons
 that led to the Magna Carta. So really, mosquitoes, again, have shaped history in ways we've not
 given them credit for. All right, then, if we're doing tenuous things that we can thank mosquitoes
 for, we can also thank them for gin and tonic, which I think there may be one fewer connection
 here. Gin, its reputation was ruined, start of the 19th century, because, you know, all the like,
 the scummy gin houses, and it was making people behave very badly. And then it became a bit of a
 heroic drink, because this was round about the time that the Brits were colonising India, and
 they realised that the only way to stave off malaria was with quinine. And so they started
 making tonic water with loads and loads of quinine. And so quinine became this great heroic drink,
 because it was saving the British colonisers in India from getting malaria, and it was brought
 home. They chucked it in gin, and suddenly gin went from being a scourge on society to being a
 patriotic thing to drink when you paired it with tonic water. And thus, the gin and tonic was born.
 They also spread Christianity bizarre.
 Dan, you've got to stop reading Timothy C. Weingard.
 Listen, I'm telling you, the mosquito, a human history of our deadliest predator,
 is fascinating. According to Timothy C. Weingard, it's because people were dying of malaria that
 people who were pushing the Christian faith were going out to help the sick. And in helping the
 sick, they were able to spread the message more. So malaria was leading to actually a huge burst
 of advertisement. So if people were dying of other stuff, then the Christians would have gone,
 "No, fuck it. If it's not mosquito related, I'm not interested." Exactly. Could have been a very
 different world. But once again, the mosquito has forced the course of history that we've ended on.
 Yeah, they shouldn't call it the butterfly effect, should they? They should call it the mosquito effect.
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.
 My fact is that in the early 20th century, Japan had secret propaganda underwear,
 which you would only show to your close friends or family.
 Okay. Wow. So this is a kind of clothing. They were common in Japan in the early 20th century.
 Basically, there are a kind of kimono. There are lots of different kinds of kimono and also
 lots of different things to do with kimono. So there are under kimonos. There are Miyamira kimono,
 which are kind of swaddling kimonos for babies, all sorts of kimonos. And around about 1900,
 Japan started producing various artisans, started making really stunning modern kimono prints,
 which were Art Deco, and they were Cubist, and they had all sorts of beautiful,
 modern patterns on them. And they had cities and ocean liners and skyscrapers and trains and planes
 and everything. And they were secret because you wouldn't obviously be flashing your undergarments,
 or the linings at people, unless it was to people you knew quite well.
 But yeah, to be honest, we probably had known each other three or four months before you started
 flashing your undergarments at me. Exactly. You got into what I call the inner circle.
 Well, I wish you had gotten that. Those things sound not propaganda though. You know, it seems
 harsh. If you're brandishing some Art Deco, that's all like artistic expression. I think it's more
 what we call it, isn't it? That's like the term that people call it propaganda kimonos.
 They did make a slight twist into more outright propaganda territory when the government became
 a bit more militaristic and a bit more fascistic as well. So you could get Mussolini underpants as
 well, or under kimonos as well. Really? Yeah, yeah. They had Hitler ones too, anti-aircraft guns
 on your under kimonos. So yeah, it did go in that direction. They're seen as slightly embarrassing
 now, but they didn't start out that way. I bought some pants in Japan once, but they were Godzilla
 on them. So that's not the same thing as it. Well, they were just still slightly embarrassing.
 These ones, these propaganda ones you were mentioning, Andy, the really interesting one was
 the one that was made for kids that you mentioned, the Mayamari. That was made for infants that were
 going to a Shinto shrine for the first time to be blessed. And when they were doing the propaganda
 ones, they were quite full on. They had soldiers preparing to dash through a field of exploding
 shells and children on the garment sleeve. So it was all about children in war, largely when
 you saw these things. It was really pushing the idea that kids should be believing in battle as
 well. Yeah, it definitely went a bit in Goebbels direction, didn't it? They were very much trying
 to suck up to the fascists at one point of their underwear making industry. And there is some
 shame attached to it now. This is what I thought was really interesting about the article that you
 sent around, Andy, which I think was an Atlas Obscura piece, was the woman who first revealed it,
 was this woman called Jacqueline Atkins, who I partly liked that she was a full bright scholar
 in Japanese textiles, which I didn't realise they did full bright scholarships in. But
 she tracked them down. She went to Japan and she started seeing these propaganda,
 slightly fascistic kimonos. And she asked people about them and they wouldn't tell her anything.
 And she found this woman who had a collection and she really didn't want to speak to her because
 you know, she was like, it's really embarrassing. My family don't know that I have these. No one
 knows. There's no written records of them. The history has been really suppressed because,
 you know, it was very militaristic, putting pictures of fighting children on
 children's underwear. But yeah, so it's only come out recently, hasn't it? This whole thing.
 I love that the kimono itself roughly translate as "thing to wear". It hasn't got just such a
 random and even these propaganda ones that were designed, they were called "omoshi-rogaras" and
 "omoshi-rogara" just means interesting or amusing design. So just "thing to wear" with
 interesting or amusing design. But these days, like, to get a really good kimono,
 they're unbelievably expensive. We went to a kimono shop when we're in Japan and tried to buy
 one thinking that it would be expensive but not that expensive. And they brought you in the shop
 like, you know, you're in a car showroom and they showed you all of these amazing prints and stuff
 and then only at the end told you it was going to be like 20 grand for one of these kimonos.
 I know. And like, you know, you can get them for all different price ranges but if you go to
 these specialist shops, that can be the amount. They're so expensive.
 Were you like, you were trying to leave the shop but you didn't want to seem like you didn't have
 the money so you bought something anyway and just went, "God, you know, I'll just go for those Godzilla
 underpants". How much? Five grand?
 They are really artisan there, aren't they? The people who are designing them. There's one
 family that has been making kimonos and still to this day. And I think they're the last surviving
 of the sort of historical makers of it. So they're called Chiso and they were set up in 1555
 and it was initially set up by a guy who was making it for some monks. And all these four
 centuries later, they are still making it with the same family. It's a descendants of the same
 family. It's like the pastor we were talking about the other week of just it being handed down.
 It's a company that has over 600 people designing these things and putting them together.
 Yet still, they only make 25 kimonos a year. That's how precious and time consuming and
 dedicated it is. Yeah. They're slow, aren't they? They're slow at making them. I'm sure it's a very
 difficult process. But they say a standard kimono takes three to four months. This is just this
 company. But it's not unusual for it to be a year and a half for one kimono. So if you're thinking
 emergency for the party at the weekend, you're not in luck. They once spent 10 years developing one
 specific kimono trying to get the indigo dye exactly right. You might have changed your mind
 about whether you want it by then. I mean, you'll have changed shades. You might have changed
 like your idea of what colour you want. You're like, actually, you know, I'm not really... I was
 thinking more violet rather than indigo. The thing is, if you change shape, doesn't matter.
 That's a joy of kimono, right? You can go up to 45, 50 stone and because it just wraps around,
 just wrap it around a bit looser. Everyone looks good in the kimono.
 Washing them is an absolute nightmare, as far as I can tell.
 A, it looks like it's extremely expensive, time consuming, but also you just can't do it on your
 own. So in order for you to wash a kimono, the whole thing needs to be taken apart into seven
 different parts. And then you need to air dry them and then re-stitch the whole thing back together.
 There's special kimono washing stations in order to do it. They have a huge process to do it.
 They wash it by hand with soapy water. They then lather it with seaweed paste.
 They hang it on these panels to dry such a long process, but you have to literally take it up.
 It's like going to a car wash and then taking your car apart to wash it all in and put it back
 together. It's mad. I'm not really surprised if it takes 10 years to make. I would be
 staggered if there was a label inside saying just bunging it on 16 for an hour and a half.
 That's true. I think just soap under the armpits for a couple of minutes and you're fine.
 When you're putting on your kimono, make sure you always bring the right side over the body first
 and then pull the left side over the right side because the opposite way is the way the Japanese
 dress the dead. And so if you do it that way, it's a big faux pas or someone will just think you've
 died probably. You've worn one, haven't you, James? You sound as a very fetching image.
 Well, what I'm looking at now and why I said that is because I was given three steps to wearing a
 kimono by the hotel which made us wear these kimonos instead of you don't wear it. You're
 not getting dinner this evening. That's what they said. And women would put the sash around the waist
 and men would put it over the hip bone slightly lower down. So that's the difference between men
 and women. That's how you tell the difference. Yes, exactly. Is that a live man or a dead woman?
 You can tell by just looking at the kimono. I was speaking of wearing kimonos during dinner,
 James. I was reading that in order to make sure that you don't have to go and have your kimono
 washed, you often have to do preventative things. For example, wearing it in a kimono, part of that
 is so that it doesn't touch the body and take on the odor. So you have to protect them that way.
 If anything gets onto the kimono, immediately get cleaning on it because obviously the nightmare.
 I know. I'm just thinking actually when I had that dinner, I shouldn't have ordered the spaghetti
 bolognese because I got sauce all over my kimono and it's going to take three years to wash.
 No. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's... I was reading this lady on Quora who said exactly
 that, that when she sat down to dinner in her kimono, the waiter came over and immediately
 padded her entire body with cows and napkins for fear that she would be getting it dirty.
 James, just say the spike ball is a representation of a traumatic war scene.
 This is the som, okay? What are the questions?
 They used to have magic eye kimonos that you could get and these are 300 years ago. Yeah.
 Okay. Now look, when I say magic eye, no, hang on. Everyone calm down a bit.
 I was just thinking, right, just hear me out here. If you were to have a pair of trousers,
 which were magic eye and then people stared at them and then it looked like a bulge was coming
 out of the groin to make your genitals look bigger. That would be quite clever, wouldn't it?
 That'd be really good if you wanted to be arrested.
 Why would I be arrested when people are staring at my genitals?
 Good point. It's not a fair system, James.
 Yeah, that's what the flashers say, don't they?
 Not forcing you to look.
 Sorry. Okay. So when I say magic eye, basically, it's all about the way they change the perspective.
 So there is a kimono from the 18th century, but it has hawks on the bottom half of it,
 right? It hawks the birds of prey. And on the top, all around the top half of it,
 there are these Japanese characters, which looks like they're referring to different birds of prey.
 But actually, it can be read in two ways. And actually, if you read it in the other
 interpretation, it's all about visiting prostitutes. And it's a kind of naughty sex kimono.
 I love it. Very cool. I was trying to find other kinds of kimonos. I like going to Wikipedia
 sometimes and pressing the button that gives you their surname as kimono. Anyway, what I found is,
 did you know that there is only one band called Kimono in Iceland?
 Nice. That's good. Very strong. Go on. And how did they get there? Were they chased down the
 Isle of a Plain, taken to Germany first? Actually, they're pretty cool. They were formed in 2001,
 and they've had a bunch of albums. And one of their members actually left them recently,
 moved to London and joined the Vaccines. Oh, really? Yeah. So one of the Vaccines members
 used to be in kimono in Iceland. Very cool. So here's an interesting kimono. I read about this
 in the New York Times in 2007. This was because in Japan, there is still, and there definitely was,
 a worry of women being assaulted when they're walking down the street. And so this thing was
 invented where you would get your kimono and then you would almost turn it inside out. And there
 was a few flaps and stuff. And then you could stand by the side of the road and it would make you look
 exactly like a vending machine. So you would walk past and you would think oh, it's just a vending
 machine. But actually, it was a woman who turned her kimono inside out to make her look like a
 vending machine. James, I can't believe I'm going to say this to you. What are you talking about?
 This is a thing it was invented by someone called Ms. Sukioka, who's a 29-year-old fashion designer
 in Tokyo. And that was the idea. I'm not sure. I don't think they would commonly came into use
 after 2007. And if you ever go to Japan, you'll see there are vending machines everywhere. Like,
 that is one thing about it. So it is a... Well, Arthur, we don't know. Exactly. No vending machine
 anywhere. That's what I thought. When I went to Japan, I thought there's so many vending machines,
 but no women in this country. Aren't you more likely to be touched by a man who's thinking
 he's using a vending machine than you would if you were just standing being a woman?
 That's a really good point. Yeah, I suppose. Maybe your vending machine should look like an
 empty vending machine, or maybe one of your Twix's should be just hanging off. So anyone who sees it
 goes, "Oh, that's the dodgy one that's not going to give me my Twix." I don't know. If there's one...
 I mean, the worst-case scenario is when you are a bit cheeky and you stick your hand into the
 vending machine to try and... I'm just saying, this is going up a lot of possible problems.
 I'm with you. Do you have to bring out 100 Mars bars with you whenever you go out? If you don't,
 do you get people violently shaking you to try and extract what they think they're owed?
 I'm not saying it's a flawless system. I'm just saying it's a thing that at least in concept form
 existed. Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.
 My fact this week is that fish get the bends if you reel them in too quickly.
 I know. They put all little things, and they get it worse than we do.
 Stop really fishing.
 Yeah, or reel them in very slowly. This is a genuine problem because in a lot of recreation
 or fishing, you throw the fish back into the water. You don't want to deplete the supplies,
 you don't want to kill the fish. But actually, I read one estimate that in Western Australia,
 70% of certain fish are thrown back into the water. Someone estimated that about 50% of
 those will actually die because they've got the bends from being reeled in. The bends is the
 very painful consequence of if you've been diving very, very deep in the water, and then you come
 up far too quickly, there's this extremely quick decrease in pressure that you undergo,
 and nitrogen bubbles are released into your system, and it's very painful. It's called the bends
 because of the position that it renders you into. You're bending over in agony, and fish get it too.
 And with fish, it's more like they often just get bigger and bulgier, and their eyes pop out.
 Sometimes their stomach bulges out their mouth.
 Yeah, and there's a few ways to stop it being a problem. So you can vent them if you can somehow
 put a hollow instrument through their body into their swim bladder wall. It can release some of
 the gases. That can help. Unfortunately, you have to be a bit of an expert to do that. Don't
 just shove a byro in because that's like most people who try and do it, it doesn't work.
 I just think it's amazing that method that you can do mini surgery on a fish like a tracheotomy.
 It is really amazing that that can happen. The other thing that you can do is you can put them
 in a fish elevator, which is a word for basically a milk crate with a rope attached where you put
 the fish in and very slowly weigh it down so it goes back to where it came from.
 Mason, if you threw the fish back in, it wouldn't know to go back down to the depth.
 No, I don't know if it even knows it's a fish, but it would naturally try and go down to the
 bottom. But the problem is it's full of this gas, so it can't go anywhere because it's floating.
 You need to somehow get the gas out of it or get it back down to where it was before so that the
 gas changes under pressure. That's basically because they have this swim bladder, isn't it?
 So actually, it's worse because when they have gas bubbles in them, the whole swim bladder inflates
 like it's literally like an inflatable. And so they're just stuck at the top.
 There is another method you can have to bring them down, which is attach a descending device to them,
 which is basically a weight that you put onto its lip. And you just sort of clamp it on there,
 and it just tugs the fish back down with it. And then it comes off. You can set it to release
 at the particular depth that the fish should be swimming around at. I know.
 When Anna, you said that the name the bends comes from when you bend over because you're in so much
 pain. I found this really interesting. It's actually named after something called the Grecian
 bend, which I'm sure you all read about, which is incredible. So people do bend over in pain because
 they have this. But at the time in the 19th century, there was this thing called the Grecian bend.
 And it was a way that women walked where they kind of stuck their thumbs out because they had a big
 bustle and they stuck their chest out and they kind of look like they're in a bit of an S shape.
 You'll see it if you see like illustrations that are kind of taking the piss out of the way women
 dressed in the 19th century, you'll see that people dress like this. And basically when people
 started going into mines or diving and they started having this problem, it was around the same time
 that the Grecian bend was a really fashionable way for women to dress. And so people said, wow,
 you're, you're bending over like you're doing the Grecian bend. And that's why it's called the bends.
 Those women kind of enjoyed being made fun of though. Oh, they didn't care because it's fashion.
 Like, you don't care if you're fashionable, you don't give a fuck if people are saying,
 oh, what an idiot. Look at you with your big, you know, Godzilla pants or whatever. You're like,
 I don't care. These are fashionable, mate. Like, I don't know. I'd be sensitive to it.
 If only those women had a way of disguising themselves as some sort of common bit of street
 furniture. Just what we're talking about the bends. Did you guys read about John Scott Halden?
 Oh, what a guy. So this is, this is the person who started studying the idea of why you would get
 the bends as you were coming up. And in 1905, he would tasked with trying to find this out. So
 Halden was a very famous scientist in his day. And actually just a quick bit of background
 about this guy. He's someone who helped to create the gas mask that we had at the First World War
 by literally going to the front line and finding the gases and diagnosing what they were and then
 coming back and making the masks. He was someone who threw himself into experiments to make sure
 he could understand what was going on. In the case of decompression and working out the bends,
 he was tasked with trying to do that. And he used groups of animals to begin with to try and do it,
 but they all weren't matching humans. So eventually he worked out the goats
 with a perfect match. They weren't quite perfect. It was like 1.7 goats would make up the human,
 but they were close enough. And so he had 85 goats come to this one spot in London,
 and he would put them in these big chambers and then release them into the fields outside and
 watch how they responded. And that's where they started learning about the stages of decompression.
 So all these experiments eventually led to Halden working out what we still use today as the standard
 decompression stages that you would use if you were a scuba diver still to this day. And it was
 based on 85 goats. Just a little note on that. They then moved to live trials on humans and the
 ship which they did live trials on was called HMS Spanker. Here's the thing about who might get
 the bends sometimes. Scientists now think that ancient sea monsters also got the bends.
 So have you heard of a Mosasaur? It's like a dinosaur, but they were a different kind. They
 lived in the sea. Like there are pterosaurs, which are those winged ones. It's dinosaur adjacent.
 So scientists have found fossilized vertebrae of Mosasaur, and they were about four or five
 meters long, really big animals. But they found a strip of dead bone in an otherwise healthy bone.
 Now, I don't understand what that means because it's all obviously fossilized dead bone,
 but they somehow found a bit of the bone is different from the other bone. And they
 think that decompression sickness is the only possible cause of why you would have that sudden
 layer all the way through the bone. Interestingly though, if they found the dead bone inside the
 living bone, that suggests that they had the problem, but then they survived it because then
 the living bone grew around it, doesn't it? They figured out the decompression stages thousands
 of years before we did. Well, maybe. I feel like I've been tricked into saying that.
 I think dolphins get it as well, but have actually worked out the decompression stages,
 they believe. So people found something similar in dolphins that have been washed up on a beach
 recently, which was that they had little pockets of air in their blubber, which shows that they
 obviously are suffering from something like the bends, like the air is accumulating,
 but it is thought that what they do is they come to the surface and if they feel like they've got
 the symptoms, then they dive back down again really deeply to sort of re-equalize and they
 keep coming up and going down until they don't die, which is sort of how people used to do it
 before halding came along. I believe you just have to dive back down to the bottom and start again
 till it works. That must have been just the worst, wasn't it? When you're in so much pain,
 they're like, "Well, you're just going to have to go back down again, mate." Oh, really?
 That's what caused the problem in the first place. No, that's the way.
 It's so bad now, though, now that we do know. It's almost as bad if you're diving, right? There's
 Egyptian diver called Ahmed Gaba, who beat the record for the deepest dive in 2014,
 dove 332.35 meters down. That took him 14 minutes to get to that depth. He then spent 13 and a half
 hours getting back up to the surface decompressing along the way.
 When you're going down, if you see a nice shipwreck or a nice load of fish or something,
 you just don't look at them. You just go down as quick, because otherwise,
 you're spoiling the whole way back up, aren't you?
 You're right. You've got time on the way back for that title.
 But don't they have chambers that you can... I remember watching an episode of Baywatch years
 ago where David Hasselhoff very bravely swam to the bottom of the ocean to save someone,
 a scuba diver who was trapped, and then brought them right back up. The whole episode is basically
 him inside a decompression chamber, back on the surface. Now, don't we have those? Can't you just
 swim up and just get into a... Yeah, but it just is slightly more expensive to provide every amateur
 diver with an entire decompression chamber. But you're right. For this guy, actually,
 you would have thought you're breaking a record. I agree. Stingy.
 But if you come back up, Dan, wouldn't David Hasselhoff have got the symptoms and then have
 to be put in a decompression chamber to kind of push... You'd have to get Hasselhoff into the
 chamber as quickly as possible, really. Yes. All the time, this nitrogen's trying to get
 into your body. But if you could get back into pressure as quickly as possible, you might be
 okay. Yeah. But I mean, that's a tough guy, because you don't want to rush him. He hates famously
 being hassled, doesn't he? Oh, boy. Being hassled, though. But at the same time,
 Baywatch was a big show back then with a big budget. So they probably could afford one of these
 machines, unlike amateur divers on the lesser production. Home and Away probably couldn't
 afford that. That's why there are so few deep-sea diving plot lines in Home and Away.
 Well, there was that. Do you remember there was the whole nine months of when they were all coming
 back to the surface? All you just saw, you just saw a flat bit of water with a few bubbles coming
 up. The show was just called Away for that series, wasn't it? Okay, it's time for our final fact of
 the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that in 18th century London, professional
 boxers would challenge opponents by publishing requests to fight in the letters columns of
 newspapers. So I stumbled on this fact while reading a book called The London Monster by an
 old buddy of ours, John Bondeson, great historian, and has nothing to do with The London Monster,
 which was all about a sort of precursor to Jack the Ripper. But in there, he was talking about
 interesting things that happened in newspapers at the time. And he mentioned that boxers would
 sort of publish challenges to each other, and they'd would tease opponents, and they would propose
 fights and where and when and so on, and then would wait for a response to come through,
 maybe in the next day's newspaper or the following days to say, yes, I accept. And then
 you would know a fight was on. Such a weird way to communicate with each other.
 Were they rude? Would they say, you know, I will be kicking your head in at three o'clock tomorrow?
 Bondeson says polite, but he also says that they would often put in some barbs and teasers along
 the way. I think sometimes it was quite insulting. I've read a few of these. There was one, for
 instance, this was the first ever, I think, really professional fight between two women in the UK.
 It was Elizabeth Wilkinson versus Hannah Highfield. And Elizabeth Wilkinson put an
 advertisement in the newspaper saying, I, Elizabeth Wilkinson of Clark and Well,
 having had some words with Hannah Highfield and requiring satisfaction to invite her to
 meet me on the stage and box me. That sounds quite polite. It's quite polite. But maybe for the day,
 it was a bit unpolite, right? Because there was another one. She was fighting someone called
 Anne Field, who was an ass driver from Stoke, Newington. And she said in that one, yeah.
 An ass driver? An ass driver. You know what an ass driver is. So like, let's say you've got a donkey
 driver. Yeah. So someone who has a load of asses and wants to get them to market and so has a stick
 and kind of walks into market and hits them and makes sure they go in the right direction.
 Cool. It just took me a while to put donkey in the meaning when you said ass driver.
 That's where I got confused. Yeah. She was trying to get a fight with this
 ass driver from Stoke, Newington called Anne Field. And she told anyone who read the newspaper that
 the blows which I shall present her with will be more difficult for her to digest than any she
 has ever given her asses. Yeah. So, you know, that slam does work better when you say asses
 instead of donkeys. Well, exactly. It's just an implication of kicking your ass that you need.
 That's what she should have said. I'm going to kick you and then I'm going to kick your ass.
 Yeah. Apparently, the Elizabeth, who was one of the people in that fight, she also used to have
 couples fights a bit like couples nights. But when you would have couples would be pitched against
 each other, which sounds quite fun. So cool. But it was mixed doubles, wasn't it? So it was,
 I think it was men fighting men while the women fight the women. It was very, I don't think it
 ever happened that men would fight women in the same. It's that's not really like mixed doubles,
 because in mixed doubles, the man can serve to the woman, right? It's not like you don't just hit
 it to the man or the woman hits it to the women. So it's like, yeah. I would watch a mixed doubles
 where there were two balls in play at the same time and it can only go between the same sex.
 Yeah. So hang on. She was called Stokes, right? Is it Elizabeth?
 She's called Elizabeth Wilkinson, also Elizabeth Stokes, because she got married halfway through
 her career. But she was a... Ney one, Ney Stokes or Ney Wilkinson? I didn't want to say which one
 was Ney, because I couldn't know. The donkey was the Ney, probably. It was the Bray. But yeah, they
 were like almost professional boxers. And the way that they told the difference between a professional
 and a non-professional was that they wouldn't fight topless. So you would have like prostitutes
 doing fights where they were all topless. And this would be like a way of making money because
 they would get lots of people to watch them and people would bet on it and they would bake money
 and stuff. Whereas these people like Elizabeth Wilkinson, they were more proper boxers, really.
 Yeah. I read a description of those more bawdy crazy fights that would happen in the streets.
 Yeah. So there was a guy called William Hickey. He wrote about it. He saw a fight in a tavern
 in Drury Lane in 1768. And his description of it was the whole room was in uproar. Men and women
 promiscuously mounted upon chairs, tables and benches in order to see a sort of general conflict
 carried upon the floor. Two she-devils, for they scarce had a human appearance, were engaged in
 a scratching and boxing match. Their faces entirely covered with blood, bosoms bare, and the clothes
 nearly torn from their bodies. For several minutes, not a creature interfered between them or seemed
 to care a straw of what mischief they might do to each other. And this used to happen a lot,
 apparently, these fights that were going on. But women fighting was a thing that Elizabeth
 Wilkinson was desperately trying to make normal, because you would almost think that
 female professional boxing was not a thing back then. But actually, it started in 1722,
 and it was very popular. And it was not only seen as let's beat each other up, but let's try and
 empower women. It was a real movement. They even tried to, at the arenas, which would usually be
 the bear gardens in London, where you would usually go to see a bear fighting a monkey,
 which was a massively popular thing back in the day. They even tried to set up galleries
 where women could go and watch it. So the upper class women could come and see it and say, "Oh,
 this is a womanly thing, as well as a male thing." Wait, so women could go and watch the
 bears fighting their monkeys, or the women fighting the women? Could any bears and monkeys go and
 watch the bears fighting the monkeys? I think there was a glass bears and monkeys.
 All right, okay. Lord Byron's bear would have gone and say it. I think Stokes had an amphitheatre
 later in life, as then she must have been really successful, because I think she and her husband
 ran a boxing theatre. Because I read an advert for it, which advertised that there would be bull,
 bear, and ass baiting. But also- Sorry, is that like donkey baiting? Is that-
 That is donkey baiting. Yes. Donkey baiting sounds even more rude, doesn't it? The farmer was caught
 donkey baiting. But the final event, or I don't know if it's the final event, it's the words of
 the advert say, "A dog will be dressed up with fireworks to augment the diversion of the spectators."
 I mean, it sounds unbelievably cruel. Yeah. We touched on this in our vinyl when we released a
 vinyl. I think it was James. James's fact, I think, was about fireworks. I went boxing.
 Yeah. Oh, yeah. But you're not going to hear anything else. This is a bit like one of those
 porn sites where you give a 30-second teaser and then you cut them off. You can't know anything
 else about that fact unless you buy the vinyl. Yeah. Or like a trailer for a double movie,
 a bit like that as well. It's like lots of things. If you want to go high, brah.
 Feels like a very pent-up episode of the podcast. We've been in our houses for almost a whole year.
 We all need to go away and have a bottle of whiskey each. We should say that it was all
 illegal, right? We keep saying professional boxing, but until quite late, it was all kind
 of illegal even though it happened all over the place. I think the main way you can make a living
 from it was in boxing booths, which I didn't really know about, which is odd because they
 lasted until the 1970s. And of course, you were born in 1940, Anna, so it's really weird that you
 weren't there for them. Yeah. Well, they sound fun. These came about in the 1700s and it was a way
 that boxers, sort of professional, even though it was illegal, would travel around with fairs
 and anyone who attended the fair would challenge the boxer to a fight. Now, I don't know why anyone
 did this because that's a professional boxer inside the booth and you're just a pleb. But
 that's what they did. And you pay a bit of money to do that or to see it. And I think the famous
 one was Tom Hickman. He was in the 1820s and he was known as the Gaslight Man because he
 told everyone he won when he hadn't actually won. I'm the champion of the world.
 He put your lights out. Oh, very good. Yeah. But actually, boxing booths, the reason that
 there's a more relevant association with them in the modern day is that in the 1930s,
 there was a miner who lasted three rounds in a boxing booth with a professional boxer,
 and so he won a bit of money, used that money to buy a wedding ring for the women he fancied,
 and they had two sons, Bobby and Jack, and surname Charlton. So without boxing booths,
 to credit another spurious link, without boxing booths, England would not have won the World Cup.
 It's no wine guard connection. I don't think he would have put that in his book.
 Just on betting on whether you could beat boxers, there was one quite weird trick, which was
 round turn of the 20th century in Texas. There would be a circus would come into town,
 and there would be a woman outside the tent promising $50 to any man who could stay three
 rounds in a boxing ring with her, and then people would go, "Yeah, no problem," and they pay their
 $5, and then they'd walk into the tent, were very conveniently, all the lights were extremely dim,
 and you couldn't really see what was going on, and then found themselves in the ring with a
 mailboxer wearing a dress, who would beat the crap out of them.
 Right. I thought you were going to say that the lights were all extinguished,
 but she'd been eating carrots from a very young age, so you could see them brilliantly in the dark.
 Wow. Have you guys heard of Daniel Mendoza? I'm sure he came across him in your reading.
 He was one of the big… Don't recall the name. No.
 He was really famous for his style of boxing. He basically, he was five foot seven, he was
 about 70 kilos. He was relatively, he was a sort of middleweight rather than a heavyweight,
 but he was still a champion boxer despite that, and I've read that he basically came up with
 the idea of avoiding being punched. Before that, you just sort of take the hits and hope that you
 could hit the other guy harder, and he came up with a style of moving and basically avoiding
 being hit really hard. That sort of revolutionized boxing. Yeah. And he was really, really tough.
 He wrote his memoirs later in life. He wrote in his memoirs, he was so tough that he once
 got in three fights on his way to a boxing match, because he was so angry. Firstly,
 someone cut him up in a carriage, so he got in a fight with them. Then a shopkeeper tried to
 cheat him, allegedly, and then third, someone just looked at him in a funny way, and so he arrived
 at the boxing match. He sounds lovely. I don't know if you can claim you're so tough if you've
 invented the tactic of avoiding being punched. I think he was compensating with that story.
 I was reading about one very famous fight between Bob Fitzsimmons and Jack Sharkey,
 and this had been organized by William Randolph Hearst, who was the newspaper magnate.
 These two were the biggest boxes of the day. This was going to be a huge, huge fight. The amount
 of money they could win was going to be huge. There was so much gambling on it and everything.
 Then halfway through the fight, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey a low blow,
 and according to the Associated Press, it left Sharkey lying on the canvas, unable to move his
 legs, though he clutched spasmodically at his groin with his gloved hand. So he's basically
 can't carry on because he's been hit below the belt, and it was a really obvious shot.
 But the referee apparently didn't see it because we think William Randolph Hearst had
 bet $20,000 on Sharkey to win, and the referee happened to be a friend of his whose name was
 Wyatt Earp. No. The famous Wyatt Earp. Yeah. The Wyatt Earp. The Wyatt Earp actually worked as
 a bodyguard for William Randolph Hearst, and he was like, well, we're going to need someone to
 referee this match who's going to help me to win all my cash with the betting thing.
 And so he got Wyatt Earp to be the referee for the match. I'm really shocked because I
 thought Wyatt Earp was a good sort of upstanding lawman. I know. Clearly not.
 But wasn't that a thing that followed him around more so than the gun battle at the OK Corral?
 It was it was in his obituary. It was sort of he became a byword for if you did something dodgy,
 you were pulling an Earp or something like that. Yeah, it became like a humongous
 cause celebra of him being the biggest cheat of all time. And yeah, really, it spoiled his reputation
 as if that could happen. But yeah, so funny. It used to not be illegal, though, to hit someone
 or certainly to grab them below the waist. It used to be just, you know, if that's boxing,
 you could hit people when they were down. That was just not against the rules. I was really,
 really rough until about the mid 18th century. That's UFC, isn't it? I guess hitting people
 while they're down. It pretty much is. And, you know, gouging and all sorts of vicious practices
 were just allowed until this guy Jack Broughton came along and he devised the Broughton's rules.
 Some people say it's after he accidentally killed the opponent in the ring. He said,
 "Maybe we should professionalize this." And I think that's when gloves were introduced.
 I did read that with Broughton, who actually codified the first boxing rules in 1743. It was
 actually the case that in most fights, you didn't kick people when they were down. It all punched
 them when they were down or attacked them when they were down, even though it hadn't been codified.
 But the way that the rules upheld was just by the masses. And so in reports, you'd have,
 instead of an umpire, this massive crowd around them. And I think in 1726, someone recorded,
 for instance, that laws were very strictly observed. Because basically, if you didn't obey
 the unofficial rules, then the entire mob of baying people descended on you and attacked you.
 Well, that's a good way of doing it, isn't it? It's a good way of refereeing a match, yeah.
 I got something on modern day boxing. Did you know that there is only one professional male
 boxer in Iceland? Oh, come on. Is that true? Yeah, absolutely true. Wow. He's undefeated in his home
 nation, isn't he? Which is great. So professional boxing got banned in Iceland, something like 64
 years ago. It's been banned. And so no one has ever done it professionally. But this one guy
 called Colbyn Christensen, he's the only person that has taken it on. And he goes internationally
 to fight people. And he's finding it really hard because he's got no funding. There's only about
 four boxing rings that are in Iceland. How? Wait, wait. How? Yeah. How are the four boxing
 rings in Iceland? They're handovers. They're handovers. Yeah, but you've got four times more
 boxing rings than you have boxes. He can't find it hard to ring up and get a booking at any of them.
 How's your schedule looking? But it only allows amateur boxing. So no one's doing it. No one's
 professional. He's doing it professionally. He's setting up matches overseas. He's going to Berlin.
 He's got coaches that he's trying to get. He's having to fund his own matches, which he loses.
 He's not very good. So he's been losing the matches. So he's broke. And yeah, so he's, and he finally
 was getting on to a roll because he signed up with the trainer of Tyson Fury, who's been looking
 after him, suddenly getting into it. And he's now gone pro and he's winning all his matches.
 And then COVID hit. So he's had to go back to Iceland and just be the only professional boxer
 with no one to punch. Can I just say, what's the name of this guy? Kolbein Christensen. Okay,
 I just want to say, Mr. Christensen, if you're listening, that dad thinks that you're shit.
 But I think you're probably an extremely talented boxer who deserves respect. So if you're
 reading the letters pages of the Icelandic news, you'll see a polite invitation.
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like to
