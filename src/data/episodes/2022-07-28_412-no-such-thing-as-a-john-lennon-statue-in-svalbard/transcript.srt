00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Hey everyone welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we begin we just want to let you know

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,000
 that we have a very special guest on this week. So we were doing a live show in Brighton and Anna

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,920
 Tyshinski could not make it to the show unfortunately and so we had to find someone to fill those very

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,320
 big shoes and we did. In fact we went to the top we brought in the big gun Debra Francis White of

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,240
 the Guilty Feminist. She is such a fun person she's a really good pal of ours we had so much fun on

 stage with her and you must check out if you haven't already the Guilty Feminist podcast.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Okay let's do it on with the pod.

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish a weekly podcast

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,440
 this week coming to you live from Brighton.

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:45,040
 My name is Dan Shriver I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin and special

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,360
 guest Debra Francis White and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,600
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:03,440
 fact number one and that is Debra. So my fact is that actress Tallulah Bankhead had a parrot

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,440
 which she taught to say birds can't talk. She also taught her to say who'd want to talk to you.

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,880
 Nice. And who are you so sometimes someone will come in and say who are you and the person

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,680
 would answer and go birds can't talk which was a sort of gaslighting parrot really in a very

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,920
 real way. It was actually I think a minor bird which I'm assured is a sort of a parrot

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,840
 that might not be accurate but if it isn't email these guys. She had a lot of pets actually she

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,360
 had a lion cub called Winston Churchill. She bought that when she was in Nevada and she only

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,600
 went to Nevada so she could get a quick divorce and it used to take curtain calls with her on the

27
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:57,280
 stage. She had a dog called Hitchcock given to her by Hitchcock all her life she had an incredible

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,080
 series of animals but she was one of the great eccentrics. She was completely amazing and she

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,760
 most famous as an actor but only really took off she was from America she came to the UK

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,600
 in 1923 and she spent eight years here doing plays and becoming a real complete sensation

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,800
 and there was a group of fans called the gallery girls who were a group of teenage cockney girls

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,240
 who would arrive and just wait in the gallery and whenever she came on stage they would just

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,880
 scream and cheer and it was incredibly annoying obviously for anyone else who actually wanted

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,400
 to see the show and you know they would applaud for about as long as she was on stage herself as in

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,160
 that long again you know. Yeah they used to sing Tallulah hallelujah, Tallulah hallelujah on and on

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,560
 and on and some of the other actors she'd vamp and some of the other actors they'd be like we're

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,000
 never going to get out of here because she would let it go on but the gallery girls were working as

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,600
 you say working class women many lesbians and they knew that she was Tallulah was what she called

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:05,760
 ambi-sextrous and she famously said my father warned me about men and booze but never said a word

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,720
 about women and cocaine. She was also said to have slept with 70 percent of the aristocracy

41
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,200
 but her her I mean that was what she claimed. I love that idea like the battered old copy of

42
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,080
 the brettes like just crossing off the El of Westminster and in fact the Duchess of Kilmore.

43
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:40,160
 Well she did catch quite a lot of things actually. She did generally yeah. She was amazing. She was so famous

44
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,800
 in London when she lived there that according to Lord Beaverbrook there were only two people in the

45
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,800
 whole of the UK who could be identified by just the first name from an average costamunga and that

46
00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:01,360
 was Tallulah and Steve. Steve? Steve? Everyone knows Steve. Let's try and guess it. 1920s Steve?

47
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,600
 Steve? I mean good luck because I can see the answer. Okay. Is this person still famous? Oh

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:16,880
 no. It was Steve Donahue the great English jockey. Oh that's amazing. And she loved a bit at the

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,880
 races as well. Oh she did? Yes. You'd see her photograph with the Prince of Wales at the races

50
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,400
 and she was friends with the Arga Khan but she would often come to the door without any clothes on

51
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,800
 just with a strand of pearls around her neck even the stage door she'd come without any clothes on

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,160
 and she once said to an aristocrat at a stuffy party who was there with his wife

53
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,760
 who she had slept with many times he looked away from her and she said what's the matter darling

54
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,640
 don't you recognize me with my clothes on? She was wonderful with those kind of quips and also

55
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,160
 the nudity thing like she used to do that not just in sort of her personal life but on sets of movies

56
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,240
 she'd just get naked and start cartwheeling everywhere. Loved a nude cartwheel. Yeah. Pantsless

57
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
 cartwheels with her speciality. So you think it was a normal cartwheel and then she'd get to the top

58
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,280
 of the car. We didn't know it was a very special car wheel actually. Yeah so that might be the other

59
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,760
 thing she might have her clothes on but she wouldn't have any underpants on and there was a thing with

60
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,720
 a movie she was on it was an Alfred Hitchcock movie where they did get complaints and they told

61
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,240
 Hitchcock we've got to sort this out and Hitchcock reportedly said back that he didn't know if it was

62
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:33,520
 a matter for wardrobe or hairdressing. She inspired amazing quits from everywhere. That's the thing.

63
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,640
 Do you want to hear another Tallulah line? Yeah this is where she saw former lover of hers and she

64
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,440
 saw him for the first time in years and she said to him I thought I told you to wait in the car.

65
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:51,840
 She also she used to say I hate to go to bed I hate to get up and I hate to be alone

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,880
 and so she employed in her later years middle aged and a bit later probably until she died

67
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,960
 young gay men she called Cadiz to sit with her while she fell asleep and I mean she was such a

68
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,520
 gay icon you can imagine because she was they were happy to do it but she paid them to sit with her

69
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,240
 and they would hold her hand but they did other things for her as well. They'd light her cigarettes,

70
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,200
 draw her baths you know just generally make her life more convenient. She never liked being alone

71
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,400
 even if she was asleep so if she wasn't sleeping with anyone that night on the rare night she

72
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,360
 wasn't sleeping with anyone she would hire a caddy which I might do in my older years.

73
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,040
 What did they did they speak to her or any for no was it just holding the hand?

74
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,880
 They were just there so she felt comfortable going to sleep she didn't like being alone

75
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,320
 and so she was sweet but it has pathos. Absolutely yeah she was a she was a rather

76
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:51,600
 tragic figure. Her last ever words were bourbon codeine which told you about her life but in her

77
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,920
 book in her autobiography she denies being a cocaine addict and she absolutely was. Yeah in the

78
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,640
 book she says that what happened was and I agree that this is not true but this is what she says

79
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,960
 she said one time she got really really really drunk and she decided she was going to give up

80
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,600
 drink for a few days and she said okay well what I'm going to do is if anyone says do you want

81
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,920
 to drink I'm going to say oh no thank you I don't drink have you got any cocaine right and that

82
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,200
 would get people to stop her getting drunk. The problem is the one day someone called her bluff

83
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,720
 according to her and that's why she had some cocaine and then the next day someone else did

84
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,520
 and the next day someone else did. Tower happens going at the slippery slippery slope.

85
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,920
 Well she had the sick because it was alcohol it was cocaine it was sex a lot of sex and she had

86
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,320
 this moment where she had to go to hospital to have an emergency hysterectomy brought on by

87
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,800
 gonorrhea I believe and so she got really ill she was rendered infertile she was in hospital her

88
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,200
 weight had gone down to 75 pounds and they were trying to say you know subtly that you got to

89
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
 change your life and the the thing that she used to say to the doctors as they were sort of leaving

90
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,320
 the room as she would yell at them going don't think this has taught me a lesson. She was just pure badass.

91
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,680
 There's no other way of putting it. Yeah she's a force of nature energy levels. One of her friends

92
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
 followed her around for a day with a stopwatch timing her speech and estimated that she spoke

93
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,120
 70 000 words a day which is a lot that's a short novel. Wow. You just gave me a like

94
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,800
 lightweight. Yeah I could do that my lunch time. That's quite a weird thing to do with someone

95
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,960
 estimate their word count. I think there are a lot of sort of crazy people in the 20s just going

96
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,840
 around being fabulous around Tallulah she's like this is my caddy this is my word counter how many

97
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,240
 have you done so far was that like the original pedometer. She had an amazing voice didn't she

98
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,280
 that's what she's quite famous for she had a very deep husky voice. She said in the autobiography

99
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,800
 that her voice has been likened to the mating call of the caribou. Gosh I listened to her on

100
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,680
 desert island discs and that explains a lot actually. It explains why all the caribou ran into

101
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,840
 you for me. What if you heard her voice because I haven't actually heard her voice. You know like that.

102
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:13,600
 Well darling, well well. Does she have tanny? Does she say words? Was I her daughter?

103
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,720
 I'll give you one of the things she actually said this is the thing she actually said she said

104
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,760
 I'll come and make love to you at five o'clock if I'm late start without me. She said that on desert island discs.

105
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:32,400
 Roy probably did not know where to look. We're going to move on to our next fact.

106
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,480
 Okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that this year

107
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,520
 an invisible statue made of air went to auction with an estimate of five thousand pounds.

108
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:53,200
 The piece sold for thirteen thousand pounds and the winner went home with literally nothing.

109
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,560
 Well that's not quite true he had a certificate to prove he had nothing to go home with.

110
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,760
 It's amazing. It's incredible yeah so this is an artist called Salvatore Garrao and he's done a

111
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,320
 couple of art pieces where it's invisible. This particular piece is has he has he really has

112
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:19,360
 he done has he done fuck all in fact. I have to say I buy into it. I'm probably in the minority

113
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,080
 but I do likely I do that as some as soon as someone says let's imagine we're saying right now in

114
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,200
 front of us is a hovering Yeti. We now all know that I've said there's a hovering invisible Yeti

115
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:39,600
 there. It's there. Would anyone like to buy it? Okay that didn't go well. No so this was an art piece

116
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,880
 that was called I Am and that's the English translation. Yes that's the short version the

117
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:54,400
 full title is I am thirteen thousand pounds richer thanks to you suckers. So the the instructions for

118
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,560
 if someone was buying this was that you need a room that is five foot long and five foot wide.

119
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,800
 Oh my gosh so you've got to buy all of the extras as well. You've got to buy a room to put it in.

120
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 Lighting and environment are optional due to the fact that it doesn't exist. Could you put it

121
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,120
 outdoors or would the weather. Yeah you can put it outdoors if you like. So we can get weather

122
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:24,880
 damaged. Is it fungible or non fungible? He does know what that means. Does anybody. Does anybody.

123
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,000
 This is very very controversial though I should say because he is being sued by another artist who

124
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,720
 also created nothing. Oh interesting. I know this is a guy called Tom Miller who's a performance

125
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,320
 artist from Florida and he said that he was the first person to do an invisible sculpture.

126
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
 We might go on to the fact that many other people have done that as well but he says

127
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,480
 that he did it and what he did was he went into like a community area and he got a load of people

128
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,000
 to pretend they were moving blocks like almost like building the pyramids or something so they

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,120
 just put some empty stuff here and then so it's like a performance of making an invisible sculpture

130
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,640
 and he's currently suing Salvatore. Yeah and he said he easily could have found out that I had

131
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,560
 done this previous to him. All he needed to do was google Tom Miller nothing and that would have

132
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,280
 and you're like I don't know. Why would you ever do that? Why would you ever do that but we should

133
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,400
 all if any of us has any artistic endeavor going forward should google Tom Miller and then whatever

134
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:34,640
 it is. Just a double check. Have you guys familiar with Tom Friedman as another artist? He produced

135
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,240
 a piece of work which again it's like the idea of everyone buying into something and sort of

136
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,400
 investing something with meaning I do think has a lot of merit actually so Tom Friedman came up

137
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,920
 with this work of art which is a sheet of paper and it's called A Thousand Hours of Staring and

138
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,000
 it's a sheet of paper that he spent a thousand hours staring at and then just displayed. It's

139
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,080
 still empty still completely blank but it's called A Thousand Hours of Staring. It took him five years

140
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,640
 just 1992 to 2007. To be fair to be an expert at staring at a piece of paper you'd have to do

141
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,320
 ten thousand hours with him. That's true. That's an amateur. I'm paying for that. Was that Tom Friedman

142
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,360
 you said? That was Tom Friedman. So Tom Friedman did another one called Untitled A Curse which was

143
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,920
 again just an empty pedestal but he had employed a professional witch to put a curse on an invisible

144
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,680
 sphere above it. Similarly on eBay you can buy things that are not really things. There was a

145
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,960
 man who sold a ghost in a jar but he said I will not be responsible for the black spook that comes

146
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:42,720
 out if you take the lid off and the bidding went up to 55,000 dollars. No. Yeah but the final bidder

147
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,600
 didn't buy it didn't didn't pay just disappeared so I think the ghost was bidding against everyone

148
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,080
 else to stay in this man's house. But there was also a haunted rubber duck sold on eBay.

149
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,800
 A rubber duck that according to its owner had the power to possess children. The seller said he

150
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,480
 would not be responsible for the duck after shipping. He will not field questions or help to

151
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,720
 explain its unusual mystique. The duck sold after a week making him a profit of $107.50.

152
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,400
 So if you put just any old crap on eBay and say it's haunted people will bid for it.

153
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,120
 Everything you've said I will have bid on it at that point.

154
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,040
 Don't you remember we were in Newcastle a few weeks ago and we were chatting to the

155
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,360
 night porter after hours we were having a few drinks and he said that the boxer Chris Eubank

156
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,960
 Jr had been there the day before and he was outside and taking selfies and doing signatures

157
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,360
 and stuff like that. And some Joddy came up to him with a microwave and said will you sign my

158
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,080
 microwave please. And he signed his microwave and then it sold on eBay for £60,000.

159
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:56,400
 There's video footage of it it's amazing. Have you heard of Mauricio Catalan? No. I love we're

160
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,360
 on a roll with these great artists now. So Mauricio Catalan this was an exhibition in fact in 2012

161
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,240
 the Haberd Gallery in London they hosted an exhibition of drawings of art about invisibility.

162
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,000
 So there was a pedestal that Andy Warhol had stood on briefly to kind of create an anti-statute

163
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,280
 whatever. Mauricio Catalan produced a work of art based on a claim that he had made

164
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:24,320
 that in his car he had been keeping an invisible work of art. The car was then broken into and the

165
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,120
 artwork stolen. The work of art that he claimed had existed was not the work of art that he

166
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,360
 submitted. What he submitted was the police report by the police who had to take it seriously

167
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,360
 and investigate his claim that the invisible work of art had been stolen. Wow and you can see it in

168
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,520
 the museum this police report which he got a copy of. And the police took that seriously? I don't

169
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,440
 know how seriously. I mean I guess the car had been broken into so that's that's breaking and

170
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,080
 entering if nothing else. I don't know I don't know how long they looked for it. It must be nice

171
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,040
 to be a man because when women commit for report crimes we just don't get the same sort of response.

172
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,840
 We're going to move on very soon so let's get a few more couple of things in here. I've got one

173
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:15,600
 about signing something. Yeah sure. Okay and making something invaluable, invaluable. In 1922

174
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,080
 all my facts are from the 20s just by the way. I love I just love and revel in the 20s it's where

175
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:31,920
 I belong. And I'm back in them. Oh I've just realized. This is amazing. What a good moment. I'm in the 20s.

176
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:42,640
 But Einstein was once at Tokyo's Imperial Hotel in 1922 and he didn't have any money to tip the

177
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:50,160
 bellboy. So instead he wrote him two notes. The first said a calm and modest life brings more

178
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,640
 happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness. And the second said

179
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,240
 where there's a will there's a way. In 2017 guess what that first tip sold for? So the physical

180
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,720
 handwriting. Yeah it was the note the calm and modest life one guess what it sold for. A few

181
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,120
 grand I should think. Same by Einstein. Five grand. I'll say 20 grand. I'm gonna go a million.

182
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,880
 1.56 million. Yeah. Wow. The second one got a mere quarter of a meal but it's because it was a

183
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,400
 bit of a cliche he wasn't really trying. Where there's a will there's a way. Come on Einstein you

184
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,360
 could do better than that. There's a story I don't know if it's true but there's a story that Mozart

185
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,400
 if he was passing someone on the street and they asked for money and he didn't have any change on

186
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,560
 him that he would quickly grab a pen and a quill and would quickly write a quick little song

187
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,960
 and give it to them and say sell that and get

188
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:53,280
 it wasn't one of his famous ones was it? It was because I don't know if this is true

189
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,560
 but yeah but he would just do that. Would he do a new one's bespoke for you? Yeah yeah he would

190
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:08,720
 just go ask you. It doesn't sound very good. It doesn't matter if it's good or not. It's Mozart.

191
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,560
 It's yeah it's Mozart. He could write. It could make a tune but the point about Mozart is that

192
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,120
 he was really really good. No but he was. This is a change. This is. It's not going to do a symphony

193
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,280
 if he's just trying to give someone you know for hours you know this is like when you go to when

194
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,560
 a famous person used to go to places where they would kind of think is it possible that when I

195
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,400
 give them the check with my signature on that they're going to keep the check and not bank it

196
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
 because it's worth more to them and me not so that would be the trade off. Well there is that story

197
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,840
 I think it's supposed to be by Picasso who was in a restaurant and he hadn't he had his meal and

198
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,640
 they said can you uh instead of paying can you draw me a picture and he drew them a picture

199
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
 and then they said oh would you sign it Mr Picasso and he said no I want his pay for the

200
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,080
 dinner not for the entire building. What a dick move to say that. So what you're saying is Mozart

201
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,920
 basically invented the cameo app. Yes to an extent. The original so you'd say to your friend oh

202
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,640
 you know you love that Mozart don't you he just he just wrote me this. He gives it to the guy yeah

203
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,200
 and then the guy just sells it saying I've got an original Mozart. Well yeah he goes then to

204
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,080
 a sort of yeah who's he going to? He goes to the the institution of music and and they take it

205
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:33,440
 and they go wow yeah okay classic armadillos let's get this but we um we we do need to move on uh

206
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,720
 to our next fact. So it is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay my fact this week

207
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,560
 is that the doomsday vault in Svalbard which keeps backups of more than a million of the

208
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,560
 world's seeds gets regular requests by men who wish to deposit their own seed there.

209
00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:04,320
 I saw this on a youtube clip by an account called Veritasium and they went to this doomsday vault

210
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,960
 in Svalbard where they keep all of these seeds and the idea is that every country can put seeds in

211
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,920
 there and if they have any problems if you know if there's disease that kind of kills off some plants

212
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,760
 then they can bring their seeds back out and they can regrow the plants and hopefully it will help

213
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,640
 the diversity of the earth. Now there is a lady who manages a vault called Benta Nevedal and she

214
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,600
 like said lots of things that was happening there but one thing she said is they often get letters

215
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,040
 from men asking to deposit their semen and she says that they never answer those letters that's

216
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,600
 all I can really say about it is that they never answer them but on a fairly regular basis they

217
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,280
 get these requests. Wow okay well good to know why I didn't get a letter back.

218
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:53,680
 It's like an extremely strange dick pic isn't it really just saying can I deliver my semen into

219
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,160
 your grain stores. It's one way of putting it it's pretty comparatively direct way of putting it.

220
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,560
 I mean I don't see that there's a more charming way to say it. So this seed vault is very important

221
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,920
 for mankind we think. The reason it's in Svalbard so Svalbard is an island group very very far

222
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,920
 north it's owned by Norway we might get into the entire ownership later but kind of owned by Norway

223
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,280
 it's way above the Arctic Circle and the reason that they put it there is number one hardly any

224
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,640
 people there so that's good very little tectonic activity so it won't get hit by earthquakes or

225
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,800
 anything like that. It's also really cold so it means that if the freezers kind of fail it still

226
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,200
 won't defrost because it's so cold there but most of all it's really really high up and if all of

227
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,240
 the polar ice caps completely melt it will still be above sea level so that's why they put it right

228
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,160
 here at the top of this mountain. Yeah right. I actually know a man who was raised there.

229
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,320
 Really? Really? Yeah in Spitsbergen. Sorry I think it meant in the vault.

230
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:10,000
 No in Spitsbergen which is the coldest place on earth and it's an extraordinary place Spitsbergen

231
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,080
 you have to have a gun when you leave the house because of bears but weirdly my the guy I know

232
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,320
 Sven he was raised you know you have to go out with a gun to shoot bears but when I was reading

233
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,120
 about it it said is although that is true it is also illegal to shoot a bear. Oh really? A nightmare.

234
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,200
 A nightmare but it's the lowest power it's got the lowest crime rate in the whole world

235
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,520
 and anyone can live there you can you don't have to have a visa to go there but there's a reason why

236
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,640
 people don't go there it is all ice all snow in every single direction and it is a very very tricky

237
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,440
 old place to live. It is a mad sounding place the hole is felt bad sounds completely mad so

238
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,680
 what you just said about crime there very low in crime if you commit a crime you can be sent home

239
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,440
 you can be sent away from the hole is felt bad because they just don't have the facilities

240
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,600
 or the time to look after you yeah there are six police officers and there's one detention cell

241
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,560
 and in 2013 there was a crime wave where crime went up by 800% wow now that sounds bad but

242
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,280
 actually what it meant was the year before there was one barb roll and that year there were nine

243
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,280
 barb rolls right it's so weird like there's so many reasons that they send people one is you

244
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,920
 can't die there so you can you can technically die there but then you get sent away so burials don't

245
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,640
 and let that be a lesson to you they say waving you off you are allowed to die but you're not

246
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,400
 allowed to be buried it's not illegal they won't yeah they won't jail you if you die there but

247
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,600
 they will send you away you can't be buried there because and for the reasons that James was saying

248
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,000
 about the fact that you know if all the ice melts and so on if that happens at any point

249
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,480
 with burials if the ice goes down let's say flues or whatever that might be

250
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,400
 still in the bacteria in the body uh that could spread and that that's very dangerous they found

251
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,880
 some bodies um that still had the Spanish flu in them so they buried them in 1990 1980 and

252
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,080
 something like that and it's in permafrost so it's really really cold and they dug them up and

253
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,320
 the bacterium was still alive it's like nature's cryogenics really isn't it yeah yeah yeah and

254
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,240
 you can't be but you can't be born there either yeah so did you say your friend was born there

255
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,080
 well he was raised there oh okay his parents were in fact Austrian I'm telling too many

256
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,400
 details about him now but his parents were Austrian but I don't know if he was born there

257
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,080
 he's definitely they may not have introduced the rule when when he was being born but basically

258
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,320
 they don't have any facilities to give birth so you if you're pregnant there you'll be sent to the

259
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,840
 mainland um a few weeks before your due date so that you can have the baby there and then bring

260
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,960
 it back although there aren't many I don't think there are many are there many children there they

261
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,040
 are because I know it's the most northerly kindergarten in the whole world so there are very

262
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:58,400
 small children there at least unless it's a very empty kindergarten and they used to have one of

263
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,280
 the world's most northerly cats there uh until this year unfortunately the cat died um but the cat

264
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,680
 was uh brought to Svalbard though you're not allowed cats on Svalbard and the reason is that

265
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,480
 they have lots of birds there it's like the ecosystem is really really you know it's a real

266
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,720
 problem if cats come in and start killing things and so the only way it managed to get onto the

267
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,880
 islands was by pretending to be a fox and when I say pretending it was the owners that pretended

268
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,480
 it was a fox but yeah they had to dress up their cat as a fox to smuggle it in I'll be honest I think

269
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,280
 they just filled in the form as a fox but yeah I want to think they dressed it up as a fox

270
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,680
 it's really to story honestly it's a really cute little ginger thing it looks at fox like I reckon

271
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,960
 and people would come from miles around to stroke it because it was the only cat in the

272
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,480
 whole of the country and unfortunately it died although there are rumors of a few other cats

273
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,400
 in the area so you never know most things that are open there are shops and schools and so on

274
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,640
 could you say of them that they are the most all the most it's all the northern ones so they've got

275
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,240
 the northernmost airport they've got the northernmost fully serviced hotel um they've got the northernmost

276
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,280
 school hospital and they also have the world's two most northerly lennon statues so yeah John

277
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:20,000
 John or the other one the other one I'm so sorry then sorry the other one Vladimir Iliac the other

278
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,840
 one yeah yeah but what I would like to see is no such thing as a fish donating a John Lennon statue

279
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,440
 to Spitzbergen great I did I think we will do but it'll be invisible

280
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,800
 you'll only talk about the polar bears on Svalbard yeah sure so the polar bears are really

281
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,560
 interesting they found something quite recently about them in the last five or six years and that

282
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,320
 is they eat dolphins okay not only do they eat dolphins dolphins are pretty big and the polar

283
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,840
 bear can't get through a whole one and so they freeze their leftovers and they come back to them

284
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,800
 later this is amazing there's a guy called John it looks like John arse but I think it's Ors

285
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:04,080
 it's double a r s John well let's call him John arse he found out he like was watching these polar

286
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,320
 bears and he found that they were going getting these dolphins eating some of them and then digging

287
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,200
 a hole in the in the snow putting them in there covering it up and going away and then coming

288
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,480
 back and getting it later wow uh John arse also by the way gets emails every morning from several

289
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,080
 female polar bears what that's kind of his job hot gets emails polar bears in your area

290
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,200
 well global warming I guess yeah they're too hot cool them down um yeah so what happens is they put

291
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,800
 a load of um trackers on the female polar bears in the area and every morning they are set so that

292
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,440
 they send him an email so he gets into work turns on his computer and he just gets a load of emails

293
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,720
 saying where all the polar bears are obviously because you're the scientist you get to pick

294
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,040
 the subject line of the email he should absolutely make the subject line whoa yeah yeah well that just

295
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,680
 sounded like Tallulah bank heads oh darling imagine getting one though in the morning that just says

296
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:06,640
 subject line I'm behind you um we do need to move on to our final fact it is time for our final

297
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,640
 fact of the show and that is Andy my fact is that Tina Turner is currently suing a Tina Turner

298
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:20,400
 lookalike for looking too much like Tina Turner and there's an image on the screen here for those

299
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,280
 of you listening at home it's hard to tell the difference but on the left is the impersonator

300
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,160
 the tribute act she's called Dorothea Coco Fletcher she to be fair she looks pretty pretty

301
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,480
 like Tina Turner and she's an incredibly good singer and she's been touring around Germany

302
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,560
 Austria and Switzerland with a Tina Turner show and Dorothea is 50 years younger than Tina Turner

303
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,960
 nonetheless Tina Turner's lawyers are maintaining that it's too hard to tell which of them is Tina

304
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,120
 Turner which of them is not and that the average punter could be misled into booking tickets for

305
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,160
 Dorothea's show when they actually were hoping to see Tina Turner despite the fact Tina Turner hasn't

306
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,760
 gage for years this legislation has been going on and on and on and you know there it's been going

307
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,080
 on for about two years actually these various legal tussles between the two camps and the lawyers

308
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:13,520
 for the show the Tina Turner tribute show say that only a chronically stupid person could mix up

309
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,520
 the two I don't know I think they look kind of similar I mean you know this is that is I'm not

310
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,280
 saying I'm not chronically stupid but it's a that photo is I think Tina Turner in her 80s or 90s

311
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,760
 phase so she would have been a bit closer in age to Dorothea now she is in her 80s now she's an

312
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,920
 octogenarian and I sort of love her hootspur that she's like no because someone might think that 30

313
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,520
 year old it's me yeah it's me and I'm not having it yeah well she had it from the get-go there was

314
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,080
 a story and Tina Turner is not her real name Anna Bullock is her name yeah Anna made Bullock and

315
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,320
 Tina Turner was a creation by Ike Turner who was her husband at the time abusive husband a very

316
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,200
 famous story of how she broke free of that and sort of rose above but he at the time came up with

317
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,720
 the name Tina Turner and he supposedly trademarked the name because he thought if Tina ever leaves

318
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,080
 he can just swap in another singer and use the name Tina Turner kind of like sugar babes exactly

319
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,320
 just continue the band. Imagine doing that to your wife what a lovely fucking guy

320
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:25,040
 that is a level of evil it's beyond anything any normal human being could think up in my opinion

321
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:31,760
 I don't think he was a nice guy and I'm not sure if I'm alone in that but I'm beginning to think

322
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,760
 he wasn't either but she's got the trademark for Tina Turner now hasn't she? I think in the divorce

323
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,320
 in the divorce basically she got nothing but she did get the name and that was literally the only

324
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,000
 thing she got but it did give her the freedom to be able to go on and do that great things. What

325
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,880
 right to feminism to go all I need is my fucking name and I'll do it all on my own and 40 years from

326
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,600
 now I'll be suing younger tributaries to oblivion but this happens a lot doesn't it? The the acts

327
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,160
 suing tribute acts happens all the time it happens in so many cases one that I was reading about

328
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,000
 was a guy called Pete Rossi who someone said to him you seem very similar to Meatloaf why don't

329
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,880
 you do an act Pete Rossi said yes so he started traveling around the UK as Pete Loaf and you

330
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:25,440
 can't see that guy. He's annoyingly spells it differently PEAT but he um he faced a million

331
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,400
 dollar lawsuit from Meatloaf for doing it and he eventually met Meatloaf and Meatloaf kind of

332
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,960
 then went do you know what you can do it and so he's able to still travel around doing it but yeah

333
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,440
 for a while. Interesting yeah because I guess sometimes it's just like the companies that are

334
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,480
 doing it right or the management that are doing it and then yes exactly yeah yeah exactly Bon Jovi

335
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,840
 had a very similar thing with an all-female Bon Jovi tribute act where even in the writing

336
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,160
 you kind of sound like Bon Jovi we're going we don't really want to do this but do you know what

337
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,160
 they were called? I can't remember do you? No I just I love the names I love the names that

338
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,800
 be the names are amazing because there's there's wrong Jovi and then there's a there's a heavy

339
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:11,440
 metal Abba tribute act called Abba Toa which I think is brilliant there's an all-girl Led Zeppelin

340
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,280
 called Led Zeppelin I mean there are so many good rolling clones I really like Shirley Bassey's

341
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:26,160
 looky like is called Shirley Bassey I like the Oasis band Oasis isn't which is really nice and

342
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,880
 then they get a bit crap favourite crap one is the Black Sabbath tribute act which is just called

343
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,800
 Slack Babeth it's beautiful I really like that tribute act is it elbow the band have got a tribute

344
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:47,920
 act called arse no oh that's fantastic yeah 1949 Proctoring Gamble launched a radio advertising

345
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:54,320
 campaign for a shampoo using a jingle and a character that they created called Tallulah the Tube

346
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,640
 they were sued by Tallulah Bankhead oh my god yeah for uh closely being identified with her

347
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,400
 they were using her it's a very unusual like if it was Steve the Tube for instance should be exactly

348
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,480
 the same yeah and they settled outside a court one thing on the celebrity lookalikes yeah or people

349
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,720
 working as lookalikes the thing is that you're really pegged to the person you're a lookalike for

350
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,520
 obviously and there's a risk that that person might have some reputational damage okay so there was a

351
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,760
 piece in piece of the Guardian by a great channel it's called Tom Lamont in 2016 it's about lookalikes

352
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,720
 where the celebrity is then as it were cancelled so a Tony Blair impersonator who started off in

353
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,440
 1997 incredibly popular lost all his work uh and he used to work with he was called John Broly

354
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,480
 and um he would work with Cherie Blair aka Caroline Bernstein they you know they went all over the

355
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,720
 place being Tony and Cherie together opened a ride at Alton Towers together they lived the high life

356
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,720
 and then when the Iraq war happened nothing career completely completely you know dead yeah

357
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:04,720
 I mean they're the real victims of the Iraq war I'll say

358
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,960
 look I'm not I'm not putting them high on that list I'm just saying and anyway don't worry they

359
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,920
 got so sad for them they got lots of more work after 2007 when he came out of office um we're

360
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,720
 going to have to wrap up soon guys um you don't want to wait you're talking about Cherie Booth

361
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,760
 um one of her relations or ancestors the most famous one probably John Wilkes Booth

362
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:35,280
 so John Wilkes Booth who shot Lincoln in 1865 when that happened there was a man who looked

363
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,600
 almost exactly like John Wilkes Booth and he went around America and basically was almost

364
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,360
 lynched on three separate occasions within a week he kept going to a pub he would go into a pub

365
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,240
 he was called um he was called Jacob Haas and he would just walk into a pub with his friends

366
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,680
 and everyone there would go that's the guy and they would just rile on him and they had to convince

367
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,360
 him that he wasn't John Wilkes Booth and then he would go to the next town the same would happen

368
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,800
 and the next town the same would happen you'd get a label or something wouldn't you although it's

369
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,600
 suspicious actually wearing a big I am not John Wilkes Booth t-shirt more suspicious of anything

370
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,360
 a few final uh tribute act names I found the most northerly um lookalike

371
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,080
 yeah Svalbard lookalike yeah there's a cab driver who looks like Rod Stewart in Svalbard

372
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:29,760
 his name is Nils Engen and um he's 65 years old he said he's constantly being mistaken as the singer

373
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,960
 500 people in Svalbard they must have been they must be wise to the thing now

374
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:42,480
 well what you get in a cab in in a in a town made of ice in the dark and think oh Rod Stewart's not

375
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:51,760
 doing as well as he was I mean he gets paid a million a week just for Maggie May I just don't

376
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,640
 think he does it for the love Deborah he does it he loves driving apparently the tightest man in

377
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,160
 show business never buys around well maybe people started tipping him all and they got out of the cab

378
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,120
 he could afford to um I don't know sorry I wasn't saying that taxi driver was tight I was saying

379
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,360
 Rod Stewart was tight I don't think we were sorry you're saying the taxi driver's the tightest man

380
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,240
 in show business he knows really tight that fucking Norwegian cabbie

381
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:24,480
 you know Brian Cox the actor he's in succession so Brian Cox the actor was dark as a he joined

382
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,200
 equity uh when he was a young man and he found out there was another Brian Cox inequity nightmare

383
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,240
 can't use your own name uh but he hadn't worked for ages this other Brian Cox good news so Brian

384
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,720
 Cox sent the other Brian Cox a begging letter saying you know dear Brian Cox I'm another actor

385
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,360
 with your name it seems like you haven't worked for a while I would be so grateful could you please

386
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,040
 let me play under my own name I'm also Brian Cox right sent this off okay didn't hear back until

387
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,960
 he got a letter soon after that it was from another Brian Cox and it said I I really want your name

388
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,520
 I'm another Brian Cox and it turns out Brian Cox had forgotten that he joined equity many years

389
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,240
 before and wrote him a letter to himself begging for his own name

390
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:12,560
