00:01:08,00:01:18,Okay let's do it on with the pod.
00:01:22,00:01:30,Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish a weekly podcast
00:01:30,00:01:33,this week coming to you live from Brighton.
00:01:33,00:01:45,My name is Dan Shriver I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin and special
00:01:45,00:01:49,guest Debra Francis White and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our
00:01:49,00:01:55,four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with
00:01:55,00:02:03,fact number one and that is Debra. So my fact is that actress Tallulah Bankhead had a parrot
00:02:03,00:02:11,which she taught to say birds can't talk. She also taught her to say who'd want to talk to you.
00:02:11,00:02:18,Nice. And who are you so sometimes someone will come in and say who are you and the person
00:02:18,00:02:25,would answer and go birds can't talk which was a sort of gaslighting parrot really in a very
00:02:25,00:02:31,real way. It was actually I think a minor bird which I'm assured is a sort of a parrot
00:02:31,00:02:39,that might not be accurate but if it isn't email these guys. She had a lot of pets actually she
00:02:39,00:02:45,had a lion cub called Winston Churchill. She bought that when she was in Nevada and she only
00:02:45,00:02:49,went to Nevada so she could get a quick divorce and it used to take curtain calls with her on the
00:02:49,00:02:57,stage. She had a dog called Hitchcock given to her by Hitchcock all her life she had an incredible
00:02:57,00:03:02,series of animals but she was one of the great eccentrics. She was completely amazing and she
00:03:02,00:03:09,most famous as an actor but only really took off she was from America she came to the UK
00:03:10,00:03:15,in 1923 and she spent eight years here doing plays and becoming a real complete sensation
00:03:15,00:03:20,and there was a group of fans called the gallery girls who were a group of teenage cockney girls
00:03:20,00:03:24,who would arrive and just wait in the gallery and whenever she came on stage they would just
00:03:24,00:03:28,scream and cheer and it was incredibly annoying obviously for anyone else who actually wanted
00:03:28,00:03:34,to see the show and you know they would applaud for about as long as she was on stage herself as in
00:03:34,00:03:40,"that long again you know. Yeah they used to sing Tallulah hallelujah, Tallulah hallelujah on and on"
00:03:40,00:03:44,and on and some of the other actors she'd vamp and some of the other actors they'd be like we're
00:03:44,00:03:50,never going to get out of here because she would let it go on but the gallery girls were working as
00:03:50,00:03:55,you say working class women many lesbians and they knew that she was Tallulah was what she called
00:03:55,00:04:05,ambi-sextrous and she famously said my father warned me about men and booze but never said a word
00:04:05,00:04:12,about women and cocaine. She was also said to have slept with 70 percent of the aristocracy
00:04:12,00:04:19,but her her I mean that was what she claimed. I love that idea like the battered old copy of
00:04:19,00:04:26,the brettes like just crossing off the El of Westminster and in fact the Duchess of Kilmore.
00:04:26,00:04:40,Well she did catch quite a lot of things actually. She did generally yeah. She was amazing. She was so famous
00:04:40,00:04:44,in London when she lived there that according to Lord Beaverbrook there were only two people in the
00:04:44,00:04:50,whole of the UK who could be identified by just the first name from an average costamunga and that
00:04:50,00:05:01,was Tallulah and Steve. Steve? Steve? Everyone knows Steve. Let's try and guess it. 1920s Steve?
00:05:01,00:05:07,Steve? I mean good luck because I can see the answer. Okay. Is this person still famous? Oh
00:05:07,00:05:16,no. It was Steve Donahue the great English jockey. Oh that's amazing. And she loved a bit at the
00:05:16,00:05:20,races as well. Oh she did? Yes. You'd see her photograph with the Prince of Wales at the races
00:05:20,00:05:26,and she was friends with the Arga Khan but she would often come to the door without any clothes on
00:05:26,00:05:30,just with a strand of pearls around her neck even the stage door she'd come without any clothes on
00:05:30,00:05:36,and she once said to an aristocrat at a stuffy party who was there with his wife
00:05:36,00:05:41,who she had slept with many times he looked away from her and she said what's the matter darling
00:05:41,00:05:48,don't you recognize me with my clothes on? She was wonderful with those kind of quips and also
00:05:48,00:05:54,the nudity thing like she used to do that not just in sort of her personal life but on sets of movies
00:05:54,00:06:00,she'd just get naked and start cartwheeling everywhere. Loved a nude cartwheel. Yeah. Pantsless
00:06:00,00:06:04,cartwheels with her speciality. So you think it was a normal cartwheel and then she'd get to the top
00:06:04,00:06:09,of the car. We didn't know it was a very special car wheel actually. Yeah so that might be the other
00:06:09,00:06:13,thing she might have her clothes on but she wouldn't have any underpants on and there was a thing with
00:06:13,00:06:18,a movie she was on it was an Alfred Hitchcock movie where they did get complaints and they told
00:06:18,00:06:24,Hitchcock we've got to sort this out and Hitchcock reportedly said back that he didn't know if it was
00:06:24,00:06:33,a matter for wardrobe or hairdressing. She inspired amazing quits from everywhere. That's the thing.
00:06:33,00:06:38,Do you want to hear another Tallulah line? Yeah this is where she saw former lover of hers and she
00:06:38,00:06:43,saw him for the first time in years and she said to him I thought I told you to wait in the car.
00:06:43,00:06:51,She also she used to say I hate to go to bed I hate to get up and I hate to be alone
00:06:52,00:07:00,and so she employed in her later years middle aged and a bit later probably until she died
00:07:00,00:07:06,young gay men she called Cadiz to sit with her while she fell asleep and I mean she was such a
00:07:06,00:07:13,gay icon you can imagine because she was they were happy to do it but she paid them to sit with her
00:07:13,00:07:18,"and they would hold her hand but they did other things for her as well. They'd light her cigarettes,"
00:07:18,00:07:23,draw her baths you know just generally make her life more convenient. She never liked being alone
00:07:23,00:07:26,even if she was asleep so if she wasn't sleeping with anyone that night on the rare night she
00:07:26,00:07:31,wasn't sleeping with anyone she would hire a caddy which I might do in my older years.
00:07:31,00:07:35,What did they did they speak to her or any for no was it just holding the hand?
00:07:35,00:07:38,They were just there so she felt comfortable going to sleep she didn't like being alone
00:07:38,00:07:44,and so she was sweet but it has pathos. Absolutely yeah she was a she was a rather
00:07:44,00:07:51,tragic figure. Her last ever words were bourbon codeine which told you about her life but in her
00:07:51,00:07:57,book in her autobiography she denies being a cocaine addict and she absolutely was. Yeah in the
00:07:57,00:08:02,book she says that what happened was and I agree that this is not true but this is what she says
00:08:02,00:08:06,she said one time she got really really really drunk and she decided she was going to give up
00:08:06,00:08:11,drink for a few days and she said okay well what I'm going to do is if anyone says do you want
00:08:11,00:08:15,to drink I'm going to say oh no thank you I don't drink have you got any cocaine right and that
00:08:15,00:08:21,would get people to stop her getting drunk. The problem is the one day someone called her bluff
00:08:21,00:08:24,according to her and that's why she had some cocaine and then the next day someone else did
00:08:24,00:08:29,and the next day someone else did. Tower happens going at the slippery slippery slope.
00:08:29,00:08:35,Well she had the sick because it was alcohol it was cocaine it was sex a lot of sex and she had
00:08:35,00:08:40,this moment where she had to go to hospital to have an emergency hysterectomy brought on by
00:08:40,00:08:46,gonorrhea I believe and so she got really ill she was rendered infertile she was in hospital her
00:08:46,00:08:51,weight had gone down to 75 pounds and they were trying to say you know subtly that you got to
00:08:51,00:08:55,change your life and the the thing that she used to say to the doctors as they were sort of leaving
00:08:55,00:09:02,the room as she would yell at them going don't think this has taught me a lesson. She was just pure badass.
00:09:02,00:09:07,There's no other way of putting it. Yeah she's a force of nature energy levels. One of her friends
00:09:07,00:09:12,followed her around for a day with a stopwatch timing her speech and estimated that she spoke
00:09:12,00:09:19,70 000 words a day which is a lot that's a short novel. Wow. You just gave me a like
00:09:19,00:09:26,lightweight. Yeah I could do that my lunch time. That's quite a weird thing to do with someone
00:09:26,00:09:30,estimate their word count. I think there are a lot of sort of crazy people in the 20s just going
00:09:30,00:09:35,around being fabulous around Tallulah she's like this is my caddy this is my word counter how many
00:09:35,00:09:42,have you done so far was that like the original pedometer. She had an amazing voice didn't she
00:09:42,00:09:47,that's what she's quite famous for she had a very deep husky voice. She said in the autobiography
00:09:47,00:09:52,that her voice has been likened to the mating call of the caribou. Gosh I listened to her on
00:09:52,00:09:57,desert island discs and that explains a lot actually. It explains why all the caribou ran into
00:09:57,00:10:03,you for me. What if you heard her voice because I haven't actually heard her voice. You know like that.
00:10:03,00:10:13,"Well darling, well well. Does she have tanny? Does she say words? Was I her daughter?"
00:10:13,00:10:16,I'll give you one of the things she actually said this is the thing she actually said she said
00:10:16,00:10:23,I'll come and make love to you at five o'clock if I'm late start without me. She said that on desert island discs.
00:10:23,00:10:32,Roy probably did not know where to look. We're going to move on to our next fact.
00:10:32,00:10:38,Okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that this year
00:10:38,00:10:45,an invisible statue made of air went to auction with an estimate of five thousand pounds.
00:10:45,00:10:53,The piece sold for thirteen thousand pounds and the winner went home with literally nothing.
00:10:53,00:10:58,Well that's not quite true he had a certificate to prove he had nothing to go home with.
00:10:58,00:11:03,It's amazing. It's incredible yeah so this is an artist called Salvatore Garrao and he's done a
00:11:03,00:11:10,couple of art pieces where it's invisible. This particular piece is has he has he really has
00:11:10,00:11:19,he done has he done fuck all in fact. I have to say I buy into it. I'm probably in the minority
00:11:19,00:11:24,but I do likely I do that as some as soon as someone says let's imagine we're saying right now in
00:11:24,00:11:31,front of us is a hovering Yeti. We now all know that I've said there's a hovering invisible Yeti
00:11:31,00:11:39,there. It's there. Would anyone like to buy it? Okay that didn't go well. No so this was an art piece
00:11:39,00:11:44,that was called I Am and that's the English translation. Yes that's the short version the
00:11:44,00:11:54,full title is I am thirteen thousand pounds richer thanks to you suckers. So the the instructions for
00:11:54,00:11:58,if someone was buying this was that you need a room that is five foot long and five foot wide.
00:11:58,00:12:04,Oh my gosh so you've got to buy all of the extras as well. You've got to buy a room to put it in.
00:12:04,00:12:10,Lighting and environment are optional due to the fact that it doesn't exist. Could you put it
00:12:10,00:12:15,outdoors or would the weather. Yeah you can put it outdoors if you like. So we can get weather
00:12:15,00:12:24,damaged. Is it fungible or non fungible? He does know what that means. Does anybody. Does anybody.
00:12:24,00:12:32,This is very very controversial though I should say because he is being sued by another artist who
00:12:32,00:12:40,also created nothing. Oh interesting. I know this is a guy called Tom Miller who's a performance
00:12:40,00:12:46,artist from Florida and he said that he was the first person to do an invisible sculpture.
00:12:46,00:12:49,We might go on to the fact that many other people have done that as well but he says
00:12:49,00:12:54,that he did it and what he did was he went into like a community area and he got a load of people
00:12:54,00:13:00,to pretend they were moving blocks like almost like building the pyramids or something so they
00:13:00,00:13:05,just put some empty stuff here and then so it's like a performance of making an invisible sculpture
00:13:05,00:13:10,and he's currently suing Salvatore. Yeah and he said he easily could have found out that I had
00:13:10,00:13:16,done this previous to him. All he needed to do was google Tom Miller nothing and that would have
00:13:16,00:13:21,and you're like I don't know. Why would you ever do that? Why would you ever do that but we should
00:13:21,00:13:26,all if any of us has any artistic endeavor going forward should google Tom Miller and then whatever
00:13:26,00:13:34,it is. Just a double check. Have you guys familiar with Tom Friedman as another artist? He produced
00:13:34,00:13:38,a piece of work which again it's like the idea of everyone buying into something and sort of
00:13:38,00:13:42,investing something with meaning I do think has a lot of merit actually so Tom Friedman came up
00:13:42,00:13:47,with this work of art which is a sheet of paper and it's called A Thousand Hours of Staring and
00:13:47,00:13:52,it's a sheet of paper that he spent a thousand hours staring at and then just displayed. It's
00:13:52,00:13:56,still empty still completely blank but it's called A Thousand Hours of Staring. It took him five years
00:13:57,00:14:02,just 1992 to 2007. To be fair to be an expert at staring at a piece of paper you'd have to do
00:14:02,00:14:08,ten thousand hours with him. That's true. That's an amateur. I'm paying for that. Was that Tom Friedman
00:14:08,00:14:13,you said? That was Tom Friedman. So Tom Friedman did another one called Untitled A Curse which was
00:14:13,00:14:19,again just an empty pedestal but he had employed a professional witch to put a curse on an invisible
00:14:19,00:14:27,sphere above it. Similarly on eBay you can buy things that are not really things. There was a
00:14:27,00:14:34,man who sold a ghost in a jar but he said I will not be responsible for the black spook that comes
00:14:34,00:14:42,"out if you take the lid off and the bidding went up to 55,000 dollars. No. Yeah but the final bidder"
00:14:42,00:14:47,didn't buy it didn't didn't pay just disappeared so I think the ghost was bidding against everyone
00:14:47,00:14:54,else to stay in this man's house. But there was also a haunted rubber duck sold on eBay.
00:14:54,00:14:58,A rubber duck that according to its owner had the power to possess children. The seller said he
00:14:58,00:15:04,would not be responsible for the duck after shipping. He will not field questions or help to
00:15:04,00:15:10,explain its unusual mystique. The duck sold after a week making him a profit of $107.50.
00:15:11,00:15:18,So if you put just any old crap on eBay and say it's haunted people will bid for it.
00:15:18,00:15:21,Everything you've said I will have bid on it at that point.
00:15:21,00:15:25,Don't you remember we were in Newcastle a few weeks ago and we were chatting to the
00:15:25,00:15:31,night porter after hours we were having a few drinks and he said that the boxer Chris Eubank
00:15:31,00:15:36,Jr had been there the day before and he was outside and taking selfies and doing signatures
00:15:36,00:15:41,and stuff like that. And some Joddy came up to him with a microwave and said will you sign my
00:15:41,00:15:48,"microwave please. And he signed his microwave and then it sold on eBay for £60,000."
00:15:48,00:15:56,There's video footage of it it's amazing. Have you heard of Mauricio Catalan? No. I love we're
00:15:56,00:16:01,on a roll with these great artists now. So Mauricio Catalan this was an exhibition in fact in 2012
00:16:01,00:16:06,the Haberd Gallery in London they hosted an exhibition of drawings of art about invisibility.
00:16:06,00:16:12,So there was a pedestal that Andy Warhol had stood on briefly to kind of create an anti-statute
00:16:12,00:16:17,whatever. Mauricio Catalan produced a work of art based on a claim that he had made
00:16:17,00:16:24,that in his car he had been keeping an invisible work of art. The car was then broken into and the
00:16:24,00:16:29,artwork stolen. The work of art that he claimed had existed was not the work of art that he
00:16:29,00:16:35,submitted. What he submitted was the police report by the police who had to take it seriously
00:16:35,00:16:41,and investigate his claim that the invisible work of art had been stolen. Wow and you can see it in
00:16:41,00:16:45,the museum this police report which he got a copy of. And the police took that seriously? I don't
00:16:45,00:16:49,know how seriously. I mean I guess the car had been broken into so that's that's breaking and
00:16:49,00:16:56,entering if nothing else. I don't know I don't know how long they looked for it. It must be nice
00:16:56,00:17:01,to be a man because when women commit for report crimes we just don't get the same sort of response.
00:17:03,00:17:07,We're going to move on very soon so let's get a few more couple of things in here. I've got one
00:17:07,00:17:15,"about signing something. Yeah sure. Okay and making something invaluable, invaluable. In 1922"
00:17:15,00:17:20,all my facts are from the 20s just by the way. I love I just love and revel in the 20s it's where
00:17:20,00:17:31,I belong. And I'm back in them. Oh I've just realized. This is amazing. What a good moment. I'm in the 20s.
00:17:31,00:17:42,But Einstein was once at Tokyo's Imperial Hotel in 1922 and he didn't have any money to tip the
00:17:42,00:17:50,bellboy. So instead he wrote him two notes. The first said a calm and modest life brings more
00:17:50,00:17:56,happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness. And the second said
00:17:56,00:18:04,where there's a will there's a way. In 2017 guess what that first tip sold for? So the physical
00:18:04,00:18:08,handwriting. Yeah it was the note the calm and modest life one guess what it sold for. A few
00:18:08,00:18:15,grand I should think. Same by Einstein. Five grand. I'll say 20 grand. I'm gonna go a million.
00:18:15,00:18:20,1.56 million. Yeah. Wow. The second one got a mere quarter of a meal but it's because it was a
00:18:20,00:18:24,bit of a cliche he wasn't really trying. Where there's a will there's a way. Come on Einstein you
00:18:24,00:18:29,could do better than that. There's a story I don't know if it's true but there's a story that Mozart
00:18:29,00:18:32,if he was passing someone on the street and they asked for money and he didn't have any change on
00:18:32,00:18:38,him that he would quickly grab a pen and a quill and would quickly write a quick little song
00:18:38,00:18:42,and give it to them and say sell that and get
00:18:42,00:18:53,it wasn't one of his famous ones was it? It was because I don't know if this is true
00:18:53,00:18:58,but yeah but he would just do that. Would he do a new one's bespoke for you? Yeah yeah he would
00:18:58,00:19:08,just go ask you. It doesn't sound very good. It doesn't matter if it's good or not. It's Mozart.
00:19:08,00:19:16,It's yeah it's Mozart. He could write. It could make a tune but the point about Mozart is that
00:19:16,00:19:23,he was really really good. No but he was. This is a change. This is. It's not going to do a symphony
00:19:23,00:19:27,if he's just trying to give someone you know for hours you know this is like when you go to when
00:19:27,00:19:32,a famous person used to go to places where they would kind of think is it possible that when I
00:19:32,00:19:36,give them the check with my signature on that they're going to keep the check and not bank it
00:19:36,00:19:40,because it's worth more to them and me not so that would be the trade off. Well there is that story
00:19:40,00:19:45,I think it's supposed to be by Picasso who was in a restaurant and he hadn't he had his meal and
00:19:45,00:19:50,they said can you uh instead of paying can you draw me a picture and he drew them a picture
00:19:50,00:19:54,and then they said oh would you sign it Mr Picasso and he said no I want his pay for the
00:19:54,00:20:02,dinner not for the entire building. What a dick move to say that. So what you're saying is Mozart
00:20:02,00:20:07,basically invented the cameo app. Yes to an extent. The original so you'd say to your friend oh
00:20:07,00:20:12,you know you love that Mozart don't you he just he just wrote me this. He gives it to the guy yeah
00:20:12,00:20:17,and then the guy just sells it saying I've got an original Mozart. Well yeah he goes then to
00:20:17,00:20:24,a sort of yeah who's he going to? He goes to the the institution of music and and they take it
00:20:24,00:20:33,and they go wow yeah okay classic armadillos let's get this but we um we we do need to move on uh
00:20:33,00:20:40,to our next fact. So it is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay my fact this week
00:20:40,00:20:46,is that the doomsday vault in Svalbard which keeps backups of more than a million of the
00:20:46,00:20:52,world's seeds gets regular requests by men who wish to deposit their own seed there.
00:20:52,00:21:04,I saw this on a youtube clip by an account called Veritasium and they went to this doomsday vault
00:21:04,00:21:08,in Svalbard where they keep all of these seeds and the idea is that every country can put seeds in
00:21:08,00:21:13,there and if they have any problems if you know if there's disease that kind of kills off some plants
00:21:13,00:21:17,then they can bring their seeds back out and they can regrow the plants and hopefully it will help
00:21:17,00:21:24,the diversity of the earth. Now there is a lady who manages a vault called Benta Nevedal and she
00:21:24,00:21:29,like said lots of things that was happening there but one thing she said is they often get letters
00:21:29,00:21:35,from men asking to deposit their semen and she says that they never answer those letters that's
00:21:35,00:21:39,all I can really say about it is that they never answer them but on a fairly regular basis they
00:21:39,00:21:45,get these requests. Wow okay well good to know why I didn't get a letter back.
00:21:45,00:21:53,It's like an extremely strange dick pic isn't it really just saying can I deliver my semen into
00:21:53,00:22:00,your grain stores. It's one way of putting it it's pretty comparatively direct way of putting it.
00:22:00,00:22:08,I mean I don't see that there's a more charming way to say it. So this seed vault is very important
00:22:08,00:22:13,for mankind we think. The reason it's in Svalbard so Svalbard is an island group very very far
00:22:13,00:22:19,north it's owned by Norway we might get into the entire ownership later but kind of owned by Norway
00:22:19,00:22:25,it's way above the Arctic Circle and the reason that they put it there is number one hardly any
00:22:25,00:22:30,people there so that's good very little tectonic activity so it won't get hit by earthquakes or
00:22:30,00:22:36,anything like that. It's also really cold so it means that if the freezers kind of fail it still
00:22:36,00:22:43,won't defrost because it's so cold there but most of all it's really really high up and if all of
00:22:43,00:22:48,the polar ice caps completely melt it will still be above sea level so that's why they put it right
00:22:48,00:22:52,here at the top of this mountain. Yeah right. I actually know a man who was raised there.
00:22:52,00:22:56,Really? Really? Yeah in Spitsbergen. Sorry I think it meant in the vault.
00:23:01,00:23:10,No in Spitsbergen which is the coldest place on earth and it's an extraordinary place Spitsbergen
00:23:10,00:23:18,you have to have a gun when you leave the house because of bears but weirdly my the guy I know
00:23:18,00:23:24,Sven he was raised you know you have to go out with a gun to shoot bears but when I was reading
00:23:24,00:23:31,about it it said is although that is true it is also illegal to shoot a bear. Oh really? A nightmare.
00:23:31,00:23:35,A nightmare but it's the lowest power it's got the lowest crime rate in the whole world
00:23:35,00:23:41,and anyone can live there you can you don't have to have a visa to go there but there's a reason why
00:23:41,00:23:48,people don't go there it is all ice all snow in every single direction and it is a very very tricky
00:23:48,00:23:53,old place to live. It is a mad sounding place the hole is felt bad sounds completely mad so
00:23:53,00:23:59,what you just said about crime there very low in crime if you commit a crime you can be sent home
00:23:59,00:24:03,you can be sent away from the hole is felt bad because they just don't have the facilities
00:24:03,00:24:07,or the time to look after you yeah there are six police officers and there's one detention cell
00:24:07,00:24:14,and in 2013 there was a crime wave where crime went up by 800% wow now that sounds bad but
00:24:14,00:24:19,actually what it meant was the year before there was one barb roll and that year there were nine
00:24:19,00:24:25,barb rolls right it's so weird like there's so many reasons that they send people one is you
00:24:25,00:24:31,can't die there so you can you can technically die there but then you get sent away so burials don't
00:24:31,00:24:36,and let that be a lesson to you they say waving you off you are allowed to die but you're not
00:24:36,00:24:40,allowed to be buried it's not illegal they won't yeah they won't jail you if you die there but
00:24:40,00:24:45,they will send you away you can't be buried there because and for the reasons that James was saying
00:24:45,00:24:50,about the fact that you know if all the ice melts and so on if that happens at any point
00:24:50,00:24:54,with burials if the ice goes down let's say flues or whatever that might be
00:24:54,00:24:58,still in the bacteria in the body uh that could spread and that that's very dangerous they found
00:24:58,00:25:04,some bodies um that still had the Spanish flu in them so they buried them in 1990 1980 and
00:25:04,00:25:10,something like that and it's in permafrost so it's really really cold and they dug them up and
00:25:10,00:25:16,the bacterium was still alive it's like nature's cryogenics really isn't it yeah yeah yeah and
00:25:16,00:25:20,you can't be but you can't be born there either yeah so did you say your friend was born there
00:25:20,00:25:24,well he was raised there oh okay his parents were in fact Austrian I'm telling too many
00:25:24,00:25:28,details about him now but his parents were Austrian but I don't know if he was born there
00:25:28,00:25:32,he's definitely they may not have introduced the rule when when he was being born but basically
00:25:32,00:25:36,they don't have any facilities to give birth so you if you're pregnant there you'll be sent to the
00:25:36,00:25:41,mainland um a few weeks before your due date so that you can have the baby there and then bring
00:25:41,00:25:46,it back although there aren't many I don't think there are many are there many children there they
00:25:46,00:25:51,are because I know it's the most northerly kindergarten in the whole world so there are very
00:25:51,00:25:58,small children there at least unless it's a very empty kindergarten and they used to have one of
00:25:58,00:26:05,the world's most northerly cats there uh until this year unfortunately the cat died um but the cat
00:26:05,00:26:09,was uh brought to Svalbard though you're not allowed cats on Svalbard and the reason is that
00:26:09,00:26:14,they have lots of birds there it's like the ecosystem is really really you know it's a real
00:26:14,00:26:18,problem if cats come in and start killing things and so the only way it managed to get onto the
00:26:18,00:26:24,islands was by pretending to be a fox and when I say pretending it was the owners that pretended
00:26:24,00:26:30,it was a fox but yeah they had to dress up their cat as a fox to smuggle it in I'll be honest I think
00:26:30,00:26:35,they just filled in the form as a fox but yeah I want to think they dressed it up as a fox
00:26:35,00:26:41,it's really to story honestly it's a really cute little ginger thing it looks at fox like I reckon
00:26:41,00:26:44,and people would come from miles around to stroke it because it was the only cat in the
00:26:44,00:26:50,whole of the country and unfortunately it died although there are rumors of a few other cats
00:26:50,00:26:56,in the area so you never know most things that are open there are shops and schools and so on
00:26:56,00:27:00,could you say of them that they are the most all the most it's all the northern ones so they've got
00:27:00,00:27:06,the northernmost airport they've got the northernmost fully serviced hotel um they've got the northernmost
00:27:06,00:27:13,school hospital and they also have the world's two most northerly lennon statues so yeah John
00:27:13,00:27:20,John or the other one the other one I'm so sorry then sorry the other one Vladimir Iliac the other
00:27:20,00:27:25,one yeah yeah but what I would like to see is no such thing as a fish donating a John Lennon statue
00:27:25,00:27:29,to Spitzbergen great I did I think we will do but it'll be invisible
00:27:29,00:27:36,you'll only talk about the polar bears on Svalbard yeah sure so the polar bears are really
00:27:36,00:27:40,interesting they found something quite recently about them in the last five or six years and that
00:27:40,00:27:46,is they eat dolphins okay not only do they eat dolphins dolphins are pretty big and the polar
00:27:46,00:27:51,bear can't get through a whole one and so they freeze their leftovers and they come back to them
00:27:51,00:27:56,later this is amazing there's a guy called John it looks like John arse but I think it's Ors
00:27:56,00:28:04,it's double a r s John well let's call him John arse he found out he like was watching these polar
00:28:04,00:28:08,bears and he found that they were going getting these dolphins eating some of them and then digging
00:28:08,00:28:13,a hole in the in the snow putting them in there covering it up and going away and then coming
00:28:13,00:28:18,back and getting it later wow uh John arse also by the way gets emails every morning from several
00:28:18,00:28:24,female polar bears what that's kind of his job hot gets emails polar bears in your area
00:28:24,00:28:31,well global warming I guess yeah they're too hot cool them down um yeah so what happens is they put
00:28:31,00:28:36,a load of um trackers on the female polar bears in the area and every morning they are set so that
00:28:36,00:28:41,they send him an email so he gets into work turns on his computer and he just gets a load of emails
00:28:41,00:28:44,saying where all the polar bears are obviously because you're the scientist you get to pick
00:28:44,00:28:51,the subject line of the email he should absolutely make the subject line whoa yeah yeah well that just
00:28:51,00:28:57,sounded like Tallulah bank heads oh darling imagine getting one though in the morning that just says
00:28:57,00:29:06,subject line I'm behind you um we do need to move on to our final fact it is time for our final
00:29:06,00:29:12,fact of the show and that is Andy my fact is that Tina Turner is currently suing a Tina Turner
00:29:12,00:29:20,lookalike for looking too much like Tina Turner and there's an image on the screen here for those
00:29:20,00:29:25,of you listening at home it's hard to tell the difference but on the left is the impersonator
00:29:25,00:29:30,the tribute act she's called Dorothea Coco Fletcher she to be fair she looks pretty pretty
00:29:30,00:29:34,like Tina Turner and she's an incredibly good singer and she's been touring around Germany
00:29:34,00:29:40,Austria and Switzerland with a Tina Turner show and Dorothea is 50 years younger than Tina Turner
00:29:40,00:29:44,nonetheless Tina Turner's lawyers are maintaining that it's too hard to tell which of them is Tina
00:29:44,00:29:49,Turner which of them is not and that the average punter could be misled into booking tickets for
00:29:49,00:29:54,Dorothea's show when they actually were hoping to see Tina Turner despite the fact Tina Turner hasn't
00:29:54,00:29:59,gage for years this legislation has been going on and on and on and you know there it's been going
00:29:59,00:30:06,on for about two years actually these various legal tussles between the two camps and the lawyers
00:30:06,00:30:13,for the show the Tina Turner tribute show say that only a chronically stupid person could mix up
00:30:13,00:30:19,the two I don't know I think they look kind of similar I mean you know this is that is I'm not
00:30:19,00:30:25,saying I'm not chronically stupid but it's a that photo is I think Tina Turner in her 80s or 90s
00:30:25,00:30:29,phase so she would have been a bit closer in age to Dorothea now she is in her 80s now she's an
00:30:29,00:30:35,octogenarian and I sort of love her hootspur that she's like no because someone might think that 30
00:30:35,00:30:41,year old it's me yeah it's me and I'm not having it yeah well she had it from the get-go there was
00:30:41,00:30:48,a story and Tina Turner is not her real name Anna Bullock is her name yeah Anna made Bullock and
00:30:48,00:30:54,Tina Turner was a creation by Ike Turner who was her husband at the time abusive husband a very
00:30:54,00:30:59,famous story of how she broke free of that and sort of rose above but he at the time came up with
00:30:59,00:31:04,the name Tina Turner and he supposedly trademarked the name because he thought if Tina ever leaves
00:31:04,00:31:10,he can just swap in another singer and use the name Tina Turner kind of like sugar babes exactly
00:31:10,00:31:16,just continue the band. Imagine doing that to your wife what a lovely fucking guy
00:31:16,00:31:25,that is a level of evil it's beyond anything any normal human being could think up in my opinion
00:31:25,00:31:31,I don't think he was a nice guy and I'm not sure if I'm alone in that but I'm beginning to think
00:31:31,00:31:37,he wasn't either but she's got the trademark for Tina Turner now hasn't she? I think in the divorce
00:31:37,00:31:42,in the divorce basically she got nothing but she did get the name and that was literally the only
00:31:42,00:31:46,thing she got but it did give her the freedom to be able to go on and do that great things. What
00:31:46,00:31:50,right to feminism to go all I need is my fucking name and I'll do it all on my own and 40 years from
00:31:50,00:31:57,now I'll be suing younger tributaries to oblivion but this happens a lot doesn't it? The the acts
00:31:57,00:32:02,suing tribute acts happens all the time it happens in so many cases one that I was reading about
00:32:02,00:32:08,was a guy called Pete Rossi who someone said to him you seem very similar to Meatloaf why don't
00:32:08,00:32:16,you do an act Pete Rossi said yes so he started traveling around the UK as Pete Loaf and you
00:32:16,00:32:25,can't see that guy. He's annoyingly spells it differently PEAT but he um he faced a million
00:32:25,00:32:32,dollar lawsuit from Meatloaf for doing it and he eventually met Meatloaf and Meatloaf kind of
00:32:32,00:32:36,then went do you know what you can do it and so he's able to still travel around doing it but yeah
00:32:36,00:32:41,for a while. Interesting yeah because I guess sometimes it's just like the companies that are
00:32:41,00:32:46,doing it right or the management that are doing it and then yes exactly yeah yeah exactly Bon Jovi
00:32:46,00:32:51,had a very similar thing with an all-female Bon Jovi tribute act where even in the writing
00:32:51,00:32:56,you kind of sound like Bon Jovi we're going we don't really want to do this but do you know what
00:32:56,00:33:00,they were called? I can't remember do you? No I just I love the names I love the names that
00:33:00,00:33:04,be the names are amazing because there's there's wrong Jovi and then there's a there's a heavy
00:33:04,00:33:11,metal Abba tribute act called Abba Toa which I think is brilliant there's an all-girl Led Zeppelin
00:33:11,00:33:17,called Led Zeppelin I mean there are so many good rolling clones I really like Shirley Bassey's
00:33:17,00:33:26,looky like is called Shirley Bassey I like the Oasis band Oasis isn't which is really nice and
00:33:26,00:33:30,then they get a bit crap favourite crap one is the Black Sabbath tribute act which is just called
00:33:30,00:33:38,Slack Babeth it's beautiful I really like that tribute act is it elbow the band have got a tribute
00:33:38,00:33:47,act called arse no oh that's fantastic yeah 1949 Proctoring Gamble launched a radio advertising
00:33:47,00:33:54,campaign for a shampoo using a jingle and a character that they created called Tallulah the Tube
00:33:54,00:34:02,they were sued by Tallulah Bankhead oh my god yeah for uh closely being identified with her
00:34:02,00:34:08,they were using her it's a very unusual like if it was Steve the Tube for instance should be exactly
00:34:08,00:34:14,the same yeah and they settled outside a court one thing on the celebrity lookalikes yeah or people
00:34:14,00:34:18,working as lookalikes the thing is that you're really pegged to the person you're a lookalike for
00:34:18,00:34:23,obviously and there's a risk that that person might have some reputational damage okay so there was a
00:34:23,00:34:27,piece in piece of the Guardian by a great channel it's called Tom Lamont in 2016 it's about lookalikes
00:34:27,00:34:32,where the celebrity is then as it were cancelled so a Tony Blair impersonator who started off in
00:34:32,00:34:39,1997 incredibly popular lost all his work uh and he used to work with he was called John Broly
00:34:39,00:34:44,and um he would work with Cherie Blair aka Caroline Bernstein they you know they went all over the
00:34:44,00:34:48,place being Tony and Cherie together opened a ride at Alton Towers together they lived the high life
00:34:48,00:34:54,and then when the Iraq war happened nothing career completely completely you know dead yeah
00:34:54,00:35:04,I mean they're the real victims of the Iraq war I'll say
00:35:04,00:35:08,look I'm not I'm not putting them high on that list I'm just saying and anyway don't worry they
00:35:08,00:35:13,got so sad for them they got lots of more work after 2007 when he came out of office um we're
00:35:13,00:35:20,going to have to wrap up soon guys um you don't want to wait you're talking about Cherie Booth
00:35:20,00:35:27,um one of her relations or ancestors the most famous one probably John Wilkes Booth
00:35:27,00:35:35,so John Wilkes Booth who shot Lincoln in 1865 when that happened there was a man who looked
00:35:35,00:35:41,almost exactly like John Wilkes Booth and he went around America and basically was almost
00:35:41,00:35:47,lynched on three separate occasions within a week he kept going to a pub he would go into a pub
00:35:47,00:35:52,he was called um he was called Jacob Haas and he would just walk into a pub with his friends
00:35:52,00:35:57,and everyone there would go that's the guy and they would just rile on him and they had to convince
00:35:57,00:36:01,him that he wasn't John Wilkes Booth and then he would go to the next town the same would happen
00:36:01,00:36:04,and the next town the same would happen you'd get a label or something wouldn't you although it's
00:36:04,00:36:09,suspicious actually wearing a big I am not John Wilkes Booth t-shirt more suspicious of anything
00:36:09,00:36:15,a few final uh tribute act names I found the most northerly um lookalike
00:36:15,00:36:22,yeah Svalbard lookalike yeah there's a cab driver who looks like Rod Stewart in Svalbard
00:36:22,00:36:29,his name is Nils Engen and um he's 65 years old he said he's constantly being mistaken as the singer
00:36:29,00:36:34,500 people in Svalbard they must have been they must be wise to the thing now
00:36:35,00:36:42,well what you get in a cab in in a in a town made of ice in the dark and think oh Rod Stewart's not
00:36:42,00:36:51,doing as well as he was I mean he gets paid a million a week just for Maggie May I just don't
00:36:51,00:36:56,think he does it for the love Deborah he does it he loves driving apparently the tightest man in
00:36:56,00:37:02,show business never buys around well maybe people started tipping him all and they got out of the cab
00:37:02,00:37:07,he could afford to um I don't know sorry I wasn't saying that taxi driver was tight I was saying
00:37:07,00:37:11,Rod Stewart was tight I don't think we were sorry you're saying the taxi driver's the tightest man
