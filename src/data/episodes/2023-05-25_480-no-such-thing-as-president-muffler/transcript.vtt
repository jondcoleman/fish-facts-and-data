00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200
 - Hello and welcome to a brand new episode

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.680
 of No Such Things as Fish.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.120
 First things first, let me tell you

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.680
 about our very, very, very special guest

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.560
 and that is Phil Dunster, the brilliant actor

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.520
 who plays the character Jamie Tartt

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.680
 in the unbelievable TV show, Ted Lasso.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.080
 I don't know if you've watched Ted Lasso,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.600
 if you haven't, it's definitely worth checking out.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.640
 It's on Apple TV right now.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.920
 They're about to show the final episode

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.280
 and if you don't have Apple TV,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.400
 I'm pretty sure you'll be able

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000
 to get a free trial somewhere and it's well worth it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 There's loads of good stuff on there

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.960
 but especially Ted Lasso is such a good show.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 Phil actually does listen to fish

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.280
 so he came well prepared with loads and loads of facts.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.260
 It was such a fun show to record

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.800
 and we all had such a great time.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.880
 Few more little bits of news.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.240
 We have some live shows coming up

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.600
 in the Soho Theatre in London.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.360
 There are still tickets available for that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.680
 although some of the dates are now sold out

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.120
 so you wanna get in there really quick

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.440
 to get tickets for that

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.640
 and those tickets can be found

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.320
 at knowstichthingasafish.com/soho

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.760
 and apart from that, join up to Club Fish.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.040
 There's loads of fun stuff happening there all the time.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.440
 There's bonus episodes, there's Discord

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.880
 where you can chat to fellow Fish fans.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 You'll learn about live tickets first.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.640
 There's all sorts of bonuses for signing up to that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 so do that and apart from anything else,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 if you're listening in a place

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 where you can follow knowstichthingasafish then do that.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.880
 We taught some industry bots the other day

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.160
 and they said that is very important

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.240
 that you click follow if you like us.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.200
 Anyway, enough about that.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 Really hope you enjoy this show with Phil.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480
 I'm absolutely certain you will

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.840
 and all I can say is on with a podcast.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.420
 (upbeat music)

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.720
 of knowstichthingasafish,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.280
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.360
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.640
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.880
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Phil Dunster.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.440
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.040
 Starting with fact number one, that is Phil.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.040
 - My fact this week is that the Shakespeare's Globe Theater

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.840
 is the only building with a thatched roof in London

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.280
 since the great fire of London in 1666.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.000
 - Very cool.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.880
 - Andy is very excited right now.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.720
 - That's so excited.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.880
 - Thatched roofs, are you kidding me?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.720
 - Yeah.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.560
 - This is brilliant.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.400
 - This is your thing.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 - Jonish.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.560
 - Is it a fetish?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.480
 - No, I wouldn't say fetish.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.680
 - Would you like to have sex underneath the thatched roof?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.320
 - Everyone's got a bucket list.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.440
 (laughing)

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.960
 - Anyway, look, the Globe Theater, sorry.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.800
 (laughing)

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.560
 - So what's the story, what's going on?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.280
 - So Andrew Hunter Murray had sex inside the Globe Theater.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 (laughing)

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.880
 'Cause it had a thatched roof.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.000
 It was fascinating, it was originally built in Shoreditch.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.320
 It was called the Burbage Theater in 1576.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.520
 And the land was owned by this bloke called Giles Allen.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.320
 And when the lease on the theater came up,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.720
 he didn't want to renew it.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.040
 And so the Chamberlain's men,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.080
 which is Shakespeare's company of actors,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.640
 they decided that they will just literally upsticks,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.360
 take all of the timber from that theater

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.200
 and hide it in someone's shed for a bit.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.440
 (laughing)

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.280
 And then, whilst Allen was away at Christmas,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.560
 they built it a few hundred meters away from

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.120
 where the current Globe Theater currently is,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.440
 is where they built the original.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.840
 - So that one was thatched,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.200
 the sort of proper original South Bank.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.040
 - But that will have been

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.560
 before the Great Fire of London will it?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.320
 - That was Shakespeare's time.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.040
 - Yeah, it didn't hang around for very long.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.000
 It was 1599, I think, was when it was built.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.840
 And then it was actually burned down itself.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.760
 It didn't need no Great Fire of London to burn itself down.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.320
 - Wasn't it a cannon during a play?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.080
 - I think it was Henry VIII?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.920
 Was it?

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.760
 That bastard?

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000
 (laughing)

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.440
 - I think it's one of the least good histories.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.340
 I don't wanna--

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.200
 - Well, they don't play it very often, do they?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.160
 - They don't go down the Globe and see Henry VIII.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.800
 - No, well, I think there must be a reason for that.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.440
 - Yeah, but last time they performed it,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.480
 the whole fucking thing, probably on the band list.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.960
 So did Shakespeare do his stuff in Burbage's Theater

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.960
 up in the East London side?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.800
 - Sure did, yeah.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.640
 - Oh, really?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.960
 So was anything ever performed in his lifetime during--

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.360
 - Well, yeah, Lightfill says they moved the Globe down to--

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.040
 - And Shakespeare went along with it.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.520
 - I think they rebuilt it within his lifetime,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.400
 even though it burned down quite closely.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.760
 He died in 1616, and I think it burned down

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.320
 not long before that, but they rebuilt it,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.080
 and they're still showing new Shakespeare plays there.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.400
 - Well, that's really good to know,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.880
 because whenever I pass it, I think,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.040
 oh, this is just a replica.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.720
 It's not got any kind of original meat to it.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.320
 Shakespeare was dead by then, it's just a fake.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.320
 But if he was alive while people were performing--

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.160
 - Well, the modern one is a new one.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.000
 It's completely new.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.200
 - It's an even more new one.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.280
 - Yeah, so the modern one was built in the, what, '80s?

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.120
 - '90s.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.560
 - Something like that, in the '90s, yeah.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.720
 And that was by, what's he called?

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.560
 - San Juanemaker.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.320
 - San Juanemaker, and that's the one which has got thatched now.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.160
 - That's right, yeah.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.000
 - Right.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.160
 - Yeah, it's pretty much the same.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.320
 It uses green oak, and it has wooden postings,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.520
 or whatever, doweling, or whatever it holds it all together.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.560
 They tried to make it as close

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.760
 to how it would have been made at the time,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.480
 using all of the techniques that the builders would have used,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.320
 but they had to use stuff like modern scaffolding,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.000
 and they had to increase the amount

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.360
 of fire escapes and exits and all that sort of stuff.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.320
 - They got sprinklers.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.600
 - They got sprinklers, yeah.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.680
 - I read them, I was reading the newspaper articles

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.080
 from the time, and as late as 1988,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.120
 the papers were saying that there wouldn't be thatch,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.560
 and it would be tiled, and that was due to fire regulations.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.480
 And then sometime around 1990,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.960
 they kind of changed their mind and said,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.080
 "Yeah, we're gonna be allowed thatch after all."

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.400
 - That's cool.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.160
 It's got some cashmere in the walls.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.000
 - Is it?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.360
 - Yeah, 'cause they used,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.760
 they made proper old-fashioned plaster,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.840
 as in 17th century plaster.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.240
 Wattle and Dorb is the name of it,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.600
 and it includes cashmere goat hair,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.560
 which is an ingredient of the plaster, so yeah.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.240
 - And the thatch roof that they have now

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.160
 has a hidden set of sprinklers all the way through it.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.240
 - Oh yeah, nice.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.080
 - Just in case.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.920
 - Just in case.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.760
 - Just so you know that they learned their lessons.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.240
 - I found a company that made the thatch,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.480
 they were called TAS, and there was an article about them,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.160
 and apparently the globe wasn't the biggest-ever contract

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.000
 that they had.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.120
 They had one bigger contract for thatch roofs,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.120
 can you guess?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.960
 - Oh, my God.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.280
 - It was, oh, I've given it away, it's multiple roofs,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.440
 multiple thatch roofs.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.760
 - Did they redo a whole village or something?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.080
 - In a way.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.320
 - In a way, okay.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.920
 - Phil, I'll edit out all these silences, by the way.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.800
 - Oh, an Olympic village,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.480
 but like an old fashioned Olympic village.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.040
 - That's right, yeah, it was a 2012 Olympics.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.840
 Everyone lived in batched houses.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.640
 That's why they were all having sex all the time.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.720
 - Right, absolutely.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.600
 - Was it for like a Game of Thrones sets?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.840
 - Okay, not Game of Thrones.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.680
 - Harry Potter.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.520
 - Lord of the Rings.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.360
 - No.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.200
 - Hobbit.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.040
 - No.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.880
 - Ted Lasso.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.560
 (laughing)

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.560
 - I think, I don't know when this,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.240
 I think it was '90s, so it's a similar era, this.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
 - "Zena, the Warrior of Princes."

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.200
 - Film came out.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.040
 - "Matrix."

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.880
 - Yeah, okay.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.920
 - "Matrix," stop it.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.240
 - Was it "Historical" for?

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.880
 - Oh, no, Shakespeare in love, Shakespeare in love.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.720
 - No.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.560
 - But that would have been--

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.400
 - That feels good, that feels good.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.080
 - Do you feel it?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.000
 - It's gonna be a bit of a downer now that I tell you.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.720
 It was Robin Hood, "Prince of Thieves."

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.400
 - No, you were there tracks.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.840
 - And they had to do the entire kind of village

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.120
 and they put thatch on all of them

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.040
 and that was the most money they ever made

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.720
 and the globe was the second most they ever made.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.560
 - That's incredible.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.320
 - His movies are expensive, man.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.160
 - "Waterworld."

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.680
 - Kevin Castle, yeah, that's "Flood the Earth,"

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.840
 you know, for that one.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.880
 Kevin Costner, these huge sets.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.720
 - "Dances with Wolves,"

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.680
 they had to teach all those wolves how to dance.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.640
 (laughing)

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.320
 - You know the globe?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.160
 - I do, yeah.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.720
 - When they rebuilt it, it then shrank.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.560
 - Oh, riddle me that.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.720
 - Oh, okay.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.240
 - Okay, they built it in the summer and then it got cold.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.280
 - What kind of, just the timber dries out.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.560
 And it takes years and years for timber to properly dry out

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.040
 and it dries and it hardens and it shrinks a bit.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.800
 - So it gets stronger through time, which is amazing.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.000
 - That's cool, that's really good.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.720
 Do you know where they got the timber from?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.560
 - No.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.760
 - I think it might have been the 1987 storm

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.160
 in the new forest knocked down loads of trees.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.040
 But it's certainly a big storm in the late 80s,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.760
 knocked down a load of trees in the new forest

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.240
 and they got all of the timber from there.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.320
 - That's really cool.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.600
 - Yeah, and also the Duke of Edinburgh offered wood

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.400
 from one of his oaks at Windsor.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.240
 - Lovely.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.080
 - That's great.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.240
 - Good bloke, good bloke, yeah.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.480
 Do you want to hear another fact

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.280
 about the Royal Family in this, by the way,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.240
 while we're talking about,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.240
 well, let's not say good blokes for this one.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.080
 So they crowdfunded it quite a lot of the money for this

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.920
 because, you know, they need a load of money

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.700
 and they need to get it from somewhere.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.160
 So they went to America and they had an event

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 called UKLA88, a celebration of British arts.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.000
 And according to the Desert Sun newspaper,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.680
 the real stars will be Fergie and Prince Andrew.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.680
 So Prince Andrew's partly responsible

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.240
 for the building of the globe.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.720
 And the British consulate said,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.840
 "When you think of Britain,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.000
 "we don't want you to think about

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.960
 "fatched cottages and bobbies,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.080
 "but of Concord, microchips and Phil Collins."

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.440
 (laughing)

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.040
 - I don't love to see Phil Collins perform at the Glow Theater.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.360
 - Concord's not even going anymore.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.200
 - No.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.520
 - Microchips, do we make many microchips?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.360
 - In the UK?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.200
 - Possibly.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.040
 - I don't think so.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.880
 - Huge centre of friends.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.120
 - Phil Collins is still going strong there.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.960
 - That's a good point.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.800
 - Yeah.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.280
 - He's the one part of Britain that's left.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.280
 - Yeah, have you played there, Phil, to look like?

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.120
 - I haven't played there.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.240
 I've been to see quite a few productions there.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.760
 I was a poor student when I went.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.240
 And so I was standing.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.720
 I was one of the groundlings.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.800
 - Ooh.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.760
 - And I was, I mean,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.280
 I've got a pretty bad attention span as it is.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.320
 And being stood there for like three and a half hours,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.280
 I was like, "Oh, fuck this, man."

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.120
 But--

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.800
 - Do you remember what you were seeing?

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.160
 - I saw "Midsummer Night's Dream" there.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.880
 And they were all great productions.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.480
 But this is my, listen, I'm working on it, I'm working on it.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.560
 But they have another space,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.160
 which is called the Wanna Make a Playhouse,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
 which, again, is made like a Playhouse

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
 would have been back in Dere.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.440
 And it's fully lit by candles.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.040
 And you can just imagine that, again,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.640
 the schematics coming along, and they're like,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.760
 "Right then, Globe Theatre, what do you got for us today

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.320
 "after all the thatched houses and all this stuff?"

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.120
 Oh, a fully wooden theatre, and it's only lit by candles.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.680
 - The way you just said Dere,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.600
 just then a second ago, back into Dere,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.280
 apparently, if you see Shakespeare,

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.720
 you weren't here to be or not to be,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.320
 you're here to bear or not to bear.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 - Is that right?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.520
 - Well, this is what I read.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.000
 So apparently, the Globe Theatre has a tradition now,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.720
 these days, of making sure that the accents

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.880
 that are spoken while Shakespeare plays on

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.760
 is the accent of the time.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.240
 And so David Crystal, who James, you and I met years ago,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.360
 he's a linguistic guy, he studies all types of language,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.520
 and no one really knows how people spoke back then fully.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.400
 He kind of clobbered together an idea

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.760
 of how to speak, and to be is to bear.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.600
 - To bear?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.000
 - To bear or not to bear.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.840
 - Okay.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.920
 - That was a classmate.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.720
 - It's quite Brian Butterfield there.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.000
 (all laughing)

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.400
 - Oh, did you have any snacks when you were there?

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.440
 - This is relevant, I promise.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.760
 - A beer.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.600
 - You had a beer, okay.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.240
 - A beer can't as a snack as more of a refreshment,

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.520
 isn't it, a beverage?

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.000
 - It's still something from the theatre.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.920
 - But it was very of today.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.560
 - Okay, so it wasn't, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.400
 It wasn't brewed in there.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.240
 - I have a beer.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.360
 (all laughing)

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.920
 - To bear or not to bear?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.720
 - Exit, pursued by a bear.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.200
 (all laughing)

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.480
 - I just wondered, 'cause archaeologists have done lots

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.200
 of digging around under the sights of the old theatres,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.880
 and they found out what the snacks would have been

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.160
 in Elizabethan times.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.440
 - That's great.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.280
 - Yeah.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.120
 - Okay, so what, go on.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.280
 - Well, they're slightly limited by what remains,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.000
 as in what rots and what doesn't.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.840
 - Of course.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.560
 - But they have found thousands and thousands

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.640
 of oyster shells.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.720
 That was a huge thing.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.760
 And because oysters were not the food for the posh,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.360
 they were just a sort of standard snack.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.840
 Just get a few oysters when you went to the theatre.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.680
 So that was a big thing.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.880
 - Yeah, that's very cool.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.840
 - Just go back to the accent thing.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.680
 There was, because it was such an amalgamation

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.400
 of different accents that were in London,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.160
 and they hadn't really sort of formed a London accent yet,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.400
 I guess, at that time.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.680
 It was such a hodge podge of different accents,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.000
 like a sort of Irish, British, West Country,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.960
 Lancashire, Geordie sort of thing.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.200
 And I could give it a bit of a go.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 - Yeah, do it.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.440
 - Nobody can tell me I got it wrong,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.520
 because no one remembers it.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.280
 Something like, "Two our souls, both alike in dignity,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.200
 "in failure of a rona, will we lay our sin,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.520
 "from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.000
 "where civil blood lay civil hens unclean."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.840
 Something like that.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.680
 - Wow.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.520
 - So that's great.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.360
 - That's great.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.720
 I did just get hit in the head before I said that.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.040
 (all laughing)

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.240
 - Could you do the rest of the show?

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.080
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.960
 (all laughing)

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.120
 - There's a lot of, if you go to the globe,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.240
 there's a lot of things on the floor,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.720
 which are the names of patrons,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.320
 basically help to fund the new globe and so on.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.240
 And so there's lots of very famous names on there.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.960
 And two in particular, which are exciting to see it,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.360
 John Cleese and Michael Palin, which is very cool.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.200
 - Mm-hmm.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.040
 - Yeah.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.880
 - Michael who?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.240
 - Michael Palin.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.960
 (all laughing)

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.120
 No, Michael Palin.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.960
 - I'll stop it.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.240
 - Because according to the story,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.840
 John Cleese only agreed to donate to the theater

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.400
 on the condition that Michael Palin's name was misspelled.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.080
 - And so on the floor, you can see it.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.960
 It's P-A-L-L-I-N.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.800
 - Wow.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.640
 - Yeah.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.600
 - What would you have done if we just politely

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.440
 glossed over it?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.520
 I was so nearly dead.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.200
 - I would hold it on, go, come on, guys.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.720
 Someone, someone call me of this.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.720
 It's a problem when you pronounce everything wrong.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.560
 - The thing is that Dan's such a big fan of Michael Palin.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.520
 I was thinking maybe that's how it's pronounced.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.360
 - But yeah, so the globe says that this is the story.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.440
 When you go on the tour guides, they say this is the story.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.520
 There's no solid, you know, John Cleese needs to say it out loud.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.760
 - Okay, but it is misspelled.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.600
 - Yeah, it's misspelled.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.440
 Yeah.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.280
 We need to move on in a sec.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.800
 Does anyone have anything before we do?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.680
 - I've got some stuff on Rich the Third, but that's--

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.000
 - Yeah, do it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.720
 - So a lot of archeologists found that the old theater

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.360
 buried underneath a car park not so far away.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.960
 And as was Rich the Third found under in a car park.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.640
 And obviously was one of Shakespeare's

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.120
 big villain protagonists.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.560
 And Dr. Joe Appleby at the University of Leicester

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.080
 looked at the bones and saw that Rich the Third

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.200
 got fucked up when he got killed.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.040
 - Oh, right.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.040
 - That he was, they see from his bones.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.080
 He had a glancing blow to his cheek.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.880
 He had a wound from probably a halberd,

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.080
 which is like big stick pike with a sort of axe thing.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.920
 It was potentially the fatal blow.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.920
 The back of his head, a sort of chunk was missing there.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.000
 And then they think that they didn't want to do too much more

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.080
 to the face because Henry the Seventh

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.400
 needed to parade this dead body around to be like,

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.040
 "Look, this is definitely him."

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.600
 - This is him, not just some pulp.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.040
 - Yeah, and they saw what they thought

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.720
 would be some post-mortem injuries to his rib

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.360
 and to his spine as well.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.240
 And then one up his bum, they reckon.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.160
 There's a sort of a mark like this one.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.240
 - Was that after he died?

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.080
 - Well, this is it.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.920
 - This is it, this feels like a month.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.760
 - That's the question.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.280
 (laughing)

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.600
 - That's a different play, Dan.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.840
 (laughing)

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.920
 He's my kingdom for a horse.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.080
 My kingdom for a horse with a very soft saddle.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.440
 - Yeah.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.680
 - Wow, that's amazing.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.720
 - Yeah, poor old Blake.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.880
 - That was in battle, wasn't it?

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.720
 That he was killed?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.160
 - That was in battle, battle of Bosworth.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.000
 - Yeah.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.480
 - Who was the last king killed in a battle?

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.320
 - Was he?

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.880
 - I don't think anyone since then has been.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.720
 - Cowards.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.040
 - Yeah.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.080
 - Come on, Charles.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.920
 - Come on.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.500
 (upbeat music)

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:57.480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.200
 and that is Andy.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.640
 - My fact is that when residents of Greater Manchester

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.600
 were recently asked,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.800
 they identified four distinctive accents in the region.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.840
 Mank, Lancashire, Wigan, and Posh.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.600
 (laughing)

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.440
 - Brilliant.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.320
 - Yeah, it's like a good version of the Spice Girls.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.160
 (laughing)

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.120
 - Wigan, Spice.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.160
 - Mank, Spice.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.560
 - Wigan, Spice is eating a pie all the time.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.160
 - James, do you, when you see that there's these four,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.000
 does that make sense to you?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.400
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.960
 I would say my accent began as Lancashire

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.800
 with a bit of Wigan,

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.440
 'cause I went to primary school in Wigan,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.000
 and now it's Posh probably.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.840
 - Right.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.120
 - Like, I've lost a lot of my accents

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.960
 since I moved to London,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.400
 so I think people in Greater Manchester

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.840
 would say I was in the Posh bit.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.680
 - You do, I notice when either you're around family

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.080
 or people from the North,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.840
 you do slightly slip back into it.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.760
 It's like the wording, like, Tintinet.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.760
 I don't want, like, you know, have that sort of word.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.440
 - That's my New York true.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.520
 But you miss out, like, certain words sometimes.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.000
 - Oh, I did, I did it on purpose.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 I did it when Phil came in,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.160
 and then he opened his mouth,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.040
 and I'm like, "Oh yeah, you're not Jamie Tartt."

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.880
 (laughing)

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.720
 - Always disappointment.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.640
 - What's Tartt's accent?

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.000
 Is that from--

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.640
 - It's, well, it's sort of new,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.560
 most in sort of the way.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.840
 - 'Cause the people who did this research,

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.080
 one of them was called Dr. Rob Drummond.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.560
 He listens to fish.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.840
 It turns out, and I emailed him

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.880
 and sent him an example of your accent

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.280
 and asked him if he could place it.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.120
 - Oh my God, oh my God.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.680
 - So this is an academic.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.560
 And he said, "No, it's shit."

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.400
 No, he didn't.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.920
 (laughing)

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.000
 He was like, "No, it's really, really good."

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.280
 And he says you do a great Manchester accent,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.080
 and it's all about the letter vowel and the happy vowel.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.120
 And apparently, when you say let her,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.000
 as I would say it,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.200
 if you're in Manchester, you say let or,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.640
 which Jamie Tartt does.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.240
 And happy, as I might say it, in Manchester,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.840
 they say happy.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.640
 But anyway, he could take your accent,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.080
 and he reckoned he could pinpoint

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.000
 it's a pretty much central,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.720
 or just north of central Manchester.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.560
 - Wow.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.000
 - From Seoul, kind of, Smedley, that kind of area.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.840
 - Wow.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.160
 - That's so cool.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.000
 - An academic.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.840
 - That's a good report card.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.280
 - Three years later, that's the relief.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.200
 - It depends what series you watch,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.480
 'cause I think the first series, I was like,

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.200
 "I don't really, I don't know if I'm doing this right."

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.840
 But it was an American show, so I was like,

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.800
 "No, they won't care."

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.120
 - We should name the project, shouldn't we?

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.680
 It was called Manchester Voices,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.760
 and it was a three-year research project

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.440
 at Manchester Metropolitan University.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.560
 - Yeah, Dr. Rob Drummond, who checked out Phil's accent,

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.400
 he is a listener, he listens to fish all the time

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.480
 with his daughter, Cassia,

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.160
 and he has a new book coming out called You Are All Talk.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.000
 It's not out yet, but if you wanna pre-order that,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.840
 you can.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.680
 - Ooh, they had a really cool thing.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.920
 They had an accent van, which drove around,

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.480
 and they bundled people into the accent van

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.640
 and recorded how they spoke.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.480
 Bundled.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.480
 - Yeah, they wrote it, there was consent.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480
 (laughing)

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.840
 - They had hoods, they had cuffs, they...

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.520
 (laughing)

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.360
 - That's so funny.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.040
 - And so the specific questions that they asked

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.520
 were things like, "Oh, I'm curious,

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.600
 'cause you're from Bolton, James.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.200
 So, if they said, "I've never heard you say,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.880
 "instead of bottle, Bockel."

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.720
 - Bockel, yeah.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.560
 - Yeah.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.400
 - Or Lickle, instead of Bockel.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.920
 - Lickle, yeah, that is a Bolton thing,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.120
 but I don't really speak like that now.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.560
 - School with two syllables.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.400
 - Skewel.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.240
 - Skewel.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.960
 - That's more of a Wigan thing, you would say skewel.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.800
 - Okay.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.080
 - So, the word Bocke, as I would say it,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.640
 10% of Boltoners say Bucke, instead of Bucke.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.000
 And 71% of Wiganers say that.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.840
 - Wow.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.240
 - So that's how you can tell the difference.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.040
 And 30% of Boltoners say buzz instead of bus.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.400
 And I actually do say buzz instead of bus.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.520
 - Did you, just with all those words, James was saying,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.080
 when you were doing your accent,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.880
 is it something that you studied?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.800
 Or is it one of those things that once you start speaking

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.360
 in an accent, you almost naturally find

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.320
 the way that they would pronounce it anyway?

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.680
 - I guess studied, watched documentaries and whatnot.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.520
 - Yeah, okay.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.040
 - My agent, who I love very dearly, is a Mancunian.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:52.920
 And she's very sassy.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.480
 And there was a lot of sass in Jamie Tartt.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.180
 So I was like, that's quite a good sort of start point.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.840
 And I think generally I sort of am okay with picking that up,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.840
 but there's a rapper called H.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.680
 And it's funny that the difference--

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.600
 - From steps, yeah, I know.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.240
 No, he's much cooler.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.640
 - H from steps is coming on next week.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.480
 - Yeah.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.320
 (laughs)

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.400
 - You're not careful.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.580
 - But H is really like proper Mank, isn't he?

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.720
 - Yeah, he's the rapper.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.560
 - Yeah, he's the rapper.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.000
 And I think that one of the things was

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.320
 when we were auditioning for it,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.760
 they didn't necessarily want a Mancunian.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.520
 They just wanted someone who didn't sound like me.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.960
 They just wanted Italian or Spanish or whatever.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.240
 And I think that it just felt right for him,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.720
 that sort of sense of like,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.120
 it'd come from a place that was,

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.560
 that you had to sort of graft to get out of.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.360
 And that's why I say season one, season three,

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.600
 I'm being totally honest.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.480
 It started off as one of the Gallagher brothers.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.320
 - Right.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.520
 - And it sort of slowly stepped towards

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.840
 sort of Jesse Lingard,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.920
 come sort of a far more sort of contemporary version of that.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.680
 It would be like, all right, how you doing?

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.520
 You all right, mate?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.360
 How's it going?

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.200
 Yeah, I'll tell you a little bit about it.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.560
 But it's like, do you know what I mean?

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.120
 Yeah, it's a lot more like sort of contemporary.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.480
 And it feels a lot more like,

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.800
 he's just got, I feel like he's rapping all the time.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.640
 Do you know what I mean?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.480
 - Right, right.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.040
 - So yeah, and just, yeah.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.120
 So anyway, it sort of, it's shifted from

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.320
 that sort of nineties version of it.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.880
 - I've read quite a few things about actors who,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.000
 so Austin Butler, who just played Elvis in the biopic,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.480
 the Baz Luhrmann biopic.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.320
 There's videos of him prior to doing the role

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.960
 to how he speaks now.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.920
 And he's been unable to shift the Elvis voice,

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.760
 the Elvis role.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.200
 So when he received his award

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.640
 at either the Emmys of the Golden Globe,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.760
 he was, well, thank you everybody for this incredible award.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.880
 He can't get rid of it.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.160
 And he actively talks about it

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.160
 'cause he's questioned about it.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.320
 They're like, you don't talk like this.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.040
 And he's like, oh no, I can't get rid of it.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.240
 - And so he's trying to lose the Elvis accent.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.400
 - That's so random.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.280
 - Yeah, well, no, it happens with quite a lot of actors.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.360
 That's how I was going to say it.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.560
 Did you ever have anything where at home,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.440
 suddenly you found yourself not being able to shift

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.400
 the accent and was it not long enough a gig to each time?

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.120
 - Oh, I think there was probably a couple of words

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.360
 I just enjoyed saying, like "pooper."

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.880
 I just really enjoyed it.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.120
 He wrote a pooper.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.240
 It just feels right.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.440
 A lot of the air words at the end was just quite fun.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.160
 But you can track what film Tom Hardy was doing

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.720
 by interviews at the time.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.440
 'Cause I mean, he's got a real sort of chameleon accent thing.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.480
 - Remember Steve McLaren when he went to work

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.920
 in the Netherlands?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.840
 And he just started talking with the Dutch accent.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.600
 - He was only there for like two.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.040
 - So he was a former England football manager.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.160
 And he became manager of, I can't remember who it was,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.000
 Ajax or something.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.320
 There he was in Ajax, but a Dutch team.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.720
 And then he would do interviews in England.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.240
 And he'd just have this really strong Dutch accent.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.680
 - And he'd been there for like only a few months.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.120
 And he was like trying to ingratiate himself

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:38.960
 for the coaches.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.680
 - I think it's subconscious though, isn't it,

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.000
 when people do that?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.560
 'Cause you're talking to people who,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.400
 let's say you go to America or Australia or somewhere,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.920
 you naturally will,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.440
 what all some people do and some people don't.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.760
 It's a really interesting thing.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.080
 - Well, you do naturally,

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.200
 you imitate someone's accent, don't you?

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.600
 Because it makes them like you better.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.520
 That's the idea.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.440
 But also they've decided that this is a good idea.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.440
 And they've got this AI software

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.200
 where if you phone up, you know,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.560
 of what do you call it?

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.160
 Like a chat, not chat line.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.000
 - Call centre.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.840
 - Call centre.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.800
 (laughing)

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800
 - Yep, hang on a minute.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.840
 Yeah, yeah, one of those call centres, yeah.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.480
 - My back card isn't working.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.720
 (laughing)

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.440
 If you phone up a call centre.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.120
 And yeah, they've worked out this AI

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.760
 which can hear your accent and then imitate your accent.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.000
 And so they come back in a slightly similar way to you talk.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.240
 And it means you trust them more.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.080
 - It's so weird.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.680
 And it's mostly, basically,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.120
 because of where call centres are around the world,

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.280
 it's mostly to make people in places like the Philippines

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.400
 sound like they're from Boston or whatever.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.800
 And so, but this is the plot of a film.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.920
 It's a film called Sorry to Bother You.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920
 And it's about a young black guy

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.120
 who gets a job in a call centre.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.960
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.720
 - And then someone tells him,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.840
 like an older guy in the centre says,

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.440
 use your white voice.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.720
 And he starts getting lots and lots of business

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.680
 because he's sounding preppy and whiter.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.760
 And so they've literally turned this.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.880
 It is a horror film.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.040
 - Yeah, they turn it into a technology, it's so weird.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.360
 - James, what is this little Bolton quiz?

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.200
 - Oh, I don't know why.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.040
 - Oh, no.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.720
 - Give it to us, give it to us.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.560
 - Give it to us, yeah.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.480
 - Pee wet, down.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.640
 - Oh, I know what that is.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.600
 I read it.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.440
 - Pee wet.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.080
 - You read it, so you're out of attention here.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.920
 I'm afraid.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.760
 - Pee wet.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.600
 - Two words.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.760
 - Pee wet is a type of bird.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.600
 - Absolutely.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.440
 Is that helpful?

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.280
 Maybe not.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.120
 - Could be.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.440
 - Could be.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.120
 - 'Cause it goes pee wet, pee wet.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.600
 - Would James be trying to help you in this quiz?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.440
 Maybe.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.280
 - Yeah, is he a friend?

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.120
 - Maybe not.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.520
 - I don't think he's a director.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.360
 - Pee wet.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.040
 - Pee wet, you've wet yourself with pee?

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.680
 (laughing)

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.720
 - I didn't even think of that, yeah.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.520
 - Yeah, good if you ever come to Bolton.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.360
 - Yeah.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.200
 - That's what you have to say.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.520
 I go to a chip shop and they say,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520
 "Do you want pee wet?"

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.880
 I go, "No, of course not."

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.440
 - I don't mind if I do.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.680
 - I don't need your help for it.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.520
 Thank you very much.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.640
 (laughing)

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.480
 - James was helping you.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.320
 That pee wet is the mushy pee water.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.640
 - Yeah, so you can get them to put,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.160
 if you have chips with pee wet,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.760
 then you don't have to pay for the pee wet.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.920
 - They'll get the chips and they'll just pour

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.720
 a bit of the wet, a bit of the mushy pee.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.560
 - Oh, it looks good.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.240
 - The water runoff from the mushy pee.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.080
 - Yeah.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.920
 - Wow.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.760
 - I'm sorry.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.600
 - No, you didn't.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.960
 - Great, that's not what I thought.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.080
 I thought it was just mushy pees,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.440
 but that's a step towards insanity.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.280
 - Why do you want that?

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.120
 Like, you'd have wet chips.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.960
 - It's delicious.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.800
 - So you'd have wet chips.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.640
 - Chips are too dry.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.600
 - So kind of like a vinegar.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.440
 - Put vinegar on, don't you?

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.280
 - Yeah.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.120
 - Wow.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:21.960
 - It's very exciting.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.800
 - Shakespeare in English, isn't it?

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.640
 - Yeah, it is.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.680
 - I want to try another one of them.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.280
 Cracking the flags.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.240
 - Bought to flags.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.080
 - Cracking flags.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.400
 - Cracking flags.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.760
 (laughing)

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.320
 - Is it rude?

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.800
 She's got a pair of cracking flags.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.160
 (laughing)

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.000
 - No, I don't know.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.840
 - Do you know what it is, Phil?

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.000
 - I don't know what this is, no.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 - Really?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.680
 What if I tell you that the flags

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.880
 relate to flagstones as in like pavement?

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.720
 - Okay.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.840
 - Cracking the flags.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.480
 - It's like walking as a pedestrian.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.320
 - Cobbled streets.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.120
 - This is so funny because these are words

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.360
 that I thought everyone knew.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.800
 - And I'd never heard this until.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.280
 That's the only reason I mentioned it, yeah.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.880
 - It means it's really hot.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.720
 It's cracking flags out there.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.880
 It's so hot that the pavement's breaking.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.520
 - Yeah, yeah, nice.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.360
 Wow.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.360
 - God, I'm really failing as my pretend Mancunian here.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.120
 (laughing)

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.040
 But the Mancunian accent was,

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.560
 sorry, just to close this again.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.720
 The Mancunian accent was voted,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.440
 and I found this in the Daily Mail

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.200
 and the research was provided by Best Casinos.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.720
 (laughing)

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.920
 - So it's flawless, yeah, come on, on my go.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.000
 - I know that you love your watertight fact checking here.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.360
 After they asked 2,500 people,

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.200
 they found that the Manchester accent

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.160
 was the sexiest accent in the world.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.000
 - That's interesting.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.320
 - And that's from Best Casinos.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.880
 - Is that recent?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.920
 - Yeah, yeah, I think it was last year, I think.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.760
 - That's interesting.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.000
 'Cause like, I reckon that change,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.080
 you see those things quite often, don't you?

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.280
 And they say, oh, the Irish accent's most sexy.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.040
 Or the Yorkshire is, never the Birmingham weirdly,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.480
 but they do say that.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.720
 And I wonder if it's like fashion,

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.400
 like they've seen people like yourself

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.760
 doing the Manc accent on TV,

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.680
 and they associate it with--

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.400
 - Did the Gallagas have an effect?

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.240
 - I think they did, yeah.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.400
 - On the sexiness of the Mancunian.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.520
 - That's what I'm thinking.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.240
 - Yeah, 'cause I read a thing that in America,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.480
 there was once a vote on what was the most sexy accent

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.440
 from the UK.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.280
 - Oh, the UK, okay.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.600
 - Yeah, and Glasgow won it, right?

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.240
 And I wonder, because Billy Conley is so big in America,

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.520
 whether or not there was just something kind of like,

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.560
 I know he's not seen as like a sex symbol,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.360
 but he's seen as really charismatic,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.760
 really funny, everything that's like likable.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.600
 - Silky guy. - Yeah.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.520
 - Or whether the person doing the research

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.600
 was Glaswegian and they felt intimidated.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.440
 - Yeah.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.720
 (all laughing)

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.080
 I get, one of my favorite things

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.120
 about doing this show is, I quite often,

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.880
 I haven't actually had it in the last sort of 12 months,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.320
 but I used to get a bunch of linguists

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.320
 who would write to me saying,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.760
 I take samples of your accent and my accent,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.080
 and I play it to other people who are linguists,

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.120
 and the challenges work out where he's from.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.520
 And every time they say, no one can work out,

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.520
 they say like, Canada or like New Zealand Australia,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.960
 like they get elements of it,

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.960
 but no one needs to collect on tour.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.000
 - And we sort of do like signings afterwards,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.560
 and people sometimes come up and say,

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.560
 where are you from, to Dan?

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.960
 And then you'd ask them to guess,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.320
 and I used to keep a list on my phone

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.720
 of everywhere people had guessed.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.560
 - Did you?

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.600
 And it was, I mean, the whole world.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.480
 - 'Cause I think you just have an international accent,

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.320
 like from, as if you went to international school,

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.480
 like my wife's got similar.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.320
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.200
 - Kind of slightly North American weird accent.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.600
 - Yeah, but I guess if then that becomes the challenge

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.200
 for the linguists, what are the influences on this accent?

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.880
 - We were saying before that when people

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.840
 who are from a certain place go back to that place

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.600
 or speak to other people from that place,

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.680
 they start, that accent starts to come out a bit more.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.200
 Do you have that with one of your?

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.080
 - If I go to Australia, I definitely lean into Aussie a bit.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.400
 I should have a British accent by now,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.160
 'cause I've been here long enough, but I don't.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.440
 And the Hong Kong accent was very American,

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.920
 where I grew up.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.680
 - But where do you go to sound more like you are now?

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.080
 Not just more Aussie, you know?

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.400
 'Cause you don't really sound very Aussie.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.240
 - No.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.640
 - When you travel internationally.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.440
 It's actually only in departure lounges.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.280
 (laughing)

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.960
 But Dan sounds most like himself.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.800
 - Yeah.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.560
 - Whenever you're buying a Toblerone, it's like,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.400
 "Ah, yeah, I don't know."

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.980
 (upbeat music)

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:11.120
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.320
 and that's my fact.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.680
 My fact this week is that of the few people

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.520
 who have top secret clearance at the White House,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.160
 one of them is the person

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.640
 who writes all of the party invitations.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.560
 (laughing)

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.400
 - Amazing.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.520
 - Such a good plot for something, isn't it?

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.360
 - It is, isn't it?

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.600
 - You know, the calligrapher.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.840
 - And it's the president's party invitation writer.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.080
 - It's missing.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:33.920
 - Yes.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.120
 - 'Cause you'll know, as the invitation writer,

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.680
 who's coming to the summits, who's, you know.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.000
 - Yeah, it's everyone's address.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.440
 He's got Brezhnev's address.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.280
 He's got--

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.680
 - Brezhnev, yeah.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.400
 - Do you think of a key global player?

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.320
 (laughing)

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.240
 Brezhnev, when did Brezhnev stop running the Soviet Union?

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.000
 (laughing)

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.600
 - I was thinking of mine as a Cold War thriller.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.320
 (laughing)

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.400
 - Imagine how beautiful his ransom letters would be.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.240
 - Oh.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.080
 - From the calligrapher.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.000
 That would be perfect.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.080
 So this is a thing where this kind of came up in the news

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.080
 when it was during Trump's administration

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.320
 that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.520
 had been downgraded from top secret clearance

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.120
 because they sort of just tried

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.960
 to stop making everyone have it.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.240
 And people noted that--

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.560
 - 'Cause he had too many links to the Saudis, but yeah, sure.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.400
 - Yeah, yeah, so--

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.520
 (laughing)

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.280
 - It's nice not recording on the BBC, is it?

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.200
 (laughing)

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.320
 - So it got downgraded and someone was pointing out

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.880
 that actually he's now got less clearance

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.280
 than the calligrapher has on the in-house.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.640
 And the reason the calligrapher has it

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.400
 is because they have to know everything

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.720
 about the president's appointments,

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.480
 what's coming up, who they have to,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.120
 and they're near dignitaries all the time.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.160
 And so they need to be on top of everything

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.000
 that they need to write

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.920
 because they write so many invitations.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.920
 They have a unit, it's a calligraphy unit.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.880
 There's a whole office that does this.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.080
 It's not many people, there's only like three or four people.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.720
 But-- - That's still a lot.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.560
 - It's a lot.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.400
 In fact, one of them said that in one December period alone,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.480
 they believed that they did 19,000 envelopes.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.320
 - Brilliant.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.160
 - And those are handwritten.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.000
 - So yeah, so, and they're paid very, very handsomely.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.240
 And they've been going for a very long time.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.640
 Like they're like long-term posts that they can run for.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.440
 - But they did ask one of the,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.240
 I think he was by this point the former calligrapher

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.200
 when the story broke.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.680
 And Rick Paulus, who had run the office,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.320
 he said that it was just 'cause of the schedule

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.560
 and the proximity to world leaders.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.400
 He said he never, ever dealt with intelligence matters,

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.640
 which you would hope he would not.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.800
 (laughing)

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.640
 As in something's gone wrong if he has to solve a crisis.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.400
 - I wonder who's the best RSV peer.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.720
 - Oh, like the timeliest.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.920
 - Of all the world leaders.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.760
 - Yes.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.600
 - That's interesting.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.160
 - I feel like Trudeau's waiting by the post office door.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.840
 - He'll reply nice and soon.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.920
 They did a thing like this with the Royal Wedding.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.600
 There was a, I can't remember which Royal Wedding it was,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.080
 whether it was William Cate or Harry and Meghan,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.920
 but they ran a thing of, so-and-so's replied very quickly.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.760
 - Oh, really?

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.600
 Really?

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.440
 - Yeah.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.160
 - Do you remember the fact that Meghan Markle,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.160
 her former job when she was an actor as a side job,

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.800
 she was a calligrapher for invitations.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.640
 So that's what she did.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.360
 - She did Robin Thickey.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.240
 - Of blurred lines, Robin Thickey.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.080
 - Yes.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.240
 - Yeah, a blurred lines wave.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.680
 He did, his wedding, the invites were written by Meghan Markle.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.800
 - You know Robin Thicke?

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.640
 - Yeah.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.480
 - Who's that?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.240
 - The blurred lines guy.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.360
 Do you know, his dad was really famous.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.840
 He wrote the theme tune to Different Strokes, the TV show.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.880
 - Ooh, is that also a problematic song?

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.640
 (laughing)

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.480
 - Sounds it.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.040
 - It's not like a sexy song, it's like a show.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.240
 - Sure, it means something very different.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.680
 - Wow, that's the best, I mean, no offense by this James.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.440
 Trippy effect, I've ever heard.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.680
 (laughing)

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.000
 Like that's good, that's good.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.800
 - It's just something that happens to know, that's all.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.640
 - That's fabulous.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.480
 - Rick Polis, by the way.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.320
 So this guy was the head of calligraphy.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.400
 Have you seen his website?

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.000
 rickpoliskalligraphy.com, wonderful.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.280
 He's quite annoyed because the kind of digital age

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.800
 where computers started recording all the examples

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.560
 of all the invites that they write over the years

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.720
 and now being archived, he kind of just missed that.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.200
 So a lot of his work isn't online for you to see.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.560
 So he presents on his website, my favorite invites

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.120
 and my favorite bits of calligraphy

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.160
 that I did for the White House.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.240
 Yeah, so you can see menu for the president of Ireland.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.200
 - That's a cool one, isn't it?

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.320
 - He did a load of convoluted Celtic style design.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.160
 - Oh, that's great.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.760
 All of those meals the president pays for, doesn't he?

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.600
 - Yeah, is that weird?

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.440
 - Yeah, is that right?

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.320
 'Cause it's, we, when I went to the White House.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.160
 - Clang?

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.000
 - Yeah, kind of.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 (all laughing)

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.960
 Guys, are we talking about the White House?

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.080
 - When did you go?

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.040
 - I went, at the start of this year,

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.520
 the cast of Ted Lasso were inexplicably invited

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.200
 for an audience with the president and the first lady.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.040
 Insane, yeah.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.600
 Six of the cast members sort of spoke to the president

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.360
 and the first lady about mental health

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.600
 and the effect that the show has

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.120
 and sort of impact that is needed over there.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.960
 But we also, you know, we were having a tour

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.200
 and we sort of had, you know, learned some things

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.600
 about a little thing or two about the White House.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.320
 And one is that the president,

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.840
 because a lot of it is state funded

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.680
 or sort of funded by taxpayers,

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.840
 they can't be seen to be handing out big banquets

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.360
 for everybody that comes.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.720
 It is just, like he says, gaff, isn't it?

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.560
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.080
 - And you know, hopefully one day we'll be able to say,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.720
 huh, gaff, guys, all right, we're all right, guys.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.560
 - 2020, '23, did you get an invite and we'll fill them?

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.440
 - Are you just like a handwritten one?

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.280
 - No, I did not.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.520
 We got an email and obviously we all thought it was fake

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.360
 that we'd be invited to the White House.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.960
 I wonder if the same guy types the emails on.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.280
 - He types them incredibly.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.560
 He has a little wand he uses to tap each letter.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.760
 It's very gay, yeah.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.160
 - Did you have lunch with Biden or did you just say hi?

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.000
 'Cause I saw a photo.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.480
 You were in the Oval Office, right?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.440
 - We were, we took her to the Oval Office, yeah.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.280
 - Oh my God.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.120
 - Which is wild.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.560
 It was the energy you walk in the room,

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.840
 you're like, oh, some scandals sort of.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.680
 - Yeah, right.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.320
 - But no, we were kept in the map room where we ate,

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.440
 which is where they planned the D-Day landings

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.960
 in the map room, just to be sitting there eating as odd.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.680
 And you're there with like 25 Secret Service

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.760
 or just sort of knocking them out.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.040
 Who were so cool, really nice.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.080
 And also like have, you know, you ask them any question

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.280
 and you can see them go through the Rolodex of

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.120
 what can I say, what can't I say.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.320
 The weird thing was, I don't know if you've had it,

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.200
 when you call someone by a title,

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.880
 it suddenly feels very strange

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.120
 and these people that you've been knocking about

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.840
 with the cast members I've been with,

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.080
 hearing them call someone a title,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.000
 it feels very contrived the whole thing.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.200
 - Do you mean like Mr. President?

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.040
 - Mr. President.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.360
 - Huh, yeah, yeah.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.600
 - And so you're just thinking about that the whole time

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.200
 when you're meeting him.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.600
 - What's the term for the first lady?

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.760
 - Dr. Biden, I think.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.080
 - Dr. Biden, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.560
 - And obviously the whole time you're thinking,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.200
 it's like in Taxi Driver, when you did an eros go,

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.400
 you're talking to me, you're talking to me.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.200
 It was like, before I turned up, I was like,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.960
 Mr. President, Mr. President, hello Mr. President.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.040
 And of course, it's just, don't say Trump, don't say Trump,

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:06.880
 don't say Trump.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.800
 (all laughing)

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.800
 But it was funny when we were saying goodbye,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.360
 the guy who plays Isaac McAdoo, Colla Bikini,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.680
 I was stood next to him, he was shaking our hands,

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.200
 the president was shaking our hand,

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.240
 it's all going around the circle.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.200
 And it turns to Colla, he goes,

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.080
 thank you for coming along, son.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.680
 And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.520
 - Cheers.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.240
 (all laughing)

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.480
 He turns to me and he says,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.880
 I just said, cheers to the president.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.960
 (all laughing)

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.000
 - That's so good.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.320
 - I don't know how often people call the president,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.480
 dad, by Mr. President.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.920
 - You know, like calling the teacher, mum.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.080
 - Exactly. - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.920
 - It must have happened to him on a sort of daily basis.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.320
 - It's such a shame you didn't have lunch with him

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.720
 because I've heard great stories about his lunchtime.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.840
 Well, when he sits with Kamala Harris

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.840
 and they have their lunch,

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.520
 he likes to eat with a slideshow going.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.720
 So they just eat their meal

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.040
 while they're watching a slideshow

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.040
 of all the recent adventures they've had,

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.240
 just so that they can sort of remember and reflect on.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.480
 - What, just the photos of?

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.800
 - Yeah, yeah, it's just a slideshow.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.120
 - That's nice, I think. - Yeah, I think, yeah.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.840
 - Is it a slideshow of his stuff or both of their?

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.280
 - Both of them, I think, it's, yeah.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.280
 It's just like, oh, okay, here I am, shaking a hand.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.560
 Yeah, so that's Ted Lutter, okay?

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.560
 He said, cheers.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.240
 (all laughing)

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.080
 But can I tell you one last calligraphy thing?

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.600
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.320
 - Did you hear of Rick Muffler?

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.160
 - No.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.480
 - What a guy.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.880
 So Rick Muffler used to be a calligrapher,

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.720
 maybe the chief one, and he was controversial

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.800
 'cause he was the only left-handed calligrapher

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.640
 in the office.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.240
 - Oh, that means you're gonna smudge

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.320
 everyone else's calligraphy.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.400
 - Exactly, it was a nightmare.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.440
 But just, he's cool, particularly because

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.360
 it's kind of a family thing for him.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.640
 So his grandfather was a chauffeur

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.360
 for President Warren G. Harding.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.200
 And then his dad, John Muffler,

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.240
 was an electrician who wound the clocks

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.360
 in the whole White House.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.440
 He worked there for 50 years.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.280
 He arrived in the late Second World War,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.160
 and he was there for Bill Clinton.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.840
 That's all that time he was in the White House.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.480
 - And so Muffler's the third?

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.320
 Is that who we're talking about?

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.440
 - Rick Muffler was the third Muffler.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.440
 I don't know if there's a new Muffler.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.440
 - I'd like to dream, and I won't be here to see it,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.440
 but in like 500 years, there'll be a Muffler president.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.440
 And like they'll have muffled the way up to the top.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.600
 - That would be good, wouldn't it?

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.440
 - That'd be great.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.120
 (laughing)

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.000
 - There were some sort of heirs and graces

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.440
 that the Trump family didn't really follow.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.280
 - Oh, really?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.440
 - There were traditions that the first lady,

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.520
 when the president leaves office for the last time,

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.600
 the first lady would sit for a portrait.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.920
 And Melania refused to do that,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.840
 or has certainly has yet to have sat for it.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.880
 And there's this corridor where all of these paintings

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.080
 are put, and Michelle Obama is still placed

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.120
 at the end of the corridor,

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.000
 which is traditionally where the previous encumbered--

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.320
 - That's so interesting.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.640
 - To be fair, I feel like both Donald and Melania

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.720
 probably have a painting in the attic somewhere.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.960
 (laughing)

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.960
 - Very good reference.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.800
 - Thank you.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.040
 (laughing)

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.520
 - I was reading about top secret clearance,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.800
 just 'cause these calligraphy people

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.640
 have top secret clearance.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.880
 - It's a very weird thing, top secret clearance,

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.080
 because it appears to, like so many people have,

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.920
 their numbers are mad.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.200
 Okay, so there's like secret confidential,

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.520
 and then top secret, or something like that.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.360
 The top secret's the highest.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.880
 But top secret clearance, even back in 2015,

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.320
 it was 1.3 million Americans.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.120
 - Yeah, that's like one in every 300 people in America.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.200
 - Well, yeah, and if you broaden it to confidential,

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.360
 maybe that's the bottom rung.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.720
 It's about 1% of all Americans have secret status.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.120
 - None of the children will have it.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.440
 So that's even, you know--

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.840
 - God, you're right.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.960
 It's really common.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.320
 If you're American listening to this

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.920
 and you don't have top secret clearance,

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.760
 that's a shame on you.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.120
 - Yeah, give you head of wobble.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.040
 - So when I said at the top of the few people

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.680
 who have top secret clearance.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.040
 - But I wonder if it's slightly different

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.240
 than White House top secret compared to,

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.800
 this is like civil service top secret.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.640
 - Yeah, there are--

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.560
 - And there's CIA and there's--

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.200
 - There are different donations within top secret where,

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.120
 like not everyone can look at the plans

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.120
 of where we're gonna invade next, or whatever.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.960
 - Who's coming for dinner?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.400
 - Yeah.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.560
 - Biden's slideshow.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.240
 (all laughing)

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.080
 - Yeah.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:12.920
 - It is strange.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.120
 - It became evident when, during the recent leaks,

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.680
 during the Ukraine war,

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.640
 that was one of the things that people were so surprised about

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.800
 was that there's so many people had this clearance

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.640
 that was, you know, very delicate.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.640
 - A 21 year old.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480
 - Very peculiar.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.320
 - Yeah.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.040
 - I was reading about some other parties,

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.480
 or some parties at the White House.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.440
 - This is a party invitation guy.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.360
 - Yeah.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.480
 - I found there seems to be quite a common thing

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.680
 of riots in inauguration parties

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.280
 when people go to get their coats

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.320
 at the end of the night.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.160
 - Yeah.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.480
 - This is really weird.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.960
 It happened in President Reagan's ball in 1985.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.120
 Like, everyone went to get their coats at the end,

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.360
 and they got all mixed up.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.960
 Because the inauguration takes place in winter, right?

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.000
 It takes place in January.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.440
 So everyone's got loads of coats,

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.600
 and they're never prepared for it.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.320
 In 1989, President Bush had a ball

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.520
 which got known as the Bastille Day Coat Check Riot.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.000
 Because people were yelling and screaming,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.760
 and some people never, to the day,

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.360
 haven't got their coats back.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.200
 There was one coat check person for 3,000 coats.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.520
 (laughing)

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.080
 - What a nightmare.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.400
 - And people, like, obviously,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.720
 these are all, like, really high-up people who think,

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.200
 well, you know, I'm the most important person in this room.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.560
 I should get to the front and get my coat first.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.320
 And people are shouting, bushing, and all that kind of stuff.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.200
 But it even goes back to 1849

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.520
 at Zachary Taylor's inauguration ball.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.040
 Abraham Lincoln lost his hat.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.800
 And for Ulysses S. Grant's inauguration,

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.600
 all the workers who were working in the close place

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.320
 were all illiterate, and no one got their coats, them, either.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.480
 So it just seems to be a thing.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480
 - That'd be dangerous for Lincoln,

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.720
 because Lincoln used to keep secret documents

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.800
 in the top of his hat, didn't he?

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.480
 - Top hat secrets.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.320
 - Oh, good.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.920
 So just so weird.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.240
 - Shame that the beautiful calligraphy

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.360
 would have been wasted on those people

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.200
 that couldn't read.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.360
 (laughing)

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.940
 (upbeat music)

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.840
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.360
 and that is James.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.160
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1999,

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.280
 The Times newspaper reported that Liverpool FC

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.320
 were about to buy a footballer called Didier Baptiste.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.560
 The Times got the story

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.240
 from Liverpool's premium line news service.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.960
 They got it from the news of the world.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.920
 They got it from a sports agency,

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.280
 and they just found it on a random Arsenal fans website.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.640
 In actual fact, Baptiste was a fictional player

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.680
 in a soap opera.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.240
 - What role did best casino play in there?

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.480
 (laughing)

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.200
 - Yeah, so this is an amazing thing that happened.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.720
 It was in the papers in '99.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.720
 Liverpool are gonna buy this guy Didier Baptiste,

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.080
 but he was actually a character

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.320
 from the show Dream Team on Skies.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.120
 - So funny.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.520
 - And yeah, just people hadn't checked it properly.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.200
 The Times said he was a promising left-back for Monaco

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.480
 and a proud member of the French under 21 national side,

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.680
 surely a steal for 3.5 million pounds.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.520
 - Amazing.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.360
 - Wow.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.240
 - The news of the world said we think Didier Baptiste

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.520
 will be an ideal addition to Liverpool's back four.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.160
 He's a really attractive player.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.480
 You'll be seeing a lot more of him

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.120
 in the news of the world from now on.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.960
 - Oh.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.800
 - Obviously.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.640
 (laughing)

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.640
 - Yeah, it was just completely made up.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.480
 - Lying again.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.640
 - Is this like a transfer season rumours thing?

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.760
 'Cause lots of football stories seem to be about, you know.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.720
 - Yeah, of course.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.240
 Like clubs gonna buy a new player.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.400
 You often have never heard of them,

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.560
 especially if they're coming from a different country.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.000
 And if he's an under 21 player, he's quite young.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.240
 It wouldn't be that surprising

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.400
 that you might not have heard of them,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.400
 but you possibly would expect

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.200
 that newspapers would do a bit more research.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.440
 - I mean, you think at today's age,

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.880
 that would be absolutely absurd, it was absurd then,

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.200
 but now, obviously, you'd be able to sort of,

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.240
 you know, they'd be on FIFA

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.320
 or you could find them somehow.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.160
 - That's true.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.000
 - Yeah.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.200
 - It would be more difficult to do today, for sure.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.040
 - When was this?

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:56.880
 It was in the '90s.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.720
 - It was in '99.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.560
 - '99?

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.320
 - Because it was so much harder

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.760
 to find these foreign players

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.000
 on databases or whatever.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 There was, do you hear about Ali Deer, not Ali Dyer?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.600
 In 1996, Graham Sunez,

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.520
 who was the manager of Southampton at the time,

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.520
 he got a call from George Weir,

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.760
 who was a Ballon d'Or winner, you know, player of the year.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.280
 - Future president of Liberia.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.120
 - Yes, yes.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:20.960
 - Ooh.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.800
 - Yeah, there you go.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.640
 - And he's interested.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.720
 - He's really muffled his way up there.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.960
 (laughing)

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.920
 - He called Graham Sunez,

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:35.840
 saying that he should give his cousin, Ali Dyer, a trial,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.160
 because he'd been playing at Paris Saint-Germain,

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.160
 he'd been playing for Liberia,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.880
 and he'd been doing pretty well.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.680
 And so, Sunez was like, that's amazing.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.040
 I mean, you know, playing at Paris Saint-Germain,

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.920
 that's incredible.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.840
 And so, they gave him a sort of trial contract.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.720
 They gave him three and a half grand, signing on bonus.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.480
 And he turned up to training,

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.000
 and Matt LaTissier, who was sort of the star player,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 he's quite the same.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.520
 What's this bloke doing here?

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.600
 - I honestly thought he won a competition.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.400
 (laughing)

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.400
 But it was the reserve team that Ali Dyer had been put

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.240
 onto to play for that weekend.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.320
 Their match was canceled.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.720
 And so, Southampton first team needed a sub.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.200
 And so, he went there and subbed on when LaTissier was injured.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.400
 He played for 43 minutes before being subbed off again.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.240
 He's so bad.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.560
 - He was just a made up guy.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.120
 Was it even, was the George Wayer thing,

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.000
 or was it actually George Wayer who called him?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.840
 - No.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.560
 - So, they don't know to this day who really who it was,

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.400
 but people believe it might have been his friend,

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.760
 or it might have been his, you know.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.000
 - It was just a bloke.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.360
 I love these stories.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.760
 - Yeah, I love the Hutzpah.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.600
 - Yeah.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.160
 - Do you guys hear about Karl Power?

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.000
 - Karl Power, okay.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.800
 - Karl Power was, he wasn't never a sports player,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.680
 but he was a serial trickster.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.720
 And his thing was tricking his way

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.960
 into sporting environments that he wasn't meant to be in,

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.800
 right?

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.880
 And he started, like, when he was a teenager,

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.040
 he would tell them about boxing matches

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.800
 with a towel and a gym bag,

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.640
 and he would get him for free

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.560
 'cause they assumed he was part of the fight, right?

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.320
 - That's a risky one, though, isn't it?

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.320
 'Cause if they think you're an actual boxer,

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.160
 you're in trouble.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.520
 - He built on it, and he built his career.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.880
 And he, so one of his greatest moments

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.560
 was when he got into a Manchester United team photo

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.960
 just before they played a big Champions League match.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.800
 And you can see a shot.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.200
 He's got Ryan Giggs, Andy Cole, Gary Neville,

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.960
 and Karl, just this guy.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.920
 And Neville, Neville, was the only one who rumbled him.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.160
 Like, they were all lined up for the photo,

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.200
 and Neville pointed at him and said,

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.720
 "Who are you, who are you?"

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.200
 And he said, "Shut it, Gary, you grass."

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.840
 (all laughing)

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.800
 - You can see that video.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.560
 You can see Roy Keane right at the end clocks it.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.480
 And Roy Keane, he's a pretty feisty footballer.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.240
 And you see him look across, and it's daggers.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.320
 - That's so funny.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.080
 That's really a shut-in grass.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.120
 - He spent his whole career doing this.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.320
 I said career, he didn't get paid much for it,

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.760
 but he played on centre court.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.960
 He just turned up and played,

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.840
 he played a match like a little warm-up

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.160
 with someone like Tim Hemman.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.080
 He got onto the podium at the Grand Prix,

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.320
 the British Grand Prix.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.560
 - He came out to bat for England,

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.120
 and the test match they were playing was.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:00.960
 I mean, it was.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.080
 - But he didn't actually hit any balls.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.160
 He just walked towards,

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.960
 and then they realised it was the wrong person.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.960
 But I just, I had mine so much.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.240
 - But that's performance art.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.080
 - That's not.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:11.920
 - Yeah.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.840
 - That's pure performance art.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.880
 - That's brilliant, 'cause he's still going in car power.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.600
 - I don't think he's still trading, as it were,

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.160
 but I think he's still around, yeah.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.120
 - Once you get to an age,

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.120
 you can't pretend to be a footballer anymore.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.520
 - You can't pretend to be a manager, I guess.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.360
 - Or like a bowls player, or something like that.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.400
 - I found a, this is a real footballer,

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.680
 but had a fictional element to them.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.320
 So it's sort of like mostly real person.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.000
 But I was reading about Maradona,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.920
 and Maradona, so he used to do a lot of drugs.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.440
 I think that's very well known to do.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.280
 - I like it.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.120
 - Breaking news.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.080
 Yeah, Andy, he was big on the old cocaine.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.720
 But so he had, he was all real, except he had a fake penis.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.720
 - Sorry, Maradona.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.480
 - Maradona, he had a real penis,

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.760
 but he also had a special fake penis made of plastic,

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.440
 so that when he had to do drug tests,

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.360
 he would pull the fake penis out,

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.200
 and he would allow the urine to come through it.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.920
 And it's so hard to get to the bottom of this story.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.040
 Supposedly, the penis was put on display

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.540
 in a museum in Buenos Aires, and then went on tour.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.560
 I read this in The Guardian,

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.800
 written on tour, and then someone stole the penis,

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.760
 somewhere on tour.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.560
 So this missing relic of Maradona's

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.080
 is out in the world somewhere, but yeah.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.920
 - Wow.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.960
 - That'll be on some billionaire's mantelpiece.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.280
 You know, they've paid big, big money to a cabal

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.320
 or something to source.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.920
 - What's called the knob of God.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.760
 - Nob of God.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.760
 - Yeah, someone's got the knob of God.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.280
 - And you have a fake bladder, too, I guess.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.840
 - It's called a whizinator, I think.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.440
 I've heard of these things before,

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.360
 and yeah, you use them for, like, drug tests.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.040
 - Do you hook it up to a fake bladder?

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.920
 Or does the penis contain the fake urine

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.760
 that you're trying to--

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.760
 - It's not an actual human bladder,

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.040
 it's just a bit of plastic, but yeah, a bag.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.920
 - So you've got the bag and the whizinator,

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.160
 the fake penis, and everything's in your trousers, right?

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.960
 - Well, everything's about your person, for sure.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.520
 But then there was a person who did that,

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.360
 and it turned out that they were pregnant,

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.960
 even though it was a male-spurred person.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.280
 Yeah, he'd taken some female urine,

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:09.160
 and they were like, "Good news, you didn't take any drugs."

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.440
 - I heard you used your pregnant.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.320
 - And a horse, apparently.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:18.680
 Before you said anything about explaining the drug test thing,

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.760
 I thought you were gonna say it was

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.640
 'cause people would try and grope him at clubs,

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.040
 and then he could kind of make a getaway.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.400
 You know, like, a lizard losing its tail.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.960
 - Oh, right. - That's a great idea.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.720
 - I mean, I don't imagine he played with it, did he?

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.560
 Did he play?

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.800
 - I don't think you're asked for urine samples mid-gay.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.120
 (all laughing)

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.120
 - To me, a non-fan, that would liven things up.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.680
 (all laughing)

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.800
 - Well, you've seen when Gary Lineker

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.160
 pooed himself on pitch, haven't you?

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.000
 - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.840
 - I haven't seen that clip, yeah, yeah.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.680
 - Well, 'cause there's a mystery,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.160
 we wrote about this in our book of the year,

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.600
 the fish book, that Gary Lineker, still to this day,

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.200
 some 20-odd years after he did that,

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.880
 gets sent a single piece of toilet paper

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.480
 that's got a bit of poo on it in the post.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.400
 He's just constantly, he doesn't know who's doing it.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.160
 - Oh, it's quite easy to find out

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.400
 surely who's poo that is.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.720
 - Well, yeah. - You can just take a look.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.120
 - No, but if the person sending it is clean,

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.720
 they're not on any DNA registers.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.600
 - I was thinking with, 'cause Gary Lineker's been

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.400
 in a bit of problem with the government,

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.240
 hasn't he? - Oh, yeah.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.080
 - This year.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.840
 I wonder if Eddie was Czech, so well, a problem.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.420
 (all laughing)

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.120
 - Not saying it's her, but it's just worth checking

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.800
 everyone, isn't it, really?

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.880
 All of his enemies.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.360
 God bless him.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.480
 What were you talking about?

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.200
 - Football, sort of fake or lie footballers.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.040
 - Yeah.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.380
 - Looking at you, Phil.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.080
 (all laughing)

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.880
 - Well, I mean, our whole performances on Ted is,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.840
 it's so edited that, you know,

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.800
 it's basically choreography on Ted Lasso,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.160
 rather than it being sort of pretending

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.640
 we're playing football, I see it in one's choreography,

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.520
 but it's so hard to do.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.520
 Because the thing, one of the things I really found,

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.400
 I really tried to, like, (sighs)

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.200
 when you see close-up of players,

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.440
 that was me breathing below.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.280
 (all laughing)

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.800
 But if there was ever shots in the middle of a game,

00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.640
 I wanted it to feel like--

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.480
 - You're probably panicking.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.440
 - Yeah, and I feel like so many sports films you watch

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.280
 that that doesn't happen and it's really frustrating.

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.320
 But there were certain things that the production

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.280
 had to take into their own hands,

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.760
 which was some of the particularly difficult

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.400
 choreography that we had to do.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.360
 Like, someone shoots, it hits off a post,

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.960
 it hits someone's face.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.680
 It's CGI, the ball is CGI.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.520
 So we'd be running around the pitch,

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.440
 sort of pretending to kick a ball,

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.080
 which is very--

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.760
 - That feels like a bit more difficult, right?

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.120
 - Yeah, it does, it feels hard.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.040
 - Because you've got to think of what the weight is

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.600
 of the ball and how far it's going to go.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.040
 - Do they not, like, in some CGI,

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.120
 they'll just have an orange instead of whatever?

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.320
 Like, you're fighting a dragon,

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.720
 but there's an orange or something.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.040
 (all laughing)

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.640
 - It's a guy in green, his head is the ball.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.400
 (all laughing)

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.200
 - And the wonderful best actor goes to the ball.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.840
 (all laughing)

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.840
 - Tom Hanks' Wilson Furious never made it to nomination level.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.840
 - No, I've got one fact.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.080
 It's less about sort of fake football,

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.640
 but more, there is, do you know about Will Still,

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.160
 the manager at Reem or Ram FC?

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.160
 It's a league team.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.640
 And every single time the team plays,

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.880
 they are fined 22,000 euros.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.880
 - What are they doing out there?

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.920
 - Well, it's not so much them, it's the manager himself.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.600
 He is the youngest manager in European football.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.840
 He's 30 years old.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:27.480
 He's an English Belgian, I think, and it's incredible.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.960
 He's like this sort of real hotshot manager,

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.080
 but because he's so young,

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.800
 he hasn't really had time to go and get his certifications,

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.440
 which you need in order to be a manager in Ligue 1.

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.000
 And so he's just sort of like, he learned off

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.960
 football manager, and he went to university,

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.640
 he got a degree, but it was really through that.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.480
 But yeah, so--

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.920
 - So they find because he just hasn't got

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.160
 the certification yet?

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.200
 - Yeah, so it's one of the rulings.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.960
 - What a fine, how big of that can they forward that?

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.520
 - But he's done so well, and it's incredible.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.080
 If you watch a video of him, you hear him speaking

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.240
 as one normally would in a training session in English,

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.480
 and then without missing a beat, it goes into perfect French.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.160
 And it's incredible, you watch him and it's just, yeah,

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.880
 he's a really interesting guy, an interesting guy.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.040
 - That's a shame, I always thought

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.880
 that we could just become a football manager.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.200
 Whenever Tramir lose that, like Tramir lost,

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.400
 I'm a Tramir fan, so we lost our manager a few weeks ago,

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.920
 and I always think, it's worth a try, isn't it?

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.520
 It's worth a try becoming a football manager,

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.720
 but now I know I have to get actual qualifications.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.160
 - This feels like a French bureaucracy thing, surely.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.920
 - Do you think ever since Karl Power turned up

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.320
 on Paris Saint-Germain and tried to coach the team?

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.280
 - Do you think it'll be okay?

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.280
 - I think it'll be fine.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.480
 I think you'd be fine, James.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.000
 What I don't know about football isn't worth knowing, right?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.360
 So I'd say go for it.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.440
 - I can friend some park with a new thatched roof.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.000
 - I'll be there, I'll be there, all right?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.320
 I've got a season ticket.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:03.040
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.360
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.240

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.400

 All of our previous episodes are up there.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.720
 And Phil, do you wanna mention anything coming up?

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:34.480
 - Ted Lasso is currently, I think it's just about to air

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.360
 its final episode, or maybe just aired.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.520
 So go and watch that.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.280
 And I love you.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.040
 (laughing)

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:43.880
 - Aw, that's nice.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.320
 - That's a great way to end our show.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.120
 - Damn, do we have any live shows coming up?

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.440
 - We certainly do.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.680
 James, do you wanna tell everyone about it?

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.520
 - Oh, fucks sake.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.360
 (laughing)

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.200
 - Yeah, there you go.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.080
 - It's happening between the 17th of July

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.320
 and late August at the Soho Theatre.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.200
 We're doing 11 shows, sometimes two a night.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.760
 So there are some tickets left, actually.

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.080
 I think about half the tickets have already gone,

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:02.920
 but there are some left.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.080
 So hurry now.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.400
 - Great, okay.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.040
 - Oh, and go to knowsuchsthingasofish.com/soho

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:09.880
 to book your tickets.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.760
 - There you go, do come.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.200
 Tickets are going really fast, so do get in quick.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.920
 And we've got a new guest each night.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.280
 It's gonna be really, really fun.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.160
 So that's it, Phil, we love you too.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.360
 Thank you for doing the show.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.680
 And we'll be back again next week with another guest.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.520
 We'll see you then, goodbye.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.100
 (upbeat music)

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.680
 (upbeat music)

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.260
 (upbeat music)

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.840
 (upbeat music)

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.420
 (upbeat music)
