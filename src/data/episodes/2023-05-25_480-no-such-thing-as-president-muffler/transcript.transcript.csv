00:00:20,00:00:22,"I don't know if you've watched Ted Lasso,"
00:00:22,00:00:24,"if you haven't, it's definitely worth checking out."

00:00:37,00:00:39,Phil actually does listen to fish
00:00:39,00:00:42,so he came well prepared with loads and loads of facts.
00:00:42,00:00:44,It was such a fun show to record
00:00:44,00:00:46,and we all had such a great time.
00:00:46,00:00:48,Few more little bits of news.

00:01:33,00:01:35,"Anyway, enough about that."

00:01:36,00:01:38,I'm absolutely certain you will
00:01:38,00:01:41,and all I can say is on with a podcast.
00:01:41,00:01:44,(upbeat music)
00:01:55,00:01:58,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:58,00:01:59,"of knowstichthingasafish,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:02:01,00:02:03,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:03,00:02:04,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,Andrew Hunter Murray and Phil Dunster.
00:02:08,00:02:11,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:11,00:02:14,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:14,00:02:17,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:17,00:02:21,"Starting with fact number one, that is Phil."
00:02:21,00:02:25,- My fact this week is that the Shakespeare's Globe Theater
00:02:25,00:02:28,is the only building with a thatched roof in London
00:02:28,00:02:32,since the great fire of London in 1666.
00:02:32,00:02:34,- Very cool.
00:02:34,00:02:35,- Andy is very excited right now.
00:02:35,00:02:36,- That's so excited.
00:02:36,00:02:37,"- Thatched roofs, are you kidding me?"
00:02:37,00:02:38,- Yeah.
00:02:38,00:02:39,- This is brilliant.
00:02:39,00:02:40,- This is your thing.
00:02:40,00:02:41,- Jonish.
00:02:41,00:02:42,- Is it a fetish?
00:02:42,00:02:45,"- No, I wouldn't say fetish."
00:02:45,00:02:48,- Would you like to have sex underneath the thatched roof?
00:02:48,00:02:50,- Everyone's got a bucket list.
00:02:50,00:02:52,(laughing)
00:02:52,00:02:54,"- Anyway, look, the Globe Theater, sorry."
00:02:54,00:02:55,(laughing)
00:02:55,00:02:57,"- So what's the story, what's going on?"
00:02:57,00:03:00,- So Andrew Hunter Murray had sex inside the Globe Theater.
00:03:00,00:03:01,(laughing)
00:03:01,00:03:02,'Cause it had a thatched roof.
00:03:02,00:03:08,"It was fascinating, it was originally built in Shoreditch."
00:03:08,00:03:12,It was called the Burbage Theater in 1576.
00:03:12,00:03:15,And the land was owned by this bloke called Giles Allen.
00:03:15,00:03:19,"And when the lease on the theater came up,"
00:03:19,00:03:20,he didn't want to renew it.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"And so the Chamberlain's men,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"which is Shakespeare's company of actors,"
00:03:24,00:03:27,"they decided that they will just literally upsticks,"
00:03:27,00:03:30,take all of the timber from that theater
00:03:30,00:03:33,and hide it in someone's shed for a bit.
00:03:33,00:03:34,(laughing)
00:03:34,00:03:37,"And then, whilst Allen was away at Christmas,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,they built it a few hundred meters away from
00:03:39,00:03:42,"where the current Globe Theater currently is,"
00:03:42,00:03:43,is where they built the original.
00:03:43,00:03:44,"- So that one was thatched,"
00:03:44,00:03:47,the sort of proper original South Bank.
00:03:47,00:03:48,- But that will have been
00:03:48,00:03:49,before the Great Fire of London will it?
00:03:49,00:03:51,- That was Shakespeare's time.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"- Yeah, it didn't hang around for very long."
00:03:53,00:03:57,"It was 1599, I think, was when it was built."
00:03:57,00:03:59,And then it was actually burned down itself.
00:03:59,00:04:02,It didn't need no Great Fire of London to burn itself down.
00:04:02,00:04:04,- Wasn't it a cannon during a play?
00:04:04,00:04:05,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:05,00:04:07,- I think it was Henry VIII?
00:04:07,00:04:07,Was it?
00:04:07,00:04:08,That bastard?
00:04:08,00:04:11,(laughing)
00:04:11,00:04:15,- I think it's one of the least good histories.
00:04:15,00:04:16,I don't wanna--
00:04:16,00:04:18,"- Well, they don't play it very often, do they?"
00:04:18,00:04:20,- They don't go down the Globe and see Henry VIII.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"- No, well, I think there must be a reason for that."
00:04:21,00:04:23,"- Yeah, but last time they performed it,"
00:04:23,00:04:27,"the whole fucking thing, probably on the band list."
00:04:27,00:04:29,So did Shakespeare do his stuff in Burbage's Theater
00:04:29,00:04:31,up in the East London side?
00:04:31,00:04:32,"- Sure did, yeah."
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- Oh, really?"
00:04:33,00:04:35,So was anything ever performed in his lifetime during--
00:04:35,00:04:39,"- Well, yeah, Lightfill says they moved the Globe down to--"
00:04:39,00:04:41,- And Shakespeare went along with it.
00:04:41,00:04:41,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:04:41,00:04:43,"- I think they rebuilt it within his lifetime,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,even though it burned down quite closely.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"He died in 1616, and I think it burned down"
00:04:47,00:04:49,"not long before that, but they rebuilt it,"
00:04:49,00:04:52,and they're still showing new Shakespeare plays there.
00:04:52,00:04:53,"- Well, that's really good to know,"
00:04:53,00:04:54,"because whenever I pass it, I think,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,"oh, this is just a replica."
00:04:56,00:04:59,It's not got any kind of original meat to it.
00:04:59,00:05:02,"Shakespeare was dead by then, it's just a fake."
00:05:02,00:05:04,But if he was alive while people were performing--
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Well, the modern one is a new one."
00:05:06,00:05:07,It's completely new.
00:05:07,00:05:08,- It's an even more new one.
00:05:08,00:05:11,"- Yeah, so the modern one was built in the, what, '80s?"
00:05:11,00:05:12,- '90s.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"- Something like that, in the '90s, yeah."
00:05:13,00:05:15,"And that was by, what's he called?"
00:05:15,00:05:16,- San Juanemaker.
00:05:16,00:05:19,"- San Juanemaker, and that's the one which has got thatched now."
00:05:19,00:05:20,"- That's right, yeah."
00:05:20,00:05:21,- Right.
00:05:21,00:05:22,"- Yeah, it's pretty much the same."
00:05:22,00:05:26,"It uses green oak, and it has wooden postings,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,"or whatever, doweling, or whatever it holds it all together."
00:05:29,00:05:30,They tried to make it as close
00:05:30,00:05:31,"to how it would have been made at the time,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,"using all of the techniques that the builders would have used,"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"but they had to use stuff like modern scaffolding,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,and they had to increase the amount
00:05:39,00:05:41,of fire escapes and exits and all that sort of stuff.
00:05:41,00:05:42,- They got sprinklers.
00:05:42,00:05:43,"- They got sprinklers, yeah."
00:05:43,00:05:45,"- I read them, I was reading the newspaper articles"
00:05:45,00:05:48,"from the time, and as late as 1988,"
00:05:48,00:05:50,"the papers were saying that there wouldn't be thatch,"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"and it would be tiled, and that was due to fire regulations."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"And then sometime around 1990,"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"they kind of changed their mind and said,"
00:05:57,00:06:00,"""Yeah, we're gonna be allowed thatch after all."""
00:06:00,00:06:01,- That's cool.
00:06:01,00:06:03,It's got some cashmere in the walls.
00:06:03,00:06:04,- Is it?
00:06:04,00:06:05,"- Yeah, 'cause they used,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"they made proper old-fashioned plaster,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,as in 17th century plaster.
00:06:09,00:06:11,"Wattle and Dorb is the name of it,"
00:06:11,00:06:13,"and it includes cashmere goat hair,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,"which is an ingredient of the plaster, so yeah."
00:06:15,00:06:17,- And the thatch roof that they have now
00:06:17,00:06:20,has a hidden set of sprinklers all the way through it.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"- Oh yeah, nice."
00:06:21,00:06:22,- Just in case.
00:06:22,00:06:22,- Just in case.
00:06:22,00:06:23,- Just so you know that they learned their lessons.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"- I found a company that made the thatch,"
00:06:25,00:06:28,"they were called TAS, and there was an article about them,"
00:06:28,00:06:32,and apparently the globe wasn't the biggest-ever contract
00:06:32,00:06:33,that they had.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"They had one bigger contract for thatch roofs,"
00:06:35,00:06:36,can you guess?
00:06:36,00:06:37,"- Oh, my God."
00:06:37,00:06:40,"- It was, oh, I've given it away, it's multiple roofs,"
00:06:40,00:06:41,multiple thatch roofs.
00:06:41,00:06:43,- Did they redo a whole village or something?
00:06:43,00:06:45,- In a way.
00:06:45,00:06:48,"- In a way, okay."
00:06:48,00:06:50,"- Phil, I'll edit out all these silences, by the way."
00:06:50,00:06:52,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- Oh, an Olympic village,"
00:06:53,00:06:56,but like an old fashioned Olympic village.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"- That's right, yeah, it was a 2012 Olympics."
00:06:59,00:07:00,Everyone lived in batched houses.
00:07:00,00:07:02,That's why they were all having sex all the time.
00:07:02,00:07:03,"- Right, absolutely."
00:07:03,00:07:06,- Was it for like a Game of Thrones sets?
00:07:06,00:07:07,"- Okay, not Game of Thrones."
00:07:07,00:07:08,- Harry Potter.
00:07:08,00:07:09,- Lord of the Rings.
00:07:09,00:07:10,- No.
00:07:10,00:07:11,- Hobbit.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- No.
00:07:12,00:07:12,- Ted Lasso.
00:07:12,00:07:14,(laughing)
00:07:14,00:07:16,"- I think, I don't know when this,"
00:07:16,00:07:20,"I think it was '90s, so it's a similar era, this."
00:07:20,00:07:21,"- ""Zena, the Warrior of Princes."""
00:07:21,00:07:22,- Film came out.
00:07:22,00:07:23,"- ""Matrix."""
00:07:23,00:07:23,"- Yeah, okay."
00:07:23,00:07:24,"- ""Matrix,"" stop it."
00:07:24,00:07:26,"- Was it ""Historical"" for?"
00:07:26,00:07:27,"- Oh, no, Shakespeare in love, Shakespeare in love."
00:07:27,00:07:28,- No.
00:07:28,00:07:29,- But that would have been--
00:07:29,00:07:30,"- That feels good, that feels good."
00:07:30,00:07:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:31,00:07:32,- Do you feel it?
00:07:32,00:07:34,- It's gonna be a bit of a downer now that I tell you.
00:07:34,00:07:35,"It was Robin Hood, ""Prince of Thieves."""
00:07:35,00:07:36,"- Oh, okay."
00:07:36,00:07:37,"- No, you were there tracks."
00:07:37,00:07:39,- And they had to do the entire kind of village
00:07:39,00:07:41,and they put thatch on all of them
00:07:41,00:07:43,and that was the most money they ever made
00:07:43,00:07:44,and the globe was the second most they ever made.
00:07:44,00:07:45,- That's incredible.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"- His movies are expensive, man."
00:07:47,00:07:48,"- ""Waterworld."""
00:07:48,00:07:49,"- Kevin Castle, yeah, that's ""Flood the Earth,"""
00:07:49,00:07:50,"you know, for that one."
00:07:50,00:07:52,"Kevin Costner, these huge sets."
00:07:52,00:07:53,"- ""Dances with Wolves,"""
00:07:53,00:07:55,they had to teach all those wolves how to dance.
00:07:55,00:07:58,(laughing)
00:07:58,00:08:00,- You know the globe?
00:08:00,00:08:01,"- I do, yeah."
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- When they rebuilt it, it then shrank."
00:08:03,00:08:05,"- Oh, riddle me that."
00:08:05,00:08:06,"- Oh, okay."
00:08:06,00:08:09,"- Okay, they built it in the summer and then it got cold."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- What kind of, just the timber dries out."
00:08:11,00:08:13,And it takes years and years for timber to properly dry out
00:08:13,00:08:16,and it dries and it hardens and it shrinks a bit.
00:08:16,00:08:18,"- So it gets stronger through time, which is amazing."
00:08:18,00:08:20,"- That's cool, that's really good."
00:08:20,00:08:21,Do you know where they got the timber from?
00:08:21,00:08:22,- No.
00:08:22,00:08:24,- I think it might have been the 1987 storm
00:08:24,00:08:27,in the new forest knocked down loads of trees.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"But it's certainly a big storm in the late 80s,"
00:08:29,00:08:30,knocked down a load of trees in the new forest
00:08:30,00:08:32,and they got all of the timber from there.
00:08:32,00:08:33,- That's really cool.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- Yeah, and also the Duke of Edinburgh offered wood"
00:08:35,00:08:37,from one of his oaks at Windsor.
00:08:37,00:08:38,- Lovely.
00:08:38,00:08:39,- That's great.
00:08:39,00:08:41,"- Good bloke, good bloke, yeah."
00:08:41,00:08:42,Do you want to hear another fact
00:08:42,00:08:44,"about the Royal Family in this, by the way,"
00:08:44,00:08:45,"while we're talking about,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"well, let's not say good blokes for this one."
00:08:47,00:08:51,So they crowdfunded it quite a lot of the money for this
00:08:51,00:08:52,"because, you know, they need a load of money"
00:08:52,00:08:54,and they need to get it from somewhere.
00:08:54,00:08:57,So they went to America and they had an event
00:08:57,00:09:02,"called UKLA88, a celebration of British arts."
00:09:02,00:09:04,"And according to the Desert Sun newspaper,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,the real stars will be Fergie and Prince Andrew.
00:09:07,00:09:09,So Prince Andrew's partly responsible
00:09:09,00:09:11,for the building of the globe.
00:09:11,00:09:12,"And the British consulate said,"
00:09:12,00:09:13,"""When you think of Britain,"
00:09:13,00:09:15,"""we don't want you to think about"
00:09:15,00:09:16,"""fatched cottages and bobbies,"
00:09:16,00:09:20,"""but of Concord, microchips and Phil Collins."""
00:09:20,00:09:21,(laughing)
00:09:21,00:09:25,- I don't love to see Phil Collins perform at the Glow Theater.
00:09:25,00:09:26,- Concord's not even going anymore.
00:09:26,00:09:27,- No.
00:09:27,00:09:29,"- Microchips, do we make many microchips?"
00:09:29,00:09:30,- In the UK?
00:09:30,00:09:31,- Possibly.
00:09:31,00:09:32,- I don't think so.
00:09:32,00:09:32,- Huge centre of friends.
00:09:32,00:09:34,- Phil Collins is still going strong there.
00:09:34,00:09:34,- That's a good point.
00:09:34,00:09:35,- Yeah.
00:09:35,00:09:37,- He's the one part of Britain that's left.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- Yeah, have you played there, Phil, to look like?"
00:09:39,00:09:40,- I haven't played there.
00:09:40,00:09:42,I've been to see quite a few productions there.
00:09:42,00:09:43,I was a poor student when I went.
00:09:43,00:09:45,And so I was standing.
00:09:45,00:09:46,I was one of the groundlings.
00:09:46,00:09:47,- Ooh.
00:09:47,00:09:49,"- And I was, I mean,"
00:09:49,00:09:52,I've got a pretty bad attention span as it is.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"And being stood there for like three and a half hours,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"I was like, ""Oh, fuck this, man."""
00:09:56,00:09:57,But--
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Do you remember what you were seeing?
00:09:58,00:10:01,"- I saw ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" there."
00:10:01,00:10:02,And they were all great productions.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"But this is my, listen, I'm working on it, I'm working on it."
00:10:07,00:10:09,"But they have another space,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,"which is called the Wanna Make a Playhouse,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"which, again, is made like a Playhouse"
00:10:13,00:10:15,would have been back in Dere.
00:10:15,00:10:18,And it's fully lit by candles.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"And you can just imagine that, again,"
00:10:20,00:10:21,"the schematics coming along, and they're like,"
00:10:21,00:10:23,"""Right then, Globe Theatre, what do you got for us today"
00:10:23,00:10:26,"""after all the thatched houses and all this stuff?"""
00:10:26,00:10:29,"Oh, a fully wooden theatre, and it's only lit by candles."
00:10:29,00:10:33,"- The way you just said Dere,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,"just then a second ago, back into Dere,"
00:10:35,00:10:37,"apparently, if you see Shakespeare,"
00:10:37,00:10:38,"you weren't here to be or not to be,"
00:10:38,00:10:41,you're here to bear or not to bear.
00:10:41,00:10:42,- Is that right?
00:10:42,00:10:43,"- Well, this is what I read."
00:10:43,00:10:46,"So apparently, the Globe Theatre has a tradition now,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"these days, of making sure that the accents"
00:10:48,00:10:50,that are spoken while Shakespeare plays on
00:10:50,00:10:52,is the accent of the time.
00:10:52,00:10:56,"And so David Crystal, who James, you and I met years ago,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"he's a linguistic guy, he studies all types of language,"
00:10:59,00:11:01,and no one really knows how people spoke back then fully.
00:11:01,00:11:04,He kind of clobbered together an idea
00:11:04,00:11:07,"of how to speak, and to be is to bear."
00:11:07,00:11:08,- To bear?
00:11:08,00:11:10,- To bear or not to bear.
00:11:10,00:11:10,- Okay.
00:11:10,00:11:11,- That was a classmate.
00:11:11,00:11:13,- It's quite Brian Butterfield there.
00:11:13,00:11:16,(all laughing)
00:11:16,00:11:17,"- Oh, did you have any snacks when you were there?"
00:11:17,00:11:18,"- This is relevant, I promise."
00:11:18,00:11:19,- A beer.
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- You had a beer, okay."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"- A beer can't as a snack as more of a refreshment,"
00:11:22,00:11:23,"isn't it, a beverage?"
00:11:23,00:11:25,- It's still something from the theatre.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- But it was very of today.
00:11:26,00:11:28,"- Okay, so it wasn't, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:28,00:11:29,It wasn't brewed in there.
00:11:29,00:11:30,- I have a beer.
00:11:30,00:11:32,(all laughing)
00:11:32,00:11:33,- To bear or not to bear?
00:11:33,00:11:35,"- Exit, pursued by a bear."
00:11:35,00:11:38,(all laughing)
00:11:38,00:11:40,"- I just wondered, 'cause archaeologists have done lots"
00:11:40,00:11:43,"of digging around under the sights of the old theatres,"
00:11:43,00:11:45,and they found out what the snacks would have been
00:11:45,00:11:47,in Elizabethan times.
00:11:47,00:11:48,- That's great.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:50,"- Okay, so what, go on."
00:11:50,00:11:53,"- Well, they're slightly limited by what remains,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,as in what rots and what doesn't.
00:11:55,00:11:55,- Of course.
00:11:55,00:11:57,- But they have found thousands and thousands
00:11:57,00:11:58,of oyster shells.
00:11:58,00:11:59,That was a huge thing.
00:11:59,00:12:01,"And because oysters were not the food for the posh,"
00:12:01,00:12:04,they were just a sort of standard snack.
00:12:04,00:12:05,Just get a few oysters when you went to the theatre.
00:12:05,00:12:06,So that was a big thing.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"- Yeah, that's very cool."
00:12:08,00:12:09,- Just go back to the accent thing.
00:12:09,00:12:11,"There was, because it was such an amalgamation"
00:12:11,00:12:14,"of different accents that were in London,"
00:12:14,00:12:17,"and they hadn't really sort of formed a London accent yet,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"I guess, at that time."
00:12:19,00:12:22,"It was such a hodge podge of different accents,"
00:12:22,00:12:26,"like a sort of Irish, British, West Country,"
00:12:26,00:12:27,"Lancashire, Geordie sort of thing."
00:12:27,00:12:31,And I could give it a bit of a go.
00:12:31,00:12:32,"- Yeah, do it."
00:12:32,00:12:33,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:33,00:12:34,"- Nobody can tell me I got it wrong,"
00:12:34,00:12:36,because no one remembers it.
00:12:36,00:12:40,"Something like, ""Two our souls, both alike in dignity,"
00:12:40,00:12:43,"""in failure of a rona, will we lay our sin,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,"""from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,"
00:12:46,00:12:50,"""where civil blood lay civil hens unclean."""
00:12:50,00:12:50,Something like that.
00:12:50,00:12:51,- Wow.
00:12:51,00:12:52,- So that's great.
00:12:52,00:12:53,- That's great.
00:12:53,00:12:54,I did just get hit in the head before I said that.
00:12:54,00:12:56,(all laughing)
00:12:56,00:12:57,- Could you do the rest of the show?
00:12:57,00:12:58,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:58,00:12:59,(all laughing)
00:12:59,00:13:01,"- There's a lot of, if you go to the globe,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,"there's a lot of things on the floor,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"which are the names of patrons,"
00:13:04,00:13:07,basically help to fund the new globe and so on.
00:13:07,00:13:10,And so there's lots of very famous names on there.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"And two in particular, which are exciting to see it,"
00:13:12,00:13:16,"John Cleese and Michael Palin, which is very cool."
00:13:16,00:13:17,- Mm-hmm.
00:13:17,00:13:18,- Yeah.
00:13:18,00:13:18,- Michael who?
00:13:18,00:13:20,- Michael Palin.
00:13:20,00:13:21,(all laughing)
00:13:21,00:13:23,"No, Michael Palin."
00:13:23,00:13:23,- I'll stop it.
00:13:23,00:13:25,"- Because according to the story,"
00:13:25,00:13:27,John Cleese only agreed to donate to the theater
00:13:27,00:13:30,on the condition that Michael Palin's name was misspelled.
00:13:30,00:13:34,"- And so on the floor, you can see it."
00:13:34,00:13:35,It's P-A-L-L-I-N.
00:13:35,00:13:36,- Wow.
00:13:36,00:13:37,- Yeah.
00:13:37,00:13:38,- What would you have done if we just politely
00:13:38,00:13:39,glossed over it?
00:13:39,00:13:41,I was so nearly dead.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"- I would hold it on, go, come on, guys."
00:13:43,00:13:45,"Someone, someone call me of this."
00:13:45,00:13:47,It's a problem when you pronounce everything wrong.
00:13:47,00:13:50,- The thing is that Dan's such a big fan of Michael Palin.
00:13:50,00:13:52,I was thinking maybe that's how it's pronounced.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:54,00:13:56,"- But yeah, so the globe says that this is the story."
00:13:56,00:13:58,"When you go on the tour guides, they say this is the story."
00:13:58,00:14:01,"There's no solid, you know, John Cleese needs to say it out loud."
00:14:01,00:14:02,"- Okay, but it is misspelled."
00:14:02,00:14:03,"- Yeah, it's misspelled."
00:14:03,00:14:04,Yeah.
00:14:04,00:14:05,We need to move on in a sec.
00:14:05,00:14:07,Does anyone have anything before we do?
00:14:07,00:14:09,"- I've got some stuff on Rich the Third, but that's--"
00:14:09,00:14:11,"- Yeah, do it."
00:14:11,00:14:14,- So a lot of archeologists found that the old theater
00:14:14,00:14:18,buried underneath a car park not so far away.
00:14:18,00:14:21,And as was Rich the Third found under in a car park.
00:14:21,00:14:23,And obviously was one of Shakespeare's
00:14:23,00:14:26,big villain protagonists.
00:14:26,00:14:29,And Dr. Joe Appleby at the University of Leicester
00:14:29,00:14:33,looked at the bones and saw that Rich the Third
00:14:33,00:14:36,got fucked up when he got killed.
00:14:36,00:14:37,"- Oh, right."
00:14:37,00:14:40,"- That he was, they see from his bones."
00:14:40,00:14:43,He had a glancing blow to his cheek.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"He had a wound from probably a halberd,"
00:14:44,00:14:49,which is like big stick pike with a sort of axe thing.
00:14:49,00:14:50,It was potentially the fatal blow.
00:14:50,00:14:53,"The back of his head, a sort of chunk was missing there."
00:14:53,00:14:58,And then they think that they didn't want to do too much more
00:14:58,00:15:00,to the face because Henry the Seventh
00:15:00,00:15:03,"needed to parade this dead body around to be like,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,"""Look, this is definitely him."""
00:15:05,00:15:06,"- This is him, not just some pulp."
00:15:06,00:15:09,"- Yeah, and they saw what they thought"
00:15:09,00:15:11,would be some post-mortem injuries to his rib
00:15:11,00:15:13,and to his spine as well.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"And then one up his bum, they reckon."
00:15:15,00:15:18,There's a sort of a mark like this one.
00:15:18,00:15:19,- Was that after he died?
00:15:19,00:15:20,"- Well, this is it."
00:15:20,00:15:20,"- This is it, this feels like a month."
00:15:20,00:15:21,- That's the question.
00:15:21,00:15:23,(laughing)
00:15:23,00:15:24,"- That's a different play, Dan."
00:15:24,00:15:26,(laughing)
00:15:26,00:15:29,He's my kingdom for a horse.
00:15:29,00:15:32,My kingdom for a horse with a very soft saddle.
00:15:32,00:15:33,- Yeah.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"- Wow, that's amazing."
00:15:34,00:15:35,"- Yeah, poor old Blake."
00:15:35,00:15:36,"- That was in battle, wasn't it?"
00:15:36,00:15:37,That he was killed?
00:15:37,00:15:39,"- That was in battle, battle of Bosworth."
00:15:39,00:15:40,- Yeah.
00:15:40,00:15:42,- Who was the last king killed in a battle?
00:15:42,00:15:43,- Was he?
00:15:43,00:15:44,- I don't think anyone since then has been.
00:15:44,00:15:45,- Cowards.
00:15:45,00:15:47,- Yeah.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"- Come on, Charles."
00:15:48,00:15:48,- Come on.
00:15:48,00:15:51,(upbeat music)
00:15:51,00:15:57,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:57,00:15:59,and that is Andy.
00:15:59,00:16:01,- My fact is that when residents of Greater Manchester
00:16:01,00:16:02,"were recently asked,"
00:16:02,00:16:05,they identified four distinctive accents in the region.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"Mank, Lancashire, Wigan, and Posh."
00:16:08,00:16:11,(laughing)
00:16:11,00:16:12,- Brilliant.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"- Yeah, it's like a good version of the Spice Girls."
00:16:15,00:16:17,(laughing)
00:16:17,00:16:18,"- Wigan, Spice."
00:16:18,00:16:19,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:16:19,00:16:20,"- Mank, Spice."
00:16:20,00:16:22,"- Wigan, Spice is eating a pie all the time."
00:16:22,00:16:26,"- James, do you, when you see that there's these four,"
00:16:26,00:16:27,does that make sense to you?
00:16:27,00:16:28,"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure."
00:16:28,00:16:30,I would say my accent began as Lancashire
00:16:30,00:16:31,"with a bit of Wigan,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,"'cause I went to primary school in Wigan,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,and now it's Posh probably.
00:16:35,00:16:35,- Right.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"- Like, I've lost a lot of my accents"
00:16:37,00:16:37,"since I moved to London,"
00:16:37,00:16:40,so I think people in Greater Manchester
00:16:40,00:16:41,would say I was in the Posh bit.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"- You do, I notice when either you're around family"
00:16:43,00:16:45,"or people from the North,"
00:16:45,00:16:46,you do slightly slip back into it.
00:16:46,00:16:49,"It's like the wording, like, Tintinet."
00:16:49,00:16:51,"I don't want, like, you know, have that sort of word."
00:16:51,00:16:52,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:52,00:16:53,- That's my New York true.
00:16:53,00:16:55,"But you miss out, like, certain words sometimes."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- Oh, I did, I did it on purpose."
00:16:57,00:16:58,"I did it when Phil came in,"
00:16:58,00:16:59,"and then he opened his mouth,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"and I'm like, ""Oh yeah, you're not Jamie Tartt."""
00:17:01,00:17:01,(laughing)
00:17:01,00:17:02,- Always disappointment.
00:17:02,00:17:03,- What's Tartt's accent?
00:17:03,00:17:05,Is that from--
00:17:05,00:17:07,"- It's, well, it's sort of new,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,most in sort of the way.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"- 'Cause the people who did this research,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,one of them was called Dr. Rob Drummond.
00:17:15,00:17:16,He listens to fish.
00:17:16,00:17:18,"It turns out, and I emailed him"
00:17:18,00:17:20,and sent him an example of your accent
00:17:20,00:17:22,and asked him if he could place it.
00:17:22,00:17:23,"- Oh my God, oh my God."
00:17:23,00:17:24,- So this is an academic.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"And he said, ""No, it's shit."""
00:17:25,00:17:26,"No, he didn't."
00:17:26,00:17:27,(laughing)
00:17:27,00:17:30,"He was like, ""No, it's really, really good."""
00:17:30,00:17:32,"And he says you do a great Manchester accent,"
00:17:32,00:17:36,and it's all about the letter vowel and the happy vowel.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"And apparently, when you say let her,"
00:17:39,00:17:40,"as I would say it,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,"if you're in Manchester, you say let or,"
00:17:42,00:17:43,which Jamie Tartt does.
00:17:43,00:17:47,"And happy, as I might say it, in Manchester,"
00:17:47,00:17:48,they say happy.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"But anyway, he could take your accent,"
00:17:50,00:17:52,and he reckoned he could pinpoint
00:17:52,00:17:54,"it's a pretty much central,"
00:17:54,00:17:56,or just north of central Manchester.
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Wow.
00:17:57,00:18:00,"- From Seoul, kind of, Smedley, that kind of area."
00:18:00,00:18:00,- Wow.
00:18:00,00:18:02,- That's so cool.
00:18:02,00:18:03,- An academic.
00:18:03,00:18:04,- That's a good report card.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"- Three years later, that's the relief."
00:18:06,00:18:08,"- It depends what series you watch,"
00:18:08,00:18:09,"'cause I think the first series, I was like,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,"""I don't really, I don't know if I'm doing this right."""
00:18:11,00:18:12,"But it was an American show, so I was like,"
00:18:12,00:18:14,"""No, they won't care."""
00:18:14,00:18:16,"- We should name the project, shouldn't we?"
00:18:16,00:18:17,"It was called Manchester Voices,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,and it was a three-year research project
00:18:19,00:18:21,at Manchester Metropolitan University.
00:18:21,00:18:25,"- Yeah, Dr. Rob Drummond, who checked out Phil's accent,"
00:18:25,00:18:28,"he is a listener, he listens to fish all the time"
00:18:28,00:18:29,"with his daughter, Cassia,"
00:18:29,00:18:33,and he has a new book coming out called You Are All Talk.
00:18:33,00:18:35,"It's not out yet, but if you wanna pre-order that,"
00:18:35,00:18:35,you can.
00:18:35,00:18:36,"- Ooh, they had a really cool thing."
00:18:36,00:18:38,"They had an accent van, which drove around,"
00:18:38,00:18:40,and they bundled people into the accent van
00:18:40,00:18:41,and recorded how they spoke.
00:18:41,00:18:42,Bundled.
00:18:42,00:18:44,"- Yeah, they wrote it, there was consent."
00:18:44,00:18:45,(laughing)
00:18:45,00:18:47,"- They had hoods, they had cuffs, they..."
00:18:47,00:18:49,(laughing)
00:18:49,00:18:50,- That's so funny.
00:18:50,00:18:53,- And so the specific questions that they asked
00:18:53,00:18:54,"were things like, ""Oh, I'm curious,"
00:18:54,00:18:55,"'cause you're from Bolton, James."
00:18:55,00:18:59,"So, if they said, ""I've never heard you say,"
00:18:59,00:19:00,"""instead of bottle, Bockel."""
00:19:00,00:19:01,"- Bockel, yeah."
00:19:01,00:19:02,- Yeah.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"- Or Lickle, instead of Bockel."
00:19:03,00:19:04,"- Lickle, yeah, that is a Bolton thing,"
00:19:04,00:19:07,but I don't really speak like that now.
00:19:07,00:19:08,- School with two syllables.
00:19:08,00:19:09,- Skewel.
00:19:09,00:19:10,- Skewel.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"- That's more of a Wigan thing, you would say skewel."
00:19:11,00:19:12,- Okay.
00:19:12,00:19:16,"- So, the word Bocke, as I would say it,"
00:19:16,00:19:20,"10% of Boltoners say Bucke, instead of Bucke."
00:19:20,00:19:23,And 71% of Wiganers say that.
00:19:23,00:19:23,- Wow.
00:19:23,00:19:25,- So that's how you can tell the difference.
00:19:25,00:19:29,And 30% of Boltoners say buzz instead of bus.
00:19:29,00:19:32,And I actually do say buzz instead of bus.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"- Did you, just with all those words, James was saying,"
00:19:34,00:19:36,"when you were doing your accent,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,is it something that you studied?
00:19:37,00:19:39,Or is it one of those things that once you start speaking
00:19:39,00:19:41,"in an accent, you almost naturally find"
00:19:41,00:19:43,the way that they would pronounce it anyway?
00:19:43,00:19:46,"- I guess studied, watched documentaries and whatnot."
00:19:46,00:19:47,"- Yeah, okay."
00:19:47,00:19:52,"- My agent, who I love very dearly, is a Mancunian."
00:19:52,00:19:52,And she's very sassy.
00:19:52,00:19:54,And there was a lot of sass in Jamie Tartt.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"So I was like, that's quite a good sort of start point."
00:19:57,00:19:59,"And I think generally I sort of am okay with picking that up,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,but there's a rapper called H.
00:20:01,00:20:02,And it's funny that the difference--
00:20:02,00:20:03,"- From steps, yeah, I know."
00:20:03,00:20:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:04,00:20:07,"No, he's much cooler."
00:20:07,00:20:08,- H from steps is coming on next week.
00:20:08,00:20:09,- Yeah.
00:20:09,00:20:10,(laughs)
00:20:10,00:20:11,- You're not careful.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- But H is really like proper Mank, isn't he?"
00:20:13,00:20:14,"- Yeah, he's the rapper."
00:20:14,00:20:15,"- Yeah, he's the rapper."
00:20:15,00:20:16,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:16,00:20:18,And I think that one of the things was
00:20:18,00:20:20,"when we were auditioning for it,"
00:20:20,00:20:22,they didn't necessarily want a Mancunian.
00:20:22,00:20:24,They just wanted someone who didn't sound like me.
00:20:24,00:20:27,They just wanted Italian or Spanish or whatever.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"And I think that it just felt right for him,"
00:20:30,00:20:31,"that sort of sense of like,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,"it'd come from a place that was,"
00:20:33,00:20:36,that you had to sort of graft to get out of.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"And that's why I say season one, season three,"
00:20:39,00:20:40,I'm being totally honest.
00:20:40,00:20:42,It started off as one of the Gallagher brothers.
00:20:42,00:20:43,- Right.
00:20:43,00:20:45,- And it sort of slowly stepped towards
00:20:45,00:20:46,"sort of Jesse Lingard,"
00:20:46,00:20:50,come sort of a far more sort of contemporary version of that.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"It would be like, all right, how you doing?"
00:20:52,00:20:53,"You all right, mate?"
00:20:53,00:20:54,How's it going?
00:20:54,00:20:55,"Yeah, I'll tell you a little bit about it."
00:20:55,00:20:56,"But it's like, do you know what I mean?"
00:20:56,00:20:59,"Yeah, it's a lot more like sort of contemporary."
00:20:59,00:21:00,"And it feels a lot more like,"
00:21:00,00:21:02,"he's just got, I feel like he's rapping all the time."
00:21:02,00:21:03,Do you know what I mean?
00:21:03,00:21:04,"- Right, right."
00:21:04,00:21:06,"- So yeah, and just, yeah."
00:21:06,00:21:08,"So anyway, it sort of, it's shifted from"
00:21:08,00:21:10,that sort of nineties version of it.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"- I've read quite a few things about actors who,"
00:21:12,00:21:16,"so Austin Butler, who just played Elvis in the biopic,"
00:21:16,00:21:17,the Baz Luhrmann biopic.
00:21:17,00:21:20,There's videos of him prior to doing the role
00:21:20,00:21:21,to how he speaks now.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"And he's been unable to shift the Elvis voice,"
00:21:24,00:21:25,the Elvis role.
00:21:25,00:21:27,So when he received his award
00:21:27,00:21:28,"at either the Emmys of the Golden Globe,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"he was, well, thank you everybody for this incredible award."
00:21:31,00:21:32,He can't get rid of it.
00:21:32,00:21:34,And he actively talks about it
00:21:34,00:21:35,'cause he's questioned about it.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"They're like, you don't talk like this."
00:21:36,00:21:38,"And he's like, oh no, I can't get rid of it."
00:21:38,00:21:42,- And so he's trying to lose the Elvis accent.
00:21:42,00:21:43,- That's so random.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"- Yeah, well, no, it happens with quite a lot of actors."
00:21:45,00:21:46,That's how I was going to say it.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"Did you ever have anything where at home,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,suddenly you found yourself not being able to shift
00:21:50,00:21:53,the accent and was it not long enough a gig to each time?
00:21:53,00:21:55,"- Oh, I think there was probably a couple of words"
00:21:55,00:21:58,"I just enjoyed saying, like ""pooper."""
00:21:58,00:21:59,I just really enjoyed it.
00:21:59,00:22:01,He wrote a pooper.
00:22:01,00:22:02,It just feels right.
00:22:02,00:22:04,A lot of the air words at the end was just quite fun.
00:22:04,00:22:07,But you can track what film Tom Hardy was doing
00:22:07,00:22:08,by interviews at the time.
00:22:08,00:22:13,"'Cause I mean, he's got a real sort of chameleon accent thing."
00:22:13,00:22:15,- Remember Steve McLaren when he went to work
00:22:15,00:22:16,in the Netherlands?
00:22:16,00:22:19,And he just started talking with the Dutch accent.
00:22:19,00:22:21,- He was only there for like two.
00:22:21,00:22:24,- So he was a former England football manager.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"And he became manager of, I can't remember who it was,"
00:22:26,00:22:27,Ajax or something.
00:22:27,00:22:29,"There he was in Ajax, but a Dutch team."
00:22:29,00:22:31,And then he would do interviews in England.
00:22:31,00:22:34,And he'd just have this really strong Dutch accent.
00:22:34,00:22:36,- And he'd been there for like only a few months.
00:22:36,00:22:38,And he was like trying to ingratiate himself
00:22:38,00:22:38,for the coaches.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"- I think it's subconscious though, isn't it,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,when people do that?
00:22:42,00:22:43,"'Cause you're talking to people who,"
00:22:43,00:22:45,"let's say you go to America or Australia or somewhere,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,"you naturally will,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,what all some people do and some people don't.
00:22:48,00:22:49,It's a really interesting thing.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"- Well, you do naturally,"
00:22:51,00:22:53,"you imitate someone's accent, don't you?"
00:22:53,00:22:55,Because it makes them like you better.
00:22:55,00:22:56,That's the idea.
00:22:56,00:22:59,But also they've decided that this is a good idea.
00:22:59,00:23:01,And they've got this AI software
00:23:01,00:23:04,"where if you phone up, you know,"
00:23:04,00:23:05,of what do you call it?
00:23:05,00:23:07,"Like a chat, not chat line."
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Call centre.
00:23:08,00:23:08,- Call centre.
00:23:08,00:23:09,(laughing)
00:23:09,00:23:10,"- Yep, hang on a minute."
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Yeah, yeah, one of those call centres, yeah."
00:23:12,00:23:14,- My back card isn't working.
00:23:14,00:23:17,(laughing)
00:23:17,00:23:19,If you phone up a call centre.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"And yeah, they've worked out this AI"
00:23:22,00:23:25,which can hear your accent and then imitate your accent.
00:23:25,00:23:29,And so they come back in a slightly similar way to you talk.
00:23:29,00:23:30,And it means you trust them more.
00:23:30,00:23:31,- It's so weird.
00:23:31,00:23:32,"And it's mostly, basically,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,"because of where call centres are around the world,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,it's mostly to make people in places like the Philippines
00:23:36,00:23:38,sound like they're from Boston or whatever.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"And so, but this is the plot of a film."
00:23:40,00:23:42,It's a film called Sorry to Bother You.
00:23:42,00:23:43,And it's about a young black guy
00:23:43,00:23:45,who gets a job in a call centre.
00:23:45,00:23:45,- Oh yeah.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"- And then someone tells him,"
00:23:47,00:23:48,"like an older guy in the centre says,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,use your white voice.
00:23:50,00:23:52,And he starts getting lots and lots of business
00:23:52,00:23:55,because he's sounding preppy and whiter.
00:23:55,00:23:57,And so they've literally turned this.
00:23:57,00:23:58,It is a horror film.
00:23:58,00:24:03,"- Yeah, they turn it into a technology, it's so weird."
00:24:03,00:24:05,"- James, what is this little Bolton quiz?"
00:24:05,00:24:06,"- Oh, I don't know why."
00:24:06,00:24:07,"- Oh, no."
00:24:07,00:24:07,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:24:07,00:24:08,"- Give it to us, give it to us."
00:24:08,00:24:09,"- Give it to us, yeah."
00:24:09,00:24:11,"- Pee wet, down."
00:24:11,00:24:12,"- Oh, I know what that is."
00:24:12,00:24:13,I read it.
00:24:13,00:24:14,- Pee wet.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"- You read it, so you're out of attention here."
00:24:16,00:24:16,I'm afraid.
00:24:16,00:24:17,- Pee wet.
00:24:17,00:24:18,- Two words.
00:24:18,00:24:19,- Pee wet is a type of bird.
00:24:19,00:24:20,- Absolutely.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Is that helpful?
00:24:21,00:24:22,Maybe not.
00:24:22,00:24:23,- Could be.
00:24:23,00:24:24,- Could be.
00:24:24,00:24:26,"- 'Cause it goes pee wet, pee wet."
00:24:26,00:24:27,- Would James be trying to help you in this quiz?
00:24:27,00:24:28,Maybe.
00:24:28,00:24:29,"- Yeah, is he a friend?"
00:24:29,00:24:30,- Maybe not.
00:24:30,00:24:31,- I don't think he's a director.
00:24:31,00:24:32,- Pee wet.
00:24:32,00:24:35,"- Pee wet, you've wet yourself with pee?"
00:24:35,00:24:36,(laughing)
00:24:36,00:24:38,"- I didn't even think of that, yeah."
00:24:38,00:24:40,"- Yeah, good if you ever come to Bolton."
00:24:40,00:24:41,- Yeah.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- That's what you have to say.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"I go to a chip shop and they say,"
00:24:43,00:24:44,"""Do you want pee wet?"""
00:24:44,00:24:45,"I go, ""No, of course not."""
00:24:45,00:24:47,- I don't mind if I do.
00:24:47,00:24:48,- I don't need your help for it.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Thank you very much.
00:24:49,00:24:51,(laughing)
00:24:51,00:24:52,- James was helping you.
00:24:52,00:24:55,That pee wet is the mushy pee water.
00:24:55,00:24:56,"- Yeah, so you can get them to put,"
00:24:56,00:24:58,"if you have chips with pee wet,"
00:24:58,00:24:59,then you don't have to pay for the pee wet.
00:24:59,00:25:00,- They'll get the chips and they'll just pour
00:25:00,00:25:02,"a bit of the wet, a bit of the mushy pee."
00:25:02,00:25:03,"- Oh, it looks good."
00:25:03,00:25:05,- The water runoff from the mushy pee.
00:25:05,00:25:06,- Yeah.
00:25:06,00:25:06,- Wow.
00:25:06,00:25:07,- I'm sorry.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"- No, you didn't."
00:25:08,00:25:09,"- Great, that's not what I thought."
00:25:09,00:25:11,"I thought it was just mushy pees,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,but that's a step towards insanity.
00:25:13,00:25:14,- Why do you want that?
00:25:14,00:25:15,"Like, you'd have wet chips."
00:25:15,00:25:15,- It's delicious.
00:25:15,00:25:16,- So you'd have wet chips.
00:25:16,00:25:17,- Chips are too dry.
00:25:17,00:25:18,- So kind of like a vinegar.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"- Put vinegar on, don't you?"
00:25:19,00:25:20,- Yeah.
00:25:20,00:25:21,- Wow.
00:25:21,00:25:21,- It's very exciting.
00:25:21,00:25:22,"- Shakespeare in English, isn't it?"
00:25:22,00:25:23,"- Yeah, it is."
00:25:23,00:25:25,- I want to try another one of them.
00:25:25,00:25:27,Cracking the flags.
00:25:27,00:25:28,- Bought to flags.
00:25:28,00:25:29,- Cracking flags.
00:25:29,00:25:30,- Cracking flags.
00:25:30,00:25:31,(laughing)
00:25:31,00:25:33,- Is it rude?
00:25:33,00:25:34,She's got a pair of cracking flags.
00:25:34,00:25:36,(laughing)
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- No, I don't know."
00:25:38,00:25:38,"- Do you know what it is, Phil?"
00:25:38,00:25:40,"- I don't know what this is, no."
00:25:40,00:25:41,- Really?
00:25:41,00:25:42,What if I tell you that the flags
00:25:42,00:25:45,relate to flagstones as in like pavement?
00:25:45,00:25:46,- Okay.
00:25:46,00:25:47,- Cracking the flags.
00:25:47,00:25:52,- It's like walking as a pedestrian.
00:25:52,00:25:53,- Cobbled streets.
00:25:53,00:25:55,- This is so funny because these are words
00:25:55,00:25:56,that I thought everyone knew.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- And I'd never heard this until.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"That's the only reason I mentioned it, yeah."
00:25:59,00:26:00,- It means it's really hot.
00:26:00,00:26:02,It's cracking flags out there.
00:26:02,00:26:04,It's so hot that the pavement's breaking.
00:26:04,00:26:06,"- Yeah, yeah, nice."
00:26:06,00:26:07,Wow.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- God, I'm really failing as my pretend Mancunian here."
00:26:09,00:26:12,(laughing)
00:26:12,00:26:14,"But the Mancunian accent was,"
00:26:14,00:26:15,"sorry, just to close this again."
00:26:15,00:26:17,"The Mancunian accent was voted,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,and I found this in the Daily Mail
00:26:19,00:26:22,and the research was provided by Best Casinos.
00:26:22,00:26:23,(laughing)
00:26:23,00:26:25,"- So it's flawless, yeah, come on, on my go."
00:26:25,00:26:30,- I know that you love your watertight fact checking here.
00:26:30,00:26:32,"After they asked 2,500 people,"
00:26:32,00:26:35,they found that the Manchester accent
00:26:35,00:26:37,was the sexiest accent in the world.
00:26:37,00:26:38,- That's interesting.
00:26:38,00:26:39,- And that's from Best Casinos.
00:26:39,00:26:40,- Is that recent?
00:26:40,00:26:42,"- Yeah, yeah, I think it was last year, I think."
00:26:42,00:26:43,- That's interesting.
00:26:43,00:26:46,"'Cause like, I reckon that change,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"you see those things quite often, don't you?"
00:26:48,00:26:50,"And they say, oh, the Irish accent's most sexy."
00:26:50,00:26:53,"Or the Yorkshire is, never the Birmingham weirdly,"
00:26:53,00:26:54,but they do say that.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"And I wonder if it's like fashion,"
00:26:55,00:26:57,like they've seen people like yourself
00:26:57,00:26:58,"doing the Manc accent on TV,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,and they associate it with--
00:27:00,00:27:02,- Did the Gallagas have an effect?
00:27:02,00:27:03,"- I think they did, yeah."
00:27:03,00:27:04,- On the sexiness of the Mancunian.
00:27:04,00:27:05,- That's what I'm thinking.
00:27:05,00:27:08,"- Yeah, 'cause I read a thing that in America,"
00:27:08,00:27:11,there was once a vote on what was the most sexy accent
00:27:11,00:27:12,from the UK.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"- Oh, the UK, okay."
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- Yeah, and Glasgow won it, right?"
00:27:15,00:27:19,"And I wonder, because Billy Conley is so big in America,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"whether or not there was just something kind of like,"
00:27:21,00:27:23,"I know he's not seen as like a sex symbol,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"but he's seen as really charismatic,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,"really funny, everything that's like likable."
00:27:27,00:27:29,- Silky guy. - Yeah.
00:27:29,00:27:31,- Or whether the person doing the research
00:27:31,00:27:33,was Glaswegian and they felt intimidated.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- Yeah.
00:27:34,00:27:36,(all laughing)
00:27:36,00:27:38,"I get, one of my favorite things"
00:27:38,00:27:40,"about doing this show is, I quite often,"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"I haven't actually had it in the last sort of 12 months,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,but I used to get a bunch of linguists
00:27:44,00:27:45,"who would write to me saying,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"I take samples of your accent and my accent,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"and I play it to other people who are linguists,"
00:27:50,00:27:53,and the challenges work out where he's from.
00:27:53,00:27:55,"And every time they say, no one can work out,"
00:27:55,00:27:58,"they say like, Canada or like New Zealand Australia,"
00:27:58,00:27:59,"like they get elements of it,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,but no one needs to collect on tour.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"- And we sort of do like signings afterwards,"
00:28:04,00:28:05,"and people sometimes come up and say,"
00:28:05,00:28:06,"where are you from, to Dan?"
00:28:06,00:28:07,"And then you'd ask them to guess,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,and I used to keep a list on my phone
00:28:09,00:28:10,of everywhere people had guessed.
00:28:10,00:28:11,- Did you?
00:28:11,00:28:12,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:12,00:28:13,"And it was, I mean, the whole world."
00:28:13,00:28:15,"- 'Cause I think you just have an international accent,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"like from, as if you went to international school,"
00:28:17,00:28:18,like my wife's got similar.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:28:19,00:28:21,- Kind of slightly North American weird accent.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"- Yeah, but I guess if then that becomes the challenge"
00:28:23,00:28:26,"for the linguists, what are the influences on this accent?"
00:28:26,00:28:27,- We were saying before that when people
00:28:27,00:28:29,who are from a certain place go back to that place
00:28:29,00:28:31,"or speak to other people from that place,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"they start, that accent starts to come out a bit more."
00:28:33,00:28:35,Do you have that with one of your?
00:28:35,00:28:40,"- If I go to Australia, I definitely lean into Aussie a bit."
00:28:40,00:28:41,"I should have a British accent by now,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,"'cause I've been here long enough, but I don't."
00:28:43,00:28:45,"And the Hong Kong accent was very American,"
00:28:45,00:28:46,where I grew up.
00:28:46,00:28:49,- But where do you go to sound more like you are now?
00:28:49,00:28:51,"Not just more Aussie, you know?"
00:28:51,00:28:52,'Cause you don't really sound very Aussie.
00:28:52,00:28:53,- No.
00:28:53,00:28:54,- When you travel internationally.
00:28:54,00:28:56,It's actually only in departure lounges.
00:28:56,00:28:57,(laughing)
00:28:57,00:28:58,But Dan sounds most like himself.
00:28:58,00:28:59,- Yeah.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"- Whenever you're buying a Toblerone, it's like,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"""Ah, yeah, I don't know."""
00:29:03,00:29:05,(upbeat music)
00:29:05,00:29:11,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:11,00:29:12,and that's my fact.
00:29:12,00:29:14,My fact this week is that of the few people
00:29:14,00:29:17,"who have top secret clearance at the White House,"
00:29:17,00:29:19,one of them is the person
00:29:19,00:29:21,who writes all of the party invitations.
00:29:21,00:29:23,(laughing)
00:29:23,00:29:24,- Amazing.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"- Such a good plot for something, isn't it?"
00:29:26,00:29:27,"- It is, isn't it?"
00:29:27,00:29:28,"- You know, the calligrapher."
00:29:28,00:29:31,- And it's the president's party invitation writer.
00:29:31,00:29:33,- It's missing.
00:29:33,00:29:33,- Yes.
00:29:33,00:29:36,"- 'Cause you'll know, as the invitation writer,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,"who's coming to the summits, who's, you know."
00:29:38,00:29:40,"- Yeah, it's everyone's address."
00:29:40,00:29:41,He's got Brezhnev's address.
00:29:41,00:29:42,He's got--
00:29:42,00:29:43,"- Brezhnev, yeah."
00:29:43,00:29:45,- Do you think of a key global player?
00:29:45,00:29:47,(laughing)
00:29:47,00:29:50,"Brezhnev, when did Brezhnev stop running the Soviet Union?"
00:29:50,00:29:53,(laughing)
00:29:53,00:29:55,- I was thinking of mine as a Cold War thriller.
00:29:55,00:29:57,(laughing)
00:29:57,00:29:59,- Imagine how beautiful his ransom letters would be.
00:29:59,00:30:00,- Oh.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- From the calligrapher.
00:30:01,00:30:02,That would be perfect.
00:30:02,00:30:05,So this is a thing where this kind of came up in the news
00:30:05,00:30:07,when it was during Trump's administration
00:30:07,00:30:09,"that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,had been downgraded from top secret clearance
00:30:11,00:30:13,because they sort of just tried
00:30:13,00:30:14,to stop making everyone have it.
00:30:14,00:30:17,And people noted that--
00:30:17,00:30:19,"- 'Cause he had too many links to the Saudis, but yeah, sure."
00:30:19,00:30:20,"- Yeah, yeah, so--"
00:30:20,00:30:22,(laughing)
00:30:22,00:30:24,"- It's nice not recording on the BBC, is it?"
00:30:24,00:30:26,(laughing)
00:30:26,00:30:28,- So it got downgraded and someone was pointing out
00:30:28,00:30:30,that actually he's now got less clearance
00:30:30,00:30:33,than the calligrapher has on the in-house.
00:30:33,00:30:34,And the reason the calligrapher has it
00:30:34,00:30:36,is because they have to know everything
00:30:36,00:30:37,"about the president's appointments,"
00:30:37,00:30:39,"what's coming up, who they have to,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,and they're near dignitaries all the time.
00:30:41,00:30:43,And so they need to be on top of everything
00:30:43,00:30:44,that they need to write
00:30:44,00:30:45,because they write so many invitations.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"They have a unit, it's a calligraphy unit."
00:30:47,00:30:49,There's a whole office that does this.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"It's not many people, there's only like three or four people."
00:30:52,00:30:53,But-- - That's still a lot.
00:30:53,00:30:54,- It's a lot.
00:30:54,00:30:57,"In fact, one of them said that in one December period alone,"
00:30:57,00:31:00,"they believed that they did 19,000 envelopes."
00:31:00,00:31:01,- Brilliant.
00:31:01,00:31:02,- And those are handwritten.
00:31:02,00:31:05,"- So yeah, so, and they're paid very, very handsomely."
00:31:05,00:31:08,And they've been going for a very long time.
00:31:08,00:31:11,Like they're like long-term posts that they can run for.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"- But they did ask one of the,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,I think he was by this point the former calligrapher
00:31:15,00:31:16,when the story broke.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"And Rick Paulus, who had run the office,"
00:31:18,00:31:21,he said that it was just 'cause of the schedule
00:31:21,00:31:22,and the proximity to world leaders.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"He said he never, ever dealt with intelligence matters,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,which you would hope he would not.
00:31:27,00:31:28,(laughing)
00:31:28,00:31:33,As in something's gone wrong if he has to solve a crisis.
00:31:33,00:31:36,- I wonder who's the best RSV peer.
00:31:36,00:31:37,"- Oh, like the timeliest."
00:31:37,00:31:38,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:31:38,00:31:39,- Of all the world leaders.
00:31:39,00:31:40,- Yes.
00:31:40,00:31:41,- That's interesting.
00:31:41,00:31:46,- I feel like Trudeau's waiting by the post office door.
00:31:46,00:31:47,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:31:47,00:31:47,- He'll reply nice and soon.
00:31:47,00:31:49,They did a thing like this with the Royal Wedding.
00:31:49,00:31:51,"There was a, I can't remember which Royal Wedding it was,"
00:31:51,00:31:53,"whether it was William Cate or Harry and Meghan,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"but they ran a thing of, so-and-so's replied very quickly."
00:31:55,00:31:56,"- Oh, really?"
00:31:56,00:31:57,Really?
00:31:57,00:31:58,- Yeah.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- Do you remember the fact that Meghan Markle,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"her former job when she was an actor as a side job,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,she was a calligrapher for invitations.
00:32:05,00:32:06,So that's what she did.
00:32:06,00:32:09,- She did Robin Thickey.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"- Of blurred lines, Robin Thickey."
00:32:11,00:32:12,- Yes.
00:32:12,00:32:13,"- Yeah, a blurred lines wave."
00:32:13,00:32:16,"He did, his wedding, the invites were written by Meghan Markle."
00:32:16,00:32:17,- You know Robin Thicke?
00:32:17,00:32:18,- Yeah.
00:32:18,00:32:19,- Who's that?
00:32:19,00:32:21,- The blurred lines guy.
00:32:21,00:32:23,"Do you know, his dad was really famous."
00:32:23,00:32:26,"He wrote the theme tune to Different Strokes, the TV show."
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- Ooh, is that also a problematic song?"
00:32:28,00:32:31,(laughing)
00:32:31,00:32:32,- Sounds it.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"- It's not like a sexy song, it's like a show."
00:32:34,00:32:37,"- Sure, it means something very different."
00:32:37,00:32:41,"- Wow, that's the best, I mean, no offense by this James."
00:32:41,00:32:43,"Trippy effect, I've ever heard."
00:32:43,00:32:46,(laughing)
00:32:46,00:32:48,"Like that's good, that's good."
00:32:48,00:32:49,"- It's just something that happens to know, that's all."
00:32:49,00:32:50,- That's fabulous.
00:32:50,00:32:51,"- Rick Polis, by the way."
00:32:51,00:32:54,So this guy was the head of calligraphy.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Have you seen his website?
00:32:55,00:32:58,"rickpoliskalligraphy.com, wonderful."
00:32:58,00:33:01,He's quite annoyed because the kind of digital age
00:33:01,00:33:03,where computers started recording all the examples
00:33:03,00:33:06,of all the invites that they write over the years
00:33:06,00:33:09,"and now being archived, he kind of just missed that."
00:33:09,00:33:12,So a lot of his work isn't online for you to see.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"So he presents on his website, my favorite invites"
00:33:15,00:33:17,and my favorite bits of calligraphy
00:33:17,00:33:18,that I did for the White House.
00:33:18,00:33:21,"Yeah, so you can see menu for the president of Ireland."
00:33:21,00:33:23,"- That's a cool one, isn't it?"
00:33:23,00:33:27,- He did a load of convoluted Celtic style design.
00:33:27,00:33:28,"- Oh, that's great."
00:33:28,00:33:30,"All of those meals the president pays for, doesn't he?"
00:33:30,00:33:31,"- Yeah, is that weird?"
00:33:31,00:33:32,"- Yeah, is that right?"
00:33:32,00:33:35,"'Cause it's, we, when I went to the White House."
00:33:35,00:33:36,- Clang?
00:33:36,00:33:37,"- Yeah, kind of."
00:33:37,00:33:38,(all laughing)
00:33:38,00:33:39,"Guys, are we talking about the White House?"
00:33:39,00:33:41,- When did you go?
00:33:41,00:33:44,"- I went, at the start of this year,"
00:33:44,00:33:47,the cast of Ted Lasso were inexplicably invited
00:33:47,00:33:51,for an audience with the president and the first lady.
00:33:51,00:33:52,"Insane, yeah."
00:33:52,00:33:55,Six of the cast members sort of spoke to the president
00:33:55,00:33:57,and the first lady about mental health
00:33:57,00:33:58,and the effect that the show has
00:33:58,00:34:01,and sort of impact that is needed over there.
00:34:01,00:34:02,"But we also, you know, we were having a tour"
00:34:02,00:34:05,"and we sort of had, you know, learned some things"
00:34:05,00:34:07,about a little thing or two about the White House.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"And one is that the president,"
00:34:10,00:34:14,because a lot of it is state funded
00:34:14,00:34:16,"or sort of funded by taxpayers,"
00:34:16,00:34:19,they can't be seen to be handing out big banquets
00:34:19,00:34:21,for everybody that comes.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"It is just, like he says, gaff, isn't it?"
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:34:24,00:34:26,"- And you know, hopefully one day we'll be able to say,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,"huh, gaff, guys, all right, we're all right, guys."
00:34:28,00:34:31,"- 2020, '23, did you get an invite and we'll fill them?"
00:34:31,00:34:33,- Are you just like a handwritten one?
00:34:33,00:34:34,"- No, I did not."
00:34:34,00:34:36,We got an email and obviously we all thought it was fake
00:34:36,00:34:38,that we'd be invited to the White House.
00:34:38,00:34:40,I wonder if the same guy types the emails on.
00:34:40,00:34:43,- He types them incredibly.
00:34:43,00:34:45,He has a little wand he uses to tap each letter.
00:34:45,00:34:46,"It's very gay, yeah."
00:34:46,00:34:51,- Did you have lunch with Biden or did you just say hi?
00:34:51,00:34:52,'Cause I saw a photo.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"You were in the Oval Office, right?"
00:34:53,00:34:55,"- We were, we took her to the Oval Office, yeah."
00:34:55,00:34:56,- Oh my God.
00:34:56,00:34:57,- Which is wild.
00:34:57,00:34:58,"It was the energy you walk in the room,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,"you're like, oh, some scandals sort of."
00:35:00,00:35:02,"- Yeah, right."
00:35:02,00:35:06,"- But no, we were kept in the map room where we ate,"
00:35:06,00:35:09,which is where they planned the D-Day landings
00:35:09,00:35:11,"in the map room, just to be sitting there eating as odd."
00:35:11,00:35:13,And you're there with like 25 Secret Service
00:35:13,00:35:14,or just sort of knocking them out.
00:35:14,00:35:17,"Who were so cool, really nice."
00:35:17,00:35:20,"And also like have, you know, you ask them any question"
00:35:20,00:35:22,and you can see them go through the Rolodex of
00:35:22,00:35:24,"what can I say, what can't I say."
00:35:25,00:35:29,"The weird thing was, I don't know if you've had it,"
00:35:29,00:35:32,"when you call someone by a title,"
00:35:32,00:35:33,it suddenly feels very strange
00:35:33,00:35:35,and these people that you've been knocking about
00:35:35,00:35:36,"with the cast members I've been with,"
00:35:36,00:35:39,"hearing them call someone a title,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,it feels very contrived the whole thing.
00:35:41,00:35:42,- Do you mean like Mr. President?
00:35:42,00:35:43,- Mr. President.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"- Huh, yeah, yeah."
00:35:44,00:35:47,- And so you're just thinking about that the whole time
00:35:47,00:35:49,when you're meeting him.
00:35:49,00:35:50,- What's the term for the first lady?
00:35:50,00:35:51,"- Dr. Biden, I think."
00:35:51,00:35:54,"- Dr. Biden, sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:35:54,00:35:55,"- And obviously the whole time you're thinking,"
00:35:55,00:35:58,"it's like in Taxi Driver, when you did an eros go,"
00:35:58,00:35:59,"you're talking to me, you're talking to me."
00:35:59,00:36:01,"It was like, before I turned up, I was like,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,"Mr. President, Mr. President, hello Mr. President."
00:36:03,00:36:06,"And of course, it's just, don't say Trump, don't say Trump,"
00:36:06,00:36:06,don't say Trump.
00:36:06,00:36:08,(all laughing)
00:36:08,00:36:10,"But it was funny when we were saying goodbye,"
00:36:10,00:36:13,"the guy who plays Isaac McAdoo, Colla Bikini,"
00:36:13,00:36:15,"I was stood next to him, he was shaking our hands,"
00:36:15,00:36:17,"the president was shaking our hand,"
00:36:17,00:36:18,it's all going around the circle.
00:36:18,00:36:19,"And it turns to Colla, he goes,"
00:36:19,00:36:21,"thank you for coming along, son."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:23,00:36:24,- Cheers.
00:36:24,00:36:26,(all laughing)
00:36:26,00:36:27,"He turns to me and he says,"
00:36:27,00:36:28,"I just said, cheers to the president."
00:36:28,00:36:31,(all laughing)
00:36:31,00:36:33,- That's so good.
00:36:33,00:36:35,"- I don't know how often people call the president,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"dad, by Mr. President."
00:36:37,00:36:38,"- You know, like calling the teacher, mum."
00:36:38,00:36:40,"- Exactly. - Yeah, yeah."
00:36:40,00:36:42,- It must have happened to him on a sort of daily basis.
00:36:42,00:36:44,- It's such a shame you didn't have lunch with him
00:36:44,00:36:46,because I've heard great stories about his lunchtime.
00:36:46,00:36:49,"Well, when he sits with Kamala Harris"
00:36:49,00:36:51,"and they have their lunch,"
00:36:51,00:36:54,he likes to eat with a slideshow going.
00:36:54,00:36:55,So they just eat their meal
00:36:55,00:36:57,while they're watching a slideshow
00:36:57,00:36:59,"of all the recent adventures they've had,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,just so that they can sort of remember and reflect on.
00:37:01,00:37:02,"- What, just the photos of?"
00:37:02,00:37:03,"- Yeah, yeah, it's just a slideshow."
00:37:03,00:37:06,"- That's nice, I think. - Yeah, I think, yeah."
00:37:06,00:37:07,- Is it a slideshow of his stuff or both of their?
00:37:07,00:37:09,"- Both of them, I think, it's, yeah."
00:37:09,00:37:11,"It's just like, oh, okay, here I am, shaking a hand."
00:37:11,00:37:13,"Yeah, so that's Ted Lutter, okay?"
00:37:13,00:37:14,"He said, cheers."
00:37:14,00:37:17,(all laughing)
00:37:17,00:37:19,But can I tell you one last calligraphy thing?
00:37:19,00:37:20,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:20,00:37:22,- Did you hear of Rick Muffler?
00:37:22,00:37:23,- No.
00:37:23,00:37:24,- What a guy.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"So Rick Muffler used to be a calligrapher,"
00:37:26,00:37:28,"maybe the chief one, and he was controversial"
00:37:28,00:37:30,'cause he was the only left-handed calligrapher
00:37:30,00:37:31,in the office.
00:37:31,00:37:33,"- Oh, that means you're gonna smudge"
00:37:33,00:37:34,everyone else's calligraphy.
00:37:34,00:37:36,"- Exactly, it was a nightmare."
00:37:36,00:37:39,"But just, he's cool, particularly because"
00:37:39,00:37:41,it's kind of a family thing for him.
00:37:41,00:37:43,So his grandfather was a chauffeur
00:37:43,00:37:46,for President Warren G. Harding.
00:37:46,00:37:50,"And then his dad, John Muffler,"
00:37:50,00:37:53,was an electrician who wound the clocks
00:37:53,00:37:54,in the whole White House.
00:37:54,00:37:56,He worked there for 50 years.
00:37:56,00:37:58,"He arrived in the late Second World War,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,and he was there for Bill Clinton.
00:38:00,00:38:01,That's all that time he was in the White House.
00:38:01,00:38:03,- And so Muffler's the third?
00:38:03,00:38:04,Is that who we're talking about?
00:38:04,00:38:05,- Rick Muffler was the third Muffler.
00:38:05,00:38:07,I don't know if there's a new Muffler.
00:38:07,00:38:10,"- I'd like to dream, and I won't be here to see it,"
00:38:10,00:38:13,"but in like 500 years, there'll be a Muffler president."
00:38:13,00:38:18,And like they'll have muffled the way up to the top.
00:38:19,00:38:20,"- That would be good, wouldn't it?"
00:38:20,00:38:21,- That'd be great.
00:38:21,00:38:24,(laughing)
00:38:24,00:38:26,- There were some sort of heirs and graces
00:38:26,00:38:28,that the Trump family didn't really follow.
00:38:28,00:38:29,"- Oh, really?"
00:38:29,00:38:31,"- There were traditions that the first lady,"
00:38:31,00:38:34,"when the president leaves office for the last time,"
00:38:34,00:38:37,the first lady would sit for a portrait.
00:38:37,00:38:39,"And Melania refused to do that,"
00:38:39,00:38:42,or has certainly has yet to have sat for it.
00:38:42,00:38:45,And there's this corridor where all of these paintings
00:38:45,00:38:49,"are put, and Michelle Obama is still placed"
00:38:49,00:38:50,"at the end of the corridor,"
00:38:50,00:38:53,which is traditionally where the previous encumbered--
00:38:53,00:38:54,- That's so interesting.
00:38:54,00:38:56,"- To be fair, I feel like both Donald and Melania"
00:38:56,00:38:58,probably have a painting in the attic somewhere.
00:38:58,00:39:00,(laughing)
00:39:00,00:39:02,- Very good reference.
00:39:02,00:39:03,- Thank you.
00:39:03,00:39:05,(laughing)
00:39:05,00:39:06,"- I was reading about top secret clearance,"
00:39:06,00:39:07,just 'cause these calligraphy people
00:39:07,00:39:08,have top secret clearance.
00:39:08,00:39:09,"- Oh, yeah."
00:39:09,00:39:11,"- It's a very weird thing, top secret clearance,"
00:39:11,00:39:15,"because it appears to, like so many people have,"
00:39:15,00:39:15,their numbers are mad.
00:39:15,00:39:18,"Okay, so there's like secret confidential,"
00:39:18,00:39:19,"and then top secret, or something like that."
00:39:19,00:39:21,The top secret's the highest.
00:39:21,00:39:23,"But top secret clearance, even back in 2015,"
00:39:23,00:39:26,it was 1.3 million Americans.
00:39:26,00:39:30,"- Yeah, that's like one in every 300 people in America."
00:39:30,00:39:33,"- Well, yeah, and if you broaden it to confidential,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,maybe that's the bottom rung.
00:39:34,00:39:37,It's about 1% of all Americans have secret status.
00:39:37,00:39:39,- None of the children will have it.
00:39:39,00:39:40,"So that's even, you know--"
00:39:40,00:39:41,"- God, you're right."
00:39:41,00:39:42,It's really common.
00:39:42,00:39:44,If you're American listening to this
00:39:44,00:39:45,"and you don't have top secret clearance,"
00:39:45,00:39:46,that's a shame on you.
00:39:46,00:39:48,"- Yeah, give you head of wobble."
00:39:48,00:39:50,- So when I said at the top of the few people
00:39:50,00:39:51,who have top secret clearance.
00:39:51,00:39:53,- But I wonder if it's slightly different
00:39:53,00:39:55,"than White House top secret compared to,"
00:39:55,00:39:56,this is like civil service top secret.
00:39:56,00:39:57,"- Yeah, there are--"
00:39:57,00:39:58,- And there's CIA and there's--
00:39:58,00:40:01,"- There are different donations within top secret where,"
00:40:01,00:40:03,like not everyone can look at the plans
00:40:03,00:40:05,"of where we're gonna invade next, or whatever."
00:40:05,00:40:05,- Who's coming for dinner?
00:40:05,00:40:07,- Yeah.
00:40:07,00:40:08,- Biden's slideshow.
00:40:08,00:40:11,(all laughing)
00:40:11,00:40:12,- Yeah.
00:40:12,00:40:12,- It is strange.
00:40:12,00:40:16,"- It became evident when, during the recent leaks,"
00:40:16,00:40:17,"during the Ukraine war,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,that was one of the things that people were so surprised about
00:40:19,00:40:21,was that there's so many people had this clearance
00:40:21,00:40:23,"that was, you know, very delicate."
00:40:23,00:40:24,- A 21 year old.
00:40:24,00:40:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:25,00:40:26,- Very peculiar.
00:40:26,00:40:27,- Yeah.
00:40:27,00:40:29,"- I was reading about some other parties,"
00:40:29,00:40:30,or some parties at the White House.
00:40:30,00:40:31,- Oh yeah.
00:40:31,00:40:32,- This is a party invitation guy.
00:40:32,00:40:33,- Yeah.
00:40:33,00:40:35,- I found there seems to be quite a common thing
00:40:35,00:40:39,of riots in inauguration parties
00:40:39,00:40:41,when people go to get their coats
00:40:41,00:40:42,at the end of the night.
00:40:42,00:40:43,- Yeah.
00:40:43,00:40:44,- This is really weird.
00:40:44,00:40:47,It happened in President Reagan's ball in 1985.
00:40:47,00:40:50,"Like, everyone went to get their coats at the end,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,and they got all mixed up.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"Because the inauguration takes place in winter, right?"
00:40:54,00:40:56,It takes place in January.
00:40:56,00:40:57,"So everyone's got loads of coats,"
00:40:57,00:40:59,and they're never prepared for it.
00:40:59,00:41:02,"In 1989, President Bush had a ball"
00:41:02,00:41:06,which got known as the Bastille Day Coat Check Riot.
00:41:06,00:41:09,"Because people were yelling and screaming,"
00:41:09,00:41:10,"and some people never, to the day,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,haven't got their coats back.
00:41:12,00:41:15,"There was one coat check person for 3,000 coats."
00:41:15,00:41:16,(laughing)
00:41:16,00:41:18,- What a nightmare.
00:41:18,00:41:19,"- And people, like, obviously,"
00:41:19,00:41:22,"these are all, like, really high-up people who think,"
00:41:22,00:41:25,"well, you know, I'm the most important person in this room."
00:41:25,00:41:27,I should get to the front and get my coat first.
00:41:27,00:41:30,"And people are shouting, bushing, and all that kind of stuff."
00:41:30,00:41:33,But it even goes back to 1849
00:41:33,00:41:35,at Zachary Taylor's inauguration ball.
00:41:35,00:41:38,Abraham Lincoln lost his hat.
00:41:38,00:41:40,"And for Ulysses S. Grant's inauguration,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,all the workers who were working in the close place
00:41:42,00:41:45,"were all illiterate, and no one got their coats, them, either."
00:41:45,00:41:46,So it just seems to be a thing.
00:41:46,00:41:47,"- That'd be dangerous for Lincoln,"
00:41:47,00:41:49,because Lincoln used to keep secret documents
00:41:49,00:41:50,"in the top of his hat, didn't he?"
00:41:50,00:41:51,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:41:51,00:41:52,- Top hat secrets.
00:41:52,00:41:53,"- Oh, good."
00:41:53,00:41:55,So just so weird.
00:41:55,00:41:57,- Shame that the beautiful calligraphy
00:41:57,00:41:58,would have been wasted on those people
00:41:58,00:41:59,that couldn't read.
00:41:59,00:42:01,(laughing)
00:42:01,00:42:03,(upbeat music)
00:42:06,00:42:08,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,and that is James.
00:42:10,00:42:13,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1999,"
00:42:13,00:42:16,The Times newspaper reported that Liverpool FC
00:42:16,00:42:19,were about to buy a footballer called Didier Baptiste.
00:42:19,00:42:20,The Times got the story
00:42:20,00:42:23,from Liverpool's premium line news service.
00:42:23,00:42:24,They got it from the news of the world.
00:42:24,00:42:26,"They got it from a sports agency,"
00:42:26,00:42:30,and they just found it on a random Arsenal fans website.
00:42:30,00:42:32,"In actual fact, Baptiste was a fictional player"
00:42:32,00:42:33,in a soap opera.
00:42:35,00:42:37,- What role did best casino play in there?
00:42:37,00:42:39,(laughing)
00:42:39,00:42:43,"- Yeah, so this is an amazing thing that happened."
00:42:43,00:42:44,It was in the papers in '99.
00:42:44,00:42:46,"Liverpool are gonna buy this guy Didier Baptiste,"
00:42:46,00:42:48,but he was actually a character
00:42:48,00:42:50,from the show Dream Team on Skies.
00:42:50,00:42:52,- So funny.
00:42:52,00:42:54,"- And yeah, just people hadn't checked it properly."
00:42:54,00:42:57,The Times said he was a promising left-back for Monaco
00:42:57,00:43:00,"and a proud member of the French under 21 national side,"
00:43:00,00:43:03,surely a steal for 3.5 million pounds.
00:43:03,00:43:04,- Amazing.
00:43:04,00:43:05,- Wow.
00:43:05,00:43:07,- The news of the world said we think Didier Baptiste
00:43:07,00:43:09,will be an ideal addition to Liverpool's back four.
00:43:09,00:43:11,He's a really attractive player.
00:43:11,00:43:12,You'll be seeing a lot more of him
00:43:12,00:43:14,in the news of the world from now on.
00:43:14,00:43:14,- Oh.
00:43:14,00:43:15,- Obviously.
00:43:15,00:43:16,(laughing)
00:43:16,00:43:17,"- Yeah, it was just completely made up."
00:43:17,00:43:18,- Lying again.
00:43:18,00:43:22,- Is this like a transfer season rumours thing?
00:43:22,00:43:25,"'Cause lots of football stories seem to be about, you know."
00:43:25,00:43:26,"- Yeah, of course."
00:43:26,00:43:29,Like clubs gonna buy a new player.
00:43:29,00:43:31,"You often have never heard of them,"
00:43:31,00:43:33,especially if they're coming from a different country.
00:43:33,00:43:36,"And if he's an under 21 player, he's quite young."
00:43:36,00:43:37,It wouldn't be that surprising
00:43:37,00:43:38,"that you might not have heard of them,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,but you possibly would expect
00:43:40,00:43:43,that newspapers would do a bit more research.
00:43:43,00:43:44,"- I mean, you think at today's age,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"that would be absolutely absurd, it was absurd then,"
00:43:46,00:43:49,"but now, obviously, you'd be able to sort of,"
00:43:49,00:43:50,"you know, they'd be on FIFA"
00:43:50,00:43:51,or you could find them somehow.
00:43:51,00:43:52,- That's true.
00:43:52,00:43:53,- Yeah.
00:43:53,00:43:55,"- It would be more difficult to do today, for sure."
00:43:55,00:43:56,- When was this?
00:43:56,00:43:56,It was in the '90s.
00:43:56,00:43:57,- It was in '99.
00:43:57,00:43:58,- '99?
00:43:58,00:43:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:43:59,00:44:00,- Because it was so much harder
00:44:00,00:44:02,to find these foreign players
00:44:02,00:44:04,on databases or whatever.
00:44:04,00:44:07,"There was, do you hear about Ali Deer, not Ali Dyer?"
00:44:07,00:44:09,"In 1996, Graham Sunez,"
00:44:09,00:44:11,"who was the manager of Southampton at the time,"
00:44:11,00:44:13,"he got a call from George Weir,"
00:44:13,00:44:17,"who was a Ballon d'Or winner, you know, player of the year."
00:44:17,00:44:19,- Future president of Liberia.
00:44:19,00:44:20,"- Yes, yes."
00:44:20,00:44:20,- Ooh.
00:44:20,00:44:21,"- Yeah, there you go."
00:44:21,00:44:22,- And he's interested.
00:44:22,00:44:24,- He's really muffled his way up there.
00:44:24,00:44:26,(laughing)
00:44:26,00:44:30,"- He called Graham Sunez,"
00:44:30,00:44:35,"saying that he should give his cousin, Ali Dyer, a trial,"
00:44:35,00:44:38,"because he'd been playing at Paris Saint-Germain,"
00:44:38,00:44:39,"he'd been playing for Liberia,"
00:44:39,00:44:40,and he'd been doing pretty well.
00:44:40,00:44:43,"And so, Sunez was like, that's amazing."
00:44:43,00:44:45,"I mean, you know, playing at Paris Saint-Germain,"
00:44:45,00:44:45,that's incredible.
00:44:45,00:44:49,"And so, they gave him a sort of trial contract."
00:44:49,00:44:52,"They gave him three and a half grand, signing on bonus."
00:44:52,00:44:54,"And he turned up to training,"
00:44:54,00:44:57,"and Matt LaTissier, who was sort of the star player,"
00:44:57,00:44:58,he's quite the same.
00:44:58,00:44:59,What's this bloke doing here?
00:44:59,00:45:01,- I honestly thought he won a competition.
00:45:01,00:45:04,(laughing)
00:45:04,00:45:09,But it was the reserve team that Ali Dyer had been put
00:45:09,00:45:12,onto to play for that weekend.
00:45:12,00:45:13,Their match was canceled.
00:45:13,00:45:16,"And so, Southampton first team needed a sub."
00:45:16,00:45:21,"And so, he went there and subbed on when LaTissier was injured."
00:45:21,00:45:24,He played for 43 minutes before being subbed off again.
00:45:24,00:45:25,He's so bad.
00:45:25,00:45:26,- He was just a made up guy.
00:45:26,00:45:28,"Was it even, was the George Wayer thing,"
00:45:28,00:45:30,or was it actually George Wayer who called him?
00:45:30,00:45:30,- No.
00:45:30,00:45:32,"- So, they don't know to this day who really who it was,"
00:45:32,00:45:35,"but people believe it might have been his friend,"
00:45:35,00:45:36,"or it might have been his, you know."
00:45:36,00:45:38,- It was just a bloke.
00:45:38,00:45:39,I love these stories.
00:45:39,00:45:40,"- Yeah, I love the Hutzpah."
00:45:40,00:45:41,- Yeah.
00:45:41,00:45:43,- Do you guys hear about Karl Power?
00:45:43,00:45:44,"- Karl Power, okay."
00:45:44,00:45:46,"- Karl Power was, he wasn't never a sports player,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,but he was a serial trickster.
00:45:48,00:45:50,And his thing was tricking his way
00:45:50,00:45:52,"into sporting environments that he wasn't meant to be in,"
00:45:52,00:45:53,right?
00:45:53,00:45:54,"And he started, like, when he was a teenager,"
00:45:54,00:45:56,he would tell them about boxing matches
00:45:56,00:45:57,"with a towel and a gym bag,"
00:45:57,00:45:58,and he would get him for free
00:45:58,00:46:00,"'cause they assumed he was part of the fight, right?"
00:46:00,00:46:02,"- That's a risky one, though, isn't it?"
00:46:02,00:46:05,"'Cause if they think you're an actual boxer,"
00:46:05,00:46:06,you're in trouble.
00:46:06,00:46:08,"- He built on it, and he built his career."
00:46:08,00:46:10,"And he, so one of his greatest moments"
00:46:10,00:46:13,was when he got into a Manchester United team photo
00:46:13,00:46:15,just before they played a big Champions League match.
00:46:15,00:46:16,And you can see a shot.
00:46:16,00:46:19,"He's got Ryan Giggs, Andy Cole, Gary Neville,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,"and Karl, just this guy."
00:46:21,00:46:23,"And Neville, Neville, was the only one who rumbled him."
00:46:23,00:46:25,"Like, they were all lined up for the photo,"
00:46:25,00:46:26,"and Neville pointed at him and said,"
00:46:26,00:46:27,"""Who are you, who are you?"""
00:46:27,00:46:30,"And he said, ""Shut it, Gary, you grass."""
00:46:30,00:46:32,(all laughing)
00:46:32,00:46:33,- You can see that video.
00:46:33,00:46:35,You can see Roy Keane right at the end clocks it.
00:46:35,00:46:38,"And Roy Keane, he's a pretty feisty footballer."
00:46:38,00:46:41,"And you see him look across, and it's daggers."
00:46:41,00:46:42,- That's so funny.
00:46:42,00:46:44,That's really a shut-in grass.
00:46:44,00:46:46,- He spent his whole career doing this.
00:46:46,00:46:48,"I said career, he didn't get paid much for it,"
00:46:48,00:46:49,but he played on centre court.
00:46:49,00:46:50,"He just turned up and played,"
00:46:50,00:46:52,he played a match like a little warm-up
00:46:52,00:46:54,with someone like Tim Hemman.
00:46:54,00:46:56,"He got onto the podium at the Grand Prix,"
00:46:56,00:46:57,the British Grand Prix.
00:46:57,00:46:58,"- He came out to bat for England,"
00:46:58,00:47:00,and the test match they were playing was.
00:47:00,00:47:00,"I mean, it was."
00:47:00,00:47:03,- But he didn't actually hit any balls.
00:47:03,00:47:04,"He just walked towards,"
00:47:04,00:47:05,and then they realised it was the wrong person.
00:47:05,00:47:06,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:06,00:47:08,"But I just, I had mine so much."
00:47:08,00:47:10,- But that's performance art.
00:47:10,00:47:11,- That's not.
00:47:11,00:47:11,- Yeah.
00:47:11,00:47:12,- That's pure performance art.
00:47:12,00:47:14,"- That's brilliant, 'cause he's still going in car power."
00:47:14,00:47:16,"- I don't think he's still trading, as it were,"
00:47:16,00:47:19,"but I think he's still around, yeah."
00:47:19,00:47:20,"- Once you get to an age,"
00:47:20,00:47:22,you can't pretend to be a footballer anymore.
00:47:22,00:47:24,"- You can't pretend to be a manager, I guess."
00:47:24,00:47:28,"- Or like a bowls player, or something like that."
00:47:28,00:47:30,"- I found a, this is a real footballer,"
00:47:30,00:47:32,but had a fictional element to them.
00:47:32,00:47:34,So it's sort of like mostly real person.
00:47:34,00:47:36,"But I was reading about Maradona,"
00:47:36,00:47:38,"and Maradona, so he used to do a lot of drugs."
00:47:38,00:47:41,I think that's very well known to do.
00:47:41,00:47:42,- I like it.
00:47:42,00:47:43,- Breaking news.
00:47:43,00:47:46,"Yeah, Andy, he was big on the old cocaine."
00:47:46,00:47:49,"But so he had, he was all real, except he had a fake penis."
00:47:49,00:47:50,"- Sorry, Maradona."
00:47:50,00:47:53,"- Maradona, he had a real penis,"
00:47:53,00:47:55,"but he also had a special fake penis made of plastic,"
00:47:55,00:47:57,"so that when he had to do drug tests,"
00:47:57,00:47:59,"he would pull the fake penis out,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,and he would allow the urine to come through it.
00:48:01,00:48:03,And it's so hard to get to the bottom of this story.
00:48:03,00:48:06,"Supposedly, the penis was put on display"
00:48:06,00:48:09,"in a museum in Buenos Aires, and then went on tour."
00:48:09,00:48:10,"I read this in The Guardian,"
00:48:10,00:48:12,"written on tour, and then someone stole the penis,"
00:48:12,00:48:13,somewhere on tour.
00:48:13,00:48:16,So this missing relic of Maradona's
00:48:16,00:48:19,"is out in the world somewhere, but yeah."
00:48:19,00:48:19,- Wow.
00:48:19,00:48:21,- That'll be on some billionaire's mantelpiece.
00:48:21,00:48:24,"You know, they've paid big, big money to a cabal"
00:48:24,00:48:25,or something to source.
00:48:25,00:48:26,- What's called the knob of God.
00:48:26,00:48:27,- Nob of God.
00:48:27,00:48:29,"- Yeah, someone's got the knob of God."
00:48:29,00:48:31,"- And you have a fake bladder, too, I guess."
00:48:31,00:48:32,"- It's called a whizinator, I think."
00:48:32,00:48:34,"I've heard of these things before,"
00:48:34,00:48:37,"and yeah, you use them for, like, drug tests."
00:48:37,00:48:39,- Do you hook it up to a fake bladder?
00:48:39,00:48:40,Or does the penis contain the fake urine
00:48:40,00:48:41,that you're trying to--
00:48:41,00:48:43,"- It's not an actual human bladder,"
00:48:43,00:48:47,"it's just a bit of plastic, but yeah, a bag."
00:48:47,00:48:49,"- So you've got the bag and the whizinator,"
00:48:49,00:48:53,"the fake penis, and everything's in your trousers, right?"
00:48:53,00:48:55,"- Well, everything's about your person, for sure."
00:48:55,00:48:59,"But then there was a person who did that,"
00:48:59,00:49:01,"and it turned out that they were pregnant,"
00:49:01,00:49:03,even though it was a male-spurred person.
00:49:03,00:49:06,"Yeah, he'd taken some female urine,"
00:49:06,00:49:09,"and they were like, ""Good news, you didn't take any drugs."""
00:49:09,00:49:11,- I heard you used your pregnant.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"- And a horse, apparently."
00:49:13,00:49:18,"Before you said anything about explaining the drug test thing,"
00:49:18,00:49:19,I thought you were gonna say it was
00:49:19,00:49:21,"'cause people would try and grope him at clubs,"
00:49:21,00:49:23,and then he could kind of make a getaway.
00:49:23,00:49:24,"You know, like, a lizard losing its tail."
00:49:24,00:49:26,"- Oh, right. - That's a great idea."
00:49:26,00:49:28,"- I mean, I don't imagine he played with it, did he?"
00:49:28,00:49:29,Did he play?
00:49:29,00:49:31,- I don't think you're asked for urine samples mid-gay.
00:49:31,00:49:34,(all laughing)
00:49:34,00:49:36,"- To me, a non-fan, that would liven things up."
00:49:36,00:49:37,(all laughing)
00:49:37,00:49:38,"- Well, you've seen when Gary Lineker"
00:49:38,00:49:40,"pooed himself on pitch, haven't you?"
00:49:40,00:49:41,"- Oh, yeah? - Yeah."
00:49:41,00:49:42,"- I haven't seen that clip, yeah, yeah."
00:49:42,00:49:43,"- Well, 'cause there's a mystery,"
00:49:43,00:49:45,"we wrote about this in our book of the year,"
00:49:45,00:49:47,"the fish book, that Gary Lineker, still to this day,"
00:49:47,00:49:49,"some 20-odd years after he did that,"
00:49:49,00:49:51,gets sent a single piece of toilet paper
00:49:51,00:49:54,that's got a bit of poo on it in the post.
00:49:54,00:49:56,"He's just constantly, he doesn't know who's doing it."
00:49:56,00:49:58,"- Oh, it's quite easy to find out"
00:49:58,00:49:59,surely who's poo that is.
00:49:59,00:50:00,"- Well, yeah. - You can just take a look."
00:50:00,00:50:03,"- No, but if the person sending it is clean,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,they're not on any DNA registers.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"- I was thinking with, 'cause Gary Lineker's been"
00:50:06,00:50:08,"in a bit of problem with the government,"
00:50:08,00:50:09,"hasn't he? - Oh, yeah."
00:50:09,00:50:10,- This year.
00:50:10,00:50:11,"I wonder if Eddie was Czech, so well, a problem."
00:50:11,00:50:14,(all laughing)
00:50:16,00:50:19,"- Not saying it's her, but it's just worth checking"
00:50:19,00:50:20,"everyone, isn't it, really?"
00:50:20,00:50:21,All of his enemies.
00:50:21,00:50:24,God bless him.
00:50:24,00:50:25,What were you talking about?
00:50:25,00:50:29,"- Football, sort of fake or lie footballers."
00:50:29,00:50:30,- Yeah.
00:50:30,00:50:31,"- Looking at you, Phil."
00:50:31,00:50:34,(all laughing)
00:50:34,00:50:36,"- Well, I mean, our whole performances on Ted is,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,"it's so edited that, you know,"
00:50:38,00:50:40,"it's basically choreography on Ted Lasso,"
00:50:40,00:50:43,rather than it being sort of pretending
00:50:43,00:50:45,"we're playing football, I see it in one's choreography,"
00:50:45,00:50:47,but it's so hard to do.
00:50:47,00:50:49,"Because the thing, one of the things I really found,"
00:50:49,00:50:52,"I really tried to, like, (sighs)"
00:50:52,00:50:54,"when you see close-up of players,"
00:50:54,00:50:55,that was me breathing below.
00:50:55,00:50:56,(all laughing)
00:50:56,00:50:58,"But if there was ever shots in the middle of a game,"
00:50:58,00:50:59,I wanted it to feel like--
00:50:59,00:51:00,- You're probably panicking.
00:51:00,00:51:02,"- Yeah, and I feel like so many sports films you watch"
00:51:02,00:51:05,that that doesn't happen and it's really frustrating.
00:51:05,00:51:07,But there were certain things that the production
00:51:07,00:51:08,"had to take into their own hands,"
00:51:08,00:51:11,which was some of the particularly difficult
00:51:11,00:51:13,choreography that we had to do.
00:51:13,00:51:15,"Like, someone shoots, it hits off a post,"
00:51:15,00:51:16,it hits someone's face.
00:51:16,00:51:18,"It's CGI, the ball is CGI."
00:51:18,00:51:20,"So we'd be running around the pitch,"
00:51:20,00:51:22,"sort of pretending to kick a ball,"
00:51:22,00:51:24,which is very--
00:51:24,00:51:25,"- That feels like a bit more difficult, right?"
00:51:25,00:51:27,"- Yeah, it does, it feels hard."
00:51:27,00:51:29,- Because you've got to think of what the weight is
00:51:29,00:51:30,of the ball and how far it's going to go.
00:51:30,00:51:32,"- Do they not, like, in some CGI,"
00:51:32,00:51:34,they'll just have an orange instead of whatever?
00:51:34,00:51:35,"Like, you're fighting a dragon,"
00:51:35,00:51:36,but there's an orange or something.
00:51:36,00:51:38,(all laughing)
00:51:38,00:51:40,"- It's a guy in green, his head is the ball."
00:51:40,00:51:43,(all laughing)
00:51:43,00:51:46,- And the wonderful best actor goes to the ball.
00:51:46,00:51:47,(all laughing)
00:51:47,00:51:52,- Tom Hanks' Wilson Furious never made it to nomination level.
00:51:52,00:51:55,"- No, I've got one fact."
00:51:55,00:51:58,"It's less about sort of fake football,"
00:51:58,00:52:01,"but more, there is, do you know about Will Still,"
00:52:01,00:52:05,the manager at Reem or Ram FC?
00:52:05,00:52:07,It's a league team.
00:52:07,00:52:09,"And every single time the team plays,"
00:52:09,00:52:12,"they are fined 22,000 euros."
00:52:13,00:52:14,- What are they doing out there?
00:52:14,00:52:17,"- Well, it's not so much them, it's the manager himself."
00:52:17,00:52:21,He is the youngest manager in European football.
00:52:21,00:52:22,He's 30 years old.
00:52:22,00:52:27,"He's an English Belgian, I think, and it's incredible."
00:52:27,00:52:30,"He's like this sort of real hotshot manager,"
00:52:30,00:52:34,"but because he's so young,"
00:52:34,00:52:36,"he hasn't really had time to go and get his certifications,"
00:52:36,00:52:40,which you need in order to be a manager in Ligue 1.
00:52:40,00:52:43,"And so he's just sort of like, he learned off"
00:52:43,00:52:45,"football manager, and he went to university,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,"he got a degree, but it was really through that."
00:52:48,00:52:49,"But yeah, so--"
00:52:49,00:52:50,- So they find because he just hasn't got
00:52:50,00:52:52,the certification yet?
00:52:52,00:52:54,"- Yeah, so it's one of the rulings."
00:52:54,00:52:56,"- What a fine, how big of that can they forward that?"
00:52:56,00:52:59,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:59,00:53:03,"- But he's done so well, and it's incredible."
00:53:03,00:53:06,"If you watch a video of him, you hear him speaking"
00:53:06,00:53:08,"as one normally would in a training session in English,"
00:53:08,00:53:12,"and then without missing a beat, it goes into perfect French."
00:53:12,00:53:14,"And it's incredible, you watch him and it's just, yeah,"
00:53:14,00:53:15,"he's a really interesting guy, an interesting guy."
00:53:15,00:53:17,"- That's a shame, I always thought"
00:53:17,00:53:19,that we could just become a football manager.
00:53:19,00:53:22,"Whenever Tramir lose that, like Tramir lost,"
00:53:22,00:53:25,"I'm a Tramir fan, so we lost our manager a few weeks ago,"
00:53:25,00:53:27,"and I always think, it's worth a try, isn't it?"
00:53:27,00:53:30,"It's worth a try becoming a football manager,"
00:53:30,00:53:32,but now I know I have to get actual qualifications.
00:53:32,00:53:35,"- This feels like a French bureaucracy thing, surely."
00:53:35,00:53:36,- Do you think ever since Karl Power turned up
00:53:36,00:53:40,on Paris Saint-Germain and tried to coach the team?
00:53:40,00:53:41,- Do you think it'll be okay?
00:53:41,00:53:42,- I think it'll be fine.
00:53:42,00:53:43,"I think you'd be fine, James."
00:53:43,00:53:46,"What I don't know about football isn't worth knowing, right?"
00:53:46,00:53:47,So I'd say go for it.
00:53:47,00:53:51,- I can friend some park with a new thatched roof.
00:53:51,00:53:55,"- I'll be there, I'll be there, all right?"
00:53:55,00:53:56,I've got a season ticket.
00:53:56,00:54:03,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
