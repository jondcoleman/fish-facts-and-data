00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,200
 - Hello and welcome to a brand new episode

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,680
 of No Such Things as Fish.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,120
 First things first, let me tell you

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,680
 about our very, very, very special guest

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,560
 and that is Phil Dunster, the brilliant actor

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
 who plays the character Jamie Tartt

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,680
 in the unbelievable TV show, Ted Lasso.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,080
 I don't know if you've watched Ted Lasso,

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,600
 if you haven't, it's definitely worth checking out.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,640
 It's on Apple TV right now.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,920
 They're about to show the final episode

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,280
 and if you don't have Apple TV,

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,400
 I'm pretty sure you'll be able

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,000
 to get a free trial somewhere and it's well worth it.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,040
 There's loads of good stuff on there

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,960
 but especially Ted Lasso is such a good show.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,600
 Phil actually does listen to fish

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,280
 so he came well prepared with loads and loads of facts.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,260
 It was such a fun show to record

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,800
 and we all had such a great time.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,880
 Few more little bits of news.

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,240
 We have some live shows coming up

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,600
 in the Soho Theatre in London.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,360
 There are still tickets available for that

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,680
 although some of the dates are now sold out

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,120
 so you wanna get in there really quick

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,440
 to get tickets for that

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,640
 and those tickets can be found

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,320
 at knowstichthingasafish.com/soho

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,760
 and apart from that, join up to Club Fish.

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,040
 There's loads of fun stuff happening there all the time.

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,440
 There's bonus episodes, there's Discord

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,880
 where you can chat to fellow Fish fans.

35
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,600
 You'll learn about live tickets first.

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,640
 There's all sorts of bonuses for signing up to that

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,960
 so do that and apart from anything else,

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,280
 if you're listening in a place

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,600
 where you can follow knowstichthingasafish then do that.

40
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,880
 We taught some industry bots the other day

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,160
 and they said that is very important

42
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,240
 that you click follow if you like us.

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,200
 Anyway, enough about that.

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,720
 Really hope you enjoy this show with Phil.

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,480
 I'm absolutely certain you will

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,840
 and all I can say is on with a podcast.

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,420
 (upbeat music)

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,720
 of knowstichthingasafish,

50
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,280
 a weekly podcast coming to you

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,640
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,880
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Phil Dunster.

55
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,440
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
 Starting with fact number one, that is Phil.

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 - My fact this week is that the Shakespeare's Globe Theater

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,840
 is the only building with a thatched roof in London

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,280
 since the great fire of London in 1666.

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
 - Very cool.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,880
 - Andy is very excited right now.

64
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
 - That's so excited.

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,880
 - Thatched roofs, are you kidding me?

66
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,720
 - Yeah.

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
 - This is brilliant.

68
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,400
 - This is your thing.

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
 - Jonish.

70
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,560
 - Is it a fetish?

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,480
 - No, I wouldn't say fetish.

72
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,680
 - Would you like to have sex underneath the thatched roof?

73
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,320
 - Everyone's got a bucket list.

74
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,440
 (laughing)

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,960
 - Anyway, look, the Globe Theater, sorry.

76
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
 (laughing)

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
 - So what's the story, what's going on?

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,280
 - So Andrew Hunter Murray had sex inside the Globe Theater.

79
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
 (laughing)

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,880
 'Cause it had a thatched roof.

81
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,000
 It was fascinating, it was originally built in Shoreditch.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,320
 It was called the Burbage Theater in 1576.

83
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,520
 And the land was owned by this bloke called Giles Allen.

84
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,320
 And when the lease on the theater came up,

85
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,720
 he didn't want to renew it.

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,040
 And so the Chamberlain's men,

87
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,080
 which is Shakespeare's company of actors,

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,640
 they decided that they will just literally upsticks,

89
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,360
 take all of the timber from that theater

90
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,200
 and hide it in someone's shed for a bit.

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,440
 (laughing)

92
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,280
 And then, whilst Allen was away at Christmas,

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,560
 they built it a few hundred meters away from

94
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,120
 where the current Globe Theater currently is,

95
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,440
 is where they built the original.

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,840
 - So that one was thatched,

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,200
 the sort of proper original South Bank.

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,040
 - But that will have been

99
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,560
 before the Great Fire of London will it?

100
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,320
 - That was Shakespeare's time.

101
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,040
 - Yeah, it didn't hang around for very long.

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,000
 It was 1599, I think, was when it was built.

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,840
 And then it was actually burned down itself.

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,760
 It didn't need no Great Fire of London to burn itself down.

105
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,320
 - Wasn't it a cannon during a play?

106
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,080
 - I think it was Henry VIII?

108
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
 Was it?

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
 That bastard?

110
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,000
 (laughing)

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,440
 - I think it's one of the least good histories.

112
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,340
 I don't wanna--

113
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,200
 - Well, they don't play it very often, do they?

114
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,160
 - They don't go down the Globe and see Henry VIII.

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
 - No, well, I think there must be a reason for that.

116
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,440
 - Yeah, but last time they performed it,

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,480
 the whole fucking thing, probably on the band list.

118
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,960
 So did Shakespeare do his stuff in Burbage's Theater

119
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
 up in the East London side?

120
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
 - Sure did, yeah.

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,640
 - Oh, really?

122
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,960
 So was anything ever performed in his lifetime during--

123
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,360
 - Well, yeah, Lightfill says they moved the Globe down to--

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
 - And Shakespeare went along with it.

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

126
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,520
 - I think they rebuilt it within his lifetime,

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,400
 even though it burned down quite closely.

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,760
 He died in 1616, and I think it burned down

129
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
 not long before that, but they rebuilt it,

130
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,080
 and they're still showing new Shakespeare plays there.

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,400
 - Well, that's really good to know,

132
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,880
 because whenever I pass it, I think,

133
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,040
 oh, this is just a replica.

134
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,720
 It's not got any kind of original meat to it.

135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,320
 Shakespeare was dead by then, it's just a fake.

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
 But if he was alive while people were performing--

137
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,160
 - Well, the modern one is a new one.

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,000
 It's completely new.

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,200
 - It's an even more new one.

140
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,280
 - Yeah, so the modern one was built in the, what, '80s?

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
 - '90s.

142
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,560
 - Something like that, in the '90s, yeah.

143
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,720
 And that was by, what's he called?

144
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
 - San Juanemaker.

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,320
 - San Juanemaker, and that's the one which has got thatched now.

146
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
 - That's right, yeah.

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
 - Right.

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
 - Yeah, it's pretty much the same.

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
 It uses green oak, and it has wooden postings,

150
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
 or whatever, doweling, or whatever it holds it all together.

151
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,560
 They tried to make it as close

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,760
 to how it would have been made at the time,

153
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,480
 using all of the techniques that the builders would have used,

154
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,320
 but they had to use stuff like modern scaffolding,

155
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,000
 and they had to increase the amount

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,360
 of fire escapes and exits and all that sort of stuff.

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,320
 - They got sprinklers.

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
 - They got sprinklers, yeah.

159
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,680
 - I read them, I was reading the newspaper articles

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
 from the time, and as late as 1988,

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,120
 the papers were saying that there wouldn't be thatch,

162
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,560
 and it would be tiled, and that was due to fire regulations.

163
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,480
 And then sometime around 1990,

164
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,960
 they kind of changed their mind and said,

165
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,080
 "Yeah, we're gonna be allowed thatch after all."

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
 - That's cool.

167
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,160
 It's got some cashmere in the walls.

168
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,000
 - Is it?

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
 - Yeah, 'cause they used,

170
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,760
 they made proper old-fashioned plaster,

171
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,840
 as in 17th century plaster.

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,240
 Wattle and Dorb is the name of it,

173
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,600
 and it includes cashmere goat hair,

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,560
 which is an ingredient of the plaster, so yeah.

175
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,240
 - And the thatch roof that they have now

176
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,160
 has a hidden set of sprinklers all the way through it.

177
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,240
 - Oh yeah, nice.

178
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,080
 - Just in case.

179
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,920
 - Just in case.

180
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,760
 - Just so you know that they learned their lessons.

181
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,240
 - I found a company that made the thatch,

182
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,480
 they were called TAS, and there was an article about them,

183
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,160
 and apparently the globe wasn't the biggest-ever contract

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
 that they had.

185
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,120
 They had one bigger contract for thatch roofs,

186
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
 can you guess?

187
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,960
 - Oh, my God.

188
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,280
 - It was, oh, I've given it away, it's multiple roofs,

189
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,440
 multiple thatch roofs.

190
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,760
 - Did they redo a whole village or something?

191
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,080
 - In a way.

192
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,320
 - In a way, okay.

193
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,920
 - Phil, I'll edit out all these silences, by the way.

194
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,800
 - Oh, an Olympic village,

196
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,480
 but like an old fashioned Olympic village.

197
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
 - That's right, yeah, it was a 2012 Olympics.

198
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,840
 Everyone lived in batched houses.

199
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,640
 That's why they were all having sex all the time.

200
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,720
 - Right, absolutely.

201
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,600
 - Was it for like a Game of Thrones sets?

202
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,840
 - Okay, not Game of Thrones.

203
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,680
 - Harry Potter.

204
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
 - Lord of the Rings.

205
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
 - No.

206
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
 - Hobbit.

207
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
 - No.

208
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
 - Ted Lasso.

209
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,560
 (laughing)

210
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
 - I think, I don't know when this,

211
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
 I think it was '90s, so it's a similar era, this.

212
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
 - "Zena, the Warrior of Princes."

213
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,200
 - Film came out.

214
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,040
 - "Matrix."

215
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
 - Yeah, okay.

216
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,920
 - "Matrix," stop it.

217
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
 - Was it "Historical" for?

218
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,880
 - Oh, no, Shakespeare in love, Shakespeare in love.

219
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
 - No.

220
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
 - But that would have been--

221
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,400
 - That feels good, that feels good.

222
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
 - Do you feel it?

224
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,000
 - It's gonna be a bit of a downer now that I tell you.

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,720
 It was Robin Hood, "Prince of Thieves."

226
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
 - Oh, okay.

227
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
 - No, you were there tracks.

228
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,840
 - And they had to do the entire kind of village

229
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
 and they put thatch on all of them

230
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,040
 and that was the most money they ever made

231
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
 and the globe was the second most they ever made.

232
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
 - That's incredible.

233
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,320
 - His movies are expensive, man.

234
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,160
 - "Waterworld."

235
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
 - Kevin Castle, yeah, that's "Flood the Earth,"

236
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,840
 you know, for that one.

237
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,880
 Kevin Costner, these huge sets.

238
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
 - "Dances with Wolves,"

239
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,680
 they had to teach all those wolves how to dance.

240
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,640
 (laughing)

241
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,320
 - You know the globe?

242
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,160
 - I do, yeah.

243
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,720
 - When they rebuilt it, it then shrank.

244
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,560
 - Oh, riddle me that.

245
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,720
 - Oh, okay.

246
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,240
 - Okay, they built it in the summer and then it got cold.

247
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,280
 - What kind of, just the timber dries out.

248
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,560
 And it takes years and years for timber to properly dry out

249
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,040
 and it dries and it hardens and it shrinks a bit.

250
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,800
 - So it gets stronger through time, which is amazing.

251
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
 - That's cool, that's really good.

252
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,720
 Do you know where they got the timber from?

253
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
 - No.

254
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,760
 - I think it might have been the 1987 storm

255
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,160
 in the new forest knocked down loads of trees.

256
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,040
 But it's certainly a big storm in the late 80s,

257
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,760
 knocked down a load of trees in the new forest

258
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
 and they got all of the timber from there.

259
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,320
 - That's really cool.

260
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,600
 - Yeah, and also the Duke of Edinburgh offered wood

261
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
 from one of his oaks at Windsor.

262
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,240
 - Lovely.

263
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
 - That's great.

264
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,240
 - Good bloke, good bloke, yeah.

265
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,480
 Do you want to hear another fact

266
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,280
 about the Royal Family in this, by the way,

267
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,240
 while we're talking about,

268
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
 well, let's not say good blokes for this one.

269
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,080
 So they crowdfunded it quite a lot of the money for this

270
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,920
 because, you know, they need a load of money

271
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,700
 and they need to get it from somewhere.

272
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,160
 So they went to America and they had an event

273
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,160
 called UKLA88, a celebration of British arts.

274
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,000
 And according to the Desert Sun newspaper,

275
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,680
 the real stars will be Fergie and Prince Andrew.

276
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
 So Prince Andrew's partly responsible

277
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,240
 for the building of the globe.

278
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
 And the British consulate said,

279
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
 "When you think of Britain,

280
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,000
 "we don't want you to think about

281
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,960
 "fatched cottages and bobbies,

282
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,080
 "but of Concord, microchips and Phil Collins."

283
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
 (laughing)

284
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,040
 - I don't love to see Phil Collins perform at the Glow Theater.

285
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,360
 - Concord's not even going anymore.

286
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
 - No.

287
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,520
 - Microchips, do we make many microchips?

288
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,360
 - In the UK?

289
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
 - Possibly.

290
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
 - I don't think so.

291
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
 - Huge centre of friends.

292
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,120
 - Phil Collins is still going strong there.

293
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
 - That's a good point.

294
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
 - Yeah.

295
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,280
 - He's the one part of Britain that's left.

296
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
 - Yeah, have you played there, Phil, to look like?

297
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,120
 - I haven't played there.

298
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,240
 I've been to see quite a few productions there.

299
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,760
 I was a poor student when I went.

300
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,240
 And so I was standing.

301
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,720
 I was one of the groundlings.

302
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,800
 - Ooh.

303
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,760
 - And I was, I mean,

304
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,280
 I've got a pretty bad attention span as it is.

305
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,320
 And being stood there for like three and a half hours,

306
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,280
 I was like, "Oh, fuck this, man."

307
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,120
 But--

308
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
 - Do you remember what you were seeing?

309
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,160
 - I saw "Midsummer Night's Dream" there.

310
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,880
 And they were all great productions.

311
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,480
 But this is my, listen, I'm working on it, I'm working on it.

312
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,560
 But they have another space,

313
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
 which is called the Wanna Make a Playhouse,

314
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
 which, again, is made like a Playhouse

315
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
 would have been back in Dere.

316
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,440
 And it's fully lit by candles.

317
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,040
 And you can just imagine that, again,

318
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,640
 the schematics coming along, and they're like,

319
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,760
 "Right then, Globe Theatre, what do you got for us today

320
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,320
 "after all the thatched houses and all this stuff?"

321
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
 Oh, a fully wooden theatre, and it's only lit by candles.

322
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,680
 - The way you just said Dere,

323
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
 just then a second ago, back into Dere,

324
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,280
 apparently, if you see Shakespeare,

325
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,720
 you weren't here to be or not to be,

326
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,320
 you're here to bear or not to bear.

327
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 - Is that right?

328
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,520
 - Well, this is what I read.

329
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,000
 So apparently, the Globe Theatre has a tradition now,

330
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,720
 these days, of making sure that the accents

331
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
 that are spoken while Shakespeare plays on

332
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,760
 is the accent of the time.

333
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,240
 And so David Crystal, who James, you and I met years ago,

334
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,360
 he's a linguistic guy, he studies all types of language,

335
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,520
 and no one really knows how people spoke back then fully.

336
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,400
 He kind of clobbered together an idea

337
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,760
 of how to speak, and to be is to bear.

338
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,600
 - To bear?

339
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
 - To bear or not to bear.

340
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
 - Okay.

341
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,920
 - That was a classmate.

342
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,720
 - It's quite Brian Butterfield there.

343
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,000
 (all laughing)

344
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
 - Oh, did you have any snacks when you were there?

345
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
 - This is relevant, I promise.

346
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,760
 - A beer.

347
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,600
 - You had a beer, okay.

348
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,240
 - A beer can't as a snack as more of a refreshment,

349
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,520
 isn't it, a beverage?

350
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,000
 - It's still something from the theatre.

351
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,920
 - But it was very of today.

352
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,560
 - Okay, so it wasn't, yeah, yeah, yeah.

353
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,400
 It wasn't brewed in there.

354
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,240
 - I have a beer.

355
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,360
 (all laughing)

356
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,920
 - To bear or not to bear?

357
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,720
 - Exit, pursued by a bear.

358
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,200
 (all laughing)

359
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,480
 - I just wondered, 'cause archaeologists have done lots

360
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,200
 of digging around under the sights of the old theatres,

361
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,880
 and they found out what the snacks would have been

362
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,160
 in Elizabethan times.

363
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
 - That's great.

364
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,280
 - Yeah.

365
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,120
 - Okay, so what, go on.

366
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,280
 - Well, they're slightly limited by what remains,

367
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,000
 as in what rots and what doesn't.

368
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,840
 - Of course.

369
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,560
 - But they have found thousands and thousands

370
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,640
 of oyster shells.

371
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,720
 That was a huge thing.

372
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,760
 And because oysters were not the food for the posh,

373
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,360
 they were just a sort of standard snack.

374
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,840
 Just get a few oysters when you went to the theatre.

375
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,680
 So that was a big thing.

376
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,880
 - Yeah, that's very cool.

377
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
 - Just go back to the accent thing.

378
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,680
 There was, because it was such an amalgamation

379
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,400
 of different accents that were in London,

380
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,160
 and they hadn't really sort of formed a London accent yet,

381
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,400
 I guess, at that time.

382
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,680
 It was such a hodge podge of different accents,

383
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,000
 like a sort of Irish, British, West Country,

384
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,960
 Lancashire, Geordie sort of thing.

385
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,200
 And I could give it a bit of a go.

386
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 - Yeah, do it.

387
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

388
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,440
 - Nobody can tell me I got it wrong,

389
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,520
 because no one remembers it.

390
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,280
 Something like, "Two our souls, both alike in dignity,

391
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,200
 "in failure of a rona, will we lay our sin,

392
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,520
 "from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

393
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,000
 "where civil blood lay civil hens unclean."

394
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
 Something like that.

395
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,680
 - Wow.

396
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,520
 - So that's great.

397
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
 - That's great.

398
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
 I did just get hit in the head before I said that.

399
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,040
 (all laughing)

400
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,240
 - Could you do the rest of the show?

401
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,080
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

402
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,960
 (all laughing)

403
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,120
 - There's a lot of, if you go to the globe,

404
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
 there's a lot of things on the floor,

405
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
 which are the names of patrons,

406
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,320
 basically help to fund the new globe and so on.

407
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,240
 And so there's lots of very famous names on there.

408
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,960
 And two in particular, which are exciting to see it,

409
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,360
 John Cleese and Michael Palin, which is very cool.

410
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,200
 - Mm-hmm.

411
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,040
 - Yeah.

412
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,880
 - Michael who?

413
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,240
 - Michael Palin.

414
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,960
 (all laughing)

415
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,120
 No, Michael Palin.

416
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,960
 - I'll stop it.

417
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,240
 - Because according to the story,

418
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,840
 John Cleese only agreed to donate to the theater

419
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
 on the condition that Michael Palin's name was misspelled.

420
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,080
 - And so on the floor, you can see it.

421
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,960
 It's P-A-L-L-I-N.

422
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
 - Wow.

423
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,640
 - Yeah.

424
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,600
 - What would you have done if we just politely

425
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
 glossed over it?

426
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,520
 I was so nearly dead.

427
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,200
 - I would hold it on, go, come on, guys.

428
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,720
 Someone, someone call me of this.

429
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
 It's a problem when you pronounce everything wrong.

430
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,560
 - The thing is that Dan's such a big fan of Michael Palin.

431
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,520
 I was thinking maybe that's how it's pronounced.

432
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360
 - But yeah, so the globe says that this is the story.

434
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,440
 When you go on the tour guides, they say this is the story.

435
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,520
 There's no solid, you know, John Cleese needs to say it out loud.

436
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,760
 - Okay, but it is misspelled.

437
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,600
 - Yeah, it's misspelled.

438
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,440
 Yeah.

439
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,280
 We need to move on in a sec.

440
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,800
 Does anyone have anything before we do?

441
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,680
 - I've got some stuff on Rich the Third, but that's--

442
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,000
 - Yeah, do it.

443
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,720
 - So a lot of archeologists found that the old theater

444
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,360
 buried underneath a car park not so far away.

445
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,960
 And as was Rich the Third found under in a car park.

446
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,640
 And obviously was one of Shakespeare's

447
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,120
 big villain protagonists.

448
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,560
 And Dr. Joe Appleby at the University of Leicester

449
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,080
 looked at the bones and saw that Rich the Third

450
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,200
 got fucked up when he got killed.

451
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
 - Oh, right.

452
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
 - That he was, they see from his bones.

453
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,080
 He had a glancing blow to his cheek.

454
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,880
 He had a wound from probably a halberd,

455
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,080
 which is like big stick pike with a sort of axe thing.

456
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,920
 It was potentially the fatal blow.

457
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,920
 The back of his head, a sort of chunk was missing there.

458
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,000
 And then they think that they didn't want to do too much more

459
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,080
 to the face because Henry the Seventh

460
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,400
 needed to parade this dead body around to be like,

461
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,040
 "Look, this is definitely him."

462
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,600
 - This is him, not just some pulp.

463
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,040
 - Yeah, and they saw what they thought

464
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,720
 would be some post-mortem injuries to his rib

465
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,360
 and to his spine as well.

466
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,240
 And then one up his bum, they reckon.

467
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,160
 There's a sort of a mark like this one.

468
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,240
 - Was that after he died?

469
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,080
 - Well, this is it.

470
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,920
 - This is it, this feels like a month.

471
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,760
 - That's the question.

472
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,280
 (laughing)

473
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,600
 - That's a different play, Dan.

474
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,840
 (laughing)

475
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,920
 He's my kingdom for a horse.

476
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,080
 My kingdom for a horse with a very soft saddle.

477
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,440
 - Yeah.

478
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680
 - Wow, that's amazing.

479
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,720
 - Yeah, poor old Blake.

480
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,880
 - That was in battle, wasn't it?

481
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,720
 That he was killed?

482
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,160
 - That was in battle, battle of Bosworth.

483
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,000
 - Yeah.

484
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
 - Who was the last king killed in a battle?

485
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,320
 - Was he?

486
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,880
 - I don't think anyone since then has been.

487
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,720
 - Cowards.

488
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,040
 - Yeah.

489
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,080
 - Come on, Charles.

490
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,920
 - Come on.

491
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,500
 (upbeat music)

492
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

493
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,200
 and that is Andy.

494
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,640
 - My fact is that when residents of Greater Manchester

495
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,600
 were recently asked,

496
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,800
 they identified four distinctive accents in the region.

497
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,840
 Mank, Lancashire, Wigan, and Posh.

498
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,600
 (laughing)

499
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,440
 - Brilliant.

500
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,320
 - Yeah, it's like a good version of the Spice Girls.

501
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,160
 (laughing)

502
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,120
 - Wigan, Spice.

503
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

504
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,160
 - Mank, Spice.

505
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,560
 - Wigan, Spice is eating a pie all the time.

506
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
 - James, do you, when you see that there's these four,

507
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,000
 does that make sense to you?

508
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

509
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,960
 I would say my accent began as Lancashire

510
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,800
 with a bit of Wigan,

511
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,440
 'cause I went to primary school in Wigan,

512
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,000
 and now it's Posh probably.

513
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,840
 - Right.

514
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,120
 - Like, I've lost a lot of my accents

515
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,960
 since I moved to London,

516
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,400
 so I think people in Greater Manchester

517
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,840
 would say I was in the Posh bit.

518
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,680
 - You do, I notice when either you're around family

519
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,080
 or people from the North,

520
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,840
 you do slightly slip back into it.

521
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,760
 It's like the wording, like, Tintinet.

522
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
 I don't want, like, you know, have that sort of word.

523
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,440
 - That's my New York true.

525
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,520
 But you miss out, like, certain words sometimes.

526
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,000
 - Oh, I did, I did it on purpose.

527
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I did it when Phil came in,

528
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,160
 and then he opened his mouth,

529
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,040
 and I'm like, "Oh yeah, you're not Jamie Tartt."

530
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,880
 (laughing)

531
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,720
 - Always disappointment.

532
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,640
 - What's Tartt's accent?

533
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,000
 Is that from--

534
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,640
 - It's, well, it's sort of new,

535
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,560
 most in sort of the way.

536
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,840
 - 'Cause the people who did this research,

537
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,080
 one of them was called Dr. Rob Drummond.

538
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,560
 He listens to fish.

539
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,840
 It turns out, and I emailed him

540
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,880
 and sent him an example of your accent

541
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,280
 and asked him if he could place it.

542
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,120
 - Oh my God, oh my God.

543
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,680
 - So this is an academic.

544
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,560
 And he said, "No, it's shit."

545
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,400
 No, he didn't.

546
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,920
 (laughing)

547
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,000
 He was like, "No, it's really, really good."

548
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,280
 And he says you do a great Manchester accent,

549
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,080
 and it's all about the letter vowel and the happy vowel.

550
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,120
 And apparently, when you say let her,

551
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,000
 as I would say it,

552
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
 if you're in Manchester, you say let or,

553
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,640
 which Jamie Tartt does.

554
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,240
 And happy, as I might say it, in Manchester,

555
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,840
 they say happy.

556
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,640
 But anyway, he could take your accent,

557
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,080
 and he reckoned he could pinpoint

558
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
 it's a pretty much central,

559
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,720
 or just north of central Manchester.

560
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,560
 - Wow.

561
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,000
 - From Seoul, kind of, Smedley, that kind of area.

562
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
 - Wow.

563
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,160
 - That's so cool.

564
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
 - An academic.

565
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,840
 - That's a good report card.

566
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,280
 - Three years later, that's the relief.

567
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,200
 - It depends what series you watch,

568
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,480
 'cause I think the first series, I was like,

569
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,200
 "I don't really, I don't know if I'm doing this right."

570
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,840
 But it was an American show, so I was like,

571
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,800
 "No, they won't care."

572
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,120
 - We should name the project, shouldn't we?

573
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,680
 It was called Manchester Voices,

574
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,760
 and it was a three-year research project

575
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
 at Manchester Metropolitan University.

576
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,560
 - Yeah, Dr. Rob Drummond, who checked out Phil's accent,

577
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,400
 he is a listener, he listens to fish all the time

578
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,480
 with his daughter, Cassia,

579
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,160
 and he has a new book coming out called You Are All Talk.

580
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,000
 It's not out yet, but if you wanna pre-order that,

581
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,840
 you can.

582
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,680
 - Ooh, they had a really cool thing.

583
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,920
 They had an accent van, which drove around,

584
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,480
 and they bundled people into the accent van

585
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,640
 and recorded how they spoke.

586
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,480
 Bundled.

587
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
 - Yeah, they wrote it, there was consent.

588
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
 (laughing)

589
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,840
 - They had hoods, they had cuffs, they...

590
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
 (laughing)

591
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,360
 - That's so funny.

592
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,040
 - And so the specific questions that they asked

593
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,520
 were things like, "Oh, I'm curious,

594
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,600
 'cause you're from Bolton, James.

595
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,200
 So, if they said, "I've never heard you say,

596
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
 "instead of bottle, Bockel."

597
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,720
 - Bockel, yeah.

598
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,560
 - Yeah.

599
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,400
 - Or Lickle, instead of Bockel.

600
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,920
 - Lickle, yeah, that is a Bolton thing,

601
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,120
 but I don't really speak like that now.

602
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,560
 - School with two syllables.

603
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,400
 - Skewel.

604
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,240
 - Skewel.

605
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,960
 - That's more of a Wigan thing, you would say skewel.

606
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,800
 - Okay.

607
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,080
 - So, the word Bocke, as I would say it,

608
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,640
 10% of Boltoners say Bucke, instead of Bucke.

609
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,000
 And 71% of Wiganers say that.

610
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,840
 - Wow.

611
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,240
 - So that's how you can tell the difference.

612
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,040
 And 30% of Boltoners say buzz instead of bus.

613
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,400
 And I actually do say buzz instead of bus.

614
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,520
 - Did you, just with all those words, James was saying,

615
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,080
 when you were doing your accent,

616
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,880
 is it something that you studied?

617
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,800
 Or is it one of those things that once you start speaking

618
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,360
 in an accent, you almost naturally find

619
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,320
 the way that they would pronounce it anyway?

620
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,680
 - I guess studied, watched documentaries and whatnot.

621
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,520
 - Yeah, okay.

622
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,040
 - My agent, who I love very dearly, is a Mancunian.

623
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,920
 And she's very sassy.

624
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,480
 And there was a lot of sass in Jamie Tartt.

625
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,180
 So I was like, that's quite a good sort of start point.

626
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,840
 And I think generally I sort of am okay with picking that up,

627
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
 but there's a rapper called H.

628
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
 And it's funny that the difference--

629
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,600
 - From steps, yeah, I know.

630
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

631
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,240
 No, he's much cooler.

632
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,640
 - H from steps is coming on next week.

633
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
 - Yeah.

634
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,320
 (laughs)

635
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,400
 - You're not careful.

636
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,580
 - But H is really like proper Mank, isn't he?

637
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,720
 - Yeah, he's the rapper.

638
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,560
 - Yeah, he's the rapper.

639
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
 And I think that one of the things was

641
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,320
 when we were auditioning for it,

642
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,760
 they didn't necessarily want a Mancunian.

643
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,520
 They just wanted someone who didn't sound like me.

644
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,960
 They just wanted Italian or Spanish or whatever.

645
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,240
 And I think that it just felt right for him,

646
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,720
 that sort of sense of like,

647
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
 it'd come from a place that was,

648
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,560
 that you had to sort of graft to get out of.

649
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,360
 And that's why I say season one, season three,

650
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,600
 I'm being totally honest.

651
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,480
 It started off as one of the Gallagher brothers.

652
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,320
 - Right.

653
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,520
 - And it sort of slowly stepped towards

654
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,840
 sort of Jesse Lingard,

655
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,920
 come sort of a far more sort of contemporary version of that.

656
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,680
 It would be like, all right, how you doing?

657
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,520
 You all right, mate?

658
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,360
 How's it going?

659
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,200
 Yeah, I'll tell you a little bit about it.

660
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,560
 But it's like, do you know what I mean?

661
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,120
 Yeah, it's a lot more like sort of contemporary.

662
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
 And it feels a lot more like,

663
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,800
 he's just got, I feel like he's rapping all the time.

664
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,640
 Do you know what I mean?

665
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,480
 - Right, right.

666
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,040
 - So yeah, and just, yeah.

667
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,120
 So anyway, it sort of, it's shifted from

668
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,320
 that sort of nineties version of it.

669
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,880
 - I've read quite a few things about actors who,

670
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,000
 so Austin Butler, who just played Elvis in the biopic,

671
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,480
 the Baz Luhrmann biopic.

672
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,320
 There's videos of him prior to doing the role

673
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,960
 to how he speaks now.

674
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,920
 And he's been unable to shift the Elvis voice,

675
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
 the Elvis role.

676
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
 So when he received his award

677
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,640
 at either the Emmys of the Golden Globe,

678
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
 he was, well, thank you everybody for this incredible award.

679
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
 He can't get rid of it.

680
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,160
 And he actively talks about it

681
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
 'cause he's questioned about it.

682
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,320
 They're like, you don't talk like this.

683
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,040
 And he's like, oh no, I can't get rid of it.

684
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,240
 - And so he's trying to lose the Elvis accent.

685
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
 - That's so random.

686
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,280
 - Yeah, well, no, it happens with quite a lot of actors.

687
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,360
 That's how I was going to say it.

688
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,560
 Did you ever have anything where at home,

689
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,440
 suddenly you found yourself not being able to shift

690
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
 the accent and was it not long enough a gig to each time?

691
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,120
 - Oh, I think there was probably a couple of words

692
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,360
 I just enjoyed saying, like "pooper."

693
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,880
 I just really enjoyed it.

694
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,120
 He wrote a pooper.

695
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,240
 It just feels right.

696
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,440
 A lot of the air words at the end was just quite fun.

697
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,160
 But you can track what film Tom Hardy was doing

698
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,720
 by interviews at the time.

699
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,440
 'Cause I mean, he's got a real sort of chameleon accent thing.

700
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,480
 - Remember Steve McLaren when he went to work

701
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,920
 in the Netherlands?

702
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,840
 And he just started talking with the Dutch accent.

703
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,600
 - He was only there for like two.

704
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,040
 - So he was a former England football manager.

705
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,160
 And he became manager of, I can't remember who it was,

706
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,000
 Ajax or something.

707
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,320
 There he was in Ajax, but a Dutch team.

708
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,720
 And then he would do interviews in England.

709
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,240
 And he'd just have this really strong Dutch accent.

710
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,680
 - And he'd been there for like only a few months.

711
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,120
 And he was like trying to ingratiate himself

712
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,960
 for the coaches.

713
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,680
 - I think it's subconscious though, isn't it,

714
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,000
 when people do that?

715
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,560
 'Cause you're talking to people who,

716
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,400
 let's say you go to America or Australia or somewhere,

717
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,920
 you naturally will,

718
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,440
 what all some people do and some people don't.

719
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,760
 It's a really interesting thing.

720
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,080
 - Well, you do naturally,

721
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,200
 you imitate someone's accent, don't you?

722
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
 Because it makes them like you better.

723
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,520
 That's the idea.

724
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,440
 But also they've decided that this is a good idea.

725
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
 And they've got this AI software

726
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,200
 where if you phone up, you know,

727
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,560
 of what do you call it?

728
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
 Like a chat, not chat line.

729
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,000
 - Call centre.

730
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,840
 - Call centre.

731
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,800
 (laughing)

732
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 - Yep, hang on a minute.

733
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,840
 Yeah, yeah, one of those call centres, yeah.

734
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,480
 - My back card isn't working.

735
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,720
 (laughing)

736
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,440
 If you phone up a call centre.

737
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,120
 And yeah, they've worked out this AI

738
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,760
 which can hear your accent and then imitate your accent.

739
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,000
 And so they come back in a slightly similar way to you talk.

740
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,240
 And it means you trust them more.

741
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,080
 - It's so weird.

742
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,680
 And it's mostly, basically,

743
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,120
 because of where call centres are around the world,

744
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,280
 it's mostly to make people in places like the Philippines

745
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,400
 sound like they're from Boston or whatever.

746
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,800
 And so, but this is the plot of a film.

747
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,920
 It's a film called Sorry to Bother You.

748
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
 And it's about a young black guy

749
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,120
 who gets a job in a call centre.

750
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,960
 - Oh yeah.

751
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,720
 - And then someone tells him,

752
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,840
 like an older guy in the centre says,

753
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,440
 use your white voice.

754
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,720
 And he starts getting lots and lots of business

755
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,680
 because he's sounding preppy and whiter.

756
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,760
 And so they've literally turned this.

757
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,880
 It is a horror film.

758
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,040
 - Yeah, they turn it into a technology, it's so weird.

759
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,360
 - James, what is this little Bolton quiz?

760
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,200
 - Oh, I don't know why.

761
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,040
 - Oh, no.

762
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

763
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,720
 - Give it to us, give it to us.

764
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,560
 - Give it to us, yeah.

765
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,480
 - Pee wet, down.

766
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,640
 - Oh, I know what that is.

767
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
 I read it.

768
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,440
 - Pee wet.

769
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,080
 - You read it, so you're out of attention here.

770
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,920
 I'm afraid.

771
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,760
 - Pee wet.

772
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,600
 - Two words.

773
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,760
 - Pee wet is a type of bird.

774
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,600
 - Absolutely.

775
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,440
 Is that helpful?

776
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,280
 Maybe not.

777
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,120
 - Could be.

778
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,440
 - Could be.

779
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,120
 - 'Cause it goes pee wet, pee wet.

780
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,600
 - Would James be trying to help you in this quiz?

781
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,440
 Maybe.

782
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,280
 - Yeah, is he a friend?

783
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,120
 - Maybe not.

784
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,520
 - I don't think he's a director.

785
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,360
 - Pee wet.

786
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,040
 - Pee wet, you've wet yourself with pee?

787
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,680
 (laughing)

788
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,720
 - I didn't even think of that, yeah.

789
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,520
 - Yeah, good if you ever come to Bolton.

790
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,360
 - Yeah.

791
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,200
 - That's what you have to say.

792
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,520
 I go to a chip shop and they say,

793
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
 "Do you want pee wet?"

794
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,880
 I go, "No, of course not."

795
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,440
 - I don't mind if I do.

796
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,680
 - I don't need your help for it.

797
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,520
 Thank you very much.

798
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,640
 (laughing)

799
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,480
 - James was helping you.

800
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,320
 That pee wet is the mushy pee water.

801
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,640
 - Yeah, so you can get them to put,

802
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
 if you have chips with pee wet,

803
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,760
 then you don't have to pay for the pee wet.

804
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,920
 - They'll get the chips and they'll just pour

805
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,720
 a bit of the wet, a bit of the mushy pee.

806
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,560
 - Oh, it looks good.

807
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,240
 - The water runoff from the mushy pee.

808
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,080
 - Yeah.

809
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,920
 - Wow.

810
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,760
 - I'm sorry.

811
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,600
 - No, you didn't.

812
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,960
 - Great, that's not what I thought.

813
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,080
 I thought it was just mushy pees,

814
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,440
 but that's a step towards insanity.

815
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,280
 - Why do you want that?

816
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,120
 Like, you'd have wet chips.

817
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,960
 - It's delicious.

818
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,800
 - So you'd have wet chips.

819
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
 - Chips are too dry.

820
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,600
 - So kind of like a vinegar.

821
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,440
 - Put vinegar on, don't you?

822
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,280
 - Yeah.

823
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,120
 - Wow.

824
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,960
 - It's very exciting.

825
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,800
 - Shakespeare in English, isn't it?

826
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,640
 - Yeah, it is.

827
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,680
 - I want to try another one of them.

828
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,280
 Cracking the flags.

829
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,240
 - Bought to flags.

830
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,080
 - Cracking flags.

831
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,400
 - Cracking flags.

832
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,760
 (laughing)

833
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,320
 - Is it rude?

834
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,800
 She's got a pair of cracking flags.

835
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,160
 (laughing)

836
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,000
 - No, I don't know.

837
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,840
 - Do you know what it is, Phil?

838
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,000
 - I don't know what this is, no.

839
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 - Really?

840
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,680
 What if I tell you that the flags

841
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,880
 relate to flagstones as in like pavement?

842
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,720
 - Okay.

843
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,840
 - Cracking the flags.

844
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,480
 - It's like walking as a pedestrian.

845
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,320
 - Cobbled streets.

846
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,120
 - This is so funny because these are words

847
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,360
 that I thought everyone knew.

848
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,800
 - And I'd never heard this until.

849
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,280
 That's the only reason I mentioned it, yeah.

850
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,880
 - It means it's really hot.

851
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,720
 It's cracking flags out there.

852
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,880
 It's so hot that the pavement's breaking.

853
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,520
 - Yeah, yeah, nice.

854
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,360
 Wow.

855
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
 - God, I'm really failing as my pretend Mancunian here.

856
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,120
 (laughing)

857
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,040
 But the Mancunian accent was,

858
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,560
 sorry, just to close this again.

859
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,720
 The Mancunian accent was voted,

860
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,440
 and I found this in the Daily Mail

861
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,200
 and the research was provided by Best Casinos.

862
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,720
 (laughing)

863
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,920
 - So it's flawless, yeah, come on, on my go.

864
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,000
 - I know that you love your watertight fact checking here.

865
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,360
 After they asked 2,500 people,

866
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,200
 they found that the Manchester accent

867
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,160
 was the sexiest accent in the world.

868
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,000
 - That's interesting.

869
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
 - And that's from Best Casinos.

870
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,880
 - Is that recent?

871
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,920
 - Yeah, yeah, I think it was last year, I think.

872
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,760
 - That's interesting.

873
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
 'Cause like, I reckon that change,

874
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,080
 you see those things quite often, don't you?

875
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,280
 And they say, oh, the Irish accent's most sexy.

876
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,040
 Or the Yorkshire is, never the Birmingham weirdly,

877
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,480
 but they do say that.

878
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,720
 And I wonder if it's like fashion,

879
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,400
 like they've seen people like yourself

880
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,760
 doing the Manc accent on TV,

881
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,680
 and they associate it with--

882
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,400
 - Did the Gallagas have an effect?

883
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,240
 - I think they did, yeah.

884
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,400
 - On the sexiness of the Mancunian.

885
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
 - That's what I'm thinking.

886
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,240
 - Yeah, 'cause I read a thing that in America,

887
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,480
 there was once a vote on what was the most sexy accent

888
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,440
 from the UK.

889
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,280
 - Oh, the UK, okay.

890
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,600
 - Yeah, and Glasgow won it, right?

891
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,240
 And I wonder, because Billy Conley is so big in America,

892
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,520
 whether or not there was just something kind of like,

893
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,560
 I know he's not seen as like a sex symbol,

894
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,360
 but he's seen as really charismatic,

895
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,760
 really funny, everything that's like likable.

896
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
 - Silky guy. - Yeah.

897
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,520
 - Or whether the person doing the research

898
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
 was Glaswegian and they felt intimidated.

899
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,440
 - Yeah.

900
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,720
 (all laughing)

901
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,080
 I get, one of my favorite things

902
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,120
 about doing this show is, I quite often,

903
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,880
 I haven't actually had it in the last sort of 12 months,

904
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,320
 but I used to get a bunch of linguists

905
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
 who would write to me saying,

906
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,760
 I take samples of your accent and my accent,

907
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,080
 and I play it to other people who are linguists,

908
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
 and the challenges work out where he's from.

909
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
 And every time they say, no one can work out,

910
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,520
 they say like, Canada or like New Zealand Australia,

911
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,960
 like they get elements of it,

912
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
 but no one needs to collect on tour.

913
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,000
 - And we sort of do like signings afterwards,

914
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,560
 and people sometimes come up and say,

915
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
 where are you from, to Dan?

916
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,960
 And then you'd ask them to guess,

917
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,320
 and I used to keep a list on my phone

918
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,720
 of everywhere people had guessed.

919
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,560
 - Did you?

920
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
 And it was, I mean, the whole world.

922
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,480
 - 'Cause I think you just have an international accent,

923
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,320
 like from, as if you went to international school,

924
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,480
 like my wife's got similar.

925
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,320
 - Yeah, exactly.

926
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,200
 - Kind of slightly North American weird accent.

927
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
 - Yeah, but I guess if then that becomes the challenge

928
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,200
 for the linguists, what are the influences on this accent?

929
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
 - We were saying before that when people

930
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,840
 who are from a certain place go back to that place

931
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,600
 or speak to other people from that place,

932
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,680
 they start, that accent starts to come out a bit more.

933
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,200
 Do you have that with one of your?

934
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,080
 - If I go to Australia, I definitely lean into Aussie a bit.

935
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,400
 I should have a British accent by now,

936
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,160
 'cause I've been here long enough, but I don't.

937
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,440
 And the Hong Kong accent was very American,

938
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,920
 where I grew up.

939
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,680
 - But where do you go to sound more like you are now?

940
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,080
 Not just more Aussie, you know?

941
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,400
 'Cause you don't really sound very Aussie.

942
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,240
 - No.

943
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,640
 - When you travel internationally.

944
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,440
 It's actually only in departure lounges.

945
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,280
 (laughing)

946
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,960
 But Dan sounds most like himself.

947
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,800
 - Yeah.

948
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,560
 - Whenever you're buying a Toblerone, it's like,

949
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,400
 "Ah, yeah, I don't know."

950
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,980
 (upbeat music)

951
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,120
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

952
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,320
 and that's my fact.

953
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,680
 My fact this week is that of the few people

954
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,520
 who have top secret clearance at the White House,

955
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,160
 one of them is the person

956
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,640
 who writes all of the party invitations.

957
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,560
 (laughing)

958
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,400
 - Amazing.

959
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,520
 - Such a good plot for something, isn't it?

960
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,360
 - It is, isn't it?

961
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,600
 - You know, the calligrapher.

962
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,840
 - And it's the president's party invitation writer.

963
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,080
 - It's missing.

964
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,920
 - Yes.

965
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,120
 - 'Cause you'll know, as the invitation writer,

966
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,680
 who's coming to the summits, who's, you know.

967
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,000
 - Yeah, it's everyone's address.

968
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,440
 He's got Brezhnev's address.

969
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,280
 He's got--

970
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,680
 - Brezhnev, yeah.

971
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,400
 - Do you think of a key global player?

972
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,320
 (laughing)

973
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,240
 Brezhnev, when did Brezhnev stop running the Soviet Union?

974
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,000
 (laughing)

975
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,600
 - I was thinking of mine as a Cold War thriller.

976
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,320
 (laughing)

977
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,400
 - Imagine how beautiful his ransom letters would be.

978
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
 - Oh.

979
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,080
 - From the calligrapher.

980
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,000
 That would be perfect.

981
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,080
 So this is a thing where this kind of came up in the news

982
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
 when it was during Trump's administration

983
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,320
 that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law,

984
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,520
 had been downgraded from top secret clearance

985
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
 because they sort of just tried

986
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
 to stop making everyone have it.

987
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,240
 And people noted that--

988
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,560
 - 'Cause he had too many links to the Saudis, but yeah, sure.

989
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,400
 - Yeah, yeah, so--

990
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,520
 (laughing)

991
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
 - It's nice not recording on the BBC, is it?

992
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,200
 (laughing)

993
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,320
 - So it got downgraded and someone was pointing out

994
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,880
 that actually he's now got less clearance

995
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,280
 than the calligrapher has on the in-house.

996
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,640
 And the reason the calligrapher has it

997
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
 is because they have to know everything

998
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,720
 about the president's appointments,

999
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,480
 what's coming up, who they have to,

1000
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,120
 and they're near dignitaries all the time.

1001
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,160
 And so they need to be on top of everything

1002
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
 that they need to write

1003
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,920
 because they write so many invitations.

1004
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
 They have a unit, it's a calligraphy unit.

1005
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,880
 There's a whole office that does this.

1006
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,080
 It's not many people, there's only like three or four people.

1007
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,720
 But-- - That's still a lot.

1008
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,560
 - It's a lot.

1009
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,400
 In fact, one of them said that in one December period alone,

1010
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,480
 they believed that they did 19,000 envelopes.

1011
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,320
 - Brilliant.

1012
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,160
 - And those are handwritten.

1013
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,000
 - So yeah, so, and they're paid very, very handsomely.

1014
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,240
 And they've been going for a very long time.

1015
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,640
 Like they're like long-term posts that they can run for.

1016
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,440
 - But they did ask one of the,

1017
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,240
 I think he was by this point the former calligrapher

1018
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
 when the story broke.

1019
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,680
 And Rick Paulus, who had run the office,

1020
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,320
 he said that it was just 'cause of the schedule

1021
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,560
 and the proximity to world leaders.

1022
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,400
 He said he never, ever dealt with intelligence matters,

1023
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,640
 which you would hope he would not.

1024
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,800
 (laughing)

1025
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,640
 As in something's gone wrong if he has to solve a crisis.

1026
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,400
 - I wonder who's the best RSV peer.

1027
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,720
 - Oh, like the timeliest.

1028
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

1029
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,920
 - Of all the world leaders.

1030
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,760
 - Yes.

1031
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,600
 - That's interesting.

1032
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,160
 - I feel like Trudeau's waiting by the post office door.

1033
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

1034
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,840
 - He'll reply nice and soon.

1035
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,920
 They did a thing like this with the Royal Wedding.

1036
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,600
 There was a, I can't remember which Royal Wedding it was,

1037
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,080
 whether it was William Cate or Harry and Meghan,

1038
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,920
 but they ran a thing of, so-and-so's replied very quickly.

1039
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,760
 - Oh, really?

1040
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,600
 Really?

1041
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,440
 - Yeah.

1042
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,160
 - Do you remember the fact that Meghan Markle,

1043
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,160
 her former job when she was an actor as a side job,

1044
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,800
 she was a calligrapher for invitations.

1045
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,640
 So that's what she did.

1046
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,360
 - She did Robin Thickey.

1047
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,240
 - Of blurred lines, Robin Thickey.

1048
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,080
 - Yes.

1049
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,240
 - Yeah, a blurred lines wave.

1050
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,680
 He did, his wedding, the invites were written by Meghan Markle.

1051
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,800
 - You know Robin Thicke?

1052
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
 - Yeah.

1053
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,480
 - Who's that?

1054
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,240
 - The blurred lines guy.

1055
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,360
 Do you know, his dad was really famous.

1056
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,840
 He wrote the theme tune to Different Strokes, the TV show.

1057
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,880
 - Ooh, is that also a problematic song?

1058
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,640
 (laughing)

1059
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,480
 - Sounds it.

1060
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,040
 - It's not like a sexy song, it's like a show.

1061
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,240
 - Sure, it means something very different.

1062
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,680
 - Wow, that's the best, I mean, no offense by this James.

1063
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,440
 Trippy effect, I've ever heard.

1064
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,680
 (laughing)

1065
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,000
 Like that's good, that's good.

1066
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,800
 - It's just something that happens to know, that's all.

1067
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,640
 - That's fabulous.

1068
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,480
 - Rick Polis, by the way.

1069
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,320
 So this guy was the head of calligraphy.

1070
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,400
 Have you seen his website?

1071
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,000
 rickpoliskalligraphy.com, wonderful.

1072
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,280
 He's quite annoyed because the kind of digital age

1073
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,800
 where computers started recording all the examples

1074
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,560
 of all the invites that they write over the years

1075
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,720
 and now being archived, he kind of just missed that.

1076
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,200
 So a lot of his work isn't online for you to see.

1077
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,560
 So he presents on his website, my favorite invites

1078
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,120
 and my favorite bits of calligraphy

1079
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,160
 that I did for the White House.

1080
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,240
 Yeah, so you can see menu for the president of Ireland.

1081
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,200
 - That's a cool one, isn't it?

1082
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,320
 - He did a load of convoluted Celtic style design.

1083
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,160
 - Oh, that's great.

1084
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,760
 All of those meals the president pays for, doesn't he?

1085
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
 - Yeah, is that weird?

1086
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,440
 - Yeah, is that right?

1087
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,320
 'Cause it's, we, when I went to the White House.

1088
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,160
 - Clang?

1089
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,000
 - Yeah, kind of.

1090
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 (all laughing)

1091
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,960
 Guys, are we talking about the White House?

1092
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,080
 - When did you go?

1093
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,040
 - I went, at the start of this year,

1094
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,520
 the cast of Ted Lasso were inexplicably invited

1095
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,200
 for an audience with the president and the first lady.

1096
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,040
 Insane, yeah.

1097
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,600
 Six of the cast members sort of spoke to the president

1098
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,360
 and the first lady about mental health

1099
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,600
 and the effect that the show has

1100
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,120
 and sort of impact that is needed over there.

1101
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,960
 But we also, you know, we were having a tour

1102
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,200
 and we sort of had, you know, learned some things

1103
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,600
 about a little thing or two about the White House.

1104
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
 And one is that the president,

1105
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,840
 because a lot of it is state funded

1106
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,680
 or sort of funded by taxpayers,

1107
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,840
 they can't be seen to be handing out big banquets

1108
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
 for everybody that comes.

1109
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,720
 It is just, like he says, gaff, isn't it?

1110
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,560
 - Yeah, exactly.

1111
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,080
 - And you know, hopefully one day we'll be able to say,

1112
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,720
 huh, gaff, guys, all right, we're all right, guys.

1113
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,560
 - 2020, '23, did you get an invite and we'll fill them?

1114
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,440
 - Are you just like a handwritten one?

1115
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,280
 - No, I did not.

1116
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,520
 We got an email and obviously we all thought it was fake

1117
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,360
 that we'd be invited to the White House.

1118
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,960
 I wonder if the same guy types the emails on.

1119
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,280
 - He types them incredibly.

1120
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,560
 He has a little wand he uses to tap each letter.

1121
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,760
 It's very gay, yeah.

1122
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,160
 - Did you have lunch with Biden or did you just say hi?

1123
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,000
 'Cause I saw a photo.

1124
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,480
 You were in the Oval Office, right?

1125
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,440
 - We were, we took her to the Oval Office, yeah.

1126
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
 - Oh my God.

1127
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,120
 - Which is wild.

1128
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,560
 It was the energy you walk in the room,

1129
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,840
 you're like, oh, some scandals sort of.

1130
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,680
 - Yeah, right.

1131
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,320
 - But no, we were kept in the map room where we ate,

1132
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,440
 which is where they planned the D-Day landings

1133
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,960
 in the map room, just to be sitting there eating as odd.

1134
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,680
 And you're there with like 25 Secret Service

1135
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,760
 or just sort of knocking them out.

1136
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,040
 Who were so cool, really nice.

1137
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,080
 And also like have, you know, you ask them any question

1138
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,280
 and you can see them go through the Rolodex of

1139
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,120
 what can I say, what can't I say.

1140
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,320
 The weird thing was, I don't know if you've had it,

1141
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,200
 when you call someone by a title,

1142
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,880
 it suddenly feels very strange

1143
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,120
 and these people that you've been knocking about

1144
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,840
 with the cast members I've been with,

1145
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,080
 hearing them call someone a title,

1146
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,000
 it feels very contrived the whole thing.

1147
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,200
 - Do you mean like Mr. President?

1148
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,040
 - Mr. President.

1149
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,360
 - Huh, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,600
 - And so you're just thinking about that the whole time

1151
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,200
 when you're meeting him.

1152
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,600
 - What's the term for the first lady?

1153
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,760
 - Dr. Biden, I think.

1154
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,080
 - Dr. Biden, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1155
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,560
 - And obviously the whole time you're thinking,

1156
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,200
 it's like in Taxi Driver, when you did an eros go,

1157
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,400
 you're talking to me, you're talking to me.

1158
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,200
 It was like, before I turned up, I was like,

1159
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,960
 Mr. President, Mr. President, hello Mr. President.

1160
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,040
 And of course, it's just, don't say Trump, don't say Trump,

1161
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,880
 don't say Trump.

1162
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,800
 (all laughing)

1163
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
 But it was funny when we were saying goodbye,

1164
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,360
 the guy who plays Isaac McAdoo, Colla Bikini,

1165
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,680
 I was stood next to him, he was shaking our hands,

1166
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,200
 the president was shaking our hand,

1167
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,240
 it's all going around the circle.

1168
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,200
 And it turns to Colla, he goes,

1169
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,080
 thank you for coming along, son.

1170
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,680
 And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1171
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,520
 - Cheers.

1172
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,240
 (all laughing)

1173
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,480
 He turns to me and he says,

1174
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,880
 I just said, cheers to the president.

1175
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,960
 (all laughing)

1176
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,000
 - That's so good.

1177
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,320
 - I don't know how often people call the president,

1178
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,480
 dad, by Mr. President.

1179
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,920
 - You know, like calling the teacher, mum.

1180
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,080
 - Exactly. - Yeah, yeah.

1181
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,920
 - It must have happened to him on a sort of daily basis.

1182
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,320
 - It's such a shame you didn't have lunch with him

1183
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
 because I've heard great stories about his lunchtime.

1184
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,840
 Well, when he sits with Kamala Harris

1185
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
 and they have their lunch,

1186
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,520
 he likes to eat with a slideshow going.

1187
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,720
 So they just eat their meal

1188
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,040
 while they're watching a slideshow

1189
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
 of all the recent adventures they've had,

1190
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,240
 just so that they can sort of remember and reflect on.

1191
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,480
 - What, just the photos of?

1192
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,800
 - Yeah, yeah, it's just a slideshow.

1193
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,120
 - That's nice, I think. - Yeah, I think, yeah.

1194
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,840
 - Is it a slideshow of his stuff or both of their?

1195
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,280
 - Both of them, I think, it's, yeah.

1196
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
 It's just like, oh, okay, here I am, shaking a hand.

1197
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,560
 Yeah, so that's Ted Lutter, okay?

1198
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
 He said, cheers.

1199
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,240
 (all laughing)

1200
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,080
 But can I tell you one last calligraphy thing?

1201
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,600
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1202
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,320
 - Did you hear of Rick Muffler?

1203
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
 - No.

1204
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,480
 - What a guy.

1205
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,880
 So Rick Muffler used to be a calligrapher,

1206
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,720
 maybe the chief one, and he was controversial

1207
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
 'cause he was the only left-handed calligrapher

1208
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,640
 in the office.

1209
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,240
 - Oh, that means you're gonna smudge

1210
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,320
 everyone else's calligraphy.

1211
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,400
 - Exactly, it was a nightmare.

1212
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
 But just, he's cool, particularly because

1213
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,360
 it's kind of a family thing for him.

1214
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,640
 So his grandfather was a chauffeur

1215
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,360
 for President Warren G. Harding.

1216
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,200
 And then his dad, John Muffler,

1217
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,240
 was an electrician who wound the clocks

1218
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,360
 in the whole White House.

1219
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,440
 He worked there for 50 years.

1220
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,280
 He arrived in the late Second World War,

1221
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,160
 and he was there for Bill Clinton.

1222
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,840
 That's all that time he was in the White House.

1223
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,480
 - And so Muffler's the third?

1224
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,320
 Is that who we're talking about?

1225
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
 - Rick Muffler was the third Muffler.

1226
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
 I don't know if there's a new Muffler.

1227
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,440
 - I'd like to dream, and I won't be here to see it,

1228
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,440
 but in like 500 years, there'll be a Muffler president.

1229
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,440
 And like they'll have muffled the way up to the top.

1230
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,600
 - That would be good, wouldn't it?

1231
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,440
 - That'd be great.

1232
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,120
 (laughing)

1233
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,000
 - There were some sort of heirs and graces

1234
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,440
 that the Trump family didn't really follow.

1235
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,280
 - Oh, really?

1236
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,440
 - There were traditions that the first lady,

1237
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,520
 when the president leaves office for the last time,

1238
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,600
 the first lady would sit for a portrait.

1239
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,920
 And Melania refused to do that,

1240
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,840
 or has certainly has yet to have sat for it.

1241
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,880
 And there's this corridor where all of these paintings

1242
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,080
 are put, and Michelle Obama is still placed

1243
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,120
 at the end of the corridor,

1244
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,000
 which is traditionally where the previous encumbered--

1245
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,320
 - That's so interesting.

1246
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,640
 - To be fair, I feel like both Donald and Melania

1247
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,720
 probably have a painting in the attic somewhere.

1248
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,960
 (laughing)

1249
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
 - Very good reference.

1250
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,800
 - Thank you.

1251
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,040
 (laughing)

1252
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,520
 - I was reading about top secret clearance,

1253
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,800
 just 'cause these calligraphy people

1254
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,640
 have top secret clearance.

1255
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,480
 - Oh, yeah.

1256
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,880
 - It's a very weird thing, top secret clearance,

1257
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,080
 because it appears to, like so many people have,

1258
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,920
 their numbers are mad.

1259
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,200
 Okay, so there's like secret confidential,

1260
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,520
 and then top secret, or something like that.

1261
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,360
 The top secret's the highest.

1262
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,880
 But top secret clearance, even back in 2015,

1263
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,320
 it was 1.3 million Americans.

1264
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,120
 - Yeah, that's like one in every 300 people in America.

1265
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,200
 - Well, yeah, and if you broaden it to confidential,

1266
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,360
 maybe that's the bottom rung.

1267
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,720
 It's about 1% of all Americans have secret status.

1268
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,120
 - None of the children will have it.

1269
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,440
 So that's even, you know--

1270
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,840
 - God, you're right.

1271
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,960
 It's really common.

1272
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,320
 If you're American listening to this

1273
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,920
 and you don't have top secret clearance,

1274
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,760
 that's a shame on you.

1275
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,120
 - Yeah, give you head of wobble.

1276
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,040
 - So when I said at the top of the few people

1277
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,680
 who have top secret clearance.

1278
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,040
 - But I wonder if it's slightly different

1279
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,240
 than White House top secret compared to,

1280
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,800
 this is like civil service top secret.

1281
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,640
 - Yeah, there are--

1282
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,560
 - And there's CIA and there's--

1283
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,200
 - There are different donations within top secret where,

1284
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,120
 like not everyone can look at the plans

1285
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
 of where we're gonna invade next, or whatever.

1286
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,960
 - Who's coming for dinner?

1287
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,400
 - Yeah.

1288
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,560
 - Biden's slideshow.

1289
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,240
 (all laughing)

1290
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,080
 - Yeah.

1291
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,920
 - It is strange.

1292
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,120
 - It became evident when, during the recent leaks,

1293
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,680
 during the Ukraine war,

1294
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,640
 that was one of the things that people were so surprised about

1295
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,800
 was that there's so many people had this clearance

1296
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,640
 that was, you know, very delicate.

1297
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
 - A 21 year old.

1298
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1299
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
 - Very peculiar.

1300
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,320
 - Yeah.

1301
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,040
 - I was reading about some other parties,

1302
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,480
 or some parties at the White House.

1303
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,320
 - Oh yeah.

1304
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,440
 - This is a party invitation guy.

1305
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,360
 - Yeah.

1306
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,480
 - I found there seems to be quite a common thing

1307
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,680
 of riots in inauguration parties

1308
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,280
 when people go to get their coats

1309
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,320
 at the end of the night.

1310
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,160
 - Yeah.

1311
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,480
 - This is really weird.

1312
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,960
 It happened in President Reagan's ball in 1985.

1313
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,120
 Like, everyone went to get their coats at the end,

1314
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,360
 and they got all mixed up.

1315
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,960
 Because the inauguration takes place in winter, right?

1316
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,000
 It takes place in January.

1317
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,440
 So everyone's got loads of coats,

1318
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,600
 and they're never prepared for it.

1319
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,320
 In 1989, President Bush had a ball

1320
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,520
 which got known as the Bastille Day Coat Check Riot.

1321
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,000
 Because people were yelling and screaming,

1322
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,760
 and some people never, to the day,

1323
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,360
 haven't got their coats back.

1324
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,200
 There was one coat check person for 3,000 coats.

1325
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,520
 (laughing)

1326
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,080
 - What a nightmare.

1327
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,400
 - And people, like, obviously,

1328
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,720
 these are all, like, really high-up people who think,

1329
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,200
 well, you know, I'm the most important person in this room.

1330
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,560
 I should get to the front and get my coat first.

1331
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,320
 And people are shouting, bushing, and all that kind of stuff.

1332
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,200
 But it even goes back to 1849

1333
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,520
 at Zachary Taylor's inauguration ball.

1334
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,040
 Abraham Lincoln lost his hat.

1335
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,800
 And for Ulysses S. Grant's inauguration,

1336
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,600
 all the workers who were working in the close place

1337
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,320
 were all illiterate, and no one got their coats, them, either.

1338
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,480
 So it just seems to be a thing.

1339
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
 - That'd be dangerous for Lincoln,

1340
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,720
 because Lincoln used to keep secret documents

1341
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,800
 in the top of his hat, didn't he?

1342
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,640
 - Yeah, exactly.

1343
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,480
 - Top hat secrets.

1344
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,320
 - Oh, good.

1345
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,920
 So just so weird.

1346
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,240
 - Shame that the beautiful calligraphy

1347
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,360
 would have been wasted on those people

1348
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,200
 that couldn't read.

1349
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,360
 (laughing)

1350
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,940
 (upbeat music)

1351
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,840
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1352
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,360
 and that is James.

1353
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,160
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1999,

1354
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,280
 The Times newspaper reported that Liverpool FC

1355
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,320
 were about to buy a footballer called Didier Baptiste.

1356
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,560
 The Times got the story

1357
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,240
 from Liverpool's premium line news service.

1358
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,960
 They got it from the news of the world.

1359
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,920
 They got it from a sports agency,

1360
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,280
 and they just found it on a random Arsenal fans website.

1361
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,640
 In actual fact, Baptiste was a fictional player

1362
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,680
 in a soap opera.

1363
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,240
 - What role did best casino play in there?

1364
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,480
 (laughing)

1365
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,200
 - Yeah, so this is an amazing thing that happened.

1366
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,720
 It was in the papers in '99.

1367
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
 Liverpool are gonna buy this guy Didier Baptiste,

1368
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,080
 but he was actually a character

1369
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,320
 from the show Dream Team on Skies.

1370
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,120
 - So funny.

1371
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,520
 - And yeah, just people hadn't checked it properly.

1372
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,200
 The Times said he was a promising left-back for Monaco

1373
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,480
 and a proud member of the French under 21 national side,

1374
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,680
 surely a steal for 3.5 million pounds.

1375
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,520
 - Amazing.

1376
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,360
 - Wow.

1377
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,240
 - The news of the world said we think Didier Baptiste

1378
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,520
 will be an ideal addition to Liverpool's back four.

1379
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,160
 He's a really attractive player.

1380
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,480
 You'll be seeing a lot more of him

1381
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,120
 in the news of the world from now on.

1382
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,960
 - Oh.

1383
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,800
 - Obviously.

1384
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,640
 (laughing)

1385
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
 - Yeah, it was just completely made up.

1386
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,480
 - Lying again.

1387
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,640
 - Is this like a transfer season rumours thing?

1388
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,760
 'Cause lots of football stories seem to be about, you know.

1389
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,720
 - Yeah, of course.

1390
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,240
 Like clubs gonna buy a new player.

1391
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,400
 You often have never heard of them,

1392
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,560
 especially if they're coming from a different country.

1393
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,000
 And if he's an under 21 player, he's quite young.

1394
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,240
 It wouldn't be that surprising

1395
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,400
 that you might not have heard of them,

1396
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
 but you possibly would expect

1397
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,200
 that newspapers would do a bit more research.

1398
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,440
 - I mean, you think at today's age,

1399
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,880
 that would be absolutely absurd, it was absurd then,

1400
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,200
 but now, obviously, you'd be able to sort of,

1401
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,240
 you know, they'd be on FIFA

1402
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,320
 or you could find them somehow.

1403
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,160
 - That's true.

1404
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,000
 - Yeah.

1405
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,200
 - It would be more difficult to do today, for sure.

1406
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,040
 - When was this?

1407
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,880
 It was in the '90s.

1408
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,720
 - It was in '99.

1409
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,560
 - '99?

1410
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

1411
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,320
 - Because it was so much harder

1412
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,760
 to find these foreign players

1413
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,000
 on databases or whatever.

1414
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 There was, do you hear about Ali Deer, not Ali Dyer?

1415
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,600
 In 1996, Graham Sunez,

1416
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,520
 who was the manager of Southampton at the time,

1417
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,520
 he got a call from George Weir,

1418
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,760
 who was a Ballon d'Or winner, you know, player of the year.

1419
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,280
 - Future president of Liberia.

1420
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,120
 - Yes, yes.

1421
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,960
 - Ooh.

1422
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,800
 - Yeah, there you go.

1423
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,640
 - And he's interested.

1424
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,720
 - He's really muffled his way up there.

1425
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,960
 (laughing)

1426
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,920
 - He called Graham Sunez,

1427
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,840
 saying that he should give his cousin, Ali Dyer, a trial,

1428
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,160
 because he'd been playing at Paris Saint-Germain,

1429
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
 he'd been playing for Liberia,

1430
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,880
 and he'd been doing pretty well.

1431
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,680
 And so, Sunez was like, that's amazing.

1432
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,040
 I mean, you know, playing at Paris Saint-Germain,

1433
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,920
 that's incredible.

1434
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,840
 And so, they gave him a sort of trial contract.

1435
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,720
 They gave him three and a half grand, signing on bonus.

1436
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,480
 And he turned up to training,

1437
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,000
 and Matt LaTissier, who was sort of the star player,

1438
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 he's quite the same.

1439
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,520
 What's this bloke doing here?

1440
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,600
 - I honestly thought he won a competition.

1441
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,400
 (laughing)

1442
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,400
 But it was the reserve team that Ali Dyer had been put

1443
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,240
 onto to play for that weekend.

1444
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,320
 Their match was canceled.

1445
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,720
 And so, Southampton first team needed a sub.

1446
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,200
 And so, he went there and subbed on when LaTissier was injured.

1447
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,400
 He played for 43 minutes before being subbed off again.

1448
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,240
 He's so bad.

1449
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,560
 - He was just a made up guy.

1450
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,120
 Was it even, was the George Wayer thing,

1451
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,000
 or was it actually George Wayer who called him?

1452
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,840
 - No.

1453
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,560
 - So, they don't know to this day who really who it was,

1454
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,400
 but people believe it might have been his friend,

1455
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,760
 or it might have been his, you know.

1456
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,000
 - It was just a bloke.

1457
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,360
 I love these stories.

1458
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,760
 - Yeah, I love the Hutzpah.

1459
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,600
 - Yeah.

1460
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,160
 - Do you guys hear about Karl Power?

1461
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,000
 - Karl Power, okay.

1462
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,800
 - Karl Power was, he wasn't never a sports player,

1463
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,680
 but he was a serial trickster.

1464
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,720
 And his thing was tricking his way

1465
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,960
 into sporting environments that he wasn't meant to be in,

1466
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,800
 right?

1467
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,880
 And he started, like, when he was a teenager,

1468
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,040
 he would tell them about boxing matches

1469
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,800
 with a towel and a gym bag,

1470
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,640
 and he would get him for free

1471
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,560
 'cause they assumed he was part of the fight, right?

1472
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,320
 - That's a risky one, though, isn't it?

1473
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,320
 'Cause if they think you're an actual boxer,

1474
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,160
 you're in trouble.

1475
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,520
 - He built on it, and he built his career.

1476
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,880
 And he, so one of his greatest moments

1477
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,560
 was when he got into a Manchester United team photo

1478
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,960
 just before they played a big Champions League match.

1479
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,800
 And you can see a shot.

1480
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,200
 He's got Ryan Giggs, Andy Cole, Gary Neville,

1481
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,960
 and Karl, just this guy.

1482
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,920
 And Neville, Neville, was the only one who rumbled him.

1483
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,160
 Like, they were all lined up for the photo,

1484
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,200
 and Neville pointed at him and said,

1485
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,720
 "Who are you, who are you?"

1486
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,200
 And he said, "Shut it, Gary, you grass."

1487
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,840
 (all laughing)

1488
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,800
 - You can see that video.

1489
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,560
 You can see Roy Keane right at the end clocks it.

1490
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,480
 And Roy Keane, he's a pretty feisty footballer.

1491
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,240
 And you see him look across, and it's daggers.

1492
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,320
 - That's so funny.

1493
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,080
 That's really a shut-in grass.

1494
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,120
 - He spent his whole career doing this.

1495
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,320
 I said career, he didn't get paid much for it,

1496
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,760
 but he played on centre court.

1497
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,960
 He just turned up and played,

1498
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,840
 he played a match like a little warm-up

1499
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,160
 with someone like Tim Hemman.

1500
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,080
 He got onto the podium at the Grand Prix,

1501
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,320
 the British Grand Prix.

1502
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,560
 - He came out to bat for England,

1503
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,120
 and the test match they were playing was.

1504
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,960
 I mean, it was.

1505
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,080
 - But he didn't actually hit any balls.

1506
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,160
 He just walked towards,

1507
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,960
 and then they realised it was the wrong person.

1508
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1509
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,960
 But I just, I had mine so much.

1510
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,240
 - But that's performance art.

1511
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,080
 - That's not.

1512
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,920
 - Yeah.

1513
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,840
 - That's pure performance art.

1514
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,880
 - That's brilliant, 'cause he's still going in car power.

1515
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,600
 - I don't think he's still trading, as it were,

1516
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,160
 but I think he's still around, yeah.

1517
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,120
 - Once you get to an age,

1518
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,120
 you can't pretend to be a footballer anymore.

1519
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,520
 - You can't pretend to be a manager, I guess.

1520
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,360
 - Or like a bowls player, or something like that.

1521
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,400
 - I found a, this is a real footballer,

1522
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,680
 but had a fictional element to them.

1523
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,320
 So it's sort of like mostly real person.

1524
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,000
 But I was reading about Maradona,

1525
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,920
 and Maradona, so he used to do a lot of drugs.

1526
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,440
 I think that's very well known to do.

1527
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,280
 - I like it.

1528
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,120
 - Breaking news.

1529
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,080
 Yeah, Andy, he was big on the old cocaine.

1530
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,720
 But so he had, he was all real, except he had a fake penis.

1531
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,720
 - Sorry, Maradona.

1532
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,480
 - Maradona, he had a real penis,

1533
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,760
 but he also had a special fake penis made of plastic,

1534
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,440
 so that when he had to do drug tests,

1535
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,360
 he would pull the fake penis out,

1536
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,200
 and he would allow the urine to come through it.

1537
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,920
 And it's so hard to get to the bottom of this story.

1538
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,040
 Supposedly, the penis was put on display

1539
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,540
 in a museum in Buenos Aires, and then went on tour.

1540
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,560
 I read this in The Guardian,

1541
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,800
 written on tour, and then someone stole the penis,

1542
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,760
 somewhere on tour.

1543
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,560
 So this missing relic of Maradona's

1544
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,080
 is out in the world somewhere, but yeah.

1545
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,920
 - Wow.

1546
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,960
 - That'll be on some billionaire's mantelpiece.

1547
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,280
 You know, they've paid big, big money to a cabal

1548
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,320
 or something to source.

1549
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,920
 - What's called the knob of God.

1550
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,760
 - Nob of God.

1551
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
 - Yeah, someone's got the knob of God.

1552
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,280
 - And you have a fake bladder, too, I guess.

1553
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,840
 - It's called a whizinator, I think.

1554
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,440
 I've heard of these things before,

1555
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,360
 and yeah, you use them for, like, drug tests.

1556
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,040
 - Do you hook it up to a fake bladder?

1557
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,920
 Or does the penis contain the fake urine

1558
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,760
 that you're trying to--

1559
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
 - It's not an actual human bladder,

1560
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,040
 it's just a bit of plastic, but yeah, a bag.

1561
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,920
 - So you've got the bag and the whizinator,

1562
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,160
 the fake penis, and everything's in your trousers, right?

1563
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,960
 - Well, everything's about your person, for sure.

1564
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,520
 But then there was a person who did that,

1565
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,360
 and it turned out that they were pregnant,

1566
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,960
 even though it was a male-spurred person.

1567
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,280
 Yeah, he'd taken some female urine,

1568
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,160
 and they were like, "Good news, you didn't take any drugs."

1569
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,440
 - I heard you used your pregnant.

1570
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,320
 - And a horse, apparently.

1571
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,680
 Before you said anything about explaining the drug test thing,

1572
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,760
 I thought you were gonna say it was

1573
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,640
 'cause people would try and grope him at clubs,

1574
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,040
 and then he could kind of make a getaway.

1575
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,400
 You know, like, a lizard losing its tail.

1576
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,960
 - Oh, right. - That's a great idea.

1577
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,720
 - I mean, I don't imagine he played with it, did he?

1578
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,560
 Did he play?

1579
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,800
 - I don't think you're asked for urine samples mid-gay.

1580
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,120
 (all laughing)

1581
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,120
 - To me, a non-fan, that would liven things up.

1582
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,680
 (all laughing)

1583
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,800
 - Well, you've seen when Gary Lineker

1584
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,160
 pooed himself on pitch, haven't you?

1585
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,000
 - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

1586
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,840
 - I haven't seen that clip, yeah, yeah.

1587
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,680
 - Well, 'cause there's a mystery,

1588
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,160
 we wrote about this in our book of the year,

1589
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,600
 the fish book, that Gary Lineker, still to this day,

1590
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,200
 some 20-odd years after he did that,

1591
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,880
 gets sent a single piece of toilet paper

1592
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,480
 that's got a bit of poo on it in the post.

1593
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,400
 He's just constantly, he doesn't know who's doing it.

1594
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,160
 - Oh, it's quite easy to find out

1595
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,400
 surely who's poo that is.

1596
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,720
 - Well, yeah. - You can just take a look.

1597
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,120
 - No, but if the person sending it is clean,

1598
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,720
 they're not on any DNA registers.

1599
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,600
 - I was thinking with, 'cause Gary Lineker's been

1600
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,400
 in a bit of problem with the government,

1601
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,240
 hasn't he? - Oh, yeah.

1602
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,080
 - This year.

1603
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,840
 I wonder if Eddie was Czech, so well, a problem.

1604
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,420
 (all laughing)

1605
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,120
 - Not saying it's her, but it's just worth checking

1606
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,800
 everyone, isn't it, really?

1607
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,880
 All of his enemies.

1608
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,360
 God bless him.

1609
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,480
 What were you talking about?

1610
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,200
 - Football, sort of fake or lie footballers.

1611
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,040
 - Yeah.

1612
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,380
 - Looking at you, Phil.

1613
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,080
 (all laughing)

1614
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,880
 - Well, I mean, our whole performances on Ted is,

1615
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,840
 it's so edited that, you know,

1616
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,800
 it's basically choreography on Ted Lasso,

1617
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,160
 rather than it being sort of pretending

1618
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,640
 we're playing football, I see it in one's choreography,

1619
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,520
 but it's so hard to do.

1620
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
 Because the thing, one of the things I really found,

1621
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,400
 I really tried to, like, (sighs)

1622
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,200
 when you see close-up of players,

1623
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,440
 that was me breathing below.

1624
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,280
 (all laughing)

1625
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,800
 But if there was ever shots in the middle of a game,

1626
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,640
 I wanted it to feel like--

1627
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,480
 - You're probably panicking.

1628
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,440
 - Yeah, and I feel like so many sports films you watch

1629
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,280
 that that doesn't happen and it's really frustrating.

1630
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,320
 But there were certain things that the production

1631
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,280
 had to take into their own hands,

1632
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,760
 which was some of the particularly difficult

1633
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,400
 choreography that we had to do.

1634
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,360
 Like, someone shoots, it hits off a post,

1635
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,960
 it hits someone's face.

1636
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,680
 It's CGI, the ball is CGI.

1637
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,520
 So we'd be running around the pitch,

1638
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,440
 sort of pretending to kick a ball,

1639
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,080
 which is very--

1640
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,760
 - That feels like a bit more difficult, right?

1641
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,120
 - Yeah, it does, it feels hard.

1642
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,040
 - Because you've got to think of what the weight is

1643
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,600
 of the ball and how far it's going to go.

1644
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,040
 - Do they not, like, in some CGI,

1645
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,120
 they'll just have an orange instead of whatever?

1646
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,320
 Like, you're fighting a dragon,

1647
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,720
 but there's an orange or something.

1648
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,040
 (all laughing)

1649
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,640
 - It's a guy in green, his head is the ball.

1650
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,400
 (all laughing)

1651
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,200
 - And the wonderful best actor goes to the ball.

1652
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,840
 (all laughing)

1653
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,840
 - Tom Hanks' Wilson Furious never made it to nomination level.

1654
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,840
 - No, I've got one fact.

1655
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,080
 It's less about sort of fake football,

1656
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,640
 but more, there is, do you know about Will Still,

1657
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,160
 the manager at Reem or Ram FC?

1658
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,160
 It's a league team.

1659
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,640
 And every single time the team plays,

1660
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,880
 they are fined 22,000 euros.

1661
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,880
 - What are they doing out there?

1662
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,920
 - Well, it's not so much them, it's the manager himself.

1663
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,600
 He is the youngest manager in European football.

1664
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,840
 He's 30 years old.

1665
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,480
 He's an English Belgian, I think, and it's incredible.

1666
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,960
 He's like this sort of real hotshot manager,

1667
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,080
 but because he's so young,

1668
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,800
 he hasn't really had time to go and get his certifications,

1669
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,440
 which you need in order to be a manager in Ligue 1.

1670
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,000
 And so he's just sort of like, he learned off

1671
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,960
 football manager, and he went to university,

1672
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,640
 he got a degree, but it was really through that.

1673
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,480
 But yeah, so--

1674
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,920
 - So they find because he just hasn't got

1675
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,160
 the certification yet?

1676
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,200
 - Yeah, so it's one of the rulings.

1677
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,960
 - What a fine, how big of that can they forward that?

1678
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1679
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,520
 - But he's done so well, and it's incredible.

1680
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,080
 If you watch a video of him, you hear him speaking

1681
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,240
 as one normally would in a training session in English,

1682
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,480
 and then without missing a beat, it goes into perfect French.

1683
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,160
 And it's incredible, you watch him and it's just, yeah,

1684
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,880
 he's a really interesting guy, an interesting guy.

1685
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,040
 - That's a shame, I always thought

1686
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,880
 that we could just become a football manager.

1687
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,200
 Whenever Tramir lose that, like Tramir lost,

1688
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,400
 I'm a Tramir fan, so we lost our manager a few weeks ago,

1689
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,920
 and I always think, it's worth a try, isn't it?

1690
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,520
 It's worth a try becoming a football manager,

1691
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,720
 but now I know I have to get actual qualifications.

1692
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,160
 - This feels like a French bureaucracy thing, surely.

1693
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,920
 - Do you think ever since Karl Power turned up

1694
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,320
 on Paris Saint-Germain and tried to coach the team?

1695
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,280
 - Do you think it'll be okay?

1696
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,280
 - I think it'll be fine.

1697
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,480
 I think you'd be fine, James.

1698
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,000
 What I don't know about football isn't worth knowing, right?

1699
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,360
 So I'd say go for it.

1700
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,440
 - I can friend some park with a new thatched roof.

1701
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,000
 - I'll be there, I'll be there, all right?

1702
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,320
 I've got a season ticket.

1703
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:03,040
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

1704
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,360
 Thank you so much for listening.

1705
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,240
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1706
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,400

1707
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,720
 over the course of this podcast,

 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1709
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,360
 I'm on @Shrieberland, James.

 nosuchthingasafish.com.

1718
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,120
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

1719
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,720
 And Phil, do you wanna mention anything coming up?

1720
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,480
 - Ted Lasso is currently, I think it's just about to air

1721
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,360
 its final episode, or maybe just aired.

1722
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,520
 So go and watch that.

1723
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,280
 And I love you.

1724
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,040
 (laughing)

1725
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,880
 - Aw, that's nice.

1726
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,320
 - That's a great way to end our show.

1727
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,120
 - Damn, do we have any live shows coming up?

1728
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,440
 - We certainly do.

1729
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,680
 James, do you wanna tell everyone about it?

1730
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,520
 - Oh, fucks sake.

1731
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,360
 (laughing)

1732
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,200
 - Yeah, there you go.

1733
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,080
 - It's happening between the 17th of July

1734
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,320
 and late August at the Soho Theatre.

1735
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,200
 We're doing 11 shows, sometimes two a night.

1736
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,760
 So there are some tickets left, actually.

1737
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,080
 I think about half the tickets have already gone,

1738
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,920
 but there are some left.

1739
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,080
 So hurry now.

1740
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,400
 - Great, okay.

1741
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,040
 - Oh, and go to knowsuchsthingasofish.com/soho

1742
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,880
 to book your tickets.

1743
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,760
 - There you go, do come.

1744
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,200
 Tickets are going really fast, so do get in quick.

1745
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,920
 And we've got a new guest each night.

1746
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,280
 It's gonna be really, really fun.

1747
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,160
 So that's it, Phil, we love you too.

1748
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,360
 Thank you for doing the show.

1749
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,680
 And we'll be back again next week with another guest.

1750
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,520
 We'll see you then, goodbye.

1751
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,100
 (upbeat music)

1752
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,680
 (upbeat music)

1753
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,260
 (upbeat music)

1754
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,840
 (upbeat music)

1755
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,420
 (upbeat music)
