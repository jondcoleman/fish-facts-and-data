00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 *starts playing*

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from our four respective homes in the UK while we're all on lockdown.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tuginski and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphone to our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Starting with you, Anna.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 My fact this week is that P.T. Barnum once tried to buy William Shakespeare's birthplace and transport it to America.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Would that technically have made Shakespeare American if his house where he was born was moved to America?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Yeah, I think that's how citizenship works. It would have been ideal for him. He could have worked in America for dream.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 So P.T. Barnum, the very famous 19th century shoman entertainer, circus man and business man and great PR man above all, who very famous guy I think there was a film about him recently.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Was it the greatest show? Was that about him? The greatest show man. It's all in the title.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 So yeah, this is an 1844. We know it actually happened because as well as Barnum reporting on it, he reported on every detail of his own life pretty much and lots of details that maybe weren't in his own life.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 But as well as Barnum writing about it, his signature is in the visitor's book in the house. So it was an 1844 and he signed the visitor's book and he signed it along with Tom Thumb, who was one of his acts.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 He signed it saying this P.T. Barnum with or Kara of Tom Thumb. But I couldn't tell if Tom Thumb was actually there if that's just how he signed stuff, who was just like Barnum, Kara of Tom Thumb.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And yeah, he visited and he thought it was pretty great. And as he wrote later, I obtained through a friend the refusal of the house, like a friend said he had dibs on the house.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And I planned to take it in lots of boxes to New York, but the project leaks out and British pride was touched, so several English gentlemen interfered and purchased the premises for the Shakespeare Association instead.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 So sadly, his plan was thwarted.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 But actually, these English gentlemen who interfered, they had been planning to interfere for quite a long time.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 They had gotten together a group that was always going to buy this house and they put the wheels in motion in 1835, but they'd just been really procrastinating and not really doing anything.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 And it was only when Barnum came along and actually a few other Americans who thought they were going to buy this, that they went, oh shit, we better get our asses in gear and we better buy this house.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 And one of the people who was involved was Dickens. And in the end, they started putting on all these kind of shows to get money together. And Dickens was part of those shows and put on Shakespeare plays to try and fundraise.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Yeah, he did. He played Justice Shallow in the Mary Wives of Windsor, I think. And then they also made this, what appears to be a kind of mashup called this house to be sold, great name.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And it was, it was a new play, but it featured lots of kind of Shakespeare characters along the way. Sounds amazing.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 That hasn't, yeah.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Written partially by Dickens.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 No, written by Ben Elton.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Ben Elton, yes.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So Barnum was, was insane. The things he did, we've mentioned it a couple of times before. We mentioned one of his first claims to fame was this lady Joyce Heth, who was a very elderly African American woman, who he claimed was 161 years old and had been George Washington's nursemate.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 He also said that at one point she, when that sort of that rose was being sort of uncovered and exposed. He then said that she was an automaton.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 And that she was, yeah, he sold her as an automaton and said that she was being manipulated by Ventriloquist for the sound. And if you look close, you can see the cogs and so on.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Anyway, Joyce Heth died and doctors examined her and said, yep, this is an elderly woman, but not 161 year old woman.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And Barnum, Barnum wrote in his autobiography about it. He said, the doctors disagreed and this dark subject will probably always continue to be shrouded in mystery.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 There's an interesting bit in this book about Joyce Heth. So we should say one of the reasons we're talking about this is there's this new book out which is quite a big deal. Barnum and American life is the latest Barnum biography.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 But he says that one thing that the P.D. Barnum did quite well was sort of play with his audience, half acknowledging that a lot of his things were aroused. So for instance, with Joyce Heth, he'd claim she's 161.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And then he'd be like, or is she guys? Is this a big old trick? Why don't you come and see and judge for yourself?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 That's quite a good idea. I was looking at some of the less exploitative acts in his circus.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 So when you went as well as these people, you could see glass blowers. They had there. They had a guy called the Lightning Calculator.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 I can't work out what he did. I think it's him like taking large numbers from people and then multiplying them together really quickly rather than hearing some lightning and some thunder of working out how far away it is.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 It's a good thing. Every dad could do that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 He was the first dad to do that. That was so amazing.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Do you think you know when you go to a festival and there's quite, there's the main stage and then there's some quite shit tents on the edge?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 That's glass blowing, right? Like when you've got a woman with 17 heads doing peace acts in the Big Ten. Who's going to see the glass blowing?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Only when it's raining that they go to the glass blowing tent. That's right.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 This museum, the American Museum, it sounds amazing. So more people went to it proportionately. I think that has been to Disneyland or Disney World or whatever it is.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 But the museum, it did have a lot of acts or exhibits which were not great. So they had a living cow with five legs and two tails.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 They had the preserved hand and arm of a pirate called Tom Trouble. They had some black bugs found in the stomach of a distressed Maryland lady and a hat made out of broom splints made by a lunatic.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 That's the least good stuff he has. And this museum was in the center of New York City. This was on Broadway which is amazing.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 To think of this astonishing building with all these oddities in there and you could go up to the top of the roof. They had daily hot air balloon rides that would leave from the roof of the building.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Can we talk about his wife a bit or his wives? So he was married to charity his wife for 40 years and then she died. But they weren't very close I think because he got the news that she had died when he was off buying racing ostriches in Hamburg and then he didn't go to the funeral.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 So maybe a sign there. Imagine if he turned up to the funeral with the racing ostriches. I can't find anyone to look after them. They're going to come up.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 I came as quick as I could on the dust. It's like whatever he's called Bernie Winters.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 You mentioned Tom Thumb earlier. So Tom Thumb, general Tom Thumb as he was nicknamed had dwarfism.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 He was only three foot high and Barnum took him on as an act basically. But because he was only about four years old when Barnum took him on.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Barnum then aged him up and said this is an adult who has dwarfism rather than this is a child who would be small anyway who also has dwarfism.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 So adding ages to people didn't he just like making people older than he loved he absolutely right. He doubled the ages of every one of his most famous acts because it's more impressive.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 He would be amazing as one of those people who made fake IDs when you're okay. That's probably how he started.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 But he married Tom Thumb off to another lady with dwarfism and then there was a there was an intense rivalry over her affection.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 So I think she was called Levinia between Tom Thumb, general Tom Thumb and then a third dwarf who was called Commodore Nut.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 And they and he I think Barnum set up this love rivalry between the three of them.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Amazing. These people all came from military backgrounds.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Yeah.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Okay. It is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Okay. My fact this week is that in 1547 the Venetian government assassinated two men to stop them from revealing how mirrors were made.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 So good.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Well, I read this on a website called Longreads.com, an article called The Ugly History of Beautiful Things and it's all about mirrors.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And they mostly used as a source, a book called The Mirror of History by Sabine Mel qua Bonnet or Bonnet.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 And this is all about the fact that mirrors were made in Venice for hundreds and hundreds of years and no one else around the world knew how to make them.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 So Venice had a complete monopoly on them.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 It was in fact even in Venice it was just this one island called Marano where all the glass makers lived and all the mirrors were made.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 And they were extremely expensive.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 If you wanted to buy one in England for instance, Henry VIII bought one.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 The cost of one Venetian mirror was about the same as buying a large naval ship. That's how much one mirror would cost.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 It was incredible. They basically completely cornered the market but everyone else wanted to know how to make these mirrors so they wouldn't have to pay such massive amounts.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 And then in 1547 two Venetian workers moved to Germany to try and like sell their wares over there.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And the Venetian government were having absolutely none of it and sent some assassins out to try and kill them and they did kill them.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Yeah, from what I read on that article as well, the stuff that they would do to these people if they attempted to leave the island.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 So if you went off the island they would hold your family hostage on the island to make sure that you came back.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 They didn't want you giving out those secrets.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Unbelievable. The mirror island, it's amazing. Never heard of it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 It was policy basically. It wasn't a Venetian policy and it lasted for hundreds of years, like you say.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 So even in 1665 this rule still existed that if you took the secrets away with you, then the government could track you down and kill you.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And there was this huge diplomatic incident in 1665 because the French were gagging for mirrors and for the technology to make mirrors.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 And so the French ambassador was sent to Venice and told you got to get some of those morano workers back with you.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And so he sort of bribed a few of them and said, you know, I'll give you shed loads of money come with me. They went back to Paris and it was awful for them because they were working in these Paris factories.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 They still because they wanted to keep the secrets. They wouldn't let any of the French workers see them work.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 So it's kind of pointless because the French weren't able to find out their secrets.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 And they just kept having nervous breakdowns because Venice kept sending threatening messages in various ways to them saying we're going to get you, we're going to kill you, you better come back now.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 And they sent sort of fake messages from their wives saying you must come home now.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 And then the French responded by sort of abducting their wives and bringing them to Paris in the hopes that way they stay.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 If I was the French government, I would send a mirror right from the mirror island.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 But I would write on the frame of the mirror, this guy's dead if we ever get him.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 That's a great idea. Oh my god. You would have been an excellent Renaissance diplomat.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 And in the end, the French did get it, didn't they? Got all the technology and they built the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, which was a big fuck you to Venice.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Wow, it's an opening move, a whole hall. That's awesome.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And it did collapse the Venetian industry, didn't it?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 So it kind of went to show that hundreds of years of obsessive secrecy was totally worth it. Because as soon as the secret got out, the industry died.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Yeah. Yeah, it was kind of, if you're a Venetian mirror maker, you kind of had some good bits and some bad bits.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 So the good bits were that you were really important in society.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 So you're one of the few people in Venice that was allowed to have a sword at all times.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 And your daughters were allowed to marry into affluent Venetian families, because there was like a communist caste system where, you know, you weren't allowed to marry outside of your level, but the glass blowers were allowed to.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 But then on the downside, they worked with Mercury and so they all went mad.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Yes, yeah, there's a contemporary account from 1713 by guy called Ramazzini, who said that's the course of that of having to work with Mercury and the insanity that came off it.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 But having to look at yourself as you were going insane in these mirrors, watching the madness take you over is, yeah.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 So even if your daughter brings home her affluent new husband, you think he's a pickle because you've got mad because the Mercury is that? That's the curse.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 I thought, sure, if it was that specific kind of insanity, what do you think people are pickles? It was more of a dissent into madness. Like there was a quote where they said that the mirror makers scaled at their reflection of their own suffering in the mirrors and cursed the trades that they have chosen.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Mind you, if they could have hung on for another couple of hundred years, they would have found a career with PT Bonham because you've got glass blowing and sounds like they're kind of loopy by that stage.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Great, great performance. Yeah, we seem to, we, I mean, humanities seem to make mirrors for quite a while, so there were mirrors in ancient Rome.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 And then in the dark ages, like with a lot of stuff, they sort of disappeared, right? And then this technology took a while to come back, but they definitely had them in ancient times and good mirrors.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 And I read the Caligula, who obviously made a bit of a living and a reputation out of scaring the shed out of people, Caligula used his mirror to practice scary faces.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Not really. That was the side hustle for Caligula, though. That's just something he did in the course of being Emperor. He didn't have a sort of spooky Emporium.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 That's great, though. He practices faces. I love that. That's really good. You don't hear that about evil dicks.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 No. You just think it comes in control, right? Yeah. You've got to work hard at these things, Dan. Yeah.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Guys, I've got a mirror, a mirror question for you. Oh, great. Cool. Are you looking in your bathroom mirror at your face and your neck, maybe your shoulders?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 And you want to see your whole body and imagine you've got a massive bathroom. How are you going to make it so the mirror reflects your whole body?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Get a full length mirror. No, go as far away from the mirror as possible and eventually you'll be able to see yourself.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 I would crouch on the basin. Okay. On the basin. Yeah. If I want to see my whole body, I'll just awkwardly crouch on top of the basin.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 How unbelievably strong is your face? And he doesn't have a toilet in his bathroom, actually. He just uses the same for everything.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It's multi-purpose. Well, I'm astonished to say this, but Andy's right. I'm afraid.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 So I was amazed by this. You are always the same size in a mirror. No matter how far back you go, you're never going to be able to see any more of your body.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 And that size is half of your actual size. So let's say you look in a mirror close up and you get a permanent pen and you draw your face or you draw, you know, the, yeah, you draw a circle around your face of where your face images in the mirror.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 If you stand back 20 yards and get someone close to the mirror to do it again, it's going to be in exactly the same place. Wow.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Isn't that this I found this amazing, but it's so like it's obvious when you actually think about the old boring physics lessons about mirrors because it's about the fact that, you know, the angle of incident.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So where the light hits the mirror and then where it reflects off the mirror always has to be the same.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 So imagine you're standing really close to a mirror and you want to see your feet. Then the light from your feet goes up to the mirror at a steep angle and then has to reflect at that exact same angle to get to your eyes for you to see your feet.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 When you go away from the mirror, it's going to be exactly the same problem if you couldn't see your eyes there and you go away from there, you won't see your eyes further away because the light has further to travel.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So even though the angle is smaller, the light travels further and goes over your head, draw a diagram and you'll understand it.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So even if I have a very, very, very long bathroom, it's so I've got a bathroom that's 100 meters long and have a mirror at the end of it that I can't see my feet in up close, even at the other end of the bathroom, I still won't be able to see my feet.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 You'll never be able to see your feet.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 The thing that's confusing me is the other person standing next to the mirror who's drawing the head because if you were standing at the back of the room and I was next to the mirror and you said, can you see what's in my teeth and opened your mouth?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 It feels odd to me that I'd be able to see your head as a real size head despite the fact that you're all the way over there.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 No, you've misunderstood that.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Great.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Because that person is a different person.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 So this is just about how it looks.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 To you.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 To the reflection, how it looks to you, the person.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Obviously to the person standing next to the mirror, you're going to look like you're in a completely different place and etc.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 So we can't test your idea of drawing the circle then, the other person drawing your circle.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 No, you'd have to tell the other person what to draw.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 You have to guide their hand with your words.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 Gotcha.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 But what you're describing then and not quite understanding that is something called the toilet of Venus illusion.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And that is that there is a lot of paintings of the toilet of Venus and that is Venus is lying down kind of sideways on a painting and there's a chair holding a mirror.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 And then you looking at the painting can see Venus and can see her in the mirror.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And most people think that she's looking at herself in the mirror.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 But the fact is if you can see her face, she can't see her face in the mirror.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 She can actually see you in the mirror.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 So she would theoretically be looking at the person who's painting the painting.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 She wouldn't be looking at herself.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 But most people when they see those paintings think that she's looking at herself.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 She's not as vain as people think.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Yeah, that's very cool. You know that thing of practicing faces in the mirror.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 The killer.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Yeah, there's a nice thing which is that Kate Winslet keeps her Oscar in her bathroom because she knows that everyone wants to practice giving an Oscar speech in front of the mirror.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 And she can tell when people are doing it because she'll say the flush goes and it's almost as if they clock it in there and they just spend an extra few minutes in there for silently doing their speech.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 You know what, I think generally speaking, this is a non-controversial statement.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Generally speaking, it's a bad idea to have a secret camera in someone's bathroom.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 But in this case, I would love to see people doing that speech.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 That would be amazing.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 She can pick up some ideas. I thought you were going to say she keeps it in her bathroom so that she can pretend she's got two Oscars.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 I thought you were going to say that.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Or maybe she has a mirror behind the mirror and it looks like she's just got infinite Oscars.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 So you look gradually more green as they go on.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 There is, if we're on movie stuff, have you guys seen Terminator 2?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 I watched it just this week.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 For the first time, did you like it? I did actually, yeah. I watched Terminator 1 as well for the first time.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Oh, nice. Well, it's a zinger. But in Terminator 2, there is a scene. It might be in the extra features.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 But there's a scene where there's a mirror shot.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 And it's the two humans operating on Schwarzenegger the robot and they're unscrewing his brain in case and they're opening his head up.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And you can see the operation happening in the mirror as well.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 That wasn't done using a mirror because there's no film crew reflected in the mirror.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Of course not.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 And you would think, oh, well, they might just remove the film crew with CGI.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 They didn't do that. They literally had cut out space.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 So they had a fake Arnie in the foreground. And then the reflection shot in the mirror is the real Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Except he's not in a mirror. He's just sitting opposite a dummy of himself.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Oh, that's so clever.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Linda Hamilton who plays Sarah Connor, she has a twin sister who did the reflection.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Or did the foreground stuff and then the Hamilton's in the reflection.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 So you see both of them and they're mirroring each other's movements.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 No.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 But they are not actually being shown in a mirror. They're up to six.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 I know. Isn't that insane?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 That's incredible.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Do you know there's an animal that has mirrors in its body?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Oh, no.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 And that is the skull up.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 The humble skull up.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 So it has eyes made of mirrors.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Skullups have about 200 eyes each and rather than having a lens like we have to focus the light as it comes in.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 They have what most telescopes have now to focus the light, which is the mirror.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 So the light hits a mirror that's curved and then obviously it like bends and focuses.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 So this means that their retina is actually on the ceiling of their eyes.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 So with us, our retina is behind our lens.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 So the light hits our lens and then it's focused on our retina, which is just behind it.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 With them, it hits these mirrors, which are their eyes and then bounces up onto the ceiling of their eyes,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 which is the retina, isn't that cool?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 That's really cool.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 If you were to get, let's say, 20,000 skullups and remove all of their eyes and then paste it on a piece of cardboard,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 would you be able to make a mirror that's usable?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 It's a bit of a fucked up mirror, isn't it?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 I don't think people will come round your house.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 I just think in that the French could have used this technology instead of going to Venice.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 It could have been a very different world.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 It could have been what a world we could have had, where the Venetians have good mirrors,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 and everyone else has to kill a million skulls.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Would you guys get your hair cut without a mirror?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Yeah, I have done many times.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 I have to.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Well, sorry, why do you have to?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 When you go to the hairdressers, do you say sorry?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Don't mirror the mirror.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Well, are you a vampire?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 No, I technically.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 So because I wear glasses and I can't see very well, I have to take them off for the hair cut.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So there was a mirror in front of me.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 I can't make out what is in front of me.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 You don't force them to remove the mirror.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Turn it to face the wall.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 No, there's only one hairdressing salon that I've found, although I haven't looked very hard,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 where this happens.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 But this is in Peckham in London, and instead of a mirror, you get given a piece of modern art,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 and then your hair is cut, and you have to look at the modern art for nearly an hour.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Isn't that because like one of the worst things about sitting in a hairdress is I find

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 is having to look at myself the whole time, because I'm like, oh my god, what a mess.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 But if I was looking at a Picasso, for instance,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 whether notes, whether you should be and stuff like that,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 I think I'd feel even worse about myself.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Oh, but you'd think, at least I don't look like that guy.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 At least my eyes are on different sides of my face.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 That's great.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 I don't know.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 My fact this week is that the longest car in the world was so long

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 that it had a literal backseat driver.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 What do you mean by this? Someone at the very back of it having to shout really loudly

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 to the driver in the front?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 I thought it was that you needed someone in the backseat of a normal car,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 but with very long arms, to reach to the front.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Stretch arm strong.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Yeah.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Well, this is a limo that was built called the American Dream,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 and it was 100-foot long, and it has 26 wheels, has things like,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 there's a helipad on the back, there's a jacuzzi, there's multiple interior rooms,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 you can play putt putt in the middle of it, but as one solid unit,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 as 100-foot long, you can't take corners too long to take any corners.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 So what the car had built into it was a bit in the middle where you could hinge it apart,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 and when you see on bendy buses where they have that sort of the accordion style thing,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 this car would have that, and in the second half of the car,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 there was a second booth for another driver to be changing the angles of the wheels back there.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 So it had a backseat driver as well as a front seat driver.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Dan, can I ask, what happens if the person in the backseat slams on the brakes,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 and the guy in the front seat carries on going?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Does he come back and smash him in the face like a cartoon?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Yeah, you're right, it would stretch out to probably 110 feet,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 and then, yeah, lob itself back.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 It's like the Blackbird SR-71 plane,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 which, as we all remember, stretches and compressors depending on which outfit it is at.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Why are you bringing that up? Why are you bringing up these old words?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 So this is a limo, which is Guinness World Record certified as the longest car in the world,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 and it's built by a man called Jay Orberg, who lives in America,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 and is one of the great car makers for movies that there's ever been.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 He's the man behind the delorean in Back to the Future.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 He built cars for, like, kit for Knight Rider.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Not the original, but he built one that was a modified one that they used in the series.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 He did cars for the Flintstones movies.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Which was a more basic engineering challenge, doesn't it?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 It was, yeah, yeah.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 He did the Batmobiles for the Tim Burton Batman Return movies.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 So he's an amazing designer,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 and this was his big dream to create this super luxurious 100-foot-long car.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 But unfortunately, no one wanted it,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 and it sort of fell into disuse and went to a garage and it's wasting away now.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 But it's been, it's been repurposed now.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 As what?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 It's been bought by the Auto Museum,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 or the Auto Museum, I think it's called in New Jersey,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 and they bought it to teach, not children, to teach their students how to do up cars.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 So a bunch of students started rebuilding it in 2016,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 and I think as they said, it'll take years and years to rebuild it properly.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 But you know, it's been used as a teaching tool, so it's finally found a purpose.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Great.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 But I have a question about this car.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Yeah.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 It said it's got a Jacuzzi,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 or in some more enthusiastic articles, a swimming pool.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And it also says it has a diving board.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Yes.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 The depth of a pool that you can get into a limo,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 because it's not a super high limo.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 It's just car height.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 If you're diving off that, you're breaking your neck.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Very good point, very good point.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 I mean, these things were never actually driven anywhere, were they?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 Not really.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 They're always publicity gimmicks, aren't they?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Yeah.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Yeah.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Because I saw one interview with someone who had, basically,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 it was like a stretch limo that had been turned into an entire Jacuzzi and swimming pool,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 as in, literally, everything about it was a swimming pool,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 apart from the bit where you drive.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 And they said, yeah, we would never drive this anywhere,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 because all the water would just splash out.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Yeah.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 We just take it to car shows to show that it's something we can do in theory.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And, yeah.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 So I was looking up other Guinness World records that are held by cars.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 And one, which was set at an auto sports international show in Birmingham,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 was the record for the Titus Parallel Park.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 And this was done live in front of an audience at Birmingham.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 So the Titus Parallel Park is 7.5 centimeters.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 That's the gap.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 On each side, or together.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Yeah, yeah. I think all together that this person going in was allowed, yeah.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 That's insane.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Yes, quite.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 Because if I see a space which is smaller than twice than the vicar, I think.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 I'll drive around a bit longer.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Yes, as Alistair Mothat, 2015, he's set it in Birmingham.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And the car's still there.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 He hasn't been able to get it yet, has he?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 You heard of the World Terriers car.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 No, no, no.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 This was earned by Maria Lucia Mugno and Valentino Dessano in Italy.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 They were hairdressers and they thought what better way to advertise our business

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 by sweeping up a load of human hair off the floor and gluing it to our car.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Wow.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And that's what they actual human hair from the actual human hair.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 And it's legal.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 You're allowed to drive it because.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Yeah, who would come up with the law?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 What sick legislation would think of that?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Also, they're too bad.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Their customers couldn't see them stealing their hair behind them because they had the modern art in front of them.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Oh, my God.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 It's legal.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And there's only one part of the car.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 You're not allowed to put the hair.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Oh, don't tell us, don't tell us.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 I would say.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 No, because you could like comb it out of the way.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Instead of with screenwipers, it has two massive combs.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Centre perfect, very bold.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 I would say on the steering wheel because.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 This is a legal thing.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Yeah, but I think a hairy steering wheel will be a hazard to road users, other road users.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 I don't think so.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 I would say, okay, you could just have a hairy steering wheel and the rest of your car's normal.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 And that would be fine, wouldn't it?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 A hairy gear stick.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 I'd say the accelerator pedal because the hairs might get caught underneath somehow, tie up and then you can't lift it back up.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Such a good answer.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 The answer is engine because if you put it on the engine, it might set on fire.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Okay, better answer.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 So you're saying it's allowed to put a moustache on your brake pedal if you want to.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 In Italy.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 What about the number plate?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 I thought it was illegal to conceal your number plate.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 You know what? When I asked this question, I didn't think you were all going to come up with a million great answers.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Well, let's be honest.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Almost every part of a car is a terrible place to put a hair.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Yeah.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 But no, you can get invented for that because if you have grey hair, you can spell out the words and letters.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Sorry, numbers and letters.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 No.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Just with different colour hair.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 That's very easy to do.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Really that point?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Yeah, I do know what then. I think if your car is covered in hair, no one needs your number plate.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 But these are putting out a cow, call for it.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 My fact is that ancient British fruit varieties include the Hens turd apple and the bloody bastard pear.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 So, this is just about amusing names of fruit.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 It doesn't get much more amusing than that, and he doesn't know.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 There are hundreds of varieties of apple and pear and other fruits which have gone out.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 So for example, one ancient one is called the shit smock plum, which apparently has a laxative effect if you eat too many of them.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 I believe the bloody bastard pear also has a laxative effect.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 I think that's where they've got the name as well.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 So how does that...

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 I think you're on the toilet and you've got bloody bastard.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 It doesn't create bloody stool.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Oh, that sounds like you shouldn't beat.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Well, it just sounded like that was what you were suggesting.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Yeah, no, I wasn't intending to suggest that.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Well, that's a relief because I'm just eating seven.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 They are inevitable.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Can I just say, if you go to the shops and see a bloody bastard pear, do not eat it.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 They are in edible.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 They're responsible for them to be selling it.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 They are...

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 There's a load of pears in the UK which are in edible pears, but they're used to make peri.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 They're used to make alcohol.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 So peri is the per version of cider, and bloody bastard is one of the ones that's used to make this, but you can't eat them because they'll give you the shit.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Right.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And similarly, in fact, with a cider apple, I don't know why so many of these fruits have this effect.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 This is a cider apple called Slack McGurdle, which is, again, a reference to the fact that you're going to have to drop your trousers once you've eaten this guy.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Can I give you some funny names of apples and pears just for fun?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Yes.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 So I was looking for the bloody bastard pear, and it's enshrined in UK legislation.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 So they have certain apples and pears that are able to be used to make cider or peri.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 It's by the Apple and Pear Research Council Order of 1989.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 And there's a big long list of them.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 And the apples include bowls bittersweet, bloody turk, crummy Norman, and, as Anna says, Slack McGurdle.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And peri pairs include bastard sack, clipper dick, golden bowls, hairy knob, and Margaret.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 And they're all official fruits that you should use to make cider or peri.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 They also have, on that government list, they have the startle cock pear, which is, and now I think people can now guess, because there's been a pattern why it's called the startle cock.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Is it like a viagra and natural viagra?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 It's not that. That's one of the things that could have been your right.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Does it fall to the fruits fall from the tree to the ground shortly before dawn, waking up cock rolls?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Oh, the sweetened wholesome explanation. No, it's because it's a diuretic.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 So your cock is literally startled into urinating when you eat it.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Oh, okay.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Or when you drink the cider, I suppose.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Yeah.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 You know, you say, "Oh gosh, my cock's a bit startled."

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 I've never heard anyone say that.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 I think that's a new phrase that we're going to bring into the lexicon, isn't it?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Whenever you need to go to the bathroom, it's a polite way of saying, "I want to go to the little advisory, my little girls' room."

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Just say, "Oops, my cock's been startled."

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 I'll be back in a minute.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 So naming apples happens today as well, though.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 So there are new name varieties.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Have you guys been reading about the Cosmic Crisp?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 No.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Okay.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 So this is a new apple that was launched last year with a $10 million marketing budget.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 It's basically, I know it's one of the biggest apple launches that has not been of an apple.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 What is it called again?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 It's called the Cosmic Crisp.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 And it's got PR people who have said it's enormously crunchy and wipe your face juicy.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Are you under the thumb a big apple?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 I'm not.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 But it's, I find, so normally apples get launched with a bit of fanfare, but this is an unusual apple.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 So it's got taglines, which include the apple of big dreams and imagine the possibilities.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 They've hired an ex-astronaut called Leroy Chow to be a social influence of plugging the apple.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Wow.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Its actual name is WA-38.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 And it was patented by Washington State University.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 They developed it.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 And so this has been launched as a thing.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Sorry, this is all sounding a bit #spon.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 It is, and I'm just feeling sorry for the career of Leroy Chow, which has clearly taken a dip since it's astronaut.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 I think it was a commander on the ISS.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Well, okay.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Nice vlogging apples.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 I know.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 But anyway, so because you can patent an apple, every time someone buys one of these, a bit of the money goes to Washington State University, because they were the people who cross-bred it.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 That's a really controversial thing, isn't it?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 Being able to patent fruits and seeds and stuff, and some people think it's really important, because then you get more varieties, which helps feed people.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 But then other people think, well, how can you patent an apple?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Yeah.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 I'm not saying which side of the argument I come on, but...

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 No.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 So, yeah, we used to have lots more varieties of apples and pears than we do today.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 But it seems like they're making a bit of a comeback.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 This fact suggests people are getting more interest in these quirky new varieties.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 And especially you mentioned Perry, Pear Sider.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 So Perry is also making a comeback.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 So all these different types of pear are starting to be bred again.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 And most of the pear cider that you get in pubs, I didn't know this.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Most of the pear cider that you order, like a basic pear cider is just apple cider, and they've put pear flavoring into it.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 No.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Wow.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 And it's only the proper...

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Yeah.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 It's not weird.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 That.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 And unless you're getting nice, proper, expensive Perry or whatever, or you're going to deffin for it.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 I feel like I've been really ripped off by that.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 I'm so sorry.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 I'll be honest, I'm not sure I've ever bought it, but I still am curious.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 And one thing that I have drank, which is definitely Perry, I think, is baby sham, right?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Yes.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 Baby sham is Perry.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 And that's definitely made of pear.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 That's made of pear, baby sham.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 You're right.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 But the Perry industry is a bit annoyed about baby sham because it doesn't have a massively high brown reputation.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 And they want Perry to.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 And one of the people who's trying to rejuvenate Perry's reputation is the kind of leading pear cider bloke in the world.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 I'm going to call him.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 He's called Tom Oliver.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 So he's staging this big comeback.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 He's an award-winning herifiture cider maker.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 And his other job is being tool manager of the Proclaimers.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 Wow.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 It's pretty weird.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Just two pretty weird jobs.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 It's amazing, isn't it, that these people who had such amazing jobs, like astronauts and top manager of the Proclaimers, would then go into Perry?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 Yeah.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Yeah.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Absolutely.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 Hey, I found that in Italy, 275 meters below the surface of the earth are 10,000 tons of apples.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 What?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Yeah.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 What are they doing there, Dan?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 So this is a way, okay.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 So something that is well known is that apples that you eat are often not freshly picked.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 They're kept for a year or so in storage facilities to be able to make them last longer.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 So you can pick them and you can put them in storage.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 And they do that by reducing the oxygen right down to 1% basically.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 So in Italy, what they've done is they've taken over these old mines, it's throughout the dolomites in the Italian mountains.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 And underneath it, they've converted these mines into giant refrigerators where they're stocking up to, they say, 20,000 tons of apples.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 So any given time, there must be a different amount.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 But yeah, if you visit there, it's amazing.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Yeah.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Wow.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 They say that this is what the article said when compared to a standard above ground storage space, the savings by having them underground are equal to 10 Olympic swimming pools of water being saved a day and 10 hectares of land.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 Wow.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Wow.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Yeah. So that's why they do it.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Yeah.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 There's a lot of apples underground in Italy.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 God, every time I buy into an apple now, I'll reflect more on what an adventure it's been.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 I'll be able to get here through the bowels of the earth.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 I found some other fun fruit names, actually.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 There was a good article on BBC Future about how, again, we've lost our passion for these smaller, smaller scale fruit varieties.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 And this article was saying that fist fights used to break out over which tomatoes were better.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Those grown in Mississippi or those grown in New Orleans.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 And now only dedicated foodies, no of Lee's golden girl tomato and radiator Charlie's mortgage lifter tomato.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Reveal Charlie's mortgage lifter.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 That's right.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Radiated Charlie's mortgage lifter tomato.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 Wow.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 You can still get it.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 It just sounds like you've put four random words.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Was it supposedly so good that it would allow him to pay off his mortgage?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 It was exactly that.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 It was thought that any seller of it would be able to pay off her debt.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 And he must have had quite a big house with all those radiators.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 There are some people who are devoted to finding these old fruits.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 They're often detectives, as well.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 So there's a guy called David Benzgoda who worked for the FBI and then started tracking down apples, ancient apples after.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 A head of the FBI or whatever becomes an apple detector.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 What is going on?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 There's David Carp, who was a Wall Street trader and Latin translator and he only got into fruits to impress a woman.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 And she wasn't impressed, but he just kept detecting fruits for the rest of his career.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 John Bunker, the apple whisperer, he is amazing.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 He's an American guy.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Come on, it's much easier to be an apple whisperer and tame an apple than it is to be a Robert Redford style horse whisperer.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Go on.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Well, he's tracked down a hundred varieties and saved them from extinction.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 And when you think about it, it must be incredibly hard because you know maybe where an apple was last grown.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 But you have to comb through historical records for what these apples look like, for drawings of them, for the taste.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 And he will study these records and he will sometimes go to towns or villages where they were last seen.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 And he will put up wanted signs.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 I swear to God.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Have you seen this apple?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Yeah, he was put up a sign saying wanted alive.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Narragansett Apple, last seen in York County, originated on this farm.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 And he works miracles for these things.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 So he once went to a place and he said, have you seen this apple?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 And an old man said, I know a related apple, which was also exchanged.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 And this old man said, I used to eat from this tree when I was a boy.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 And the tree was almost completely dead.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 There was one two inch wide strip of living tissue and there was one branch, right?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 And he took a cutting of that and he successfully managed to regrow the entire apple breed right from that tiny strip.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 And so that apple is great.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 I'm sorry considering you just made it up.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 True, it's all true.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 It's a promising one.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Why do you go to all that trouble and it tastes like crap?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 So likely.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Is this John Bunker, right?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Yeah.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Because he seems to have a side project.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 I guess when you've got these skills, you've got to monetize them whichever way you can.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 And you identify as other people's apples.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 So I think he said, what are you looking for is the ones who can't identify.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 But people are queuing every day saying, you know, what's this?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 It's called delicious.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 It's very, very, very, very delicious.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 He just looks at the sticker usually.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 That's the problem, isn't it?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 That basically it become homogenized and all were basically just growing the same apple trees everywhere and stuff like that.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 And the same pair of trees and you can kind of get invasive pair of trees and things like that.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 Can't you?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 There's one.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 I was reading an article in Vice when I searched for pairs.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 And the title of the article was, here's why the trees on your streets smell like semen.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Okay.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 The linden trees.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 Yeah, they're called.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 These ones are not the linden trees, which also famously smell like semen.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 These are pair trees.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 It's called the Pyrus Calariana tree.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 And this pair tree is taking over.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 They were grown on ornamentally, like linden trees were.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 But they kind of, you get one and then someone plants another one.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 And then they hybridize together and you get new types of this particular type of pair tree.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 And they're really good at taking over in an area.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 And just, you know, out competing all the other pair trees.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 All right.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 You know Nigel Farage.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 I'm angry.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 They're better at the job.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 It's a less nice way of imagining the song which ends and a partridge in a pear tree.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 If the pear tree in question smells of semen.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 If you're being given those on the 12 days of Christmas, you're not going to be happy about that.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Yeah, because actually the first 11 days, you think these are quite...

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 I mean, it's a bit awkward having all these swans and drummers and stuff.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 But they're quite good gifts in the end.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 You just get the jizzy tree.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 You've been blaming the lords of leaping until now.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
