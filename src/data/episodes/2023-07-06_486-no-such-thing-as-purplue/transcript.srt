00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish, where we are joined by the wonderful

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,680
 Sophie Duker.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,760
 Now, if you don't know who Sophie Duker is, where have you been?

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,600
 Certainly not watching season 13 of Taskmaster, that's for sure, which is the season that

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,440
 she won.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,000
 She is also one mastermind.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,080
 She's a regular on our television, on all of the panel shows, and she was absolutely brilliant

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,240
 on our show.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,160
 If you want to learn anything more about Sophie, the best place to go is to sophieduker.com

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,960
 that's S-O-P-H-I-E-D-U-K-E-R dot C-O-M.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,040
 And actually, she also has a comedy night known as Wacky Racists, which is coming to

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,720
 the Hackney Empire on the 26th of October.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,760
 That will be hosted by Sophie and will include Nish Kumar and all sorts of other guests who

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,120
 are yet to be announced.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,320
 That will be a brilliant night, you should definitely get your tickets for that.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,040
 But like I said, any information on Sophie, the best place to go is to sophieduker.com.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840
 Very much hope you enjoyed this week's show.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,960
 I will bore you with adverts for upcoming live shows or for clubfish.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,560
 You know where to go if you want to get involved with those.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:32,240
 For now, let's just say on with a podcast.

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,240
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,880
 Sophie Juker and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,920
 Starting with fact number one, that is Sophie.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:06,040
 Oh my God, my fact is, during their mating season, male camel's stomachs actually shrink

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,920
 so that they can concentrate on chasing females.

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,720
 That's incredible.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
 Brilliant.

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
 So they need to stop less for food, or is it, what is it?

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,720
 I think it's so that they look fit, but also, yeah, is it like breathing in and sticking

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
 your chest out?

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,720
 They have got three stomachs, haven't they?

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,920
 So it will have a good effect if they suck in all three stomachs.

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
 Wow.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,960
 Sadly, I don't think they suck in their stomachs.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,760
 I think they're sucking their stomachs to be kind of more agile and literally chase

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 women.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
 Oh, really?

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,880
 I totally bought the first reason, thanks for clarifying.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,000
 I think it's so they can be faster because there is quite a disgusting display that camels

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,840
 do when they are, male camels do, sorry, female camels are angels on it.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,920
 And males are disgusting, rat-like, toxic, yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,160
 So talking about the toxic male camel, toxic male camel have this thing that they do also

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,000
 during their mating season where they blow up their soft palate, so I don't know exactly

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 how they do it.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,120
 I'm not a camel, but I'm very culturally aware and some people think that they've like thrown

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 up their stomachs or like part of their mouths, but it's actually like they blow up their

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,240
 soft palate so that this huge bulbous pink glistening thing hangs out of their mouths

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
 and it looks almost exactly like a pair of testicles.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
 It really does.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 It's so disgusting.

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,360
 I saw a picture just this morning.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
 I never thought of it that way, but yeah.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,040
 Can you say that again, testicles are disgusting?

57
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
 Oh, yeah.

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
 Yes, yeah.

59
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 I'm not happy with that.

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,280
 There was a study recently about how attractive testicles are and they showed a load of images

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,360
 of scrotums to women and asked them to rate how attractive they were and in the abstract

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,160
 at the start of it, it said we were unable to say that any scrotums were attractive.

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,440
 We were only allowed to say which was the least unattractive.

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
 Oh, no.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
 What are they all human?

66
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 They were all human.

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,280
 Sorry, I should say they were all human testicles.

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,400
 Some people are getting theirs smoothened.

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,280
 If you get some Botox in there.

70
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
 You can have a smooth Botox.

71
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
 Oh, yes to have them.

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
 Yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
 You can do that.

74
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,920
 I don't think any Botox scrotum were part of the study.

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
 Right.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,760
 And also then it's so much harder for them to be expressive, which is a real shame.

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,200
 That bag that they have, the one that you're talking about, is it called the Duller?

78
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 Yes.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,360
 Yeah, I didn't know how to pronounce it, so I'm glad you took the fool for that.

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,280
 But the camel can close its nose to avoid, I think, sand in the desert storm and things

81
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
 like that.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,760
 And I think it closes its nose and then just breathes out into the bag.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,840
 You know when you're kind of trying to make your nose pop?

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
 Yes.

85
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,320
 And you're trying to equalize on the bag.

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 Exactly.

87
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,920
 God, we don't do that when we try and pop our ears and try and ball set comes out of

88
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
 our mouth.

89
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
 No, but you're actually not meant to.

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
 I didn't know this.

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
 You're not meant to do that out of the water.

92
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
 That's meant to be like a dive.

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
 If someone told me.

94
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
 Oh, wow, really?

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
 So maybe if you did it hard enough, you would.

96
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
 Yeah, yeah.

97
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
 The Duller would flop out.

98
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
 Wow.

99
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,720
 But to make it so that sack that comes out, that is seen as quite a sexy thing towards

100
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,120
 the female camels and they drool foam at the same time.

101
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 It's a quite...

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
 Lovely.

103
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,000
 I know it's wrong because it's sort of saying I find it disgusting, but obviously it's an

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 animal thing.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,880
 And you know, but in this case, it's just disgusting.

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,500
 I think it's fine even these days to say that something that an animal does is not attractive

107
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 to you.

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 I think that is allowed.

109
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,120
 But I find everything else animals do really sexy.

110
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
 They urinate on their own tails, don't they?

111
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
 Hot.

112
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
 See?

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
 Yeah.

114
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
 Is that for scent?

115
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,360
 Yeah, to lay down the scent, lay down the pheromones.

116
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,240
 And then they flick it up like a little...

117
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
 Flick it up.

118
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
 Yeah.

119
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 I don't know if that's just because they're dicks.

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,000
 They sort of flick it up a little shower of it.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
 There's something else they do during mating season.

122
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
 Oh, yeah.

123
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
 Which is...

124
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 This is...

125
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
 Oh, sorry.

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
 I'm sorry.

127
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
 I'm sorry.

128
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
 But they do...

129
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
 They must do.

130
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
 They must do.

131
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
 Otherwise how?

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,640
 So this is a study done in Saudi Arabia or maybe the UAE.

133
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,120
 So this is deceitful behavior by male camels during mating season.

134
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,160
 So they wait for the cover of darkness and their males will lie down and they'll pretend

135
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
 to go to sleep.

136
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,720
 But they're not asleep.

137
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,520
 They're just waiting for a female to be lulled into a false sense of security.

138
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
 And then the male pounce on them.

139
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,840
 Yeah, it's not great.

140
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
 No.

141
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
 So I know anthropomorphism is also not the point, but then the females respond by biting

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,000
 the male's knee joints if they're not interested, which can give them arthritis in the long

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 run.

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Okay.

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,200
 So if you ever see an old camel with arthritis, it means in his younger days he was a sex

146
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 pest.

147
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,360
 Yeah, that's exactly what it means.

148
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
 Yeah.

149
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,680
 I saw a sex video the other day of camels having mating.

150
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
 You saw a what?

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
 Sorry.

152
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
 I saw a video.

153
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
 Like, yeah.

154
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
 Like just watch...

155
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
 Was it part of this research or just...

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
 It was...

158
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 I mean, I would have got to it anyway eventually, but...

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,240
 So this footage was because two camels I think was in Dubai or Abu Dhabi just were doing

161
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,360
 it in the middle of the road.

162
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,760
 So traffic was held up.

163
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
 Everyone was filming it.

164
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,480
 And it was effectively, the female camel was on the ground and it was...

165
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
 They sit down, don't they?

166
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
 Yeah.

167
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
 And it was like doggy style.

168
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
 Yeah.

169
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,520
 And it was interesting, because in my head I hadn't pictured how camels would have sex

170
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
 and...

171
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,880
 Well, like almost all mammals, it's doggy style, but the difference is that the females sit

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
 down.

173
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
 Yeah, which is serious.

174
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,560
 They just take a seat and then the male goes behind.

175
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,560
 Do you know why camels have humps?

176
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
 Sort of.

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
 Yeah.

178
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,040
 Well, to store energy and fat reserves.

179
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
 Yeah.

180
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,440
 Why do they need to store?

181
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,880
 Like, do you mean like, why there?

182
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
 Or what?

183
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
 Why do they need to store?

184
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,440
 Oh, because they don't have time without food and...

185
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,620
 Well, in actual fact, it's not because they evolved in the desert, it's because they evolved

186
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
 in the Arctic.

187
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
 Oh.

188
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,000
 So camels evolved in really cold conditions and they evolved the humps and then eventually

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,320
 they migrated down into hotter areas and it turned out that they were brilliant for that

190
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 condition as well.

191
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
 That's so good.

192
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
 And that's where they ended up.

193
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
 Beautiful.

194
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
 Yeah.

195
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,880
 Although, like the Americas is where camels first evolved.

196
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
 The former Americas, yeah.

197
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
 Originally, yeah.

198
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
 And what...

199
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,560
 There used to be mega camels, like four meters high at the shoulder.

200
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,080
 There used to be gigantic camels roaming the earth.

201
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
 Yeah.

202
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 How long ago?

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,120
 Like at the time when everything was massive.

204
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,360
 Before there were humans in the Americas, I think, right?

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
 Yes.

206
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
 I think so.

207
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
 Certainly tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of years.

208
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
 I've got another old camel fat.

209
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,160
 I feel like they're very versatile because the earliest stone camel apparently called

210
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,120
 Protylopus that did North America 40 to 50 million years ago.

211
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
 That was the size of a rabbit.

212
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
 Oh.

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
 The size of a little rabbit.

214
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
 That's amazing.

215
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
 The rabbit is the size of a rabbit.

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
 They were the size of a rabbit.

217
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
 They were massive.

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,720
 So they were really small and then went really big and then went really small.

219
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
 Yeah.

220
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 Well, they sort of found a middle ground today.

221
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 Yeah, they did.

222
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 They found a range.

223
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 That's very cool.

224
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 Do you want to hear a couple of camel proverbs?

225
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 Oh, okay.

226
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
 These are good.

227
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
 These are from the Middle East.

228
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
 Here's one.

229
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,760
 "Egg will steal a camel."

230
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,440
 Is that what they have at the start of their DVDs?

231
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,560
 You wouldn't steal an egg.

232
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,560
 What does that mean?

233
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
 I suck with proverbs.

234
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
 What does that mean?

235
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,640
 It means if I was disautistic enough to do something small against you, then don't trust

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,320
 me because I'll do something even worse against you.

237
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 Exactly.

238
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,880
 Here's another one that's slightly harder to get.

239
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
 The door is big enough for a camel to pass through.

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
 Well, that's in the Bible.

241
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
 See you.

242
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
 No, that's about the rich man getting into hell.

243
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
 I haven't.

244
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
 I haven't.

245
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,260
 Easy and then a camel to get through the high of an eagle.

246
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,760
 For a rich man to get through.

247
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,840
 No, this is just the door is big enough for a camel to pass through.

248
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
 It's big door.

249
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
 Big old door.

250
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
 That's right.

251
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
 Big door.

252
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
 Which size camel are we talking about?

253
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
 Is this like a rabbit flap?

254
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
 Yeah, it's a rabbit flap.

255
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
 It's more small.

256
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
 It's a nice saying, actually.

257
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,760
 Oh, everyone's welcome.

258
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,280
 It's actually the opposite of that.

259
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
 It's feel free to leave.

260
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,080
 You know, you're not interested.

261
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
 The door is big enough for a camel to pass through.

262
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
 There's nothing keeping you here.

263
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
 Wow.

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
 That's not a good phrase.

265
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
 That is a good phrase.

266
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,560
 Did you see camels recently, Sophie?

267
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,560
 I did see camels recently because I went to the desert.

268
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
 Yeah.

269
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 And it falls out.

270
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,440
 They're all over the shop.

271
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,440
 I was chilling, though, not literally because it was so hot and dry with the Bedouin.

272
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,720
 Oh, cool.

273
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
 Yeah.

274
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,720
 And Bedouin people and other pastoralist people, like their camels are, they're a big

275
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 deal.

276
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
 They love their camels.

277
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,320
 There's actually a, I want to say, like a folkloric tradition of song called the Alhuda, whereas

278
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,720
 part of a journey you sing to entertain primarily the camel.

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
 Cool.

280
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
 So it's...

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
 My horns.

282
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 My horns.

283
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
 It's just that.

284
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,920
 There's a lot of, a lot of Fergie's back catalog talking about, but yeah, I really like

285
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
 that.

286
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,320
 And Alhuda has been adopted on the UNESCO Intangible Heritage List.

287
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 Oh, cool.

288
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 That's cool.

289
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 That's really cool.

290
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
 That's lovely.

291
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 Did you sing it to the camels?

292
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 I didn't sing, I didn't sing to the camels.

293
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,480
 I sort of was like, I sort of looked at them respectfully, but did not ride a camel.

294
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
 Oh, you didn't ride?

295
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
 I didn't ride a camel.

296
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 It's fun.

297
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
 I've ridden a camel.

298
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
 Oh, but are you supposed to these days?

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
 Yeah.

300
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
 Are you?

301
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 It's absolutely fine.

302
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
 It's cool to ride camels.

303
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
 Okay.

304
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,280
 Well, I mean, Sophie's been near a camel more recently than me, so there might be more

305
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 recent data.

306
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,080
 When I was doing it, it was absolutely...

307
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
 Where did you do it?

308
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
 Dubai.

309
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
 Nice.

310
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
 When I was, I was tiny.

311
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,320
 And the weird thing is when they, because they kneel down, they fold their legs so

312
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,880
 efficiently under themselves, and then you get on and then they stand up.

313
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 Yeah, yeah.

314
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,040
 But that means they have this mad, they tilt back crazily as one set of legs gets up, and

315
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,920
 then they tilt back the other way as the other set of legs gets up, and then eventually

316
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,160
 you're, you're flat.

317
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
 But it's...

318
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,640
 Also, they are so important for so much more than being ridden.

319
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
 Yeah.

320
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,840
 So much more than a great ride.

321
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,820
 I think like camel milk in Jordan, the Mansaf, like it's like a dish with camel milk is one

322
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,240
 of the, what was the national dish of Jordan, and it's meant to have like so many different

323
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
 heaving properties.

324
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
 Did you try it?

325
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,740
 I did try Mansaf.

326
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
 Oh, yeah.

327
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
 It was, it was good.

328
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
 Yeah.

329
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
 It was like a bit tough.

330
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,240
 You're saying, right, you didn't like it at all.

331
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
 I loved it.

332
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
 I loved it.

333
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
 I just liked mixing them a lot.

334
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,840
 I wouldn't want undiluted camel milk, but that's because I'm a baby raised on, raised

335
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,160
 on cow, but now very much transition to oat and almond.

336
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,640
 Here's the thing camels can do.

337
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
 This is great.

338
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,580
 They can move the two halves of their top lip left and right independently of each other.

339
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,580
 Oh, okay.

340
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
 How cool is that?

341
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
 Oh, that's fun.

342
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
 Because you can picture a camel's face.

343
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,620
 It has that kind of, you know, gap in the middle at the top of their lip and they can

344
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
 move them.

345
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,220
 So like how many people do that really fun eyebrow thing where they raise one eyebrow.

346
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,220
 They've got the lip equivalent.

347
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
 Yeah.

348
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
 Exactly.

349
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
 That's so cool.

350
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
 There must be a look in the camel world that they give when they're like.

351
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,460
 You can signal that you're not really into it if you're kissing someone, but they're

352
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,940
 only using half your mouth.

353
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,160
 That's how you can, you know.

354
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
 Yeah.

355
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,260
 I feel like they're like their inherent eroticism and also, um, like I think a lot of stuff

356
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,760
 about the physicality of camels is probably why they've not yet been given the Pixar treatment.

357
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
 They're too earthy.

358
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
 They're too bawdy.

359
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
 Yeah.

360
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
 They're too like, they're just really off the sand.

361
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
 They're sex pests.

362
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
 They're sex pests.

363
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
 Yeah.

364
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,240
 But like even they're, um, one of the factors that they, they're urine has been used in

365
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
 like certain like traditions.

366
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
 Yeah.

367
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
 People drink their urine, use them as medicines.

368
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,860
 There's not a whole lot of scientific evidence I found that proves that that it's a good

369
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
 idea.

370
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
 No.

371
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
 It's like super concentrated.

372
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,960
 God, Sophie, how did your meeting with Pixar go?

373
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,200
 Oh my God, no you don't understand.

374
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,680
 He drinks the urine and then it's super concentrated.

375
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,240
 That's the way it works.

376
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
 Yeah.

377
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
 Yeah.

378
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,480
 So there's like, there's a traditional thing of drinking cow urine in India, for instance,

379
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
 right?

380
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
 But they do think that because camels, they don't have as much water in their body that

381
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,800
 it is more concentrated and whatever good stuff is in cow urine, it's even better.

382
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
 In camel urine.

383
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
 That's the idea.

384
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
 Oh, right.

385
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
 Do you think that's true?

386
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,740
 Do we, does what I said is true whether it's good for you.

387
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
 I think perhaps.

388
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
 It feels strong.

389
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
 It feels like stuff.

390
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
 Yeah.

391
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
 Yeah.

392
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
 I think not.

393
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,020
 Is that where the milk is so tart because it's because they, it's not very tart.

394
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
 Okay.

395
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,860
 I don't want to, I don't want to offend the camels of Jordan.

396
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,900
 It was just a bit, it was different.

397
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:02,660
 I actually think that goat milk is, it's probably as weird, no offense to as goat milk.

398
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,400
 Because goat milk tastes a bit goatee, doesn't it?

399
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,720
 Does it, can you get a bit of camel taste in it or not?

400
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,160
 I think I've not done a comparative study.

401
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
 It was sort of a malty.

402
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
 Right.

403
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
 Okay.

404
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
 I mean, it's all milk malty.

405
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
 Is that the point of malt?

406
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 No.

407
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
 It was maltyer than milk.

408
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
 Like oval tea.

409
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
 Especially malty.

410
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,320
 I just, I just actually had my first oval tea.

411
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 Bullshit.

412
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,040
 You have oval tea every night, Andy.

413
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
 There's no doubt about that.

414
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
 Let me finish.

415
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,960
 I finished my first jar of oval tea in a while.

416
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
 Really?

417
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,160
 The first jar of the year.

418
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,660
 I hadn't had it for years and years and years, then my wife said, "Oh, I've never had it."

419
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,860
 And I said, "What you said to me, Jensen, I said, 'Bullshit, like you can't, I can't

420
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,860
 believe you've never had it.'"

421
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
 So I rushed out.

422
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
 I thought to myself.

423
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
 What time did this?

424
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
 Went to your dealer.

425
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
 I went to the all night shop.

426
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
 It was two in the morning.

427
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
 I got a jar.

428
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,860
 Anyway, for the last three weeks, I've been trying to push oval tea in my wife who actually

429
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,640
 doesn't like the taste of oval tea.

430
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
 Yeah.

431
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,760
 Anyway, I got a quick Camel quiz.

432
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
 Camel's got a lot of this story.

433
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
 Camel quiz.

434
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
 Get stuff.

435
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:13,240
 I just wanted to sort of part one, part two to break it up, it's so good.

436
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
 Quick Camel quiz.

437
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
 Yes, brilliant.

438
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
 Three.

439
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
 Okay.

440
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,080
 So why should you not, if you're in the desert, step into Camel Dung?

441
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,360
 Well, I mean, for the get some of your shoes.

442
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
 Yeah.

443
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,180
 That is also a correct answer, even though that's not the one I have on my sheet.

444
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,760
 Smells bad, bad vibes.

445
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,700
 Oh, you might injure some of these smaller life forms which rely on it as a, as a biome.

446
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,920
 You know, don't dung beetles and stag beetles, they use it.

447
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,640
 I was thinking perhaps similarly, but maybe it's like some poisonous animals live in it.

448
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
 Yeah.

449
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
 Who might bite your feet.

450
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
 Lovely.

451
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,640
 I thought it's so toxic that it would melt your foot off at the bone.

452
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
 Yeah.

453
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
 That's good.

454
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
 Yeah.

455
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
 Yeah.

456
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
 I mean, these are probably all correct.

457
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,440
 Maybe Sophie's one a bit lesser, but maybe the rest of them.

458
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,080
 This is, I mean, it's a stretch, my answer.

459
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,840
 I'm just making a fun quiz here, but you don't want to do it because you might explode entirely.

460
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
 Right.

461
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,000
 And that is because during the Second World War, the German tanks, if they saw a camel

462
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
 dung would roll over it.

463
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,920
 It was seen as a sort of good lunch on the allies heard about this.

464
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,600
 And so what they started doing was making camel dung landmines.

465
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,760
 So they looked the facade of it on top and so that would lower.

466
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,680
 So like we know that bombs still exist, you know, in the basement, so, you know, we're

467
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,880
 always finding unexploded World War Two bombs.

468
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,720
 There's probably camel dung landmines still out there in the desert waiting.

469
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
 That's where we're in.

470
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 There you go.

471
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
 Gosh.

472
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:48,240
 I'm very next to have the urge to jump into a pile of shit at this point.

473
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
 Okay.

474
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,520
 It is time for fact number two.

475
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,800
 And that is my fact.

476
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,640
 My fact this week is that the first woman to ever direct a film was a guy.

477
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:04,880
 I was recently sitting on a plane and we were about to do fact picking and I desperately

478
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,600
 needed like one killer fact.

479
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
 And I was like, how am I going to find it?

480
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
 Plains about to take off.

481
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,720
 And on the screen in front of me was the in flight entertainment and there was a documentary

482
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,040
 called Alice Guy, the first female filmmaker and I thought, wow, that's, that's really

483
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
 exciting.

484
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,520
 I have no idea who this person is.

485
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,520
 And B, it turns out that she's extraordinary.

486
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,400
 Turns out that this is one of the most seminal filmmakers of our time.

487
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,480
 The innovation that she created is something that means she should be held up there with

488
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,840
 like the Lumiere brothers up there with the Spielbergs, the Scorsese.

489
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,320
 This is someone whose name should be a household name and no one virtually knows who she is.

490
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
 Well, first of all, was she French?

491
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
 She was French.

492
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
 Yeah.

493
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
 So would she pronounce it Guy?

494
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
 Yeah.

495
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,840
 So Alice Guy would probably be her name and and she had a second surname, which was her

496
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,320
 husband's surname that she took on.

497
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,400
 So it was Alice Guy Blush Blanchet Blanchet, I think.

498
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 Blanchet.

499
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
 So hang on.

500
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,600
 What's the fact again in the light of these?

501
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,280
 But she not only was the first female director, but she was the first female director for

502
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
 about a decade.

503
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,240
 Like she just really only field was a period where obviously men were just saying, you're

504
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,400
 not capable of doing this.

505
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,840
 She's also acknowledged as possibly being one of the first two people to pioneer the

506
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,760
 idea of narrative filmmaking as well.

507
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,120
 Up until this point, everything was just sort of showing a train pulling in the station

508
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,480
 or people walking out of a factory where she gave it a story and she turned it into a

509
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
 narrative.

510
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
 So yeah, hugely important.

511
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
 Very cool.

512
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 Yeah.

513
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,640
 She lived until she was 94, which was 1968 that she died.

514
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,920
 And I think by that time, only about three of her films were still available.

515
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,800
 She made a thousand or was involved in a thousand, you know, directing, producing, supervising.

516
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,800
 And I think a lot more have been made available since she died or they just rediscovered.

517
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,600
 We keep finding them.

518
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 Yeah.

519
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 Yeah, it's amazing.

520
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,960
 She was when the Lumiere's made the first ever film.

521
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,240
 This was in 1895.

522
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,200
 She was in the room when that happened, as in there was a private showing and her boss,

523
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,280
 who's a guy called Gaumont, was invited because they thought that Gaumont might want to buy

524
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,560
 the equipment and kind of sell it on to people.

525
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,640
 And he was quite interested because he thought people would buy it so they could make videos

526
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,720
 of their children.

527
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,080
 That's what he thought this new technology would be of motion pictures.

528
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,240
 And he was right.

529
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
 Yeah.

530
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,320
 So he did buy some of these cameras and then he allowed Alice Guy to use them because he

531
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,600
 thought it was just like a toy.

532
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 It was just like, you know, he didn't really take it that seriously.

533
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,440
 So he just let her do it and then suddenly she became the biggest, you know, the biggest

534
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
 deal in filmmaking.

535
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
 Yeah.

536
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,000
 And her first movie, there's a few variations on the title, but one of the English translations

537
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,880
 is The Cabbage Fairy.

538
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,280
 And it's basically a narrative about how babies are born through cabbage patches.

539
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,320
 And we had an episode with Beck Hillog where we were trying to work out when did anyone

540
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,840
 think you were born from a cabbage patch to talk about the Cabbage Patch Kids.

541
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
 Oh my God.

542
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
 This goes all the way back.

543
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
 And the Cabbage Patch Kids.

544
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
 Yeah.

545
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
 And she's partly responsible for the Cabbage Patch Kids.

546
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
 It's amazing.

547
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
 You look like you have Cabbage Patch Kids.

548
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
 I don't know.

549
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
 They're scary.

550
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
 I don't like them.

551
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,600
 But I do love talking about France.

552
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,680
 And the folklore is that boys are born from cabbages, but girls are born from roses.

553
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
 Right.

554
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
 And I don't want to be so...

555
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
 Still to this day.

556
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
 That's the thing.

557
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
 Still to this day.

558
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
 That's how French people are born.

559
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,280
 There are claims that she invented the music video, which I like.

560
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,400
 I think a pretty early prototypical form of it, because she used to think of Chronophone

561
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,520
 in 1905, which is where you filmed the singer's lip syncing, and then you'd play a pre-recorded

562
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,200
 track simultaneously with it.

563
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
 Yeah.

564
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,000
 But also, I mean, the list kind of goes on and on for what she innovated in the world

565
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 of film.

566
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,560
 So we've got the first narrative movies.

567
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,760
 We've got the first movies where gender roles were swapped and they showed men at home sewing

568
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,080
 and doing the housework, and the women actually going off and being actually, you know, big

569
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
 business jobs and so on, which was...

570
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,160
 Wasn't that in the year 2000?

571
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
 That was the...

572
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
 I think the name of that film.

573
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,600
 It was the first gender roles.

574
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 Right.

575
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 That's brilliant.

576
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,760
 She did the first All African-American film.

577
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,920
 No one had done that to that point.

578
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,160
 That was 1912, a fool in his money.

579
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,720
 Apparently, it was a bit sort of behind, though, in terms of the racial politics of the time.

580
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,440
 But it was the first time African-Americans were cast into films, entirely in a film.

581
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,240
 So she did so many things that were just unbelievably forward-thinking.

582
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
 Yeah.

583
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,360
 And this is right at the beginning of filming the first Fast and Furious film.

584
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
 Yeah.

585
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
 That's right.

586
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
 Yeah.

587
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
 Yeah.

588
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
 Yeah.

589
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
 Yeah.

590
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
 Yeah.

591
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
 With a young Vin Diesel.

592
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
 Yeah.

593
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 It's pronounced Van.

594
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,600
 On the fool in his money, it was another one of her works that was considered lost for

595
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,000
 ages, and then it was found in a flea market in Stockton, California.

596
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Wow.

597
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
 So she's left like little Easter eggs.

598
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
 I mean, maybe not deliberately.

599
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
 Right, yeah.

600
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,800
 But she's got her finger into loads of cinematic pies.

601
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,840
 I do like the sound of her masterpiece, The Life of Christ.

602
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 Yeah.

603
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
 Sounds good.

604
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,760
 So there's a huge, like huge film, 35 Minutes Long, which at the time was an epic Lord of

605
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
 the Rings style.

606
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
 Yeah.

607
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
 So 35 Minutes Long, right?

608
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,960
 Do you think people after 20 minutes were going, "Oh, for fuck's sake, I'm glad those

609
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,960
 were exploding everywhere?"

610
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,120
 But that's, I think, for a film that was 35 minutes long in total.

611
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,560
 And again, 1906, so incredibly early film days.

612
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,200
 It had 25 different sets for a 35-minute film and 300 extras.

613
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,080
 The 300 extras is, you know, if you're filming a scene where there's a big crowd.

614
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
 Sure.

615
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,920
 But at the time, it was impressive stuff, I guess.

616
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
 Yeah, definitely.

617
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,080
 They had the first-ever pan shot, didn't they?

618
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
 Really?

619
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,160
 So she kind of panned across these 300 people.

620
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
 People must have freaked out.

621
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
 I know.

622
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
 What's happening?

623
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,000
 Well, you know that thing about the train.

624
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,800
 So I think we've mentioned this once before on this show, which is that one of the earliest

625
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,200
 films was, was it the Lumiere's?

626
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
 Or was it?

627
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
 Yeah, it was.

628
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,840
 It was a train arriving at some gah.

629
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,520
 It was a French coastal tower called La Ciutat.

630
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,060
 And it was one shot, 50 seconds, and the urban legend is that people freaked out and ran

631
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,680
 to the back of the room because they were so perturbed at the train coming towards them.

632
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,400
 And there aren't actually contemporary sources.

633
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,640
 And also the train is coming in diagonally.

634
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,600
 So it doesn't look like it's going to burst into the room.

635
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,520
 But I think I buy it, actually, and I'm saying about it, despite there being no evidence

636
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
 contemporary that it actually happened.

637
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,440
 But people react to films, people shout at, you know, all people shout in a big way at

638
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
 the cinema.

639
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 Yeah.

640
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
 Yeah.

641
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,600
 Well, there's a big, there's a big trend going on at the moment on, it's either Instagram

642
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 or TikTok.

643
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,680
 I've seen the video where you expect something to happen and the person filming it tricks

644
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,880
 you by throwing the object at the camera.

645
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,920
 And I probably went, whoa, so you can produce that effect.

646
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 Right.

647
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 So I buy it as well.

648
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
 Yeah.

649
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
 Yeah.

650
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
 I buy it three.

651
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
 Okay.

652
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
 No, I don't buy it at all.

653
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
 It's a bullshit.

654
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,600
 I think it's classic of, isn't it funny how these people in the past were more stupid

655
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
 than us that they would fall for this kind of thing?

656
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Yeah.

657
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Well.

658
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I also have no evidence.

659
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 I think you are probably right.

660
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
 I was reading about Florence Lawrence.

661
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,280
 What's so funny about Florence Lawrence?

662
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
 Nothing.

663
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
 Nothing at all.

664
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 First ever movie star, maybe.

665
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
 Really?

666
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
 Yeah.

667
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,120
 So she was making very early films, but she insisted that her name be on the credits.

668
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 Okay.

669
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
 Because in those days, it would just be actors and you wouldn't say who was in it.

670
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,200
 And she became quite well known.

671
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,880
 And so she could insist that her name would be on there.

672
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,920
 And she was, she was originally vaudeville.

673
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,600
 She was known as baby flow, the child wonder whistler.

674
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,760
 So she would go on stage with her mom and she would be an amazing at whistling.

675
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 Really?

676
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
 Yeah.

677
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,800
 And she also was one of the first people to own a car.

678
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:01,520
 And she invented the indicator on a car and the stop breaking lights on a car.

679
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
 Oh, the lights.

680
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
 Okay.

681
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
 Break.

682
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
 Yeah.

683
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
 Everyone before then.

684
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
 They were all still driving around.

685
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 They were like, what are we going to do?

686
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
 It was like speed.

687
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
 It was like very, very slow.

688
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
 And they're all going at 10 miles an hour.

689
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
 So it's fine.

690
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
 Yeah.

691
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
 It was slightly different.

692
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,320
 So her indicator was like the shape of an arm.

693
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,600
 And she would press a button and the arm would sort of wave to the side that she was

694
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
 going to go.

695
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 More fun.

696
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
 Much more fun.

697
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,440
 And then the stop sign would be like a arm coming out going, I'm going to stop.

698
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
 I'm going to stop.

699
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
 Wow.

700
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
 At the back of the car.

701
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
 That's so cool.

702
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
 It's clever, isn't it?

703
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
 But yeah.

704
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
 And she was like the first film star as well.

705
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
 What a pivot in her career.

706
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
 Yeah.

707
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
 Cool.

708
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,580
 The thing about her back to A Guy is that I love that she was so active in trying to

709
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,840
 scout for the locations that she would put herself into weird situations.

710
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,040
 So she was almost like an immersive documentary maker at the same time.

711
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,760
 She'd go to Orphanages and she would integrate herself there and she would go to…

712
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
 No way.

713
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
 No way.

714
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
 No way.

715
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 She was a child.

716
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,720
 I imagine Daniel Day-Lewis turns into an orphanage.

717
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,440
 Pretend I'm not here, guys.

718
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,480
 Daniel Day-Lewis in his little red wig.

719
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,920
 Yeah, no, sorry, that's the wrong term, but like she would go to Opium Parlor.

720
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
 She would go to…

721
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
 Okay.

722
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,000
 She would go to prisons.

723
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 She would…

724
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 She was invited to watch…

725
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 In the hall there.

726
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 In the hall there.

727
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 In the hall there.

728
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Actually, yeah.

729
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It does sound just like a wild night, actually.

730
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,520
 A crazy night last night when I came in at Orphanage.

731
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,520
 But yeah.

732
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
 That does sound cool.

733
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
 Yeah.

734
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
 And I quite like that she used to have a sign on her…

735
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,120
 So kind of like in Ted Lasso where Belive was up on the wall.

736
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,160
 She used to have a sign up on all of her sets, which was Be Natural and The Idea for Actors

737
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
 and so on.

738
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,640
 I mean, another innovation of sort of like, you know, let's just make this look like

739
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
 a normal thing.

740
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,720
 Oh, just so cool, yeah.

741
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
 I think she's cool.

742
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,600
 And the fact about people that she possibly might have inspired, because like we talked

743
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
 about her fooling us money.

744
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 Maybe not the…

745
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 Yeah.

746
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,880
 Not a film that would translate today but had the first all African-American cast.

747
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 Yeah.

748
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
 So that was in 1912.

749
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,880
 And in 1919, Oscar Michaud, who's like considered to be the first African-American filmmaker,

750
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,440
 he made his first film.

751
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,120
 So like that's a whole like seven years beforehand.

752
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
 Yeah.

753
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:24,040
 Also, I think one of the first female African-American directors, Maria P. Williams, worked on the

754
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
 Flames of Roth.

755
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,080
 But she, okay, so this is how she died.

756
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,680
 I'm bringing it up because it's very mysterious.

757
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
 Okay.

758
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,960
 So she produced and wrote in this film in the same year her husband died and she went

759
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,760
 on to marry another man.

760
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,080
 And then she died in 1932.

761
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,320
 This is Maria P. Williams after being called away from her home by a stranger who requested

762
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,680
 help for his ill brother and then was found shot to death on the side of a road several

763
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
 miles from her home.

764
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
 Oh my god.

765
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,200
 The murder remains unsolved.

766
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,560
 Ironically, the plot for Flames of Roth concerns the investigation of a murder after a robbery.

767
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
 Wow.

768
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
 That is interesting.

769
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,360
 How do you solve a problem like Maria P. Williams?

770
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,360
 Just one weird thing off the back of Maria P. Williams.

771
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
 Oh yeah.

772
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:17,360
 So the guy who invented the film camera, Louis Le Prince, French guy, moved to Leeds and

773
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,760
 created the film camera five years before anyone else did.

774
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
 So he was pre-Lumiere brothers.

775
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
 He was pre-everybody basically.

776
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
 Oh wow.

777
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
 He made a working film camera.

778
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,000
 He made some films in round-tail Leeds and then he disappeared.

779
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Really?

780
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,640
 And we have no idea what happened to him either.

781
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
 He may have been bumped off.

782
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,280
 There is a kind of lurid theory that Edison had him knocked off, which I don't think

783
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
 I believe.

784
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
 Really?

785
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,480
 But he was first by years as well.

786
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
 Louis Le Prince.

787
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
 Yeah.

788
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
 In Leeds.

789
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
 Yeah.

790
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 Yeah.

791
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
 He's got such a sexy name and then it's like...

792
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,480
 Not that Leeds makes it less sexy but it's sort of like...

793
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
 It sort of changes the vibe.

794
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,360
 Leeds is a very sexy place, isn't it?

795
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
 Is it?

796
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,040
 I went on a mini-walking tour of Leeds after our last show there.

797
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
 Yeah.

798
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
 Walk up in an orphanage.

799
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,320
 It's either one who...there was one who kind of got on a train and then they never saw

800
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
 them again.

801
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
 It's that one.

802
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 Another filmmaker.

803
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
 I think it's this guy.

804
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
 Is it?

805
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
 Yeah.

806
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,240
 I didn't write down how he went missing but yeah.

807
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,920
 When you're on a film set they call it a shoot.

808
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
 Coincidence.

809
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
 Oh yeah.

810
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,680
 I thought a long time before saying that and I think it's better than I did.

811
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
 No need for doubt that.

812
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,920
 Can I give you a quick quiz before we move on?

813
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
 Yeah.

814
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
 Raquel Welsh.

815
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
 Yes.

816
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,640
 The actor has a world record.

817
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,280
 She's done something 15 times that no one else has done 15 times.

818
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
 Raquel Welsh who just died.

819
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
 Yeah.

820
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,520
 Raquel Welsh of the third bikini from One Million Years BC.

821
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
 Yeah.

822
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
 The very same.

823
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
 She's done something 15 times.

824
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
 Yeah.

825
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
 Is it a film?

826
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
 Is it a film related record?

827
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,160
 A female film actor related thing.

828
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:59,760
 She was the first female film actor to refuse to answer questions on her fur bikini 15 times.

829
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
 I don't know.

830
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,920
 The start of that sentence she runs such a good run there selfie and then it went wrong

831
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
 at the end.

832
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
 I'm not familiar with Raquel Welsh.

833
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
 No.

834
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
 15 times.

835
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,320
 Did she play the same person 15 times?

836
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 No she didn't.

837
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,360
 She did the same action 15 times in different movies.

838
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
 A gesture.

839
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,360
 A V-sign.

840
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
 V-sign.

841
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 It was a horrible thing with it.

842
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
 Oh that's good.

843
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
 Yeah.

844
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
 Stop it.

845
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
 Like a MGM roar?

846
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
 Did she do a sort of...

847
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
 That was her.

848
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
 No.

849
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
 That was a lion.

850
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
 A gesture.

851
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
 A tiger actually.

852
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
 A tiger.

853
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 Sorry.

854
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
 The chicken dance.

855
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
 The fist.

856
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
 No.

857
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
 She did the YMC at No.

858
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
 That's good.

859
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,360
 I feel like we're going to hear a long time.

860
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
 A gesture.

861
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,560
 Did she change the spelling of her name 15 times?

862
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
 No.

863
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,040
 She holds the world record for kicking a male character in the balls in a movie.

864
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 Wow.

865
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
 With 15.

866
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
 Wow.

867
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
 Isn't that great?

868
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
 That is an incredible fact.

869
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,200
 Do we know who's the kicky?

870
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,760
 It was a different kicky each time.

871
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
 Oh.

872
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
 Yeah.

873
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
 So it's a different movie.

874
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
 She was almost like her catchphrase.

875
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
 Oh that's her signature move.

876
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
 That's great.

877
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,760
 God that'd be terrible when you're sort of going, "Oh that's one exciting move.

878
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
 Who's my co-lead?"

879
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
 Fuck.

880
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:15,880
 Okay it is time for fact number three and that is...

881
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
 Andy.

882
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,920
 My fact is that half of American men are confident they could safely land a plane if the pilot

883
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,960
 was incapacitated.

884
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
 That's reassuring.

885
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
 It is isn't it?

886
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,580
 As long as two American men are on your flight, one of them will be fine to do it.

887
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,580
 Brilliant.

888
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
 Yeah.

889
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,580
 That's funny.

890
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
 This is a survey that you've conducted.

891
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
 There are 20,000 adults.

892
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,460
 I think adults all in America, whether they would be quite confident, very confident,

893
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,640
 not confident, not at all confident, or they didn't know whether they would be able to

894
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,060
 land a plane and I think overall it was a third of people who said they could do it

895
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:57,800
 and 46% of men, 20% of women, so buck up, you know, and also they specified a couple of

896
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
 things.

897
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,200
 They specified you get help from air traffic control and things like that.

898
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,440
 So you're not just totally in the cockpit by yourself because obviously that would be

899
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
 incredibly terrifying.

900
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
 Yeah.

901
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,760
 And young people also more confident than older people, people between 18 and 44, again

902
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,940
 nearly half of them think, yeah, I could do that.

903
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
 Yeah.

904
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,200
 Those over 45, less sure of themselves.

905
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
 Yeah.

906
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,080
 So let's do a little survey around here.

907
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
 Sophie, do you think you could?

908
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,400
 Do I think I could land a plane?

909
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 Land a plane.

910
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
 You've got a headset on?

911
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
 You've got a headset on.

912
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
 You know.

913
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
 Okay.

914
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
 Yeah, I'm getting into it.

915
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
 I've got a headset on.

916
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
 I've got my headset on.

917
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 Can't find it's there.

918
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
 No.

919
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
 Absolutely not.

920
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
 They're all dead.

921
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
 No.

922
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,640
 In my scenario, they've just been knocked out.

923
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,600
 They've just had some dodgy fish, right?

924
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
 Exactly.

925
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
 Yeah.

926
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
 They're awake.

927
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
 They're just a bit, they're feeling a bit queasy.

928
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
 So they decided to knock off shit.

929
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
 Okay.

930
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,420
 In my one, I look at the pilots and one is Maria, the filmmaker, and the other is the

931
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
 Leedsman.

932
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
 La France.

933
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
 La France.

934
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
 Yeah.

935
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,400
 I think I could land a plane.

936
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
 Okay.

937
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
 Okay.

938
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
 That's good to hear.

939
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
 Okay.

940
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
 Good.

941
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
 Good.

942
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
 That wasn't a test.

943
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,400
 I think I could, but I would do it extremely reluctantly.

944
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
 Yeah.

945
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,200
 That's what the passengers want to hear over the next time, isn't it?

946
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,400
 I don't really want to, but we'll be landing in the next 15 minutes.

947
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
 Yeah.

948
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
 One way or another.

949
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 That's exciting.

950
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
 Okay.

951
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
 Andy.

952
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
 I think I probably couldn't actually.

953
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
 Couldn't.

954
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 Couldn't.

955
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,080
 I mean, I would, I would give it my best shot, but I think that moment where the ground comes

956
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,800
 up really quite fast, where you're landing and you're going very, very far.

957
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,400
 It's going over a hundred miles an hour.

958
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,680
 I think it would be very hard.

959
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
 Yeah.

960
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,680
 I'm not saying it would clap for me.

961
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
 I'm just saying.

962
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,400
 I think technically I couldn't, but I mentally, I would say yes to trying it because I think

963
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 this is the thing.

964
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,120
 You need someone to keep it to go.

965
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,320
 Someone's got to try and do it.

966
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,220
 And I think if I was put in that position, I would say, okay, yeah, I'll give it a go.

967
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,720
 I'm going to have assistance.

968
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
 Yeah.

969
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
 Yeah.

970
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
 I can't, I don't think I can do it.

971
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,160
 So my wife's a helicopter pilot and I think I've said on here before that she says that

972
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,160
 I'd have about 50, 50 chance of landing a helicopter, having watched her do it.

973
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,480
 So I know what she's doing.

974
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,840
 But having spoken to some commercial pilots, because we talked about this on QI, I don't

975
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
 think I will be able to do it.

976
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
 It is hard.

977
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,920
 If you're in the, if you're in the situation, we should say, yeah, the most important thing

978
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,680
 to do is find the headset, put it on and find the emergency frequency because they didn't

979
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
 monitor that.

980
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,720
 Also, if you're speaking to someone, take your finger off the button when you finish

981
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
 speaking.

982
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
 Otherwise, no more here.

983
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
 They can't get back to you.

984
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
 Yeah.

985
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,880
 But that was the funniest thing about this whole, this whole survey is that when they

986
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,720
 talk to pilots about it, I think in your head, you think, yeah, I'll just open the door,

987
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
 put on the headset.

988
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
 It's all going to be fine.

989
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,040
 They're like, you won't even get past the headset moment in trying to land this plane.

990
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,920
 You won't even get past the door in much, but I mean, they've obviously got very secure

991
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
 cockpits.

992
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,840
 When I asked my wife about this, because like I say, she is a pilot that she literally

993
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,800
 said exactly what they say on these things.

994
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,500
 She was like, well, like, will I be able to tell what the headset is?

995
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,040
 That's the first thing she said.

996
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,240
 It's weird because you would think it would just be there.

997
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
 Right?

998
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,800
 You know, it's like when you can't find your earphones and you're like, you're busy and

999
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
 you're heading out.

1000
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
 Yeah.

1001
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
 They actually have tried this as well.

1002
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
 They've tried this.

1003
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,920
 A study New Zealand's University of Waikato asked 780 people if they could land a small

1004
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,520
 plane quotes without dying or as well as a pilot could.

1005
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
 Yeah.

1006
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
 Yeah.

1007
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
 And so this is really interesting.

1008
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,600
 Some of them got shown a four minute video of pilots landing a plane, right?

1009
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,920
 But the video didn't show the pilot's hands.

1010
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,480
 So actually it was a useless video in terms of actually learning how to land a plane.

1011
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
 Totally useless.

1012
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
 Right?

1013
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,840
 But people who had seen the video were more confident in their abilities than people who

1014
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,620
 hadn't seen the video.

1015
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,680
 It's called a rapid illusion.

1016
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,880
 You see someone doing something and you think, yeah, I, yeah, okay, I broadly understand

1017
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
 how that works.

1018
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
 Yeah.

1019
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
 Yeah.

1020
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
 Actually you don't.

1021
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
 Here's the other thing.

1022
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
 This is impenetrable door.

1023
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
 Well done.

1024
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
 Stage one done.

1025
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,120
 You found the headphones.

1026
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,760
 You've somehow worked out the emergency frequency of 121.5.

1027
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
 Yeah.

1028
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,880
 We've worked out to take your finger off the buttons so that you could hear them.

1029
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,640
 Surely you're on your home stretch.

1030
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,280
 You know, you're coming in, but then they make the point you're talking to an air traffic

1031
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
 controller.

1032
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,520
 He doesn't know how to land a plane.

1033
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,920
 They're just telling you that the space is free.

1034
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
 Yeah.

1035
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
 Come on down.

1036
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
 You're fine.

1037
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,720
 So there's been cases where in the past people have had to have guidance to be

1038
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,360
 landed by an air controller and they've had to go, hang on, let me go find someone who

1039
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,160
 knows how to land a plane and have to go and bring them and help them get guided down.

1040
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,640
 I really dislike that this is how a plane is, is, is landed.

1041
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
 Yeah.

1042
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,560
 I really would have thought by now it was basically completely automated.

1043
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
 There was no skill.

1044
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
 Yeah.

1045
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,480
 Well, the thing is they do have auto land.

1046
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,360
 So an airplane does have auto land, but you need to program stuff into it.

1047
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,440
 So you need to program in how fast you're coming in, what direction you're coming in

1048
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,600
 from and you still have to click when you want your flaps to come down, whatever that

1049
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
 means.

1050
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
 Yeah.

1051
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,720
 And also when you want your landing gear to come down, whatever that, no, I know what

1052
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
 that means.

1053
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,280
 And they need to be done at exact moments and you need to know when that is.

1054
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,800
 So even though you have auto land, you still need to do stuff.

1055
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
 Yeah.

1056
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,280
 And it's, and then on top of that, even if you, if you're on a, let's say a Boeing

1057
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,840
 big airplane and we need a pilot to land this, you need to know what your plane is.

1058
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,560
 It's like going into a different kind of car.

1059
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,800
 You can't just like, you can't just.

1060
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,440
 I think it's even more complicated than that.

1061
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,760
 I think what I mean is I can get into a higher car and I'm fine.

1062
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,560
 I don't need to brag.

1063
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,560
 Do you go into the higher car and go, do you have a Ford Fiesta cause that's all I can

1064
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
 drive.

1065
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
 It's all a qualified.

1066
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,400
 Um, no, I guess the point is, is that you need to, with a plane, you, it, you absolutely

1067
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,240
 need to know how to land a Boeing plane versus a biplane.

1068
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,240
 I think it's never happened with a big commercial passenger plane.

1069
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
 Yeah.

1070
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,000
 I don't think a situation's ever come up because often, I mean, like loads of flights

1071
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,720
 have pilots who are flying as passengers that they call them deadhead crew.

1072
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,840
 And they just, you know, but it has happened once or twice, uh, in 2009, there was a pilot

1073
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,380
 who was flying from Florida to Mississippi and the pilot died and the passenger, Doug

1074
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,240
 White was on board with his family, family of four, and he had a private pilot certificate,

1075
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,280
 although he wasn't familiar with the plane, but he did manage it because the air traffic

1076
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,920
 control people, they found a flight instructor who guided them down in that.

1077
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
 There you go.

1078
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
 Had to run off and get a flight instructor.

1079
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
 Yeah.

1080
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,240
 But that was obviously, that was a small plane of, you know,

1081
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
 Happened last year.

1082
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
 2022.

1083
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
 Yeah.

1084
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,000
 Um, around Florida, the pilot collapsed or something.

1085
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,160
 We don't know exactly what happened.

1086
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,360
 There was a guy in there with him, it was a very small plane and he sat there and the

1087
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,520
 controls doesn't know what to do, rings traffic control and they say, well, where are you?

1088
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,240
 He's like, well, how the fuck should I know?

1089
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
 Yeah.

1090
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
 He's like, well, can you see the coast?

1091
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,080
 And he's like, yeah, we can see the coast.

1092
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,440
 And they said, okay, we'll fly either north or south, just follow the coast.

1093
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
 Right.

1094
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,040
 And then the air traffic controllers could look on their screen and they looked for

1095
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,560
 a plane that was following the coast in any direction.

1096
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,920
 And they managed to work out, it was them and they managed to get them down.

1097
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,520
 You're looking so stressed, Sophie.

1098
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
 It's really upsetting me.

1099
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,520
 Are you an anxious flyer normally before, before we've told you all this stuff?

1100
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,560
 No, I thought I could land the plane.

1101
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
 I've been so confident.

1102
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
 That's so funny.

1103
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,200
 I was in a helicopter with my wife and when you're on the radio, you can hear what everyone

1104
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,040
 else is doing and we were just flying along wherever we were going and there was a guy

1105
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,920
 who was like, help, help, get me out of here, get me out of here, get me out of here.

1106
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,280
 Telling the air traffic control and apparently what happened was the red arrows were flying

1107
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
 past him.

1108
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,840
 He was in a tiny little plane and he's like, there's red arrows on my left.

1109
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,440
 There's red arrows on my right.

1110
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
 What do I do?

1111
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,160
 He's leaving the red arrows at that moment.

1112
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,320
 Just release the smoke, like the others, just time it right.

1113
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
 Wave to the king.

1114
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,680
 I'm not really sure of plane etiquette generally when I was going to America.

1115
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,760
 I didn't realise that you're not allowed to drink the alcohol that you buy duty free

1116
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
 on the plane.

1117
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
 Oh, okay, yeah.

1118
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
 That is odd.

1119
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
 No, they ask you not to, yeah.

1120
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
 That is a fact.

1121
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,240
 So, yeah, I was like, oh, this is a great hat, I'll buy like a bottle of whiskey.

1122
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,440
 So I was sitting on a plane and just pouring like doubles and triples for me and my friend,

1123
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
 Laurie.

1124
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,640
 And the hostess, what passing was like, you're not allowed to do that, you're not allowed

1125
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
 to drink that on the plane.

1126
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,240
 So we both just thought that she'd meant just like bottoms up.

1127
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
 So we were like, so sorry.

1128
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
 And I was just like trying to drink that.

1129
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
 She was like, you can't have that one here.

1130
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
 So we're trying to get rid of it.

1131
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,800
 I had never been kicked off a flight though, but in May 2013, somebody was kicked off a

1132
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,360
 flight for doing the most amazing thing, which was singing Whitney Houston song, I Will Always

1133
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,320
 Love You, repeatedly.

1134
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
 Like first edition.

1135
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
 Okay.

1136
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,360
 Well, that's a bit annoying, but you know, find second, third edition is funny.

1137
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
 Yeah.

1138
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
 Yeah.

1139
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
 Yeah.

1140
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
 And then decreasing return.

1141
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
 Was it stupidly?

1142
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
 Who did it?

1143
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:06,160
 It was stupidly on a domestic service from Los Angeles to New York and it was diverted.

1144
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,640
 So it didn't actually land where it was meant to land.

1145
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
 It couldn't have been diverted because of this.

1146
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,520
 It was diverted to Kansas City so they could remove one of the planes.

1147
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
 To Houston.

1148
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
 Imagine that.

1149
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,520
 This reminds me of a song.

1150
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
 They landed it.

1151
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
 Motown in Detroit.

1152
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
 Oh my God.

1153
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
 Oh wow.

1154
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,520
 That's amazing.

1155
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
 But why was the passenger...

1156
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
 Who was the passenger?

1157
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
 I assume she was mentally unwell.

1158
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
 Right.

1159
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
 I haven't.

1160
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,520
 Well, I mean, I assume that she might just have been a legend, but apparently when she

1161
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 was...

1162
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
 It's a fine line.

1163
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,600
 When she was let off in handcuffs, she was still singing.

1164
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
 So.

1165
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
 Wow.

1166
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,120
 Can I tell you one more thing about overconfidence?

1167
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
 Yeah, yeah.

1168
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
 Which is what this is about.

1169
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,880
 So I just looked up other surveys of what people think they can do.

1170
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
 Yeah, brilliant.

1171
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
 Right?

1172
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,280
 So there was a survey about what works of art people think they could replicate.

1173
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
 Oh yeah.

1174
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
 Brilliant.

1175
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
 And it went from...

1176
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
 So Mondrian, is that...

1177
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
 Yeah, it's just lines.

1178
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,960
 It's just lines and blocks of color.

1179
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,160
 Mali Avic I could do.

1180
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
 That black...

1181
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
 It's just a black square.

1182
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
 Okay.

1183
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
 Perfect.

1184
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
 That's good.

1185
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
 So one in three Americans think they could replicate Mondrian's composition in red, blue

1186
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
 and yellow.

1187
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
 Which is quite...

1188
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
 Yeah.

1189
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,720
 But it's mostly sort of straight lines and blocks of color.

1190
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,880
 23% think they could do Van Gogh's self-portrait with a straw hat.

1191
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,880
 Which is wonderful.

1192
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,880
 Wait a minute.

1193
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,320
 If you're doing a Van Gogh self-portrait and you're replicating it, do you draw Van

1194
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,120
 Gogh or draw yourself in a straw hat?

1195
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,120
 Oh, sorry.

1196
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
 You draw Van Gogh.

1197
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,360
 You're just replicating that work of art.

1198
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
 Got it.

1199
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
 You don't have to cut off your own ear.

1200
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
 It's fine.

1201
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,000
 18% thought they could replicate Vermeer's The Milkmaid, which is one of the great works

1202
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 by a Dutch master.

1203
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Right.

1204
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 So it's really, really beautiful.

1205
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Yeah.

1206
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 And get this.

1207
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,160
 11% of Americans think they could probably or definitely replicate Michelangelo's David.

1208
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
 Wow.

1209
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
 Probably or definitely.

1210
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
 Probably.

1211
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
 Yeah.

1212
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
 Probably.

1213
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
 I'll say probably.

1214
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,160
 I don't want to see Van Gogh.

1215
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,160
 Do you have to do it exact or could you do it like...

1216
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,160
 I think you need to get it pretty dead on.

1217
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
 Yeah.

1218
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
 Yeah.

1219
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
 Okay.

1220
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
 Yeah.

1221
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,160
 That's amazing.

1222
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
 Half of British men between 16 and 24 think they could dodge a train.

1223
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
 Oh, I think I could dodge a train.

1224
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,480
 Yeah, but I mean like what qualifies as dodging a train?

1225
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
 Good point.

1226
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
 If you're trespassing on the tracks.

1227
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,800
 Well, the thing is about trains is they can only go where the tracks are.

1228
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,880
 So all you have to do is get off the tracks and you've dodged it.

1229
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,920
 Well, you two, Dan and James, are part of the problem, right?

1230
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,720
 Of young men trespassing on railway tracks.

1232
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,160
 I know that is a problem, yeah.

1233
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,720
 Thinking you can get off in time.

1234
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,360
 And actually it's very confusing when you're on tracks because all the train noise goes

1235
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
 out to the side.

1236
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
 Yeah, yeah.

1237
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,360
 This is a weird thing.

1238
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,520
 It's harder to tell than you think when there's a train coming along.

1239
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,440
 So Network Rail, a while ago, asked Rapper Wretch32.

1240
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,440
 Oh, we've met him.

1241
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
 Who we met once?

1242
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
 Yeah.

1243
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
 On Sunday branch.

1244
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
 Yeah.

1245
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
 It was a classic.

1246
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
 It was a classic booking pair.

1247
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
 Yeah.

1248
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
 I think it's Wretch32.

1249
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
 Wretch32.

1250
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
 Yeah.

1251
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1252
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1253
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
 That was a foul pair.

1254
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
 Oh, yeah.

1255
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
 Wretch32.

1256
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
 I called it Mr.32.

1257
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
 Yeah.

1258
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
 It's called Wretch32.

1259
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
 Wretch32, yeah.

1260
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1261
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
 Why is it 3-2 instead of 32?

1262
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
 Is that after a football score?

1263
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
 Yeah.

1264
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,440
 Because it looks like 32, doesn't it?

1265
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
 Yeah, but that's just his name.

1266
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
 I actually don't know why it's 3-2.

1267
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
 Where's the 1?

1268
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
 I don't know.

1269
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
 Where's the 1?

1270
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
 Where's the 1?

1271
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
 3-2.

1272
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
 3-2 is a countdown.

1273
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
 Wretch32.

1274
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
 Oh, right.

1275
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
 Let's see.

1276
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1277
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
 3-2-1.

1278
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
 Here's a train.

1279
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
 These are the mysteries, Andy.

1280
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
 Why is it thick and not thick?

1281
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
 Why is it weakened and not weakened?

1282
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,440
 These are the problems our podcast has.

1283
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
 What did Wretch32 do?

1284
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,440
 They asked him to test what it's like being on the tracks when a train is coming in.

1285
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
 By putting him in the simulator.

1286
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
 Yeah.

1287
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,440
 And he said, yes, it is actually very quiet and confusing and it's easy to be.

1288
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,440
 And he said he had great hearing, but actually it was confusing.

1289
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
 Yeah.

1290
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,440
 What a great team-up of Network Rail and Wretch32.

1291
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
 That is incredible.

1292
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
 But they were trying to get to young men, basically.

1293
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
 You were more likely to be trespassing.

1294
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,440
 He knew how to pronounce his name.

1295
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
 Okay.

1296
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,440
 It's time for our next episode.

1297
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
 Okay.

1298
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,440
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

1299
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
 And that is James.

1300
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
 Okay.

1301
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,440
 My fact this week is that the first person to use the phrase roast beef sandwich in English

1302
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,440
 had a surname, which is an anagram of the word steak.

1303
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
 It's so good.

1304
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
 It's a classic James fact.

1305
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,440
 I don't think anyone has ever come up with this fact before now.

1306
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,440
 This is new, right?

1307
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
 Yeah.

1308
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,440
 I can't imagine anyone have the time to do that.

1309
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,440
 But also this is you had a different fact, which we said, oh, we're not sure about.

1310
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,440
 So you came up with this.

1311
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,440
 I love James always does this in desperation as well.

1312
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,440
 This was real desperation.

1313
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:41,440
 So my original fact was that John Keats, spoiler alert, the famous most romantic of the romantic

1314
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,440
 poets claimed to be able to eat two dozen roast beef sandwiches in a single sitting,

1315
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,440
 which he did say in one of his letters, but it's clear when Andy read it and pointed

1316
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,440
 it out that actually he was saying metaphorically that he was so hungry, I could eat two dozen

1317
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,440
 sandwiches and perhaps he couldn't actually do it.

1318
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,440
 And we'd already researched roast beef sandwiches and Keats.

1319
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,440
 I needed to find anything else about him.

1320
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,440
 And it turns out in the OED that he's the first reference of roast beef sandwich and his name

1321
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,440
 is Nanogroma steak and that's where my brain went.

1322
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,440
 Because he's not very a steaky kind of poet.

1323
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
 No.

1324
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,440
 That's why he really likes about the original incorrect fact is he was quite Waif-like, wasn't

1325
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,440
 he, Keats?

1326
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,440
 And he was very sort of, I don't want to say wishy-washy, but you know, Byron would say

1327
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
 that for sure.

1328
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,440
 Yeah.

1329
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,440
 But yeah.

1330
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,440
 Big boy Byron.

1331
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,440
 Big boy Byron.

1332
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
 What is Burgess?

1333
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,440
 Competitive eating champs in North Ireland.

1334
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
 Yeah.

1335
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
 Yeah.

1336
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,440
 It's kind of, yeah, Keats is, so Keats, for anyone who's not a fan of Keats, John Keats,

1337
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
 died aged, what, 25?

1338
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
 Yeah.

1339
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,440
 And died of tuberculosis, consumption, which was a very poetic, seeming disease, you know,

1340
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,440
 it was associated with creative types and wrote everything he wrote, obviously, before

1341
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
 the age of 25.

1342
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,440
 Basically, all Keats poems are early Keats because there was no late Keats.

1343
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
 Yeah.

1344
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,440
 And still wrote a lot of really, actually really good stuff.

1345
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,440
 I was thinking, I was never a huge fan of Keats when I was studying because I did English,

1346
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,440
 but actually I looked back and I thought, yeah, there are some real bangers here.

1347
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,440
 Yeah.

1348
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,440
 Yeah.

1349
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
 Actually, it's not early Keats because early Keats, he burnt up, didn't he?

1350
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,440
 His earliest poems.

1351
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440
 Wow, some of those.

1352
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
 Yeah.

1353
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,440
 He just, yeah, yeah, he just thought, I don't like these.

1354
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
 And so he just, he burnt those over fire.

1355
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
 So actually, we don't have early Keats.

1356
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
 We've got sort of mid Keats.

1357
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
 Right.

1358
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
 Yeah.

1359
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,440
 So I was weirdly drawn to Keats' diet as well.

1360
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,440
 So I heard that he was voluntarily vegetarian.

1361
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
 Oh, was he?

1362
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,440
 So that's what I had to like sort of cure himself of his love sickness for Fanny.

1363
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
 Right.

1364
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,440
 His big love, but also he got put on a lot of fad diets by his doctor who, shall I say,

1365
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:54,440
 did not have his best address and prescribed him a diet of bread milk and anchovies because

1366
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,440
 he thought that his tuberculosis was in his stomach.

1367
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,440
 Yeah.

1368
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,440
 So it was hard because when you read his writing, he seemed to really love his food.

1369
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,440
 And yet he just had to eat all of this really bland stuff.

1370
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,440
 It must have, he must have hated it.

1371
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
 Doctors at the time were just so bad.

1372
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,440
 Yeah.

1373
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,440
 As in, his doctor misdiagnosed his tuberculosis as, I think, stress.

1374
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
 Oh, yeah.

1375
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,440
 Annoying.

1376
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
 He said that mental exertion is an application.

1377
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,440
 Right.

1378
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,440
 So basically, he's a little nerd that thinks too much.

1379
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,440
 Yeah.

1380
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,440
 And they bled him way too much.

1381
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
 They took pints of his blood, which is not helpful.

1382
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
 Is any amount of bleeding good?

1383
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,440
 I guess it might have helped some conditions, but I can't think of any which would have been helped.

1384
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
 But I mean, Lord Byron also was bled hugely.

1385
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,440
 As in, they took pints of Byron's blood and they made him very weak and they contributed to his death.

1386
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,440
 Yeah.

1387
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,440
 But he also, he did, you know, he was a bit fussy about his food.

1388
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
 There's a story, and this is right at the end of his days.

1389
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,440
 So he did die very young at tuberculosis.

1390
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,440
 And one of the ways that he tried to cure it was to get out of the UK and go to Rome and sort of try and soak up the sun.

1391
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
 And so he was staying there with his friend, Joseph Severin.

1392
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,440
 And they stayed at this house and there was a landlady there who used to make them food every single day.

1393
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,440
 And he hated it.

1394
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
 Hated this food.

1395
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
 She used to make them spaghetti.

1396
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,440
 And he just absolutely hates it.

1397
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,440
 He's in Rome when they were all right.

1398
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1399
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,440
 And so one day she comes in, hands them the spaghetti.

1400
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,440
 He takes the plate, keeps eye contact with her, walks over to the window, opens it up.

1401
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,440
 While maintaining the eye contact, just spills the plate out and all its contents onto the ground to make his point.

1402
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,440
 Rather than just saying, "Can we get something else?"

1403
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,440
 Oh, a child.

1404
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
 Yeah.

1405
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,440
 What a number.

1406
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,440
 And actually, lots of the stories about him, they make him a bit more kind of, you know, physical.

1407
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,440
 And like, he wasn't such a milk toast after all.

1408
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,440
 Oh, he was fighting, didn't he?

1409
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,440
 Well, I was saying he trained as a surgeon was the thing I didn't know about him.

1410
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,440
 He trained as a doctor.

1411
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
 Yeah.

1412
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,440
 And, you know, he would set broken bones and he was a dresser at Guy's Hospital and he would assist with surgery.

1413
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,440
 One of his jobs was to remove amputated limbs from the field of surgery.

1414
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,440
 So it's quite a stressful and impressive job to have, you know.

1415
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,440
 Yeah, I read one article asking if he might have been a grave robber.

1416
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,440
 Wow.

1417
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,440
 Yeah.

1418
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,440
 Because at the time, the surgery practice, they would do it on dead bodies.

1419
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,440
 And you were allowed like maybe two dead bodies a year who were like executed criminals or something like that.

1420
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,440
 But you needed more.

1421
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:14,440
 And so they had these resurrectionists who would go around getting bodies out of graves and sell them to the surgeons.

1422
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,440
 But there was a couple of people called the Burra Gang.

1423
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,440
 And the Burra Gang were famous for being body snatchers.

1424
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,440
 But apparently around that time that Keats was working there, they decided they would go on strike.

1425
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,440
 They wanted more money for their bodies.

1426
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,440
 And so they would stop giving the bodies.

1427
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,440
 And so the surgeons had to go out themselves and steal bodies from graves.

1428
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,440
 And the suggestion might be that maybe Keats, because he was there at the time that this was happening.

1429
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,440
 Great suggestion.

1430
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
 I hope it.

1431
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
 I mean, I love it.

1432
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
 Yeah.

1433
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
 How do you go on strike as a body snatcher as well?

1434
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,440
 Where do you stand?

1435
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,440
 Do you stand outside the hospital or the graveyard?

1436
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,440
 And what do your sides say?

1437
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,440
 But there's like one of his famous poems, which is called Isabella.

1438
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,440
 It's about a woman who keeps the head of her father, lover, one of the two.

1439
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
 I think lover.

1440
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,440
 Lover in a pot of basil.

1441
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,440
 And he explains what it looks like, this, you know, decapitated head.

1442
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,440
 And we think because he works as a surgeon, he knew, you know, he knew what dead bodies were like.

1443
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
 So his poems were real.

1444
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,440
 Yeah, he's lived a proper life.

1445
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,440
 Oh, here's one thing we don't know about Keats.

1446
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,440
 We don't know if he ever rode a bike.

1447
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
 Oh, okay.

1448
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,440
 Because he would have had the chance to.

1449
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,440
 Yeah, brilliant.

1450
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,440
 This was the, the Velocipede was the very early, it got called the daddy horse as well.

1451
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,440
 It's a bike with no pedals, basically.

1452
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
 So you straddle it.

1453
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,440
 You straddle it and you wheel it along the ground with your feet.

1454
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
 Like a kid's bike.

1455
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,440
 Like a very early starter bike for kids, except this was the most fashionable thing.

1456
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
 Yeah.

1457
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,440
 And we know that he wrote to his brother, George, who'd left for America in 1818.

1458
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,440
 He wrote to his brother saying the new thing today is a machine called the Velocipede.

1459
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,440
 It has a wheel carriage to ride cock horse on, sitting astride and pushing it along with the toes.

1460
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
 And it's very exciting.

1461
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,440
 So we know that he knew what they were, but we don't know if he ever had a go.

1462
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
 Because he doesn't say on the latter.

1463
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
 Did he ever use roller skates?

1464
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,440
 I don't think he did.

1465
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
 Oh, because his name is an anagram of skate.

1466
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,440
 So it's just.

1467
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,440
 Oh, wow.

1468
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,440
 See, Sophie, this is what it's like.

1469
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,440
 I feel like Keats always seemed like I did study English, but I don't remember having a great love for Keats.

1470
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,440
 Just because I think he was a bit more like, a bit like softer and gentler,

1471
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,440
 which does tally with Ben Wishall playing him in Bright Star.

1472
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,440
 And Ben Wishall said that it was the highlight of his career so far.

1473
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,440
 Play police?

1474
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
 Yeah.

1475
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,440
 Really?

1476
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
 But that was pre Paddington.

1477
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,440
 Oh, okay.

1478
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,440
 Who was your, who were your literary heroes when you did English?

1479
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
 Literary heroes.

1480
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,440
 I mean, I think what my English degree did sort of kill any enjoyment or passion I had for the subject.

1481
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
 But out of the Romantics, I liked Blake.

1482
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,440
 Yeah.

1483
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
 I liked how he did all his little etchings as well.

1484
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,440
 Yeah.

1485
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,440
 Who else did I like?

1486
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,440
 Well, you were Byron fan.

1487
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
 Yeah.

1488
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,440
 Because that's a bit, that's a bit of a dividing jets and sharks thing.

1489
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,440
 Byron and Keats, you know, Beetle stones.

1490
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,440
 Oh, yeah, you can maybe.

1491
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,440
 Well, a little bit, a little bit.

1492
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
 As in Byron is much more fun.

1493
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,440
 There are many more jokes in Byron.

1494
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,440
 It's just fun.

1495
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,440
 But it's also fun.

1496
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
 But also they had a rivalry during their lifetime.

1497
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,440
 Well, Byron was a bit rude about Keats.

1498
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
 I don't know if Keats was ever rude back about Byron.

1499
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
 Probably couldn't think of anything.

1500
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,440
 But no, he actually, he did run a lot of great stuff, Keats.

1501
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,440
 Obviously, he is one of the greats.

1502
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,440
 Interestingly, Byron, when he died, so he died out in...

1503
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
 Greece.

1504
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
 In Greece, he was in, was it a lake or the ocean?

1505
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,440
 Remember, it was the ocean, I think, right?

1506
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,440
 He drowned.

1507
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,440
 No, Shelly drowned.

1508
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,440
 Yeah.

1509
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,440
 Byron died of fever.

1510
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
 Byron, he did swim across the Bosphorus.

1511
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,440
 Byron didn't he?

1512
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,440
 But he didn't drown.

1513
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
 I don't think.

1514
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
 No, he died of a painful fever.

1515
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,440
 Sorry, I'm confused.

1516
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,440
 When part of identifying who Shelly was when they found him

1517
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,440
 was not only his clothes, but he had a book of Keats's poetry

1518
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,440
 in his pocket.

1519
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,440
 Oh, really?

1520
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,440
 Oh, but yeah, Shelly carried a record of Keats.

1521
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,440
 Yeah.

1522
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
 So Percy Shelly was a vegetarian.

1523
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,440
 We talked about earlier how Keats ended up having to be a vegetarian.

1524
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,440
 But Percy Shelly was a vegetarian because, well,

1525
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,440
 it's quite forward-thinking, I guess, at the time.

1526
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,440
 So he thought that animals used too much land.

1527
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,440
 And around that time, there was kind of a lot of Malthusian,

1528
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,440
 kind of the population's going to go through the roof.

1529
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,440
 Everyone's going to starve.

1530
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,440
 And so he decided to become a vegetarian for that reason.

1531
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,440
 But the only thing he would be tempted by was to eat bacon.

1532
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,440
 And he just couldn't not eat bacon.

1533
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,440
 And there was a guy, a friend of his, called Thomas Jefferson Hogg.

1534
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,440
 And Thomas Jefferson Hogg used to just, whenever he saw him,

1535
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,440
 he used to just give him bits of bacon and say,

1536
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,440
 "Oh, just have a bit of bacon, Shelly."

1537
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,440
 That's so funny.

1538
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,440
 Because that is a really good reason for being vegetarian.

1539
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,440
 But bacon is also the thing that a lot of vegetarians,

1540
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,440
 come across as a vegetarian.

1541
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,440
 While we're on food, just back to Keats for a second,

1542
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
 he also loved jam.

1543
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,440
 He at least ate it.

1544
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,440
 So we don't know if he rode a bicycle, but we do know that he ate jam.

1545
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,440
 Because...

1546
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,440
 We're piece of it together.

1547
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,440
 Because?

1548
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,440
 Because he apologized for spilling some jam on a letter that he'd written.

1549
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,440
 And so he wrote, and he also invented new words as a result of this,

1550
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,440
 or a new word as a result of this.

1551
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,440
 So he wrote, after spilling the jam,

1552
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,440
 "I have licked it, but it remains very purplu."

1553
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,440
 I don't know whether it's say purple or blue.

1554
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,440
 So wrote purplu.

1555
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,440
 Which may be an excellent name for a colour made up of those two.

1556
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,440
 Purplu.

1557
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,440
 That's how you get to be one of the guys.

1558
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,440
 That's the flavour of early Keats.

1559
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,440
 It's purplu period.

1560
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,440
 I was going to ask, it was mulberry jam, because in that Keats house in Hampstead,

1561
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,440
 where he lived and fell in love with his neighbour,

1562
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,440
 there is a mulberry tree, an ancient mulberry tree,

1563
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,440
 which they think that people hypothesize he stood under and wrote,

1564
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,440
 "O to a nightingale."

1565
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,440
 But whether or not it was there when he was there,

1566
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,440
 it has been adopted into the Queen,

1567
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,440
 basically recipes, had a collection of ancient trees,

1568
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,440
 less than 100 ancient trees, and it's form part of the Queen's canopy.

1569
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,440
 What a collection just around the country.

1570
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,440
 Yeah, of just royal old trees.

1571
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,440
 I think that's nice.

1572
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,440
 I've got a riddle for you.

1573
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,440
 The most famous painting of Keats is of him at Wentworth Place.

1574
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,440
 It shows him sitting and coming up with his most famous poem.

1575
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,440
 Yeah, I feel like I could knock one of them out.

1576
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,440
 Join the queue with a third of American men.

1577
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,440
 So he's dead in the painting.

1578
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,440
 Oh, what?

1579
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,440
 Okay, so...

1580
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,440
 What is riddle?

1581
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,440
 Riddle me that.

1582
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
 So someone's painted him, right,

1583
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,440
 and when they painted him,

1584
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,440
 his body was the thing they were painting.

1585
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,440
 So it was painted in 1834.

1586
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,440
 He died in 1821.

1587
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,440
 Oh, that's quite a long time afterwards.

1588
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
 Long time. So, yeah.

1589
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,440
 So the riddle is, oh, is it something like, is it...

1590
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
 There isn't a riddle in part.

1591
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,440
 Well, none of you has come up with an answer.

1592
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,440
 So I feel like it is still a riddle, actually.

1593
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,440
 Did he donate his skull to the theatre,

1594
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,440
 and so it's his skull that's depicted in the...

1595
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,440
 No, nice. Not bad.

1596
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,440
 Is he painted as an angel?

1597
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,440
 That's another good answer, but no, no, no.

1598
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,440
 Seems like no one saw my riddle.

1599
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,440
 What's the riddle?

1600
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,440
 How? How is he dead in the painting?

1601
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,440
 How has he depicted so brilliantly 13 years after he died?

1602
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
 Oh, he was a twin.

1603
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,440
 So they just used the twin to model.

1604
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,440
 His mother was the artist.

1605
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,440
 That's right. And she said, "I cannot paint this."

1606
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
 It's my son.

1607
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,440
 No. I don't understand.

1608
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,440
 He was... Shall I solve the riddle, will you all?

1609
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,440
 He's dead in the painting, because Halloween party?

1610
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,440
 That's a Halloween party painting.

1611
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,440
 Yeah, that's why. And there's a plastic bat in the corner.

1612
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,440
 No, no, no. Okay.

1613
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,440
 After his death, a death mask was made of him,

1614
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,440
 and it was used as the model.

1615
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,440
 And after Keats died in Rome, they made a death mask of his face,

1616
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,440
 and they also did his hand and his foot.

1617
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,440
 And there were only two of these death masks for a long time.

1618
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,440
 One of them was kept by Joseph Seven,

1619
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,440
 and one was sent to his publisher, which I feel is a weird...

1620
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,440
 I feel that as well.

1621
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
 As in if I died? Yeah.

1622
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,440
 And we have two masks, and they can go to any two people.

1623
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,440
 Exactly. Yeah.

1624
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,440
 I don't want to go to my editor.

1625
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,440
 But no, that's what was painted of him 13 years later.

1626
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,440
 Yeah, and the frame of this painting, this is quite romantic.

1627
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,440
 Capital art has a lock of his hair in the frame of the painting.

1628
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,440
 So there's a little bit of Keats in that original picture.

1629
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,440
 That's amazing. Good riddle. Thank you.

1630
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,440
 Speaking of siblings of Keats,

1631
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,440
 his little sister was called Fanny,

1632
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,440
 which is the same name as the woman that he was in love with.

1633
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
 What a creepy little boy.

1634
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,440
 No.

1635
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
 He can't marry someone with the same name as you.

1636
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,440
 He can't marry someone with the same name as your sibling.

1637
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,440
 He can't get married. He just loved her unrequitedly.

1638
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,440
 Unrequitedly, I think.

1639
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,440
 They were engaged, but they never married.

1640
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,440
 And then he died very young.

1641
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,440
 I don't think he could be unrequited if they got engaged.

1642
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,440
 That's not unrequited, is it?

1643
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,440
 You're absolutely right.

1644
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,440
 That's what my now wife said to me.

1645
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,440
 She said, "I will say yes, but just so you know, it's not required."

1646
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,440
 Well, Fanny never took his ring off.

1647
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,440
 So Keats gave her a ring.

1648
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,440
 And for the rest of her life, even though she remarried,

1649
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
 she still wore the ring that Keats gave her.

1650
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,440
 I think it's a bit of a kick of the guts to her second husband.

1651
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,440
 A bit of a wrap-out.

1652
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,440
 I think that's because he's such a romantic...

1653
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,440
 No, actually, it's worse that he's one of the great romantic poets.

1654
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,440
 By the way, one of the best and most romantic poets ever loved me

1655
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,440
 and gave me this ring.

1656
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,440
 It's a lot of pressure when you're writing a Valentine's card, isn't it?

1657
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,440
 It is.

1658
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,440
 Grossly red once a perfume.

1659
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,440
 [Laughter]

1660
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:47,440
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.
