00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish, where we are joined by the wonderful

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.680
 Sophie Duker.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.760
 Now, if you don't know who Sophie Duker is, where have you been?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.600
 Certainly not watching season 13 of Taskmaster, that's for sure, which is the season that

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.440
 she won.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.000
 She is also one mastermind.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.080
 She's a regular on our television, on all of the panel shows, and she was absolutely brilliant

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 on our show.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.160
 If you want to learn anything more about Sophie, the best place to go is to sophieduker.com

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.960
 that's S-O-P-H-I-E-D-U-K-E-R dot C-O-M.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.040
 And actually, she also has a comedy night known as Wacky Racists, which is coming to

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.720
 the Hackney Empire on the 26th of October.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.760
 That will be hosted by Sophie and will include Nish Kumar and all sorts of other guests who

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.120
 are yet to be announced.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.320
 That will be a brilliant night, you should definitely get your tickets for that.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.040
 But like I said, any information on Sophie, the best place to go is to sophieduker.com.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.840
 Very much hope you enjoyed this week's show.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.960
 I will bore you with adverts for upcoming live shows or for clubfish.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 You know where to go if you want to get involved with those.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:32.240
 For now, let's just say on with a podcast.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.240
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.880
 Sophie Juker and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.000
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.920
 Starting with fact number one, that is Sophie.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:06.040
 Oh my God, my fact is, during their mating season, male camel's stomachs actually shrink

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.920
 so that they can concentrate on chasing females.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.720
 That's incredible.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 Brilliant.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.640
 So they need to stop less for food, or is it, what is it?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.720
 I think it's so that they look fit, but also, yeah, is it like breathing in and sticking

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.720
 your chest out?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.720
 They have got three stomachs, haven't they?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.920
 So it will have a good effect if they suck in all three stomachs.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 Wow.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.960
 Sadly, I don't think they suck in their stomachs.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.760
 I think they're sucking their stomachs to be kind of more agile and literally chase

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
 women.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760
 Oh, really?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.880
 I totally bought the first reason, thanks for clarifying.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.000
 I think it's so they can be faster because there is quite a disgusting display that camels

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.840
 do when they are, male camels do, sorry, female camels are angels on it.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.920
 And males are disgusting, rat-like, toxic, yeah, yeah.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.160
 So talking about the toxic male camel, toxic male camel have this thing that they do also

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.000
 during their mating season where they blow up their soft palate, so I don't know exactly

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 how they do it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.120
 I'm not a camel, but I'm very culturally aware and some people think that they've like thrown

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.120
 up their stomachs or like part of their mouths, but it's actually like they blow up their

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.240
 soft palate so that this huge bulbous pink glistening thing hangs out of their mouths

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800
 and it looks almost exactly like a pair of testicles.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800
 It really does.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 It's so disgusting.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360
 I saw a picture just this morning.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.800
 I never thought of it that way, but yeah.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.040
 Can you say that again, testicles are disgusting?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 Yes, yeah.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 I'm not happy with that.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.280
 There was a study recently about how attractive testicles are and they showed a load of images

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.360
 of scrotums to women and asked them to rate how attractive they were and in the abstract

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.160
 at the start of it, it said we were unable to say that any scrotums were attractive.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.440
 We were only allowed to say which was the least unattractive.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.440
 Oh, no.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.440
 What are they all human?

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 They were all human.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.280
 Sorry, I should say they were all human testicles.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.400
 Some people are getting theirs smoothened.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.280
 If you get some Botox in there.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.640
 You can have a smooth Botox.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
 Oh, yes to have them.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 You can do that.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.920
 I don't think any Botox scrotum were part of the study.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 Right.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.760
 And also then it's so much harder for them to be expressive, which is a real shame.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.200
 That bag that they have, the one that you're talking about, is it called the Duller?

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200
 Yes.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.360
 Yeah, I didn't know how to pronounce it, so I'm glad you took the fool for that.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.280
 But the camel can close its nose to avoid, I think, sand in the desert storm and things

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 like that.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.760
 And I think it closes its nose and then just breathes out into the bag.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.840
 You know when you're kind of trying to make your nose pop?

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840
 Yes.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.320
 And you're trying to equalize on the bag.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320
 Exactly.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.920
 God, we don't do that when we try and pop our ears and try and ball set comes out of

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920
 our mouth.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920
 No, but you're actually not meant to.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920
 I didn't know this.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920
 You're not meant to do that out of the water.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920
 That's meant to be like a dive.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920
 If someone told me.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920
 Oh, wow, really?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.440
 So maybe if you did it hard enough, you would.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.440
 The Duller would flop out.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.440
 Wow.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.720
 But to make it so that sack that comes out, that is seen as quite a sexy thing towards

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.120
 the female camels and they drool foam at the same time.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 It's a quite...

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.120
 Lovely.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.000
 I know it's wrong because it's sort of saying I find it disgusting, but obviously it's an

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 animal thing.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.880
 And you know, but in this case, it's just disgusting.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.500
 I think it's fine even these days to say that something that an animal does is not attractive

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500
 to you.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 I think that is allowed.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.120
 But I find everything else animals do really sexy.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 They urinate on their own tails, don't they?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 Hot.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 See?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120
 Yeah.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120
 Is that for scent?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.360
 Yeah, to lay down the scent, lay down the pheromones.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.240
 And then they flick it up like a little...

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 Flick it up.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.240
 Yeah.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.240
 I don't know if that's just because they're dicks.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.000
 They sort of flick it up a little shower of it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.520
 There's something else they do during mating season.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.520
 Which is...

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520
 This is...

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.520
 Oh, sorry.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.520
 I'm sorry.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520
 I'm sorry.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 But they do...

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520
 They must do.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520
 They must do.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520
 Otherwise how?

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.640
 So this is a study done in Saudi Arabia or maybe the UAE.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.120
 So this is deceitful behavior by male camels during mating season.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.160
 So they wait for the cover of darkness and their males will lie down and they'll pretend

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
 to go to sleep.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.720
 But they're not asleep.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.520
 They're just waiting for a female to be lulled into a false sense of security.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.360
 And then the male pounce on them.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.840
 Yeah, it's not great.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840
 No.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.440
 So I know anthropomorphism is also not the point, but then the females respond by biting

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.000
 the male's knee joints if they're not interested, which can give them arthritis in the long

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 run.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Okay.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.200
 So if you ever see an old camel with arthritis, it means in his younger days he was a sex

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 pest.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.360
 Yeah, that's exactly what it means.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360
 Yeah.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.680
 I saw a sex video the other day of camels having mating.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.680
 You saw a what?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.680
 Sorry.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.680
 I saw a video.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680
 Like, yeah.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.680
 Like just watch...

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
 Was it part of this research or just...

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680
 It was...

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.680
 I mean, I would have got to it anyway eventually, but...

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.240
 So this footage was because two camels I think was in Dubai or Abu Dhabi just were doing

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.360
 it in the middle of the road.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.760
 So traffic was held up.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.760
 Everyone was filming it.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.480
 And it was effectively, the female camel was on the ground and it was...

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480
 They sit down, don't they?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480
 Yeah.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.480
 And it was like doggy style.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480
 Yeah.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.520
 And it was interesting, because in my head I hadn't pictured how camels would have sex

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 and...

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.880
 Well, like almost all mammals, it's doggy style, but the difference is that the females sit

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880
 down.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880
 Yeah, which is serious.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.560
 They just take a seat and then the male goes behind.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.560
 Do you know why camels have humps?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560
 Sort of.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560
 Yeah.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.040
 Well, to store energy and fat reserves.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.040
 Yeah.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.440
 Why do they need to store?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.880
 Like, do you mean like, why there?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880
 Or what?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880
 Why do they need to store?

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.440
 Oh, because they don't have time without food and...

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.620
 Well, in actual fact, it's not because they evolved in the desert, it's because they evolved

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.620
 in the Arctic.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.620
 Oh.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.000
 So camels evolved in really cold conditions and they evolved the humps and then eventually

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.320
 they migrated down into hotter areas and it turned out that they were brilliant for that

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.320
 condition as well.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.320
 That's so good.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320
 And that's where they ended up.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320
 Beautiful.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320
 Yeah.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.880
 Although, like the Americas is where camels first evolved.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.880
 The former Americas, yeah.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880
 Originally, yeah.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880
 And what...

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.560
 There used to be mega camels, like four meters high at the shoulder.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.080
 There used to be gigantic camels roaming the earth.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.080
 Yeah.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.080
 How long ago?

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.120
 Like at the time when everything was massive.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.360
 Before there were humans in the Americas, I think, right?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.360
 Yes.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360
 I think so.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.360
 Certainly tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of years.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.360
 I've got another old camel fat.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.160
 I feel like they're very versatile because the earliest stone camel apparently called

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.120
 Protylopus that did North America 40 to 50 million years ago.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.120
 That was the size of a rabbit.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.120
 Oh.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.120
 The size of a little rabbit.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.120
 That's amazing.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.120
 The rabbit is the size of a rabbit.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.120
 They were the size of a rabbit.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120
 They were massive.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.720
 So they were really small and then went really big and then went really small.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.720
 Yeah.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.720
 Well, they sort of found a middle ground today.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720
 Yeah, they did.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720
 They found a range.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720
 That's very cool.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720
 Do you want to hear a couple of camel proverbs?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 Oh, okay.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.720
 These are good.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720
 These are from the Middle East.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720
 Here's one.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.760
 "Egg will steal a camel."

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.440
 Is that what they have at the start of their DVDs?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.560
 You wouldn't steal an egg.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.560
 What does that mean?

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.560
 I suck with proverbs.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.560
 What does that mean?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.640
 It means if I was disautistic enough to do something small against you, then don't trust

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.320
 me because I'll do something even worse against you.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320
 Exactly.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.880
 Here's another one that's slightly harder to get.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.440
 The door is big enough for a camel to pass through.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440
 Well, that's in the Bible.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440
 See you.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.680
 No, that's about the rich man getting into hell.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.680
 I haven't.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.680
 I haven't.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.260
 Easy and then a camel to get through the high of an eagle.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.760
 For a rich man to get through.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.840
 No, this is just the door is big enough for a camel to pass through.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.840
 It's big door.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.840
 Big old door.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840
 That's right.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840
 Big door.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840
 Which size camel are we talking about?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840
 Is this like a rabbit flap?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840
 Yeah, it's a rabbit flap.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840
 It's more small.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.840
 It's a nice saying, actually.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.760
 Oh, everyone's welcome.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.280
 It's actually the opposite of that.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.280
 It's feel free to leave.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.080
 You know, you're not interested.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080
 The door is big enough for a camel to pass through.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080
 There's nothing keeping you here.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.080
 Wow.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.080
 That's not a good phrase.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080
 That is a good phrase.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.560
 Did you see camels recently, Sophie?

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.560
 I did see camels recently because I went to the desert.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.560
 Yeah.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560
 And it falls out.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.440
 They're all over the shop.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:04.440
 I was chilling, though, not literally because it was so hot and dry with the Bedouin.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.720
 Oh, cool.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720
 Yeah.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.720
 And Bedouin people and other pastoralist people, like their camels are, they're a big

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720
 deal.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.720
 They love their camels.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.320
 There's actually a, I want to say, like a folkloric tradition of song called the Alhuda, whereas

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.720
 part of a journey you sing to entertain primarily the camel.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.720
 Cool.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.720
 So it's...

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720
 My horns.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.720
 My horns.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.720
 It's just that.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.920
 There's a lot of, a lot of Fergie's back catalog talking about, but yeah, I really like

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.920
 that.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.320
 And Alhuda has been adopted on the UNESCO Intangible Heritage List.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 Oh, cool.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
 That's cool.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 That's really cool.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320
 That's lovely.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.320
 Did you sing it to the camels?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320
 I didn't sing, I didn't sing to the camels.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.480
 I sort of was like, I sort of looked at them respectfully, but did not ride a camel.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.480
 Oh, you didn't ride?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480
 I didn't ride a camel.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480
 It's fun.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.480
 I've ridden a camel.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.480
 Oh, but are you supposed to these days?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480
 Yeah.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480
 Are you?

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
 It's absolutely fine.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 It's cool to ride camels.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480
 Okay.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.280
 Well, I mean, Sophie's been near a camel more recently than me, so there might be more

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280
 recent data.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.080
 When I was doing it, it was absolutely...

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.080
 Where did you do it?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.080
 Dubai.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080
 Nice.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080
 When I was, I was tiny.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.320
 And the weird thing is when they, because they kneel down, they fold their legs so

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.880
 efficiently under themselves, and then you get on and then they stand up.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.040
 But that means they have this mad, they tilt back crazily as one set of legs gets up, and

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.920
 then they tilt back the other way as the other set of legs gets up, and then eventually

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.160
 you're, you're flat.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160
 But it's...

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.640
 Also, they are so important for so much more than being ridden.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.640
 Yeah.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.840
 So much more than a great ride.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.820
 I think like camel milk in Jordan, the Mansaf, like it's like a dish with camel milk is one

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:44.240
 of the, what was the national dish of Jordan, and it's meant to have like so many different

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240
 heaving properties.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240
 Did you try it?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.740
 I did try Mansaf.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.740
 It was, it was good.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.740
 Yeah.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.740
 It was like a bit tough.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.240
 You're saying, right, you didn't like it at all.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240
 I loved it.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240
 I loved it.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240
 I just liked mixing them a lot.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.840
 I wouldn't want undiluted camel milk, but that's because I'm a baby raised on, raised

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.160
 on cow, but now very much transition to oat and almond.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.640
 Here's the thing camels can do.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640
 This is great.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.580
 They can move the two halves of their top lip left and right independently of each other.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.580
 Oh, okay.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.580
 How cool is that?

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.580
 Oh, that's fun.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.580
 Because you can picture a camel's face.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.620
 It has that kind of, you know, gap in the middle at the top of their lip and they can

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.620
 move them.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.220
 So like how many people do that really fun eyebrow thing where they raise one eyebrow.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.220
 They've got the lip equivalent.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.220
 Yeah.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.220
 Exactly.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.220
 That's so cool.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.220
 There must be a look in the camel world that they give when they're like.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.460
 You can signal that you're not really into it if you're kissing someone, but they're

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.940
 only using half your mouth.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.160
 That's how you can, you know.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.160
 Yeah.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.260
 I feel like they're like their inherent eroticism and also, um, like I think a lot of stuff

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.760
 about the physicality of camels is probably why they've not yet been given the Pixar treatment.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.760
 They're too earthy.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760
 They're too bawdy.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.760
 Yeah.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.320
 They're too like, they're just really off the sand.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.320
 They're sex pests.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320
 They're sex pests.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320
 Yeah.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.240
 But like even they're, um, one of the factors that they, they're urine has been used in

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240
 like certain like traditions.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.240
 Yeah.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240
 People drink their urine, use them as medicines.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.860
 There's not a whole lot of scientific evidence I found that proves that that it's a good

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.860
 idea.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.860
 No.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.860
 It's like super concentrated.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.960
 God, Sophie, how did your meeting with Pixar go?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.200
 Oh my God, no you don't understand.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.680
 He drinks the urine and then it's super concentrated.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.240
 That's the way it works.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.240
 Yeah.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.240
 Yeah.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.480
 So there's like, there's a traditional thing of drinking cow urine in India, for instance,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480
 right?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.560
 But they do think that because camels, they don't have as much water in their body that

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.800
 it is more concentrated and whatever good stuff is in cow urine, it's even better.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800
 In camel urine.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.800
 That's the idea.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.800
 Oh, right.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.800
 Do you think that's true?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.740
 Do we, does what I said is true whether it's good for you.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.740
 I think perhaps.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.740
 It feels strong.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.740
 It feels like stuff.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.740
 Yeah.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.740
 Yeah.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.740
 I think not.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.020
 Is that where the milk is so tart because it's because they, it's not very tart.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.020
 Okay.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.860
 I don't want to, I don't want to offend the camels of Jordan.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.900
 It was just a bit, it was different.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.660
 I actually think that goat milk is, it's probably as weird, no offense to as goat milk.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.400
 Because goat milk tastes a bit goatee, doesn't it?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.720
 Does it, can you get a bit of camel taste in it or not?

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.160
 I think I've not done a comparative study.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
 It was sort of a malty.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160
 Right.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160
 Okay.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.160
 I mean, it's all milk malty.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160
 Is that the point of malt?

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
 No.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160
 It was maltyer than milk.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.160
 Like oval tea.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160
 Especially malty.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.320
 I just, I just actually had my first oval tea.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320
 Bullshit.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.040
 You have oval tea every night, Andy.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040
 There's no doubt about that.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.040
 Let me finish.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.960
 I finished my first jar of oval tea in a while.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960
 Really?

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.160
 The first jar of the year.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.660
 I hadn't had it for years and years and years, then my wife said, "Oh, I've never had it."

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.860
 And I said, "What you said to me, Jensen, I said, 'Bullshit, like you can't, I can't

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.860
 believe you've never had it.'"

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.860
 So I rushed out.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.860
 I thought to myself.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.860
 What time did this?

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.860
 Went to your dealer.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.860
 I went to the all night shop.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.860
 It was two in the morning.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.860
 I got a jar.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:57.860
 Anyway, for the last three weeks, I've been trying to push oval tea in my wife who actually

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.640
 doesn't like the taste of oval tea.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640
 Yeah.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.760
 Anyway, I got a quick Camel quiz.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.760
 Camel's got a lot of this story.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760
 Camel quiz.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.760
 Get stuff.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:13.240
 I just wanted to sort of part one, part two to break it up, it's so good.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.240
 Quick Camel quiz.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.240
 Yes, brilliant.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240
 Three.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240
 Okay.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.080
 So why should you not, if you're in the desert, step into Camel Dung?

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.360
 Well, I mean, for the get some of your shoes.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360
 Yeah.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.180
 That is also a correct answer, even though that's not the one I have on my sheet.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.760
 Smells bad, bad vibes.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.700
 Oh, you might injure some of these smaller life forms which rely on it as a, as a biome.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.920
 You know, don't dung beetles and stag beetles, they use it.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.640
 I was thinking perhaps similarly, but maybe it's like some poisonous animals live in it.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.640
 Yeah.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640
 Who might bite your feet.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640
 Lovely.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.640
 I thought it's so toxic that it would melt your foot off at the bone.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.640
 Yeah.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.640
 That's good.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.640
 Yeah.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.640
 Yeah.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.640
 I mean, these are probably all correct.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.440
 Maybe Sophie's one a bit lesser, but maybe the rest of them.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.080
 This is, I mean, it's a stretch, my answer.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.840
 I'm just making a fun quiz here, but you don't want to do it because you might explode entirely.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840
 Right.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:14.000
 And that is because during the Second World War, the German tanks, if they saw a camel

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.440
 dung would roll over it.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.920
 It was seen as a sort of good lunch on the allies heard about this.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.600
 And so what they started doing was making camel dung landmines.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.760
 So they looked the facade of it on top and so that would lower.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.680
 So like we know that bombs still exist, you know, in the basement, so, you know, we're

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.880
 always finding unexploded World War Two bombs.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.720
 There's probably camel dung landmines still out there in the desert waiting.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.720
 That's where we're in.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720
 There you go.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.720
 Gosh.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:48.240
 I'm very next to have the urge to jump into a pile of shit at this point.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.240
 Okay.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.520
 It is time for fact number two.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.800
 And that is my fact.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.640
 My fact this week is that the first woman to ever direct a film was a guy.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:04.880
 I was recently sitting on a plane and we were about to do fact picking and I desperately

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.600
 needed like one killer fact.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.200
 And I was like, how am I going to find it?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200
 Plains about to take off.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.720
 And on the screen in front of me was the in flight entertainment and there was a documentary

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.040
 called Alice Guy, the first female filmmaker and I thought, wow, that's, that's really

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040
 exciting.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.520
 I have no idea who this person is.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.520
 And B, it turns out that she's extraordinary.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.400
 Turns out that this is one of the most seminal filmmakers of our time.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.480
 The innovation that she created is something that means she should be held up there with

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.840
 like the Lumiere brothers up there with the Spielbergs, the Scorsese.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.320
 This is someone whose name should be a household name and no one virtually knows who she is.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.840
 Well, first of all, was she French?

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.840
 She was French.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.840
 Yeah.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840
 So would she pronounce it Guy?

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840
 Yeah.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.840
 So Alice Guy would probably be her name and and she had a second surname, which was her

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.320
 husband's surname that she took on.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.400
 So it was Alice Guy Blush Blanchet Blanchet, I think.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.400
 Blanchet.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.400
 So hang on.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.600
 What's the fact again in the light of these?

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.280
 But she not only was the first female director, but she was the first female director for

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280
 about a decade.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.240
 Like she just really only field was a period where obviously men were just saying, you're

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.400
 not capable of doing this.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.840
 She's also acknowledged as possibly being one of the first two people to pioneer the

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.760
 idea of narrative filmmaking as well.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.120
 Up until this point, everything was just sort of showing a train pulling in the station

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.480
 or people walking out of a factory where she gave it a story and she turned it into a

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480
 narrative.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480
 So yeah, hugely important.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480
 Very cool.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480
 Yeah.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.640
 She lived until she was 94, which was 1968 that she died.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.920
 And I think by that time, only about three of her films were still available.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.800
 She made a thousand or was involved in a thousand, you know, directing, producing, supervising.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.800
 And I think a lot more have been made available since she died or they just rediscovered.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.600
 We keep finding them.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 Yeah.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.960
 She was when the Lumiere's made the first ever film.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.240
 This was in 1895.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.200
 She was in the room when that happened, as in there was a private showing and her boss,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.280
 who's a guy called Gaumont, was invited because they thought that Gaumont might want to buy

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.560
 the equipment and kind of sell it on to people.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.640
 And he was quite interested because he thought people would buy it so they could make videos

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.720
 of their children.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.080
 That's what he thought this new technology would be of motion pictures.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.240
 And he was right.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.240
 Yeah.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:33.320
 So he did buy some of these cameras and then he allowed Alice Guy to use them because he

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.600
 thought it was just like a toy.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.600
 It was just like, you know, he didn't really take it that seriously.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.440
 So he just let her do it and then suddenly she became the biggest, you know, the biggest

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440
 deal in filmmaking.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440
 Yeah.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.000
 And her first movie, there's a few variations on the title, but one of the English translations

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.880
 is The Cabbage Fairy.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:54.280
 And it's basically a narrative about how babies are born through cabbage patches.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.320
 And we had an episode with Beck Hillog where we were trying to work out when did anyone

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.840
 think you were born from a cabbage patch to talk about the Cabbage Patch Kids.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.840
 Oh my God.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840
 This goes all the way back.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.840
 And the Cabbage Patch Kids.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.840
 Yeah.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840
 And she's partly responsible for the Cabbage Patch Kids.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840
 It's amazing.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840
 You look like you have Cabbage Patch Kids.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840
 I don't know.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840
 They're scary.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.840
 I don't like them.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.600
 But I do love talking about France.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.680
 And the folklore is that boys are born from cabbages, but girls are born from roses.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680
 Right.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680
 And I don't want to be so...

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.680
 Still to this day.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.680
 That's the thing.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.680
 Still to this day.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.680
 That's how French people are born.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.280
 There are claims that she invented the music video, which I like.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.400
 I think a pretty early prototypical form of it, because she used to think of Chronophone

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.520
 in 1905, which is where you filmed the singer's lip syncing, and then you'd play a pre-recorded

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.200
 track simultaneously with it.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200
 Yeah.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.000
 But also, I mean, the list kind of goes on and on for what she innovated in the world

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 of film.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.560
 So we've got the first narrative movies.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.760
 We've got the first movies where gender roles were swapped and they showed men at home sewing

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.080
 and doing the housework, and the women actually going off and being actually, you know, big

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.080
 business jobs and so on, which was...

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.160
 Wasn't that in the year 2000?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160
 That was the...

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160
 I think the name of that film.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.600
 It was the first gender roles.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600
 Right.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 That's brilliant.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.760
 She did the first All African-American film.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.920
 No one had done that to that point.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.160
 That was 1912, a fool in his money.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.720
 Apparently, it was a bit sort of behind, though, in terms of the racial politics of the time.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.440
 But it was the first time African-Americans were cast into films, entirely in a film.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.240
 So she did so many things that were just unbelievably forward-thinking.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240
 Yeah.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.360
 And this is right at the beginning of filming the first Fast and Furious film.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.360
 Yeah.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360
 That's right.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360
 Yeah.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360
 Yeah.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360
 Yeah.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.360
 Yeah.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360
 Yeah.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360
 With a young Vin Diesel.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360
 Yeah.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.360
 It's pronounced Van.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:50.600
 On the fool in his money, it was another one of her works that was considered lost for

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.000
 ages, and then it was found in a flea market in Stockton, California.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Wow.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.600
 So she's left like little Easter eggs.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600
 I mean, maybe not deliberately.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 Right, yeah.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.800
 But she's got her finger into loads of cinematic pies.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.840
 I do like the sound of her masterpiece, The Life of Christ.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840
 Yeah.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.840
 Sounds good.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.760
 So there's a huge, like huge film, 35 Minutes Long, which at the time was an epic Lord of

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760
 the Rings style.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.760
 Yeah.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.760
 So 35 Minutes Long, right?

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.960
 Do you think people after 20 minutes were going, "Oh, for fuck's sake, I'm glad those

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.960
 were exploding everywhere?"

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.120
 But that's, I think, for a film that was 35 minutes long in total.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.560
 And again, 1906, so incredibly early film days.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:33.200
 It had 25 different sets for a 35-minute film and 300 extras.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.080
 The 300 extras is, you know, if you're filming a scene where there's a big crowd.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.080
 Sure.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.920
 But at the time, it was impressive stuff, I guess.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.920
 Yeah, definitely.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.080
 They had the first-ever pan shot, didn't they?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080
 Really?

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.160
 So she kind of panned across these 300 people.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160
 People must have freaked out.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160
 I know.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.160
 What's happening?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.000
 Well, you know that thing about the train.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.800
 So I think we've mentioned this once before on this show, which is that one of the earliest

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.200
 films was, was it the Lumiere's?

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200
 Or was it?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.200
 Yeah, it was.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.840
 It was a train arriving at some gah.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.520
 It was a French coastal tower called La Ciutat.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.060
 And it was one shot, 50 seconds, and the urban legend is that people freaked out and ran

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.680
 to the back of the room because they were so perturbed at the train coming towards them.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.400
 And there aren't actually contemporary sources.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.640
 And also the train is coming in diagonally.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.600
 So it doesn't look like it's going to burst into the room.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.520
 But I think I buy it, actually, and I'm saying about it, despite there being no evidence

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.520
 contemporary that it actually happened.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.440
 But people react to films, people shout at, you know, all people shout in a big way at

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440
 the cinema.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440
 Yeah.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440
 Yeah.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.600
 Well, there's a big, there's a big trend going on at the moment on, it's either Instagram

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600
 or TikTok.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.680
 I've seen the video where you expect something to happen and the person filming it tricks

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.880
 you by throwing the object at the camera.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.920
 And I probably went, whoa, so you can produce that effect.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920
 Right.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.920
 So I buy it as well.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920
 Yeah.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920
 Yeah.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920
 I buy it three.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920
 Okay.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920
 No, I don't buy it at all.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920
 It's a bullshit.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.600
 I think it's classic of, isn't it funny how these people in the past were more stupid

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.000
 than us that they would fall for this kind of thing?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Yeah.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Well.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 I also have no evidence.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 I think you are probably right.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.200
 I was reading about Florence Lawrence.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.280
 What's so funny about Florence Lawrence?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.280
 Nothing.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.280
 Nothing at all.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.280
 First ever movie star, maybe.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.280
 Really?

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280
 Yeah.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.120
 So she was making very early films, but she insisted that her name be on the credits.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120
 Okay.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.720
 Because in those days, it would just be actors and you wouldn't say who was in it.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.200
 And she became quite well known.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.880
 And so she could insist that her name would be on there.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.920
 And she was, she was originally vaudeville.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.600
 She was known as baby flow, the child wonder whistler.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.760
 So she would go on stage with her mom and she would be an amazing at whistling.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760
 Really?

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760
 Yeah.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.800
 And she also was one of the first people to own a car.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:01.520
 And she invented the indicator on a car and the stop breaking lights on a car.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520
 Oh, the lights.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.520
 Okay.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.520
 Break.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 Yeah.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520
 Everyone before then.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520
 They were all still driving around.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520
 They were like, what are we going to do?

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.520
 It was like speed.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.520
 It was like very, very slow.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.520
 And they're all going at 10 miles an hour.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520
 So it's fine.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520
 Yeah.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.520
 It was slightly different.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.320
 So her indicator was like the shape of an arm.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.600
 And she would press a button and the arm would sort of wave to the side that she was

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.600
 going to go.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600
 More fun.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600
 Much more fun.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.440
 And then the stop sign would be like a arm coming out going, I'm going to stop.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.440
 I'm going to stop.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440
 Wow.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.440
 At the back of the car.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440
 That's so cool.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440
 It's clever, isn't it?

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440
 But yeah.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440
 And she was like the first film star as well.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440
 What a pivot in her career.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.440
 Yeah.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440
 Cool.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:43.580
 The thing about her back to A Guy is that I love that she was so active in trying to

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.840
 scout for the locations that she would put herself into weird situations.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.040
 So she was almost like an immersive documentary maker at the same time.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.760
 She'd go to Orphanages and she would integrate herself there and she would go to…

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.760
 No way.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760
 No way.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760
 No way.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.760
 She was a child.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.720
 I imagine Daniel Day-Lewis turns into an orphanage.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.440
 Pretend I'm not here, guys.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.480
 Daniel Day-Lewis in his little red wig.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:14.920
 Yeah, no, sorry, that's the wrong term, but like she would go to Opium Parlor.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920
 She would go to…

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920
 Okay.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.000
 She would go to prisons.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 She would…

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 She was invited to watch…

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 In the hall there.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 In the hall there.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 In the hall there.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Actually, yeah.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 It does sound just like a wild night, actually.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.520
 A crazy night last night when I came in at Orphanage.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.520
 But yeah.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520
 That does sound cool.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520
 Yeah.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.760
 And I quite like that she used to have a sign on her…

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.120
 So kind of like in Ted Lasso where Belive was up on the wall.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.160
 She used to have a sign up on all of her sets, which was Be Natural and The Idea for Actors

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.160
 and so on.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.640
 I mean, another innovation of sort of like, you know, let's just make this look like

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640
 a normal thing.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.720
 Oh, just so cool, yeah.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720
 I think she's cool.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.600
 And the fact about people that she possibly might have inspired, because like we talked

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600
 about her fooling us money.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600
 Maybe not the…

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600
 Yeah.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.880
 Not a film that would translate today but had the first all African-American cast.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.880
 Yeah.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.880
 So that was in 1912.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.880
 And in 1919, Oscar Michaud, who's like considered to be the first African-American filmmaker,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.440
 he made his first film.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.120
 So like that's a whole like seven years beforehand.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120
 Yeah.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:24.040
 Also, I think one of the first female African-American directors, Maria P. Williams, worked on the

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040
 Flames of Roth.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.080
 But she, okay, so this is how she died.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.680
 I'm bringing it up because it's very mysterious.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680
 Okay.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.960
 So she produced and wrote in this film in the same year her husband died and she went

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.760
 on to marry another man.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.080
 And then she died in 1932.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.320
 This is Maria P. Williams after being called away from her home by a stranger who requested

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.680
 help for his ill brother and then was found shot to death on the side of a road several

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.680
 miles from her home.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680
 Oh my god.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.200
 The murder remains unsolved.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.560
 Ironically, the plot for Flames of Roth concerns the investigation of a murder after a robbery.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560
 Wow.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560
 That is interesting.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.360
 How do you solve a problem like Maria P. Williams?

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.360
 Just one weird thing off the back of Maria P. Williams.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.360
 Oh yeah.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:17.360
 So the guy who invented the film camera, Louis Le Prince, French guy, moved to Leeds and

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.760
 created the film camera five years before anyone else did.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760
 So he was pre-Lumiere brothers.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760
 He was pre-everybody basically.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760
 Oh wow.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.760
 He made a working film camera.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.000
 He made some films in round-tail Leeds and then he disappeared.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Really?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.640
 And we have no idea what happened to him either.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.720
 He may have been bumped off.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.280
 There is a kind of lurid theory that Edison had him knocked off, which I don't think

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.280
 I believe.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.280
 Really?

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.480
 But he was first by years as well.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.480
 Louis Le Prince.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.480
 Yeah.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.480
 In Leeds.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.480
 Yeah.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480
 Yeah.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.480
 He's got such a sexy name and then it's like...

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.480
 Not that Leeds makes it less sexy but it's sort of like...

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.480
 It sort of changes the vibe.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.360
 Leeds is a very sexy place, isn't it?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.360
 Is it?

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.040
 I went on a mini-walking tour of Leeds after our last show there.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.040
 Yeah.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.040
 Walk up in an orphanage.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:05.320
 It's either one who...there was one who kind of got on a train and then they never saw

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.320
 them again.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320
 It's that one.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320
 Another filmmaker.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.320
 I think it's this guy.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.320
 Is it?

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320
 Yeah.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.240
 I didn't write down how he went missing but yeah.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.920
 When you're on a film set they call it a shoot.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.920
 Coincidence.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920
 Oh yeah.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:24.680
 I thought a long time before saying that and I think it's better than I did.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.680
 No need for doubt that.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.920
 Can I give you a quick quiz before we move on?

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.920
 Yeah.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.920
 Raquel Welsh.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.920
 Yes.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.640
 The actor has a world record.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.280
 She's done something 15 times that no one else has done 15 times.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.280
 Raquel Welsh who just died.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.280
 Yeah.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.520
 Raquel Welsh of the third bikini from One Million Years BC.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.520
 Yeah.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.520
 The very same.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.520
 She's done something 15 times.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520
 Yeah.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.520
 Is it a film?

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.520
 Is it a film related record?

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.160
 A female film actor related thing.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:59.760
 She was the first female film actor to refuse to answer questions on her fur bikini 15 times.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.760
 I don't know.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.920
 The start of that sentence she runs such a good run there selfie and then it went wrong

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920
 at the end.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.920
 I'm not familiar with Raquel Welsh.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.920
 No.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.920
 15 times.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.320
 Did she play the same person 15 times?

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.320
 No she didn't.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.360
 She did the same action 15 times in different movies.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360
 A gesture.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.360
 A V-sign.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360
 V-sign.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.360
 It was a horrible thing with it.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.360
 Oh that's good.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360
 Yeah.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.360
 Stop it.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.360
 Like a MGM roar?

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.360
 Did she do a sort of...

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.360
 That was her.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.360
 No.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.360
 That was a lion.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.360
 A gesture.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.360
 A tiger actually.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.360
 A tiger.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.360
 Sorry.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.360
 The chicken dance.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.360
 The fist.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.360
 No.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.360
 She did the YMC at No.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.360
 That's good.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360
 I feel like we're going to hear a long time.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.360
 A gesture.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.560
 Did she change the spelling of her name 15 times?

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.560
 No.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.040
 She holds the world record for kicking a male character in the balls in a movie.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040
 Wow.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.040
 With 15.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.040
 Wow.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040
 Isn't that great?

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040
 That is an incredible fact.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.200
 Do we know who's the kicky?

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.760
 It was a different kicky each time.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.760
 Oh.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.760
 Yeah.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.760
 So it's a different movie.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.760
 She was almost like her catchphrase.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760
 Oh that's her signature move.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.760
 That's great.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.760
 God that'd be terrible when you're sort of going, "Oh that's one exciting move.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.760
 Who's my co-lead?"

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.760
 Fuck.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:15.880
 Okay it is time for fact number three and that is...

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880
 Andy.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.920
 My fact is that half of American men are confident they could safely land a plane if the pilot

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.960
 was incapacitated.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.960
 That's reassuring.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.960
 It is isn't it?

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.580
 As long as two American men are on your flight, one of them will be fine to do it.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.580
 Brilliant.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.580
 Yeah.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.580
 That's funny.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.580
 This is a survey that you've conducted.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.580
 There are 20,000 adults.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.460
 I think adults all in America, whether they would be quite confident, very confident,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.640
 not confident, not at all confident, or they didn't know whether they would be able to

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:48.060
 land a plane and I think overall it was a third of people who said they could do it

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:57.800
 and 46% of men, 20% of women, so buck up, you know, and also they specified a couple of

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.800
 things.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.200
 They specified you get help from air traffic control and things like that.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.440
 So you're not just totally in the cockpit by yourself because obviously that would be

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.440
 incredibly terrifying.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440
 Yeah.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:12.760
 And young people also more confident than older people, people between 18 and 44, again

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.940
 nearly half of them think, yeah, I could do that.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.940
 Yeah.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.200
 Those over 45, less sure of themselves.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200
 Yeah.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.080
 So let's do a little survey around here.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.080
 Sophie, do you think you could?

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.400
 Do I think I could land a plane?

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.400
 Land a plane.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.400
 You've got a headset on?

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.400
 You've got a headset on.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.400
 You know.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.400
 Okay.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.400
 Yeah, I'm getting into it.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.400
 I've got a headset on.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.400
 I've got my headset on.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.400
 Can't find it's there.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.400
 No.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400
 Absolutely not.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.400
 They're all dead.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400
 No.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.640
 In my scenario, they've just been knocked out.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.600
 They've just had some dodgy fish, right?

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600
 Exactly.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.600
 Yeah.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600
 They're awake.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600
 They're just a bit, they're feeling a bit queasy.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.600
 So they decided to knock off shit.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.600
 Okay.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.420
 In my one, I look at the pilots and one is Maria, the filmmaker, and the other is the

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.420
 Leedsman.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.420
 La France.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.420
 La France.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.420
 Yeah.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.400
 I think I could land a plane.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.400
 Okay.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.400
 Okay.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400
 That's good to hear.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.400
 Okay.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.400
 Good.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.400
 Good.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.400
 That wasn't a test.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.400
 I think I could, but I would do it extremely reluctantly.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.400
 Yeah.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:16.200
 That's what the passengers want to hear over the next time, isn't it?

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.400
 I don't really want to, but we'll be landing in the next 15 minutes.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.400
 Yeah.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400
 One way or another.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.400
 That's exciting.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.400
 Okay.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400
 Andy.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.400
 I think I probably couldn't actually.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.400
 Couldn't.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.400
 Couldn't.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.080
 I mean, I would, I would give it my best shot, but I think that moment where the ground comes

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.800
 up really quite fast, where you're landing and you're going very, very far.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.400
 It's going over a hundred miles an hour.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.680
 I think it would be very hard.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680
 Yeah.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.680
 I'm not saying it would clap for me.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.680
 I'm just saying.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:49.400
 I think technically I couldn't, but I mentally, I would say yes to trying it because I think

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.400
 this is the thing.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.120
 You need someone to keep it to go.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.320
 Someone's got to try and do it.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.220
 And I think if I was put in that position, I would say, okay, yeah, I'll give it a go.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.720
 I'm going to have assistance.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.720
 Yeah.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.720
 Yeah.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.720
 I can't, I don't think I can do it.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.160
 So my wife's a helicopter pilot and I think I've said on here before that she says that

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.160
 I'd have about 50, 50 chance of landing a helicopter, having watched her do it.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.480
 So I know what she's doing.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.840
 But having spoken to some commercial pilots, because we talked about this on QI, I don't

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.840
 think I will be able to do it.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.840
 It is hard.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.920
 If you're in the, if you're in the situation, we should say, yeah, the most important thing

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.680
 to do is find the headset, put it on and find the emergency frequency because they didn't

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.680
 monitor that.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.720
 Also, if you're speaking to someone, take your finger off the button when you finish

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.720
 speaking.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.720
 Otherwise, no more here.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.720
 They can't get back to you.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720
 Yeah.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.880
 But that was the funniest thing about this whole, this whole survey is that when they

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.720
 talk to pilots about it, I think in your head, you think, yeah, I'll just open the door,

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720
 put on the headset.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.720
 It's all going to be fine.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.040
 They're like, you won't even get past the headset moment in trying to land this plane.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.920
 You won't even get past the door in much, but I mean, they've obviously got very secure

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.920
 cockpits.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.840
 When I asked my wife about this, because like I say, she is a pilot that she literally

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.800
 said exactly what they say on these things.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.500
 She was like, well, like, will I be able to tell what the headset is?

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.040
 That's the first thing she said.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.240
 It's weird because you would think it would just be there.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240
 Right?

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.800
 You know, it's like when you can't find your earphones and you're like, you're busy and

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800
 you're heading out.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.800
 Yeah.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.800
 They actually have tried this as well.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800
 They've tried this.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.920
 A study New Zealand's University of Waikato asked 780 people if they could land a small

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.520
 plane quotes without dying or as well as a pilot could.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.520
 Yeah.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.520
 Yeah.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520
 And so this is really interesting.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.600
 Some of them got shown a four minute video of pilots landing a plane, right?

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.920
 But the video didn't show the pilot's hands.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.480
 So actually it was a useless video in terms of actually learning how to land a plane.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.480
 Totally useless.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480
 Right?

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.840
 But people who had seen the video were more confident in their abilities than people who

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.620
 hadn't seen the video.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.680
 It's called a rapid illusion.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.880
 You see someone doing something and you think, yeah, I, yeah, okay, I broadly understand

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.880
 how that works.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.880
 Yeah.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.880
 Yeah.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880
 Actually you don't.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880
 Here's the other thing.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.880
 This is impenetrable door.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.880
 Well done.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.880
 Stage one done.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.120
 You found the headphones.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.760
 You've somehow worked out the emergency frequency of 121.5.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.760
 Yeah.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.880
 We've worked out to take your finger off the buttons so that you could hear them.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.640
 Surely you're on your home stretch.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.280
 You know, you're coming in, but then they make the point you're talking to an air traffic

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280
 controller.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.520
 He doesn't know how to land a plane.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.920
 They're just telling you that the space is free.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.920
 Yeah.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.920
 Come on down.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.920
 You're fine.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.720
 So there's been cases where in the past people have had to have guidance to be

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.360
 landed by an air controller and they've had to go, hang on, let me go find someone who

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.160
 knows how to land a plane and have to go and bring them and help them get guided down.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.640
 I really dislike that this is how a plane is, is, is landed.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640
 Yeah.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.560
 I really would have thought by now it was basically completely automated.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560
 There was no skill.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.560
 Yeah.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.480
 Well, the thing is they do have auto land.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:48.360
 So an airplane does have auto land, but you need to program stuff into it.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.440
 So you need to program in how fast you're coming in, what direction you're coming in

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.600
 from and you still have to click when you want your flaps to come down, whatever that

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.600
 means.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600
 Yeah.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.720
 And also when you want your landing gear to come down, whatever that, no, I know what

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.720
 that means.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.280
 And they need to be done at exact moments and you need to know when that is.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.800
 So even though you have auto land, you still need to do stuff.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.800
 Yeah.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.280
 And it's, and then on top of that, even if you, if you're on a, let's say a Boeing

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.840
 big airplane and we need a pilot to land this, you need to know what your plane is.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.560
 It's like going into a different kind of car.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.800
 You can't just like, you can't just.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.440
 I think it's even more complicated than that.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.760
 I think what I mean is I can get into a higher car and I'm fine.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.560
 I don't need to brag.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.560
 Do you go into the higher car and go, do you have a Ford Fiesta cause that's all I can

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560
 drive.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560
 It's all a qualified.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.400
 Um, no, I guess the point is, is that you need to, with a plane, you, it, you absolutely

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.240
 need to know how to land a Boeing plane versus a biplane.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.240
 I think it's never happened with a big commercial passenger plane.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.240
 Yeah.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.000
 I don't think a situation's ever come up because often, I mean, like loads of flights

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.720
 have pilots who are flying as passengers that they call them deadhead crew.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.840
 And they just, you know, but it has happened once or twice, uh, in 2009, there was a pilot

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.380
 who was flying from Florida to Mississippi and the pilot died and the passenger, Doug

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:10.240
 White was on board with his family, family of four, and he had a private pilot certificate,

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.280
 although he wasn't familiar with the plane, but he did manage it because the air traffic

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.920
 control people, they found a flight instructor who guided them down in that.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.920
 There you go.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.920
 Had to run off and get a flight instructor.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920
 Yeah.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.240
 But that was obviously, that was a small plane of, you know,

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240
 Happened last year.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240
 2022.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240
 Yeah.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.000
 Um, around Florida, the pilot collapsed or something.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.160
 We don't know exactly what happened.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.360
 There was a guy in there with him, it was a very small plane and he sat there and the

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.520
 controls doesn't know what to do, rings traffic control and they say, well, where are you?

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.240
 He's like, well, how the fuck should I know?

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240
 Yeah.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.240
 He's like, well, can you see the coast?

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.080
 And he's like, yeah, we can see the coast.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.440
 And they said, okay, we'll fly either north or south, just follow the coast.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.440
 Right.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.040
 And then the air traffic controllers could look on their screen and they looked for

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.560
 a plane that was following the coast in any direction.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.920
 And they managed to work out, it was them and they managed to get them down.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.520
 You're looking so stressed, Sophie.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.520
 It's really upsetting me.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.520
 Are you an anxious flyer normally before, before we've told you all this stuff?

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.560
 No, I thought I could land the plane.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.560
 I've been so confident.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.560
 That's so funny.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.200
 I was in a helicopter with my wife and when you're on the radio, you can hear what everyone

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:27.040
 else is doing and we were just flying along wherever we were going and there was a guy

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.920
 who was like, help, help, get me out of here, get me out of here, get me out of here.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.280
 Telling the air traffic control and apparently what happened was the red arrows were flying

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280
 past him.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.840
 He was in a tiny little plane and he's like, there's red arrows on my left.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.440
 There's red arrows on my right.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440
 What do I do?

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.160
 He's leaving the red arrows at that moment.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.320
 Just release the smoke, like the others, just time it right.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320
 Wave to the king.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.680
 I'm not really sure of plane etiquette generally when I was going to America.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.760
 I didn't realise that you're not allowed to drink the alcohol that you buy duty free

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.760
 on the plane.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.760
 Oh, okay, yeah.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.760
 That is odd.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.760
 No, they ask you not to, yeah.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760
 That is a fact.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.240
 So, yeah, I was like, oh, this is a great hat, I'll buy like a bottle of whiskey.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.440
 So I was sitting on a plane and just pouring like doubles and triples for me and my friend,

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.440
 Laurie.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:23.640
 And the hostess, what passing was like, you're not allowed to do that, you're not allowed

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.640
 to drink that on the plane.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.240
 So we both just thought that she'd meant just like bottoms up.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240
 So we were like, so sorry.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.240
 And I was just like trying to drink that.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.240
 She was like, you can't have that one here.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240
 So we're trying to get rid of it.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.800
 I had never been kicked off a flight though, but in May 2013, somebody was kicked off a

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.360
 flight for doing the most amazing thing, which was singing Whitney Houston song, I Will Always

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.320
 Love You, repeatedly.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.320
 Like first edition.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.320
 Okay.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.360
 Well, that's a bit annoying, but you know, find second, third edition is funny.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360
 Yeah.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.360
 Yeah.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.360
 Yeah.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.360
 And then decreasing return.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.360
 Was it stupidly?

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.360
 Who did it?

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:06.160
 It was stupidly on a domestic service from Los Angeles to New York and it was diverted.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.640
 So it didn't actually land where it was meant to land.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.640
 It couldn't have been diverted because of this.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.520
 It was diverted to Kansas City so they could remove one of the planes.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.520
 To Houston.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.520
 Imagine that.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.520
 This reminds me of a song.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520
 They landed it.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520
 Motown in Detroit.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.520
 Oh my God.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.520
 Oh wow.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.520
 That's amazing.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.520
 But why was the passenger...

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.520
 Who was the passenger?

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520
 I assume she was mentally unwell.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.520
 Right.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520
 I haven't.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.520
 Well, I mean, I assume that she might just have been a legend, but apparently when she

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520
 was...

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520
 It's a fine line.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.600
 When she was let off in handcuffs, she was still singing.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600
 So.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600
 Wow.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.120
 Can I tell you one more thing about overconfidence?

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120
 Which is what this is about.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.880
 So I just looked up other surveys of what people think they can do.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880
 Yeah, brilliant.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880
 Right?

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.280
 So there was a survey about what works of art people think they could replicate.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280
 Oh yeah.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280
 Brilliant.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.280
 And it went from...

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.280
 So Mondrian, is that...

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.280
 Yeah, it's just lines.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.960
 It's just lines and blocks of color.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.160
 Mali Avic I could do.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.160
 That black...

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160
 It's just a black square.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160
 Okay.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.160
 Perfect.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.160
 That's good.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.160
 So one in three Americans think they could replicate Mondrian's composition in red, blue

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.160
 and yellow.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.160
 Which is quite...

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.160
 Yeah.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.720
 But it's mostly sort of straight lines and blocks of color.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.880
 23% think they could do Van Gogh's self-portrait with a straw hat.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880
 Which is wonderful.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880
 Wait a minute.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.320
 If you're doing a Van Gogh self-portrait and you're replicating it, do you draw Van

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.120
 Gogh or draw yourself in a straw hat?

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.120
 Oh, sorry.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.120
 You draw Van Gogh.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.360
 You're just replicating that work of art.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360
 Got it.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.360
 You don't have to cut off your own ear.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.360
 It's fine.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:33.000
 18% thought they could replicate Vermeer's The Milkmaid, which is one of the great works

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 by a Dutch master.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 Right.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 So it's really, really beautiful.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Yeah.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 And get this.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.160
 11% of Americans think they could probably or definitely replicate Michelangelo's David.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.160
 Wow.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.160
 Probably or definitely.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.160
 Probably.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.160
 Yeah.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.160
 Probably.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160
 I'll say probably.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.160
 I don't want to see Van Gogh.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.160
 Do you have to do it exact or could you do it like...

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.160
 I think you need to get it pretty dead on.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.160
 Yeah.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.160
 Yeah.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.160
 Okay.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.160
 Yeah.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.160
 That's amazing.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.160
 Half of British men between 16 and 24 think they could dodge a train.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.160
 Oh, I think I could dodge a train.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.480
 Yeah, but I mean like what qualifies as dodging a train?

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480
 Good point.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.480
 If you're trespassing on the tracks.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.800
 Well, the thing is about trains is they can only go where the tracks are.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.880
 So all you have to do is get off the tracks and you've dodged it.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.920
 Well, you two, Dan and James, are part of the problem, right?

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.720
 Of young men trespassing on railway tracks.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.160
 I know that is a problem, yeah.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.720
 Thinking you can get off in time.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.360
 And actually it's very confusing when you're on tracks because all the train noise goes

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360
 out to the side.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360
 This is a weird thing.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.520
 It's harder to tell than you think when there's a train coming along.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.440
 So Network Rail, a while ago, asked Rapper Wretch32.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.440
 Oh, we've met him.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.440
 Who we met once?

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440
 Yeah.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.440
 On Sunday branch.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.440
 Yeah.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.440
 It was a classic.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.440
 It was a classic booking pair.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.440
 Yeah.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440
 I think it's Wretch32.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440
 Wretch32.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440
 Yeah.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440
 That was a foul pair.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.440
 Wretch32.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.440
 I called it Mr.32.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.440
 Yeah.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440
 It's called Wretch32.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.440
 Wretch32, yeah.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440
 Why is it 3-2 instead of 32?

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.440
 Is that after a football score?

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.440
 Yeah.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.440
 Because it looks like 32, doesn't it?

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.440
 Yeah, but that's just his name.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.440
 I actually don't know why it's 3-2.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.440
 Where's the 1?

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.440
 I don't know.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440
 Where's the 1?

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.440
 Where's the 1?

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.440
 3-2.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.440
 3-2 is a countdown.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.440
 Wretch32.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.440
 Oh, right.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.440
 Let's see.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.440
 3-2-1.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.440
 Here's a train.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.440
 These are the mysteries, Andy.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440
 Why is it thick and not thick?

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.440
 Why is it weakened and not weakened?

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.440
 These are the problems our podcast has.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440
 What did Wretch32 do?

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.440
 They asked him to test what it's like being on the tracks when a train is coming in.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.440
 By putting him in the simulator.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440
 Yeah.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.440
 And he said, yes, it is actually very quiet and confusing and it's easy to be.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.440
 And he said he had great hearing, but actually it was confusing.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440
 Yeah.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.440
 What a great team-up of Network Rail and Wretch32.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.440
 That is incredible.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.440
 But they were trying to get to young men, basically.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.440
 You were more likely to be trespassing.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.440
 He knew how to pronounce his name.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.440
 Okay.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.440
 It's time for our next episode.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440
 Okay.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.440
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.440
 And that is James.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.440
 Okay.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.440
 My fact this week is that the first person to use the phrase roast beef sandwich in English

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.440
 had a surname, which is an anagram of the word steak.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.440
 It's so good.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.440
 It's a classic James fact.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.440
 I don't think anyone has ever come up with this fact before now.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.440
 This is new, right?

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.440
 Yeah.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.440
 I can't imagine anyone have the time to do that.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.440
 But also this is you had a different fact, which we said, oh, we're not sure about.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440
 So you came up with this.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.440
 I love James always does this in desperation as well.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.440
 This was real desperation.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:41.440
 So my original fact was that John Keats, spoiler alert, the famous most romantic of the romantic

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:48.440
 poets claimed to be able to eat two dozen roast beef sandwiches in a single sitting,

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.440
 which he did say in one of his letters, but it's clear when Andy read it and pointed

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.440
 it out that actually he was saying metaphorically that he was so hungry, I could eat two dozen

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.440
 sandwiches and perhaps he couldn't actually do it.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.440
 And we'd already researched roast beef sandwiches and Keats.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.440
 I needed to find anything else about him.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:14.440
 And it turns out in the OED that he's the first reference of roast beef sandwich and his name

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.440
 is Nanogroma steak and that's where my brain went.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.440
 Because he's not very a steaky kind of poet.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.440
 No.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.440
 That's why he really likes about the original incorrect fact is he was quite Waif-like, wasn't

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.440
 he, Keats?

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:32.440
 And he was very sort of, I don't want to say wishy-washy, but you know, Byron would say

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.440
 that for sure.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440
 Yeah.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440
 But yeah.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440
 Big boy Byron.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.440
 Big boy Byron.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440
 What is Burgess?

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:43.440
 Competitive eating champs in North Ireland.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.440
 Yeah.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.440
 Yeah.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.440
 It's kind of, yeah, Keats is, so Keats, for anyone who's not a fan of Keats, John Keats,

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.440
 died aged, what, 25?

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.440
 Yeah.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.440
 And died of tuberculosis, consumption, which was a very poetic, seeming disease, you know,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.440
 it was associated with creative types and wrote everything he wrote, obviously, before

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.440
 the age of 25.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.440
 Basically, all Keats poems are early Keats because there was no late Keats.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.440
 Yeah.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.440
 And still wrote a lot of really, actually really good stuff.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.440
 I was thinking, I was never a huge fan of Keats when I was studying because I did English,

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.440
 but actually I looked back and I thought, yeah, there are some real bangers here.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.440
 Yeah.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.440
 Yeah.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.440
 Actually, it's not early Keats because early Keats, he burnt up, didn't he?

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.440
 His earliest poems.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.440
 Wow, some of those.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.440
 Yeah.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.440
 He just, yeah, yeah, he just thought, I don't like these.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.440
 And so he just, he burnt those over fire.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.440
 So actually, we don't have early Keats.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.440
 We've got sort of mid Keats.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.440
 Right.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.440
 Yeah.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.440
 So I was weirdly drawn to Keats' diet as well.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.440
 So I heard that he was voluntarily vegetarian.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440
 Oh, was he?

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.440
 So that's what I had to like sort of cure himself of his love sickness for Fanny.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.440
 Right.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.440
 His big love, but also he got put on a lot of fad diets by his doctor who, shall I say,

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:54.440
 did not have his best address and prescribed him a diet of bread milk and anchovies because

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.440
 he thought that his tuberculosis was in his stomach.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.440
 Yeah.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.440
 So it was hard because when you read his writing, he seemed to really love his food.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.440
 And yet he just had to eat all of this really bland stuff.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.440
 It must have, he must have hated it.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.440
 Doctors at the time were just so bad.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.440
 Yeah.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.440
 As in, his doctor misdiagnosed his tuberculosis as, I think, stress.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.440
 Annoying.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.440
 He said that mental exertion is an application.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.440
 Right.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.440
 So basically, he's a little nerd that thinks too much.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.440
 Yeah.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.440
 And they bled him way too much.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.440
 They took pints of his blood, which is not helpful.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.440
 Is any amount of bleeding good?

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.440
 I guess it might have helped some conditions, but I can't think of any which would have been helped.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.440
 But I mean, Lord Byron also was bled hugely.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.440
 As in, they took pints of Byron's blood and they made him very weak and they contributed to his death.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.440
 Yeah.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.440
 But he also, he did, you know, he was a bit fussy about his food.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.440
 There's a story, and this is right at the end of his days.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.440
 So he did die very young at tuberculosis.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:54.440
 And one of the ways that he tried to cure it was to get out of the UK and go to Rome and sort of try and soak up the sun.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.440
 And so he was staying there with his friend, Joseph Severin.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.440
 And they stayed at this house and there was a landlady there who used to make them food every single day.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.440
 And he hated it.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.440
 Hated this food.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440
 She used to make them spaghetti.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440
 And he just absolutely hates it.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.440
 He's in Rome when they were all right.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.440
 And so one day she comes in, hands them the spaghetti.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.440
 He takes the plate, keeps eye contact with her, walks over to the window, opens it up.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:20.440
 While maintaining the eye contact, just spills the plate out and all its contents onto the ground to make his point.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.440
 Rather than just saying, "Can we get something else?"

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.440
 Oh, a child.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.440
 Yeah.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.440
 What a number.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.440
 And actually, lots of the stories about him, they make him a bit more kind of, you know, physical.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.440
 And like, he wasn't such a milk toast after all.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.440
 Oh, he was fighting, didn't he?

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.440
 Well, I was saying he trained as a surgeon was the thing I didn't know about him.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.440
 He trained as a doctor.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.440
 Yeah.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.440
 And, you know, he would set broken bones and he was a dresser at Guy's Hospital and he would assist with surgery.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.440
 One of his jobs was to remove amputated limbs from the field of surgery.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.440
 So it's quite a stressful and impressive job to have, you know.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.440
 Yeah, I read one article asking if he might have been a grave robber.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.440
 Wow.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.440
 Yeah.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.440
 Because at the time, the surgery practice, they would do it on dead bodies.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:06.440
 And you were allowed like maybe two dead bodies a year who were like executed criminals or something like that.

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.440
 But you needed more.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:14.440
 And so they had these resurrectionists who would go around getting bodies out of graves and sell them to the surgeons.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.440
 But there was a couple of people called the Burra Gang.

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.440
 And the Burra Gang were famous for being body snatchers.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:26.440
 But apparently around that time that Keats was working there, they decided they would go on strike.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.440
 They wanted more money for their bodies.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.440
 And so they would stop giving the bodies.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.440
 And so the surgeons had to go out themselves and steal bodies from graves.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:40.440
 And the suggestion might be that maybe Keats, because he was there at the time that this was happening.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440
 Great suggestion.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.440
 I hope it.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440
 I mean, I love it.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.440
 Yeah.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.440
 How do you go on strike as a body snatcher as well?

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.440
 Where do you stand?

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.440
 Do you stand outside the hospital or the graveyard?

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.440
 And what do your sides say?

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.440
 But there's like one of his famous poems, which is called Isabella.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:01.440
 It's about a woman who keeps the head of her father, lover, one of the two.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440
 I think lover.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.440
 Lover in a pot of basil.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.440
 And he explains what it looks like, this, you know, decapitated head.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.440
 And we think because he works as a surgeon, he knew, you know, he knew what dead bodies were like.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.440
 So his poems were real.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.440
 Yeah, he's lived a proper life.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.440
 Oh, here's one thing we don't know about Keats.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.440
 We don't know if he ever rode a bike.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.440
 Oh, okay.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.440
 Because he would have had the chance to.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.440
 Yeah, brilliant.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.440
 This was the, the Velocipede was the very early, it got called the daddy horse as well.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.440
 It's a bike with no pedals, basically.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.440
 So you straddle it.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.440
 You straddle it and you wheel it along the ground with your feet.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.440
 Like a kid's bike.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.440
 Like a very early starter bike for kids, except this was the most fashionable thing.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.440
 Yeah.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:44.440
 And we know that he wrote to his brother, George, who'd left for America in 1818.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.440
 He wrote to his brother saying the new thing today is a machine called the Velocipede.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.440
 It has a wheel carriage to ride cock horse on, sitting astride and pushing it along with the toes.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.440
 And it's very exciting.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.440
 So we know that he knew what they were, but we don't know if he ever had a go.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.440
 Because he doesn't say on the latter.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.440
 Did he ever use roller skates?

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.440
 I don't think he did.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.440
 Oh, because his name is an anagram of skate.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.440
 So it's just.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:08.440
 Oh, wow.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.440
 See, Sophie, this is what it's like.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:17.440
 I feel like Keats always seemed like I did study English, but I don't remember having a great love for Keats.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.440
 Just because I think he was a bit more like, a bit like softer and gentler,

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.440
 which does tally with Ben Wishall playing him in Bright Star.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.440
 And Ben Wishall said that it was the highlight of his career so far.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440
 Play police?

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440
 Yeah.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440
 Really?

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.440
 But that was pre Paddington.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.440
 Oh, okay.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.440
 Who was your, who were your literary heroes when you did English?

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.440
 Literary heroes.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:43.440
 I mean, I think what my English degree did sort of kill any enjoyment or passion I had for the subject.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.440
 But out of the Romantics, I liked Blake.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.440
 Yeah.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.440
 I liked how he did all his little etchings as well.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.440
 Yeah.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440
 Who else did I like?

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440
 Well, you were Byron fan.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440
 Yeah.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.440
 Because that's a bit, that's a bit of a dividing jets and sharks thing.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.440
 Byron and Keats, you know, Beetle stones.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.440
 Oh, yeah, you can maybe.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.440
 Well, a little bit, a little bit.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.440
 As in Byron is much more fun.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.440
 There are many more jokes in Byron.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.440
 It's just fun.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.440
 But it's also fun.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.440
 But also they had a rivalry during their lifetime.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.440
 Well, Byron was a bit rude about Keats.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.440
 I don't know if Keats was ever rude back about Byron.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.440
 Probably couldn't think of anything.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.440
 But no, he actually, he did run a lot of great stuff, Keats.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.440
 Obviously, he is one of the greats.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.440
 Interestingly, Byron, when he died, so he died out in...

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.440
 Greece.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.440
 In Greece, he was in, was it a lake or the ocean?

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.440
 Remember, it was the ocean, I think, right?

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.440
 He drowned.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.440
 No, Shelly drowned.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.440
 Yeah.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.440
 Byron died of fever.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.440
 Byron, he did swim across the Bosphorus.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.440
 Byron didn't he?

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440
 But he didn't drown.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.440
 I don't think.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.440
 No, he died of a painful fever.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.440
 Sorry, I'm confused.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.440
 When part of identifying who Shelly was when they found him

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.440
 was not only his clothes, but he had a book of Keats's poetry

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440
 in his pocket.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.440
 Oh, really?

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.440
 Oh, but yeah, Shelly carried a record of Keats.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.440
 Yeah.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.440
 So Percy Shelly was a vegetarian.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.440
 We talked about earlier how Keats ended up having to be a vegetarian.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.440
 But Percy Shelly was a vegetarian because, well,

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.440
 it's quite forward-thinking, I guess, at the time.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.440
 So he thought that animals used too much land.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.440
 And around that time, there was kind of a lot of Malthusian,

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.440
 kind of the population's going to go through the roof.

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440
 Everyone's going to starve.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.440
 And so he decided to become a vegetarian for that reason.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.440
 But the only thing he would be tempted by was to eat bacon.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.440
 And he just couldn't not eat bacon.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.440
 And there was a guy, a friend of his, called Thomas Jefferson Hogg.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.440
 And Thomas Jefferson Hogg used to just, whenever he saw him,

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.440
 he used to just give him bits of bacon and say,

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.440
 "Oh, just have a bit of bacon, Shelly."

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.440
 That's so funny.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.440
 Because that is a really good reason for being vegetarian.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.440
 But bacon is also the thing that a lot of vegetarians,

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.440
 come across as a vegetarian.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.440
 While we're on food, just back to Keats for a second,

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.440
 he also loved jam.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.440
 He at least ate it.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.440
 So we don't know if he rode a bicycle, but we do know that he ate jam.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.440
 Because...

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.440
 We're piece of it together.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.440
 Because?

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.440
 Because he apologized for spilling some jam on a letter that he'd written.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.440
 And so he wrote, and he also invented new words as a result of this,

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.440
 or a new word as a result of this.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.440
 So he wrote, after spilling the jam,

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.440
 "I have licked it, but it remains very purplu."

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.440
 I don't know whether it's say purple or blue.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.440
 So wrote purplu.

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.440
 Which may be an excellent name for a colour made up of those two.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.440
 Purplu.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.440
 That's how you get to be one of the guys.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.440
 That's the flavour of early Keats.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.440
 It's purplu period.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.440
 I was going to ask, it was mulberry jam, because in that Keats house in Hampstead,

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.440
 where he lived and fell in love with his neighbour,

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.440
 there is a mulberry tree, an ancient mulberry tree,

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.440
 which they think that people hypothesize he stood under and wrote,

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.440
 "O to a nightingale."

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.440
 But whether or not it was there when he was there,

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.440
 it has been adopted into the Queen,

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.440
 basically recipes, had a collection of ancient trees,

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.440
 less than 100 ancient trees, and it's form part of the Queen's canopy.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.440
 What a collection just around the country.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.440
 Yeah, of just royal old trees.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.440
 I think that's nice.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.440
 I've got a riddle for you.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:08.440
 The most famous painting of Keats is of him at Wentworth Place.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.440
 It shows him sitting and coming up with his most famous poem.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.440
 Yeah, I feel like I could knock one of them out.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.440
 Join the queue with a third of American men.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.440
 So he's dead in the painting.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.440
 Oh, what?

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.440
 Okay, so...

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.440
 What is riddle?

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.440
 Riddle me that.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.440
 So someone's painted him, right,

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.440
 and when they painted him,

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.440
 his body was the thing they were painting.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.440
 So it was painted in 1834.

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.440
 He died in 1821.

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.440
 Oh, that's quite a long time afterwards.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.440
 Long time. So, yeah.

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.440
 So the riddle is, oh, is it something like, is it...

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.440
 There isn't a riddle in part.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.440
 Well, none of you has come up with an answer.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.440
 So I feel like it is still a riddle, actually.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.440
 Did he donate his skull to the theatre,

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.440
 and so it's his skull that's depicted in the...

00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440
 No, nice. Not bad.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.440
 Is he painted as an angel?

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.440
 That's another good answer, but no, no, no.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.440
 Seems like no one saw my riddle.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.440
 What's the riddle?

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.440
 How? How is he dead in the painting?

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.440
 How has he depicted so brilliantly 13 years after he died?

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.440
 Oh, he was a twin.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:18.440
 So they just used the twin to model.

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.440
 His mother was the artist.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.440
 That's right. And she said, "I cannot paint this."

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.440
 It's my son.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.440
 No. I don't understand.

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:31.440
 He was... Shall I solve the riddle, will you all?

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.440
 He's dead in the painting, because Halloween party?

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.440
 That's a Halloween party painting.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.440
 Yeah, that's why. And there's a plastic bat in the corner.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.440
 No, no, no. Okay.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.440
 After his death, a death mask was made of him,

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.440
 and it was used as the model.

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:49.440
 And after Keats died in Rome, they made a death mask of his face,

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.440
 and they also did his hand and his foot.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.440
 And there were only two of these death masks for a long time.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.440
 One of them was kept by Joseph Seven,

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.440
 and one was sent to his publisher, which I feel is a weird...

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.440
 I feel that as well.

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.440
 As in if I died? Yeah.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.440
 And we have two masks, and they can go to any two people.

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.440
 Exactly. Yeah.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.440
 I don't want to go to my editor.

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.440
 But no, that's what was painted of him 13 years later.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.440
 Yeah, and the frame of this painting, this is quite romantic.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.440
 Capital art has a lock of his hair in the frame of the painting.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.440
 So there's a little bit of Keats in that original picture.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.440
 That's amazing. Good riddle. Thank you.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.440
 Speaking of siblings of Keats,

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.440
 his little sister was called Fanny,

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.440
 which is the same name as the woman that he was in love with.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.440
 What a creepy little boy.

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.440
 No.

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.440
 He can't marry someone with the same name as you.

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.440
 He can't marry someone with the same name as your sibling.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.440
 He can't get married. He just loved her unrequitedly.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.440
 Unrequitedly, I think.

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.440
 They were engaged, but they never married.

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.440
 And then he died very young.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.440
 I don't think he could be unrequited if they got engaged.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.440
 That's not unrequited, is it?

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.440
 You're absolutely right.

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.440
 That's what my now wife said to me.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.440
 She said, "I will say yes, but just so you know, it's not required."

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.440
 Well, Fanny never took his ring off.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.440
 So Keats gave her a ring.

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.440
 And for the rest of her life, even though she remarried,

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.440
 she still wore the ring that Keats gave her.

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.440
 I think it's a bit of a kick of the guts to her second husband.

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.440
 A bit of a wrap-out.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.440
 I think that's because he's such a romantic...

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.440
 No, actually, it's worse that he's one of the great romantic poets.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.440
 By the way, one of the best and most romantic poets ever loved me

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.440
 and gave me this ring.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.440
 It's a lot of pressure when you're writing a Valentine's card, isn't it?

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.440
 It is.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.440
 Grossly red once a perfume.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.440
 [Laughter]

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:47.440
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.440
