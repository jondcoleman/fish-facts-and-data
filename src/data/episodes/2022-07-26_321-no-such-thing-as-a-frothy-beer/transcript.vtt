00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.280
 Hello and welcome to another working-from-home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.400
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.720
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.280
 four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 Starting with you, James. Okay, my fact this week is that if you were to take a corn on the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 cob and remove each kernel in a row while saying she loves me and then she loves me not,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.720
 then she will always love you not. Right? No. How many, that's quite a long version of that game,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.280
 I'm guessing. Well, it's row by row, right? Row by row, yes, so it's not that long. It's long

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.440
 and disappointing for any lovers doing it. There's no jeopardy, it's just guaranteed lose. There's

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.040
 an argument that it's not quite as romantic as sitting wistfully in a field taking petals off

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 a flower, just going to your fridge and grabbing an old corn on the cob. But this is basically,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.080
 I mean, the fact is that there are even number of kernels on every row of a corn on the cob.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.040
 The best way to check it yourself is to get a corn on the cob from your fridge or your supermarket,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.400
 cut it in half width ways and then look at the sliced parts and you'll get a circular cross-section

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 with the inside of the cob surrounded by corn kernels. And then if you count those kernels,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.800
 they'll always be an even number. Sometimes it's kind of difficult to see because you might have a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.480
 little runty kernel where the bigger ones have kind of squished it out of the way, you know,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.280
 like if you lose a tooth and everything kind of squishes back in that direction. But it always

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.600
 be true, always an even number and it's due to the way that corn on the cob's grow.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.680
 And by the time you finish this process, not only did she love you not, but she's had enough time

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.240
 to escape as far away from you as possible. That's true. It's even possible to peel off a row.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.360
 I really wanted to try this, but I, so I hate sweet corn and I've never touched corn on the cob,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.160
 so I don't know if a row can come off all in one row. No, but like I say, if what you do is cut your

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.560
 corn on the cob in half, then you'll be able to see the cross-section and you'll see the row itself

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.440
 and then you can just pluck off the individual kernels if you want. So you just have to say she loves

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.280
 me not, and she loves me really slowly, as you're blocking each individual kernels. Yeah.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.360
 I mean, if you start with she loves you not, then she loves me, then she loves me not, then you're fine.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.800
 But it's just basically there's an even number. I mean, what a bargain I say.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.120
 And it's because of the way that they grow. If you were to look at it, you'll find most of them

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.480
 have like 14, 16, 18, something like that. Yeah. And apparently this is just a big old,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.400
 well-known thing that people who were into corn or growing corn, you know, know about. And it used to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.280
 get hit the news. I think sometimes it still does. It hits the news if someone finds an odd numbered

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.400
 kernel. Like I found a newspaper report from 1949. It was sort of local rather than national news,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.280
 but it was all capital letters. Freak ear reported in an Iowa newspaper. Wow. So did you know,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.520
 so I read a piece, I was trying to find out other, you know, secrets of corn. And I read a

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.720
 Huffington Post piece, which has had lined five myths about corn. You should stop believing.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.640
 Oh, okay. Well, lower those expectations. They're much less juicy than I would have thought,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.000
 because one of them is that corn is unhealthy, which I didn't think it was. I was firmly

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.960
 at the opinion it was mostly most of my days vegetables. Better than the magnetum. Yeah,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.400
 better than a magnetum, exactly, although kind of a similar shape. But one of the myths is that we

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.360
 can't digest sweet corn. Oh, I believe that. So you can't digest it. I've seen it. I've seen it, Andy.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.320
 Well, okay, here we go. Well, it does have large amounts of insoluble fiber, but you can't

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.200
 digest the inside. So the inside is pure starch. So you digest that, but the outside is just a husk

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.000
 of cellulose, which is not digestible. So it looks like you haven't digested it, but you have.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.280
 Can I just say that if you're taking your feces and taking out the corn kernels saying she loves me

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.520
 and she loves me not, you might get lucky and have an odd number, but I think it's unlikely you'll get

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.200
 lucky in any other ways. Well, you haven't heard how I met my wife. That's very cool. Andy,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.880
 when you say the outside of the yellow skin, I guess, bit is made of cellulose, so you don't digest it,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.280
 but presumably the ones that come out the other end of the bits that you didn't chew. It's not like

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.680
 you've digested the inside and then you've remade the perfect shape of a piece of sweet corn,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.840
 but with just the edge, right? No, no, no, no, you're right. If you chew it with your teeth and obliterate

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.600
 the yellow outside, you won't be able to notice that, although it will still be there because that's

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.920
 the fiber, which is not soluble, which come out, but you won't be able to see it. But if you're

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.480
 shutting sweet corn, then it'll all go straight through you. Yeah, absolutely, yeah. I don't know,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.680
 people do that. I don't eat it. If it came in shots, I think you might eat it. Yeah, you're right.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.240
 You know me so well. If you found an odd numbered Cobb and you were a slave in America in the 19th

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.240
 century, you could earn your freedom. Apparently, this was, well, there was one instance of this. It was

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.960
 in an 1838 farmer's cabinet magazine and it said that a slave owner said to his slaves, if any of you

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.200
 finds a odd numbered Cobb, I'll be so astonished, I'll free you. And so this came two years later. So

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.760
 I found one and the master was just like, John, the floor said, okay, please tell me how you did that.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.480
 You must have cheated. And so the slave said, okay, look, you have to promise to frame me anyway.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.560
 And then he explained that he'd gone and he'd tampered with it. And if you tamper with them very early

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.600
 on to remove that one of the rows, then it'll grow in a way that that row disappears. And so the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.720
 master freed him but kept the Cobb and displayed it at dinner parties from then on. It was an amazing

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.400
 anecdote that there was an odd numbered Cobb. This was entertainment in the 1830s.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:16.480
 Cool. Yeah, anecdotes was so terrible then. I mean, oddly, we are doing a podcast entirely based

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.280
 on the fact that you don't get out numbered Cobb to the Cobb, sir. That's true.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:30.080
 A lot of the terrible anecdotes. I didn't realise how much corn is used in daily item,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.760
 like products that we use every day. So I didn't realise, for example, if you eat corn for dinner,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.600
 before you go to bed, you're cleaning your teeth again with other corn because bits of it that are

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.200
 broken down are put into toothpaste. So yeah, so corn, if corn wasn't in toothpaste, it's not

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.640
 obviously not for all toothpaste, but if it wasn't in there, it wouldn't have that sort of

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.120
 Swedish taste. It would taste more like soap. So they use it as a flavouring. So it's from the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.840
 Sobittle, which is a glucose derivative of the corn. So yeah, we're cleaning our teeth with

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.800
 corn as we go to bed. That's very interesting. Yeah, not all of the corn is necessarily sweet

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 corn, right? I think. So in America, sweet corn that you would think of as corn on the Cobb stuff,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.080
 it accounts for only 1% of all the corn grown in America. Wow. And the rest of it is stuff like

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.120
 field corn and all that kind of stuff is used in industry. Perhaps for this, I'm not sure which one

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.920
 is used for toothpaste, but to feed animals and things like that. It's unbelievable. So there was

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.880
 a great article on the Atlantic website, which was about a woman actually called Christine Robinson,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.600
 who is severely allergic to corn. She had no idea what she was getting into when she got this

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 allergy. She thought, oh, well, I'm ever able to have corn on the Cobb or, you know, tacos made

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.880
 of corn. It turns out everything has corn in the USA. So table salt has corn derivatives sort of

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.920
 put in it. It's tea bottled water, sometimes have minerals, which is processed because you can't have

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.000
 bottled water. Supermarket meat, bagged salad, fish, grains, fruits, tomatoes, milk, all of these

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.160
 things are sprayed with lactic acid, which is made from corn sugars. If she's traveling, she can't

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.080
 wear a wetsuit unless she knows that it hasn't been washed in a detergent that does not contain corn.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.320
 She said she loved the yogurt. She said she can't dive if her partners on the diving trip have been

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.320
 eating corn chips. I mean, it sounds like the most I've got. I know. I mean, if you went to a diving

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.560
 place and they said, here's your wetsuit and you said, excuse me, he's got an e-card on this,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:37.200
 they just think you're insane. I know. I know. It's in everything. Wow. It's astonishing poor

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.360
 woman. Jeez, I'm not the way you said she had no idea what she was getting into is though. She sort

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:48.960
 of looked so unfair. I know it's so unfair. I misspoke there. There's a corn belt in America,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.480
 you can drive for 1,500 miles and only see corn. She must hate that. Yeah, I don't think she goes there

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:01.440
 very much. That's the great American bottom, isn't it? That's why it's called where most of the

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.400
 corn is grown in America. That's funny. It's the floodplain of the Mississippi and basically,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.280
 there was glaciers there and they all retreated and it was a great vast bit of extremely

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.840
 fertile land and it's known as the Great American Bottom. And is that name related to the fact that

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:25.280
 sweet corn comes out of your bottom still intact? It can be amazing looking. I mean, it can be so

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.800
 beautiful, can't it? It's a shame it's disgusting, but they're... Well, it's great. I'm going to defend

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.040
 corn here, by the way. I love corn. Look, you're wrong, but that's okay. Don't feel bad. But I do

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:44.560
 like some of the non-yellow variety. God, you're an easy one to beat in an army. One meal to zonsky.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.560
 So sweet corn can come in loads of different colours and lots of varieties. It's a bit like we were

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.760
 talking about different types of pear a couple of weeks ago, but corn you can get in a bloody

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.400
 butcher variety, shaman's blue, the country gentleman, and the best variety is this one called

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.600
 glass gem corn. Look it up. It was originally bred by this old man, this 80-year-old man who's half

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.920
 Cherokee and he wanted to get in touch with his Native American roots and it was extremely important

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.720
 to Native Americans. And so he started growing lots of different varieties of corn, experimenting

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.680
 and crossbreeding them. And he bred this glass gem corn and it's rainbow corn. If you guys

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.120
 seen this, it's every little bit of corn. It's a different colour and it's bright red, purple, green,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.520
 blue, yellow, orange, it's absolutely stunning. Not very edible, but it's... That's the problem.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.800
 I was wondering why we haven't seen that in Tesco's. Yeah, it's the edible thing, but it looks great.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.840
 Okay, you know the movie Interstellar? Yeah. Christopher Nolan movie, that cost 165 million

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.360
 dollars to make and to help pay back that money, Christopher Nolan's sold corn.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:03.520
 How much did he sell? I haven't got the exact number, but if you've seen the movie,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.680
 you know that it's largely set in a cornfield. There's huge scenes of cornfield and rather than

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.400
 doing that by CGI, Christopher Nolan consulted with Superman director Zack Snyder, who'd also grown

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.840
 corn for his movie to say where's the best place to grow corn for your own movie? So he's spent

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.840
 £100,000 by finding a location in Calgary in Canada, which was next to a mountain range,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.880
 and they grew the cornfields from scratch for the movie. Wow. And they were told by the time they

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.640
 filmed it that the corn wouldn't be usable, but it turned out it was. So Christopher Nolan sold off

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.840
 all the corn to help pay back his movie. Imagine if you're at your local vegetable market and you had

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.000
 Christopher Nolan trying to flog you some sweet corn. It would be very surreal, except I don't

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.640
 know. You'd recognise him actually, so maybe it wouldn't. He would have to tell everyone he was

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.640
 Christopher Nolan every time. And you wouldn't believe him, would you? No, most people would say who's

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.840
 Christopher Nolan for a start? Yeah. You go home and say, this weird sweet corn dealer kept trying

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:09.440
 to tell me his name today. You would think that someone who worked in such a high profile job to

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.360
 begin with would go into purgrowing, not into sweet corn manufacturing. Is that a call back to last

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:22.080
 week? Can we pause or quickly listen to last week's episode? Do you know that today's sweet corn is

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:29.840
 1000 times larger than it was 9,000 years ago? Wow. That's quite a lot bigger, isn't it? 1000 times.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.840
 You mean the individual pieces or the cobs? The whole thing. But I think the individual pieces would

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:42.640
 be a lot smaller as well. Maybe not 1000 times because they would be invisible to me. I think they

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.760
 used to be two centimetres long, the cobs. And then so I didn't find that fact, James, but I did find

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.720
 that farmers started to selectively growing it. And it was, you know, a very early plant to be

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.920
 domesticated. But according to the source I wrote, within 6000 years, the farmers have got it from

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:08.160
 two centimetres long, a cob, to 2.5 centimetres long. Slow rate of return. How long did you say that was?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:16.160
 6000 years. Do you think like after 6000 years, you must think to yourself, it might not be worth

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.280
 carrying out. But that's only because we know where it's got to these days. Back then that might

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.800
 have looked freakishly large, but it might have been like, whoa! In his world records, get over here.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.720
 But how did they, so invisible, how do you pass on the wisdom that you have to keep breeding it?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.880
 Because if you're talking to your granddad and he's saying, look, your cob, look at it, that is half a

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.520
 millimetre bigger than mine. You're very lucky. I can't believe they bothered. You wouldn't notice.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.480
 You wouldn't like to just look at a corner of the cob and go, well, this is one tenth of a millimetre

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.280
 bigger than normal. And then plant it, would you? I can't account for it. I honestly, I have no

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:02.960
 work in this show of this fact. Native Americans used to worship corn mother, because corn was so

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:09.200
 important to them. And she was very interesting. So the myth of corn mother was that she would feed

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.800
 hungry tribes with corn. And there are various stories about how she came into being and what

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.520
 people did with her. One of them is that she fed a hungry tribe with corn and saved them all,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.560
 but suddenly one of them realized how she was doing it. And the way she did it was she rubbed her

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.840
 body really, really hard until her skin crumbled off and became sweet corn. And they were so grossed

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.800
 out by that, that they sent her away. Or I think in some versions, they killed her. And she was so

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.000
 nice that they said, we're going to kill you, because that's really rank what you're doing.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.520
 And she said, okay, but here are special instructions for how to leave my corpse to make sure it

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.600
 keeps growing corn for you guys. Wow. Wow. Self-sacrificed women. And another one, she gave them all corn,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.160
 but then one of the members of the tribe had sex with an ear of corn that looked a lot like a

00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:02.080
 vulva. And she was so offended that she ran away. She loves me not. Corn on the knob more like.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.560
 Actually, it was that joke that offended her and then she ran away.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:17.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:26.320
 Mayan gods include flying scab gathered blood and past demon. They've actually got a lot of gods

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:32.240
 and about 800, I think, but these are some of the best. These are their underworld gods. So

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.560
 I should be clear, these aren't sort of good guys. These are the guys in the underworld who represent

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.520
 things like disease and death. They're the bad guys. They don't sound like good guys. They don't,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.840
 it's quite obvious from the names, isn't it? I think so. Yeah. Well, you'll need a hell of a job for a PR

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:53.520
 person, isn't it? When you're killed, the flight scab passed demon. These are mostly Mayan gods that

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.600
 were worships when the Mayan Empire was at its height, which I think it's sort of solid to

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.360
 collapse and disintegrate around the 10th, 11th century, but there are still Mayans alive today.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:10.160
 There are about 6 million or 7 million Mayans in Central America. And they believe in these gods.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.560
 And I really like the story of these particular ones because they're involved in the creation

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:22.160
 story of Mayan mythology whereby there were these twins, these hero twins and who had their

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.480
 own weird creation story, actually, where they were born because a decapitated head spat on

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.640
 their mother and impregnated her. Anyway, they ended up... There were so many different ways

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:38.640
 of getting pregnant in the old days, weren't they? It was like sex education classes must have been

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:45.760
 really. If a swamp comes to you, watch out. I like going to get IVF and hear all the options.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:52.320
 Coming through the magazine. What would you go for? I don't think you'd pick the decapitated

00:16:52.320 --> 00:17:00.880
 headspit. I think that's one of the cheaper ones. Anyway, so these hero twins went to the underworld

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.120
 and they took on the gods and tried to defeat the gods of death and disease and they were also

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.840
 things like jaundice demon and bloody teeth. And this is all written down in the holy book which is

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.760
 called Popul Vu and has been passed down. But yeah, they beat these gods. They probably beat these gods

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.280
 by playing lots of ball games with them, which is why then in Mesoamerica, ball games were such a big

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.480
 important part of their lives. Anyway, the twins beat the underworld gods and then the twins became

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:34.160
 the sun and the moon and the world was born and everything was fine. Oh, that is a good story.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.840
 Happy ending. They worked in pairs, right? These actual gods as well. So it's not just the twins

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.040
 who came down, but you would always, so you'd have them working to do a specific thing. So flying

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.760
 scabbing, gathering blood were two that worked together who would sicken people's blood. So I'm

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.520
 guessing sepsis kind of stuff. Pust demon and jaundice demon would cause bodies to swell up,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.760
 bone staff and skull staff turned dead bodies into skeletons, sweeping demon and stabbing demon,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:08.560
 hide in the unswept areas of people's houses and stab them to death. That's a quite a specific one.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.920
 If you're sorry, if your house is so unswept that can conceal a big enough demon to stab you to death,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.160
 I almost think you deserve to die for bad housekeeping. But I think these gods were in some ways

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.360
 metaphors for overcoming illness and death. And I wonder if there's a slight hygiene message in

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.280
 sweeping demon and stabbing demon. I don't know, but this was all oral tradition until the 16th

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.080
 century when it was first written down. So there might be some, some, some... Yeah, think it must be,

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.400
 right? It must be like people telling their kids you better sweep the corners properly, otherwise

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:50.400
 you're going to get stabbed to death. That's what my mum always told me. Yeah, I now look in the

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.160
 corners every night six times. What happens though if you're away on holiday? You come back. There's

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:03.280
 a big lot of dust in the corner. Who are you sending in to deal with that? Who's the least favourite

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.920
 kid in the family? Sorry, Dan. I feel like you had a last pair. I did. They're called Wing and Packstrap.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:15.520
 So not great names. You know, you had a really strong theme going and then packstrap. Do you know

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.160
 anything about them? They cause people to die coughing up blood while they're out walking on a road.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.640
 Oh, so what's the public health message there? Don't leave your house. Yeah, don't leave your house.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.320
 One famous thing about the Mayans is that they predicted the world was going to end in 2012.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:37.360
 Supposedly. Oh, that's what a lot of people thought, right? So this is the fact that the Mayan

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:44.560
 calendar has a thing called a backton, which is 20 cycles of their calendar and it's equal to

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:51.520
 394 years. And there had been 13 of them since the start of the calendar, the particular calendar,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.560
 and we were getting to the end of that cycle. Okay, because after 13, they would start again. And so

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.720
 people thought that, oh, oh, that means the world's going to end because previous times that that

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:06.560
 had happened, the world had ended according to Mayan mythology. But we only have one text which

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:13.360
 refers to the end of that backton, which was in 2012. And it said that it will be the display of

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.520
 Bollen Yachtay. That's what would happen on the 21st of December 2012. And we all remember that,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.200
 right? Well, I looked into Bollen Yachtay. I looked into him. And we don't really know much about him.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.360
 We don't really know who he is. It seems like he might be the god of the nine steps.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:37.120
 And so what I thought it might be referring to is on the date of the end of the world,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.720
 that was the day that Gangnam style by Sai was the first video to reach 1 billion views on YouTube.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:52.240
 So that is going from 999,999 up to a billion. So that's like the nine steps, if you get what I mean.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:21:00.400
 And this is the great, the great display of the god of nine steps was clicking up from 9999999 to 1 billion.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.440
 So I think that might have been what they were predicting the Mayans.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.440
 You have blown this wide open. The length you're going through to prove the Mayans right.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.520
 There was a lot of a lot of people did genuinely get concerned that they were correct in their

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.640
 prediction in the lead up to 2012. So there was an Ipsos poll, which is a sort of global

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.760
 poll-taking company. And they they've pulled 16,000 adults in 21 countries.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:33.520
 They found that 8% of them had an anxiety or fear over the fact that it was going to be true,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:40.560
 that it was going to end. And in one case, one sort of quite highly publicized case, two reality

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.760
 stars who were together, Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt, who were from the hills in America.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.320
 So that was a massive reality TV show pack in the day. They got so rich off the back of subsequent

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.960
 things that they managed to do from their publicity on that show that they wrapped up 10 million

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.560
 American dollars. But they thought the world was going to end. So they spent it all before it got

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.920
 to 2012. What did they spend it on? Do we know? Yeah, it's random stuff. So they just started

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.040
 leading a very extravagant lifestyle. So he said, "I would give my friends $15,000 for their birthday,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.840
 just cash. I would buy people cars." Every valet I met, I gave them a couple of hundred pounds tip.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:23.120
 I would pay people $200 just to open doors for us. And yeah, so he said, "Here's some advice.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.040
 Definitely do not spend your money thinking asteroids are coming. The world did not end."

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.880
 So they lost their... Thanks mate, valuable advice. How ironic that two reality stars had not a single

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:44.320
 grip on reality whatsoever. Okay, and it's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.560
 My fact is that in pre-industrial Sweden, some people used slugs as grease to lubricate their

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:56.800
 card wheels. So this is all based on a paper that was published in the Journal of Ethnobiology,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:04.000
 and it's titled Black Slugs as grease. And it was quite a recent paper to describe this old custom

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.160
 that goes back to the 18th century. It was known to go back at least to then, sure it goes back further.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:16.320
 It's by Ingvars Fanberg from Uppsala University. And people would sometimes use other methods.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:23.200
 They would use tar. They would mix in lard from swine or fat from boiled animals' feet. So none of

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.680
 these methods of lubricating your card axles are especially nice sounding, but sometimes you would

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.440
 not have those things available, and you would need to cast around and pick up a slug. And some

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:42.240
 wagons actually had a slug tub hanging behind them. If you just put it up in a slug, shove another

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.720
 slug on the wheel. Is that what they do? Yeah, basically, and you just, it's poor slug. You just have

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.920
 to mash it up, basically, because they're so slimy that they produce excellent lubrication between the

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.560
 wheels and the axles. Right, yeah. So they did mash them up, because I thought they could do it where

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.880
 they just put a slug on a wheel and they leave it to crawl around the whole wheel. Absolutely.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.720
 That's a really good sustainable way of doing it, isn't it? Pop it back in the tub.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.160
 Yeah, you're right. No, I wish that would be the children's book version of this story, Anna.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:19.440
 This paper was a way of trying to use popular ethnology, because they put out an appeal on

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.760
 radio to say, have you ever heard of this? Have you done it? And it turns out it was done into the

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.600
 1940s. And people listen to this radio show in Sweden. Wow. They found it. Yeah. And all over Northern

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.840
 Europe as well, including, including, including Colchester in Essex. No, yeah. There was someone who

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.760
 wrote him from Colchester and said that in the 1970s, children who lived near a railway line would

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.800
 go to the railway line and gather slugs and sell them to the workforce on the trains. So they had

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:54.960
 something to lubricate the wheels. That's right. It's in this paper. That's the workforce being

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.480
 kind to the kids. That's the workforce going, oh, yeah, that's so helpful. Thanks so much.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:07.520
 Then using their industrial lubricant. Apparently, yeah. Apparently, there was a rumour in Denmark

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.600
 that German glass blowers would use black slugs to smear on their frame pans when they made pancakes

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:21.440
 instead of using oil. Is that a sick burn on the German glass blowers? It's hard to tell, isn't it?

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:27.760
 Cheap. Yeah. They said that they use badger lard or bacon rind or they used slugs if they couldn't

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.960
 get any of those. Badger lard. I mean, badger lard does send harder to get hold of than a slug.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.800
 Doesn't look like it could appear in a high quality restaurant now. I can really imagine it being

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:47.680
 a Michelin London restaurant with pancakes with badger lard and slug slime. There were some places,

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.280
 oh, it's Nordic countries as well. Actually, children would sing rhymes to slugs.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.120
 Does that help them produce more slime? I don't think so. I can't remember what

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.120
 I can't remember. Can we hear one of the rhymes? Something else? No, I've forgotten it and I'm

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.800
 definitely not going to look it up. You forgot it when you committed it to memory.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.160
 At some point. Shall I tell you? Shall I do it? I'm certain my pronunciation will be terrible,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:18.160
 but this is just reading it as it looks. So, sniggle sniggle snorey. Rack ut dinala mga horn.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:27.360
 Sakadufa en skapa corn. Hem till dina unga, unga i but. And that means snail, snail,

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:33.360
 snott. Reach out your longhorns and you will receive a bushel of barley to take home to your kids,

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:40.880
 your kids in the nest. Ah, that's lovely, isn't it? So then they'd give this snail a bushel of barley.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:49.120
 I think it was just nursery rhyme. The extra detail at the end, the kids in the nest,

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.240
 so you give it to your kids, the kids in the nest. So sort of, I know where you live,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.240
 kind of statement. Wow, I didn't think it was quite that worried. It feels aggressive to me.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.800
 Dislugs make nests. I don't think these children know what's going on.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.720
 So many holes in these rhyme.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:14.320
 Slugs are very right-hand side centric. So all the shit that's really important to them,

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.080
 in fact, is on the right-hand side. They've got their breathing hole, which is the new mistone,

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.920
 which if you look at a slug, you can see it. So cool. It's just like a big gaping,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.120
 well, it looks like a wound in their head, which is what they breathe through. But they also have

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.680
 their genitals, I think. Their anus and their genitals are towards the front of their body,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.640
 because they evolved from snails and snails have to have all of that stuff at the front,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.800
 because if it stuck in their shell, you're just pouring in your own shell. So they've got their

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.880
 anus and their genitals at the front, all on the right-hand side as well. But I think that would be

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.120
 a really exciting plot point, everything being on the right-hand side thing. If you had, let's say,

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:55.840
 a slug hospital drama, and you've got this slug spouse turning up, and the doctor slug says,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.120
 I'm so sorry, Mrs. Slug, one half of your husband's body was completely obliterated by the accident

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:09.040
 with a cart. And then which half was obliterated? The left half. Oh, well, that's fine. And then,

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.120
 you know, there's definitely that. Which half, and then the credits rule? I love it.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.480
 I know, though, surely there must be some use to the other half of the slug. Otherwise,

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.800
 all slugs would evolve into being half a slug. That's true. That's absolutely right. Well, maybe

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.520
 they're on the way there. You know, in a million years' time, slugs will only be half a slug.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:33.360
 And everyone will always say, I wonder where the other half is. You know, some slugs eat birds.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:40.080
 No. Nature's reversed itself. They're eating birds. It's actually a bit of a problem. I think

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.760
 researchers in Poland were the first ones to discover this. And they looked in birds' nests where

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.200
 there are little chicks being nestlings. And they saw a slug there. They were like, no worries,

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.760
 just a slug. The mum will probably eat it. Came back a few days later. And the birds had been eaten.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.520
 And it turns out that slugs will nore away at little chicks in nests. And the mothers don't

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.680
 even stop them from doing it. Because, well, we think they haven't really evolved this defense

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.680
 mechanism yet. Because it doesn't happen often enough that they've evolved. So they just watch

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.880
 these slugs nore away using their regular, which is their tongue, which is covered in little teeth.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.520
 And they eat the little birds alive. Wow. I have to say, the fact that it doesn't happen very

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.480
 often is not an excuse for the bird mum. I would say if that happened once, that requires

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.600
 intervention. I agree. I think that's evolution going wrong. If you don't automatically know,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.000
 if you see a slug eating your baby, you should stop it happening. Why I think it's quite interesting

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.560
 is that this nursery rhyme said, "Bushler Valley, to take home to your kids, kids in the nest." It doesn't

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.800
 say kids in your nest. So maybe these children in Denmark, they knew about this kind of behavior of

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.680
 slugs. Oh my god, James. This is like the time you proved the minds right earlier this episode.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:59.200
 Amazing. So slugs use for lubricants. Lots of other things have been used for lubricants in the past,

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:05.760
 haven't they? Seaweed used by people in Japan for thousands of years. If you get red seaweed and

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:12.080
 boil it up, it gives you this liquid called Karajinan. And it's extremely gelatinous and slippery,

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.680
 and it's been used as lubricant forever. James, are you talking about tribology here?

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.360
 Am I? I think you are. So tribology is the science of friction and lubrication.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:31.520
 And it is such a recent science that it was only named in 1966. Wow. But it covers basically

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:37.200
 everything. Everything you can imagine, all mechanical processes have friction and lubrication

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.960
 elements in them. So there's geotribology, which is about tectonic plates and glaciers.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.480
 There's nanotribology, which is in computer disk storage. There's biotribology, which is hip joints

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.680
 and how they work and now replacement hips can stay working for longer or everything. And we met

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.960
 a tribologist when we were in Vienna. You know what? I was just about to ask that. Was he not the guy

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.320
 who said he coined the word tribology? Well, I've come across different accounts of who coined it.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.520
 I've heard that a guy called Peter Jost also did, but we met Friedrich Franek, who is a senior

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.160
 tribologist in Vienna. And he was great. Yeah, kept slipping over, didn't he?

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:21.200
 Yeah, but his card, his card outside was so well-oiled.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:29.280
 That's amazing. Well, I believe him. He's our friend. Yeah. Yeah, let's go with him.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.120
 All right. I think that's how the royalty works. I was reading about nose grease.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.760
 Oh, yeah. Do you know about this? No. So the the oiliest and greasiest bit on the human body

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:45.040
 is the little bit that's connected between the nose and the face. And it's got so many uses,

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.360
 observatories with telescopes would use it to sort of minimize the scratches on the surfaces

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.440
 of the telescope. It would be really effective for that. And if you ever have a beer,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.920
 this is just for a tip. Next time you have a pint of beer, if the head of the beer is too much,

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.240
 you can take your nose grease and you can stir it into the head and it will make it will dissipate.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.880
 I'll be trying that really quickly, not yet, because I read it this morning and I thought it might be.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:18.880
 So we read once on QI that if you take earwax and put it into beer, then that will also make the

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.440
 bubbles go away. And we were going to do it on the show, but no one thought to try it. And then on

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.600
 the day of recording, we actually got some beer and we thought in rehearsal, let's just quickly

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:33.280
 try it to make sure it works and it really did not work. Just ended up with bubbly earwax

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:39.920
 seabere. Oh well, Dan, I can't wait to go out for a nice pint all of us when this is all over

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:46.160
 and just see you rubbing your nose and your glass. I'm not going to put my actual nose in the glass.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:54.480
 White cut out the middle man of the figure. I don't think we produce enough grease, do we?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.320
 We're all stroking this bit of our nose. I can see you're all doing the same as me.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.320
 So this is the bit of your nose. Dan, when you said between the nose and the face, I thought you

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:08.000
 meant on the inside. I couldn't work out what you meant, but you mean the outer bit below your eyes.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.280
 I think it's specifically the bit between like, let's say your cheeks and your nostrils,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.280
 like that little indentation. The side bit of your nose. Yeah, those are greasy bits.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.360
 Yeah, it's very soft actually. I'd never noticed before, but it is quite soft, but I still don't

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.480
 think it is enough to be stirring usefully into anything for culinary purposes. I think if you've

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.800
 got a telescope and a tiny little aperture, then I can see it might be useful for that.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.320
 But if you're going to do it for a pint, you're probably going to have to go around the whole pub

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.040
 getting bittersy at everyone's nose. I can only see if you anything.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.560
 By coincidence, I have these two things next to me. This is really a coincidence, but I could

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.560
 test out. Oh, you could test it. Dan has a beer and a glass. There's no way we're not going to demand

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:54.640
 people to say that. It's zero alcohol though, so I don't know if that might not produce a head.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:07.840
 Get my nose. Okay, so here's the beer. I'm just pour it in. Here's my nose.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:19.600
 This all stacks up so far. Wow, look at it dissolving immediately. Look at that. Oh, look at

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.080
 that. It is disappearing. This is a good tip. If you're a barman and you ever pour a bad point,

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.760
 just get some grease off your face, dip your finger in. Look at that. Okay, that actually,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.240
 that is quite impressive. Now we do need to see it with a control where you're not using the grease.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:39.360
 Maybe next week. Yes, next week's party. Tune in. Cool. That was good. Nice. Yeah, well done.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.360
 Good experiment. Well driven. I've got one more facts if we have time for one more on this one.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:53.920
 So I just read a story that happened in 2002 about a case of grease causing a lawsuit. So a man

00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:02.000
 sued a pub for slipping on pork chop grease. His name was Troy Bowrin and the story says a man who

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.040
 slipped on a trail of grease left on a pub floor by a patron wearing pork chops on his feet was

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:15.200
 awarded more than 23,000 pounds yesterday by an Australian court. So many questions. Yep,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:22.160
 Troy Bowrin. He broke his arm. He was at the Janallian in South Sydney and this was back in 1997

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:28.000
 that the incident actually happened. And basically what happened was another guy there called Ross

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.760
 Lukeock had won the meat, the pork chops in a raffle and a pub raffle. But then the pub refused

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.360
 him service at the bar because he was barefoot. So he returned a short time later with the chops

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.960
 strapped to his feet and walked around everywhere, even playing pool in the pub. And

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:52.160
 poor old Troy Bowrin was then walking along and they hand cleaned away the grease left behind

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.560
 and slipped on it and successfully sued both the pub and the man wearing the pork chops on his

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.480
 feet. And this guy was Australian. He said, wow.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:09.840
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact. My fact is in 2019,

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:16.160
 69 pilgrims made a journey from the Surn Abbas giant, which is that nude chalk man that's carved

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:23.680
 into the hillside in England to Surn in Geneva or as they put it from the large hard on to the large

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:30.880
 Hadron. So this was a pilgrimage that happened April last year. 69 pilgrims got on a double

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:38.160
 decker bus after starting a sort of pagan druid style ritual at the Surn Abbas giant. They went

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.040
 through Italy and stayed in a place called Damanher which is a community that's up there and then

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:49.520
 they went through to Switzerland where they ended up at the Surn large Hadron collider and they

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:56.400
 performed another bizarre pagan ritual there. They wanted to immunize the Eschaton which is the

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:03.120
 idea is that they wanted to bring the beauty of the afterworld into the current world. So heaven

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.120
 basically brought into world. That was all very interesting down but the main bit I got from that is

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.480
 that they went from England to Geneva and went through Italy. That's not it's not on the way.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:20.640
 There sounds like more of a jolly than a pilgrimage. I think your rice most pilgrimages are not on a

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.880
 double decker bus either. But yeah so and this was done by someone called Daisy Campbell and it was

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:33.760
 told to me by a friend of fish, Dr David Bramwell who is a author and he was actually part of the

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.600
 group of 69 pilgrims except that he didn't go with them but he was one of the 69 he was at the

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:46.080
 Surn giant. So we know that not all of them were there? Yeah I'm guessing so. 69 feels like

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:51.840
 as a crucial number though. Was that just happy coincidence? No intentional. I guess you're right

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.920
 maybe he was number 70 and I'm pretty sure that he said he was 69. Yeah if he's number 70 it ruins

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.680
 the joke so yeah can't go. We should say they were doing it for a joke right so they are quite

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.320
 funny and when you read the write-up it's obviously a very humorous thing they're doing this pagan

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.400
 thing. Yes. And they call themselves discordians which is a sort of faux pseudo religion started in

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:20.720
 the 60s and it's sort of based around chaos and chaos isn't important as order and stuff like that

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:28.320
 right? Absolutely yeah and but they are a lot of people who are druids do it and they do they do buy

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.560
 into a lot of magic and folk but yes it's all done with a great tongue and cheekness about it.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.240
 Can we just quickly mention this place that they visited in Italy because it's incredible

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.440
 I'd never heard of this damn in her but I don't know. Drumwell's been there before hasn't he?

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:51.440
 Yes he has yeah many times. I want to go. It's an extraordinary place it's a it's a community that was

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:58.640
 set up by this one guy who claimed that he was the pre-incarnation of an alien from the future so

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.360
 the idea is that there was a panel of aliens talking in the future about the destruction of planet

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.080
 earth and they pinpointed it to the fact that earth lost its way in life and became a very negative

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.480
 place and destroyed itself so he thought I'm going to stop that yeah James. It's just Andy's looking

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.760
 quite skeptical about this story. Yeah a little bit. Wait till wait till you hear where it goes Andy.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:27.200
 So he pre-incarnated by thousands of thousands of years and landed himself in the Italian hills

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:33.840
 and he set up this community and they decided under the cover of darkness to build a temple

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:39.760
 to time travel that would help save humanity using just their hands largely to begin with and then

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.640
 eventually drills and to look at pictures of it highly recommended look at damn in her it's one

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.000
 of those beautiful things you'll ever see it's stunning. So this is aside from that is obviously just

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.040
 a bunch of crazy people but these temples are unbelievable and they kept it secret for 15 years

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.800
 didn't they so this little community in Italy digging a hundred feet underground under a mountain

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:06.400
 and it was only in 1992 when someone reported them to the police and the police went and to be

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.680
 fed the police the police said oh you've made some really really nice huge temples inside a mountain

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.080
 good on you let's open it up to the public. I'm just thinking that when they were digging into this

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.480
 mountain in northern Italy did they not come across a hundred thousand apples that are in there.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.600
 Just as one bar call back to last week. Yeah.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.680
 So they pitched up there they they saw the temples and then they went on to Surn and to yeah.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.400
 I don't understand anything that's been said in the last five minutes.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:44.800
 Well let's talk about the chalk avistrylam. So the Surn Abistrian we should say is a 180-foot

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:52.320
 tall naked man with a club and he has an absolutely enormous penis. Yes. Yes is that fair to say.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.560
 Didn't always used to be as big. No that was I know this is the crazy thing this is the

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:04.960
 sort of area 51 of Britain is this chalk giant penis which used to be tiny. No it used to be normal

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:11.360
 sized. It was normal 12-foot long penis. It was 16 feet long which is a normal size for a giant

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:18.640
 that size. So basically he was like he was 200 feet tall and he had a 200 inch penis so it's the

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.400
 same as a six or tall man having a six inch penis so it's you know it's a completely normal size

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:32.480
 but then in 1908 chalk cutters merged his penis with his belly button and made it seven feet longer

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:37.840
 which now makes it look completely out of proportion. Now if that wasn't a chalk got a trying

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.680
 to compensate for something I don't know why the phrase compensating for something was ever

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:49.120
 invented. Do you know who found out about this disturbance because it's it's been described to

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.960
 a few different people some people say it was down on the 50s by contractors and other but you know

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:59.600
 blah blah blah or locals did it but Rodney Kassadin is a kind of freelance archaeologist and he

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:05.440
 developed a system of working out where the soil had been disturbed and he said I've made a trial

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.560
 run down the phallus and obtained electrical measurements indicating a joint so he worked out

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.440
 that that the penis had definitely been extended to the former belly button and then the national

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:22.960
 trust who owned the site they had to decide whether to give the certain abyss giant a penis a penis

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:30.640
ectomy penis trim reduction cut reduck a penis thank you a penis reduction and they decided not to do

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.880
 it I guess because it's been a hundred years since it was extended and it must be that's now what

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.880
 it's like but it and also because of the adverse PR that it would have created I think for them yeah

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:48.640
 like squatters rights at that point yeah they do top it up every 25 years or so give it a sort of

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:59.280
 makeover and it's 17,000 tons of chalk that's used I'm not 17 what am I talking about yeah sorry

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.520
 it's 17 tons of chalk that is used 17,000 very sorry um what a penis that would be

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:18.720
 the white cliffs of dover are no more yeah every 25 years except for when there's problems so they

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:24.160
 had to give him a nose job at one point because erosion had been too unkind on him so they maybe he

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:32.320
 was just trying to defone the beer did you read down did you read the report of the last the last job

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:38.480
 they did because they it's volunteers who do it so it's you know there are dozens of people who go and

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:44.320
 they they trim the grass verges because obviously it's cut into a chalk hillside and they interviewed

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:51.120
 the national trust man because some chalk figures have now been redone in concrete which is obviously

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:56.240
 easier but actually obviously it's not very historical and it's a bit it's a bit lazy and the

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:02.480
 national trust man um called Martin Papworth said I think there would be an outcry if we tried to cut

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:13.360
 corners says Papworth who ironically is here to help cut the corners yeah so we don't fully know

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.600
 when this was made right we yeah I always assume this was quite ancient but there's a lot of

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.400
 suggestion that it's dates from the 17th century because that's the first mention that we get of

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:28.160
 it and a lot of theories about why it came about one is that it was a sort of satirical piece on

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.160
 Oliver Cromwell and they believe that there were missing bits from it there used to be a dismembered

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:39.120
 head at the bottom and a cloak in the other arm that's not holding the club but no one truly knows

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.040
 because a lot of sources do claim that it's older don't they there was an article in the independent

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:49.360
 that casually referred to it as 2000 years old but it seems impossible that this thing would have

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:56.400
 existed for 1,500 years and no one mentioned it until the 1694 that's what I mean surely

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.880
 someone would have written down at some point by the way we've got this massive naked man on a hill

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.720
 there's a land survey in 1617 that talks about this hill and doesn't mention the massive naked man

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.680
 and it just seems like if you were to buy a house and the survey came back and it didn't

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.320
 mention there was a massive naked man on the side of your house you would complain wouldn't you

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:23.440
 yeah you would you would there is one theory I've heard and I like this so much so the people of

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:29.680
 Dorset were interviewed about it in the 18th century and this was a I think a local reverend who

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:35.600
 is a bit of an amateur historian taking this record from the locals and the people there at the time

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.880
 said that it represented a giant who had stolen sheep from the people living nearby

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.520
 for his own food and then he'd lain down to rest in this field and the villagers had killed

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:53.120
 the giant in his sleep and then they'd put an outline around him meaning that the chalk giant

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.800
 would be a literal crime scene chalk I don't know these names draw in pop shows

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:05.680
 when you have a murder and you see the chalk line on the floor they don't put the penis in there

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:17.600
 so we have a log of us today final indignity that's brilliant it has been covered up for other

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:22.800
 reasons in the past so in the 19th century classic Victorians they apparently they let foliage

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:29.360
 grow discreetly over the penis so you couldn't see the penis in the Victorian age and then in the war

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:35.040
 we covered up the certain giant and all of our other chalk hillsides I think which if you were

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.120
 listening from a broad you should know that England is the south of England specifically just has

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.400
 this weird habit of drawing massive chalk figures on hills and then come world war two we had to

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.720
 sort of like paint a lot of them green or cover a lot of them and grass and stuff because they're

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.120
 quite obvious from the sky you didn't want the German bombers to be able to use them as an

00:46:53.120 --> 00:47:08.000
 navigation like following the directs of the penis bristle this way okay that's it that is all

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.840
