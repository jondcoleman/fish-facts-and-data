00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another working-from-home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:00:32,00:00:37,"four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:42,"Starting with you, James. Okay, my fact this week is that if you were to take a corn on the"
00:00:42,00:00:48,"cob and remove each kernel in a row while saying she loves me and then she loves me not,"
00:00:48,00:00:56,"then she will always love you not. Right? No. How many, that's quite a long version of that game,"
00:00:56,00:01:01,"I'm guessing. Well, it's row by row, right? Row by row, yes, so it's not that long. It's long"
00:01:01,00:01:07,"and disappointing for any lovers doing it. There's no jeopardy, it's just guaranteed lose. There's"
00:01:07,00:01:13,an argument that it's not quite as romantic as sitting wistfully in a field taking petals off
00:01:13,00:01:19,"a flower, just going to your fridge and grabbing an old corn on the cob. But this is basically,"
00:01:19,00:01:24,"I mean, the fact is that there are even number of kernels on every row of a corn on the cob."
00:01:24,00:01:29,"The best way to check it yourself is to get a corn on the cob from your fridge or your supermarket,"
00:01:29,00:01:34,cut it in half width ways and then look at the sliced parts and you'll get a circular cross-section
00:01:34,00:01:38,"with the inside of the cob surrounded by corn kernels. And then if you count those kernels,"
00:01:38,00:01:42,they'll always be an even number. Sometimes it's kind of difficult to see because you might have a
00:01:42,00:01:48,"little runty kernel where the bigger ones have kind of squished it out of the way, you know,"
00:01:48,00:01:53,like if you lose a tooth and everything kind of squishes back in that direction. But it always
00:01:53,00:01:57,"be true, always an even number and it's due to the way that corn on the cob's grow."
00:01:57,00:02:01,"And by the time you finish this process, not only did she love you not, but she's had enough time"
00:02:01,00:02:08,to escape as far away from you as possible. That's true. It's even possible to peel off a row.
00:02:08,00:02:13,"I really wanted to try this, but I, so I hate sweet corn and I've never touched corn on the cob,"
00:02:13,00:02:18,"so I don't know if a row can come off all in one row. No, but like I say, if what you do is cut your"
00:02:18,00:02:22,"corn on the cob in half, then you'll be able to see the cross-section and you'll see the row itself"
00:02:22,00:02:27,and then you can just pluck off the individual kernels if you want. So you just have to say she loves
00:02:27,00:02:31,"me not, and she loves me really slowly, as you're blocking each individual kernels. Yeah."
00:02:31,00:02:37,"I mean, if you start with she loves you not, then she loves me, then she loves me not, then you're fine."
00:02:37,00:02:40,"But it's just basically there's an even number. I mean, what a bargain I say."
00:02:40,00:02:45,"And it's because of the way that they grow. If you were to look at it, you'll find most of them"
00:02:45,00:02:50,"have like 14, 16, 18, something like that. Yeah. And apparently this is just a big old,"
00:02:50,00:02:56,"well-known thing that people who were into corn or growing corn, you know, know about. And it used to"
00:02:56,00:03:01,get hit the news. I think sometimes it still does. It hits the news if someone finds an odd numbered
00:03:01,00:03:08,"kernel. Like I found a newspaper report from 1949. It was sort of local rather than national news,"
00:03:08,00:03:17,"but it was all capital letters. Freak ear reported in an Iowa newspaper. Wow. So did you know,"
00:03:17,00:03:23,"so I read a piece, I was trying to find out other, you know, secrets of corn. And I read a"
00:03:23,00:03:28,"Huffington Post piece, which has had lined five myths about corn. You should stop believing."
00:03:28,00:03:34,"Oh, okay. Well, lower those expectations. They're much less juicy than I would have thought,"
00:03:34,00:03:40,"because one of them is that corn is unhealthy, which I didn't think it was. I was firmly"
00:03:40,00:03:44,"at the opinion it was mostly most of my days vegetables. Better than the magnetum. Yeah,"
00:03:44,00:03:50,"better than a magnetum, exactly, although kind of a similar shape. But one of the myths is that we"
00:03:50,00:03:57,"can't digest sweet corn. Oh, I believe that. So you can't digest it. I've seen it. I've seen it, Andy."
00:03:57,00:04:04,"Well, okay, here we go. Well, it does have large amounts of insoluble fiber, but you can't"
00:04:04,00:04:09,"digest the inside. So the inside is pure starch. So you digest that, but the outside is just a husk"
00:04:09,00:04:14,"of cellulose, which is not digestible. So it looks like you haven't digested it, but you have."
00:04:14,00:04:19,Can I just say that if you're taking your feces and taking out the corn kernels saying she loves me
00:04:19,00:04:25,"and she loves me not, you might get lucky and have an odd number, but I think it's unlikely you'll get"
00:04:25,00:04:33,"lucky in any other ways. Well, you haven't heard how I met my wife. That's very cool. Andy,"
00:04:33,00:04:38,"when you say the outside of the yellow skin, I guess, bit is made of cellulose, so you don't digest it,"
00:04:38,00:04:43,but presumably the ones that come out the other end of the bits that you didn't chew. It's not like
00:04:43,00:04:47,"you've digested the inside and then you've remade the perfect shape of a piece of sweet corn,"
00:04:47,00:04:51,"but with just the edge, right? No, no, no, no, you're right. If you chew it with your teeth and obliterate"
00:04:51,00:04:55,"the yellow outside, you won't be able to notice that, although it will still be there because that's"
00:04:55,00:04:59,"the fiber, which is not soluble, which come out, but you won't be able to see it. But if you're"
00:04:59,00:05:06,"shutting sweet corn, then it'll all go straight through you. Yeah, absolutely, yeah. I don't know,"
00:05:06,00:05:11,"people do that. I don't eat it. If it came in shots, I think you might eat it. Yeah, you're right."
00:05:11,00:05:18,You know me so well. If you found an odd numbered Cobb and you were a slave in America in the 19th
00:05:18,00:05:24,"century, you could earn your freedom. Apparently, this was, well, there was one instance of this. It was"
00:05:24,00:05:30,"in an 1838 farmer's cabinet magazine and it said that a slave owner said to his slaves, if any of you"
00:05:30,00:05:37,"finds a odd numbered Cobb, I'll be so astonished, I'll free you. And so this came two years later. So"
00:05:37,00:05:41,"I found one and the master was just like, John, the floor said, okay, please tell me how you did that."
00:05:41,00:05:46,"You must have cheated. And so the slave said, okay, look, you have to promise to frame me anyway."
00:05:46,00:05:50,And then he explained that he'd gone and he'd tampered with it. And if you tamper with them very early
00:05:50,00:05:57,"on to remove that one of the rows, then it'll grow in a way that that row disappears. And so the"
00:05:57,00:06:02,master freed him but kept the Cobb and displayed it at dinner parties from then on. It was an amazing
00:06:02,00:06:08,anecdote that there was an odd numbered Cobb. This was entertainment in the 1830s.
00:06:08,00:06:16,"Cool. Yeah, anecdotes was so terrible then. I mean, oddly, we are doing a podcast entirely based"
00:06:16,00:06:21,"on the fact that you don't get out numbered Cobb to the Cobb, sir. That's true."
00:06:21,00:06:30,"A lot of the terrible anecdotes. I didn't realise how much corn is used in daily item,"
00:06:30,00:06:35,"like products that we use every day. So I didn't realise, for example, if you eat corn for dinner,"
00:06:35,00:06:41,"before you go to bed, you're cleaning your teeth again with other corn because bits of it that are"
00:06:41,00:06:47,"broken down are put into toothpaste. So yeah, so corn, if corn wasn't in toothpaste, it's not"
00:06:47,00:06:50,"obviously not for all toothpaste, but if it wasn't in there, it wouldn't have that sort of"
00:06:50,00:06:57,Swedish taste. It would taste more like soap. So they use it as a flavouring. So it's from the
00:06:57,00:07:01,"Sobittle, which is a glucose derivative of the corn. So yeah, we're cleaning our teeth with"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"corn as we go to bed. That's very interesting. Yeah, not all of the corn is necessarily sweet"
00:07:06,00:07:12,"corn, right? I think. So in America, sweet corn that you would think of as corn on the Cobb stuff,"
00:07:12,00:07:18,it accounts for only 1% of all the corn grown in America. Wow. And the rest of it is stuff like
00:07:18,00:07:23,"field corn and all that kind of stuff is used in industry. Perhaps for this, I'm not sure which one"
00:07:23,00:07:27,"is used for toothpaste, but to feed animals and things like that. It's unbelievable. So there was"
00:07:27,00:07:32,"a great article on the Atlantic website, which was about a woman actually called Christine Robinson,"
00:07:32,00:07:37,who is severely allergic to corn. She had no idea what she was getting into when she got this
00:07:37,00:07:41,"allergy. She thought, oh, well, I'm ever able to have corn on the Cobb or, you know, tacos made"
00:07:41,00:07:48,of corn. It turns out everything has corn in the USA. So table salt has corn derivatives sort of
00:07:48,00:07:53,"put in it. It's tea bottled water, sometimes have minerals, which is processed because you can't have"
00:07:53,00:08:00,"bottled water. Supermarket meat, bagged salad, fish, grains, fruits, tomatoes, milk, all of these"
00:08:00,00:08:06,"things are sprayed with lactic acid, which is made from corn sugars. If she's traveling, she can't"
00:08:06,00:08:12,wear a wetsuit unless she knows that it hasn't been washed in a detergent that does not contain corn.
00:08:12,00:08:18,She said she loved the yogurt. She said she can't dive if her partners on the diving trip have been
00:08:18,00:08:24,"eating corn chips. I mean, it sounds like the most I've got. I know. I mean, if you went to a diving"
00:08:24,00:08:28,"place and they said, here's your wetsuit and you said, excuse me, he's got an e-card on this,"
00:08:28,00:08:37,they just think you're insane. I know. I know. It's in everything. Wow. It's astonishing poor
00:08:37,00:08:41,"woman. Jeez, I'm not the way you said she had no idea what she was getting into is though. She sort"
00:08:41,00:08:48,"of looked so unfair. I know it's so unfair. I misspoke there. There's a corn belt in America,"
00:08:48,00:08:54,"you can drive for 1,500 miles and only see corn. She must hate that. Yeah, I don't think she goes there"
00:08:54,00:09:01,"very much. That's the great American bottom, isn't it? That's why it's called where most of the"
00:09:01,00:09:06,"corn is grown in America. That's funny. It's the floodplain of the Mississippi and basically,"
00:09:06,00:09:11,there was glaciers there and they all retreated and it was a great vast bit of extremely
00:09:11,00:09:17,fertile land and it's known as the Great American Bottom. And is that name related to the fact that
00:09:17,00:09:25,"sweet corn comes out of your bottom still intact? It can be amazing looking. I mean, it can be so"
00:09:25,00:09:30,"beautiful, can't it? It's a shame it's disgusting, but they're... Well, it's great. I'm going to defend"
00:09:30,00:09:37,"corn here, by the way. I love corn. Look, you're wrong, but that's okay. Don't feel bad. But I do"
00:09:37,00:09:44,"like some of the non-yellow variety. God, you're an easy one to beat in an army. One meal to zonsky."
00:09:44,00:09:50,So sweet corn can come in loads of different colours and lots of varieties. It's a bit like we were
00:09:50,00:09:55,"talking about different types of pear a couple of weeks ago, but corn you can get in a bloody"
00:09:55,00:10:02,"butcher variety, shaman's blue, the country gentleman, and the best variety is this one called"
00:10:02,00:10:09,"glass gem corn. Look it up. It was originally bred by this old man, this 80-year-old man who's half"
00:10:09,00:10:13,Cherokee and he wanted to get in touch with his Native American roots and it was extremely important
00:10:13,00:10:18,"to Native Americans. And so he started growing lots of different varieties of corn, experimenting"
00:10:18,00:10:23,and crossbreeding them. And he bred this glass gem corn and it's rainbow corn. If you guys
00:10:23,00:10:29,"seen this, it's every little bit of corn. It's a different colour and it's bright red, purple, green,"
00:10:29,00:10:35,"blue, yellow, orange, it's absolutely stunning. Not very edible, but it's... That's the problem."
00:10:35,00:10:40,"I was wondering why we haven't seen that in Tesco's. Yeah, it's the edible thing, but it looks great."
00:10:40,00:10:47,"Okay, you know the movie Interstellar? Yeah. Christopher Nolan movie, that cost 165 million"
00:10:47,00:10:53,"dollars to make and to help pay back that money, Christopher Nolan's sold corn."
00:10:55,00:11:03,"How much did he sell? I haven't got the exact number, but if you've seen the movie,"
00:11:03,00:11:09,you know that it's largely set in a cornfield. There's huge scenes of cornfield and rather than
00:11:09,00:11:16,"doing that by CGI, Christopher Nolan consulted with Superman director Zack Snyder, who'd also grown"
00:11:16,00:11:21,corn for his movie to say where's the best place to grow corn for your own movie? So he's spent
00:11:21,00:11:27,"£100,000 by finding a location in Calgary in Canada, which was next to a mountain range,"
00:11:27,00:11:32,and they grew the cornfields from scratch for the movie. Wow. And they were told by the time they
00:11:32,00:11:38,"filmed it that the corn wouldn't be usable, but it turned out it was. So Christopher Nolan sold off"
00:11:38,00:11:43,all the corn to help pay back his movie. Imagine if you're at your local vegetable market and you had
00:11:43,00:11:48,"Christopher Nolan trying to flog you some sweet corn. It would be very surreal, except I don't"
00:11:48,00:11:52,"know. You'd recognise him actually, so maybe it wouldn't. He would have to tell everyone he was"
00:11:52,00:11:56,"Christopher Nolan every time. And you wouldn't believe him, would you? No, most people would say who's"
00:11:56,00:12:01,"Christopher Nolan for a start? Yeah. You go home and say, this weird sweet corn dealer kept trying"
00:12:01,00:12:09,to tell me his name today. You would think that someone who worked in such a high profile job to
00:12:09,00:12:15,"begin with would go into purgrowing, not into sweet corn manufacturing. Is that a call back to last"
00:12:15,00:12:22,week? Can we pause or quickly listen to last week's episode? Do you know that today's sweet corn is
00:12:22,00:12:29,"1000 times larger than it was 9,000 years ago? Wow. That's quite a lot bigger, isn't it? 1000 times."
00:12:29,00:12:35,You mean the individual pieces or the cobs? The whole thing. But I think the individual pieces would
00:12:35,00:12:42,be a lot smaller as well. Maybe not 1000 times because they would be invisible to me. I think they
00:12:42,00:12:47,"used to be two centimetres long, the cobs. And then so I didn't find that fact, James, but I did find"
00:12:47,00:12:52,"that farmers started to selectively growing it. And it was, you know, a very early plant to be"
00:12:52,00:12:57,"domesticated. But according to the source I wrote, within 6000 years, the farmers have got it from"
00:12:57,00:13:08,"two centimetres long, a cob, to 2.5 centimetres long. Slow rate of return. How long did you say that was?"
00:13:08,00:13:16,"6000 years. Do you think like after 6000 years, you must think to yourself, it might not be worth"
00:13:16,00:13:21,carrying out. But that's only because we know where it's got to these days. Back then that might
00:13:21,00:13:26,"have looked freakishly large, but it might have been like, whoa! In his world records, get over here."
00:13:26,00:13:32,"But how did they, so invisible, how do you pass on the wisdom that you have to keep breeding it?"
00:13:32,00:13:38,"Because if you're talking to your granddad and he's saying, look, your cob, look at it, that is half a"
00:13:38,00:13:45,millimetre bigger than mine. You're very lucky. I can't believe they bothered. You wouldn't notice.
00:13:45,00:13:50,"You wouldn't like to just look at a corner of the cob and go, well, this is one tenth of a millimetre"
00:13:50,00:13:55,"bigger than normal. And then plant it, would you? I can't account for it. I honestly, I have no"
00:13:55,00:14:02,"work in this show of this fact. Native Americans used to worship corn mother, because corn was so"
00:14:02,00:14:09,important to them. And she was very interesting. So the myth of corn mother was that she would feed
00:14:09,00:14:14,hungry tribes with corn. And there are various stories about how she came into being and what
00:14:14,00:14:19,"people did with her. One of them is that she fed a hungry tribe with corn and saved them all,"
00:14:19,00:14:24,but suddenly one of them realized how she was doing it. And the way she did it was she rubbed her
00:14:24,00:14:29,"body really, really hard until her skin crumbled off and became sweet corn. And they were so grossed"
00:14:29,00:14:34,"out by that, that they sent her away. Or I think in some versions, they killed her. And she was so"
00:14:34,00:14:38,"nice that they said, we're going to kill you, because that's really rank what you're doing."
00:14:38,00:14:43,"And she said, okay, but here are special instructions for how to leave my corpse to make sure it"
00:14:43,00:14:49,"keeps growing corn for you guys. Wow. Wow. Self-sacrificed women. And another one, she gave them all corn,"
00:14:49,00:14:54,but then one of the members of the tribe had sex with an ear of corn that looked a lot like a
00:14:54,00:15:02,vulva. And she was so offended that she ran away. She loves me not. Corn on the knob more like.
00:15:02,00:15:06,"Actually, it was that joke that offended her and then she ran away."
00:15:06,00:15:17,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that"
00:15:17,00:15:26,Mayan gods include flying scab gathered blood and past demon. They've actually got a lot of gods
00:15:26,00:15:32,"and about 800, I think, but these are some of the best. These are their underworld gods. So"
00:15:32,00:15:36,"I should be clear, these aren't sort of good guys. These are the guys in the underworld who represent"
00:15:36,00:15:41,"things like disease and death. They're the bad guys. They don't sound like good guys. They don't,"
00:15:41,00:15:45,"it's quite obvious from the names, isn't it? I think so. Yeah. Well, you'll need a hell of a job for a PR"
00:15:45,00:15:53,"person, isn't it? When you're killed, the flight scab passed demon. These are mostly Mayan gods that"
00:15:53,00:15:59,"were worships when the Mayan Empire was at its height, which I think it's sort of solid to"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"collapse and disintegrate around the 10th, 11th century, but there are still Mayans alive today."
00:16:03,00:16:10,There are about 6 million or 7 million Mayans in Central America. And they believe in these gods.
00:16:10,00:16:14,And I really like the story of these particular ones because they're involved in the creation
00:16:14,00:16:22,"story of Mayan mythology whereby there were these twins, these hero twins and who had their"
00:16:22,00:16:26,"own weird creation story, actually, where they were born because a decapitated head spat on"
00:16:26,00:16:32,"their mother and impregnated her. Anyway, they ended up... There were so many different ways"
00:16:32,00:16:38,"of getting pregnant in the old days, weren't they? It was like sex education classes must have been"
00:16:38,00:16:45,"really. If a swamp comes to you, watch out. I like going to get IVF and hear all the options."
00:16:45,00:16:52,Coming through the magazine. What would you go for? I don't think you'd pick the decapitated
00:16:52,00:17:00,"headspit. I think that's one of the cheaper ones. Anyway, so these hero twins went to the underworld"
00:17:00,00:17:05,and they took on the gods and tried to defeat the gods of death and disease and they were also
00:17:05,00:17:11,things like jaundice demon and bloody teeth. And this is all written down in the holy book which is
00:17:11,00:17:17,"called Popul Vu and has been passed down. But yeah, they beat these gods. They probably beat these gods"
00:17:17,00:17:23,"by playing lots of ball games with them, which is why then in Mesoamerica, ball games were such a big"
00:17:23,00:17:28,"important part of their lives. Anyway, the twins beat the underworld gods and then the twins became"
00:17:28,00:17:34,"the sun and the moon and the world was born and everything was fine. Oh, that is a good story."
00:17:34,00:17:39,"Happy ending. They worked in pairs, right? These actual gods as well. So it's not just the twins"
00:17:39,00:17:45,"who came down, but you would always, so you'd have them working to do a specific thing. So flying"
00:17:45,00:17:49,"scabbing, gathering blood were two that worked together who would sicken people's blood. So I'm"
00:17:49,00:17:55,"guessing sepsis kind of stuff. Pust demon and jaundice demon would cause bodies to swell up,"
00:17:55,00:18:01,"bone staff and skull staff turned dead bodies into skeletons, sweeping demon and stabbing demon,"
00:18:01,00:18:08,hide in the unswept areas of people's houses and stab them to death. That's a quite a specific one.
00:18:08,00:18:15,"If you're sorry, if your house is so unswept that can conceal a big enough demon to stab you to death,"
00:18:15,00:18:22,I almost think you deserve to die for bad housekeeping. But I think these gods were in some ways
00:18:22,00:18:27,metaphors for overcoming illness and death. And I wonder if there's a slight hygiene message in
00:18:27,00:18:33,"sweeping demon and stabbing demon. I don't know, but this was all oral tradition until the 16th"
00:18:33,00:18:38,"century when it was first written down. So there might be some, some, some... Yeah, think it must be,"
00:18:38,00:18:42,"right? It must be like people telling their kids you better sweep the corners properly, otherwise"
00:18:42,00:18:50,"you're going to get stabbed to death. That's what my mum always told me. Yeah, I now look in the"
00:18:50,00:18:56,corners every night six times. What happens though if you're away on holiday? You come back. There's
00:18:56,00:19:03,a big lot of dust in the corner. Who are you sending in to deal with that? Who's the least favourite
00:19:03,00:19:09,"kid in the family? Sorry, Dan. I feel like you had a last pair. I did. They're called Wing and Packstrap."
00:19:09,00:19:15,"So not great names. You know, you had a really strong theme going and then packstrap. Do you know"
00:19:15,00:19:20,anything about them? They cause people to die coughing up blood while they're out walking on a road.
00:19:20,00:19:24,"Oh, so what's the public health message there? Don't leave your house. Yeah, don't leave your house."
00:19:25,00:19:30,One famous thing about the Mayans is that they predicted the world was going to end in 2012.
00:19:30,00:19:37,"Supposedly. Oh, that's what a lot of people thought, right? So this is the fact that the Mayan"
00:19:37,00:19:44,"calendar has a thing called a backton, which is 20 cycles of their calendar and it's equal to"
00:19:44,00:19:51,"394 years. And there had been 13 of them since the start of the calendar, the particular calendar,"
00:19:51,00:19:56,"and we were getting to the end of that cycle. Okay, because after 13, they would start again. And so"
00:19:56,00:20:00,"people thought that, oh, oh, that means the world's going to end because previous times that that"
00:20:00,00:20:06,"had happened, the world had ended according to Mayan mythology. But we only have one text which"
00:20:06,00:20:13,"refers to the end of that backton, which was in 2012. And it said that it will be the display of"
00:20:13,00:20:19,"Bollen Yachtay. That's what would happen on the 21st of December 2012. And we all remember that,"
00:20:19,00:20:25,"right? Well, I looked into Bollen Yachtay. I looked into him. And we don't really know much about him."
00:20:25,00:20:29,We don't really know who he is. It seems like he might be the god of the nine steps.
00:20:29,00:20:37,"And so what I thought it might be referring to is on the date of the end of the world,"
00:20:37,00:20:42,that was the day that Gangnam style by Sai was the first video to reach 1 billion views on YouTube.
00:20:43,00:20:52,"So that is going from 999,999 up to a billion. So that's like the nine steps, if you get what I mean."
00:20:52,00:21:00,"And this is the great, the great display of the god of nine steps was clicking up from 9999999 to 1 billion."
00:21:00,00:21:03,So I think that might have been what they were predicting the Mayans.
00:21:03,00:21:09,You have blown this wide open. The length you're going through to prove the Mayans right.
00:21:12,00:21:17,There was a lot of a lot of people did genuinely get concerned that they were correct in their
00:21:17,00:21:22,"prediction in the lead up to 2012. So there was an Ipsos poll, which is a sort of global"
00:21:22,00:21:27,"poll-taking company. And they they've pulled 16,000 adults in 21 countries."
00:21:27,00:21:33,"They found that 8% of them had an anxiety or fear over the fact that it was going to be true,"
00:21:33,00:21:40,"that it was going to end. And in one case, one sort of quite highly publicized case, two reality"
00:21:40,00:21:45,"stars who were together, Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt, who were from the hills in America."
00:21:45,00:21:50,So that was a massive reality TV show pack in the day. They got so rich off the back of subsequent
00:21:50,00:21:54,things that they managed to do from their publicity on that show that they wrapped up 10 million
00:21:54,00:22:00,American dollars. But they thought the world was going to end. So they spent it all before it got
00:22:00,00:22:05,"to 2012. What did they spend it on? Do we know? Yeah, it's random stuff. So they just started"
00:22:05,00:22:11,"leading a very extravagant lifestyle. So he said, ""I would give my friends $15,000 for their birthday,"
00:22:11,00:22:15,"just cash. I would buy people cars."" Every valet I met, I gave them a couple of hundred pounds tip."
00:22:15,00:22:23,"I would pay people $200 just to open doors for us. And yeah, so he said, ""Here's some advice."
00:22:23,00:22:27,"Definitely do not spend your money thinking asteroids are coming. The world did not end."""
00:22:27,00:22:32,"So they lost their... Thanks mate, valuable advice. How ironic that two reality stars had not a single"
00:22:32,00:22:44,"grip on reality whatsoever. Okay, and it's time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:44,00:22:50,"My fact is that in pre-industrial Sweden, some people used slugs as grease to lubricate their"
00:22:50,00:22:56,"card wheels. So this is all based on a paper that was published in the Journal of Ethnobiology,"
00:22:56,00:23:04,and it's titled Black Slugs as grease. And it was quite a recent paper to describe this old custom
00:23:04,00:23:08,"that goes back to the 18th century. It was known to go back at least to then, sure it goes back further."
00:23:08,00:23:16,It's by Ingvars Fanberg from Uppsala University. And people would sometimes use other methods.
00:23:16,00:23:23,They would use tar. They would mix in lard from swine or fat from boiled animals' feet. So none of
00:23:23,00:23:29,"these methods of lubricating your card axles are especially nice sounding, but sometimes you would"
00:23:29,00:23:35,"not have those things available, and you would need to cast around and pick up a slug. And some"
00:23:35,00:23:42,"wagons actually had a slug tub hanging behind them. If you just put it up in a slug, shove another"
00:23:42,00:23:46,"slug on the wheel. Is that what they do? Yeah, basically, and you just, it's poor slug. You just have"
00:23:46,00:23:51,"to mash it up, basically, because they're so slimy that they produce excellent lubrication between the"
00:23:51,00:23:56,"wheels and the axles. Right, yeah. So they did mash them up, because I thought they could do it where"
00:23:56,00:24:00,they just put a slug on a wheel and they leave it to crawl around the whole wheel. Absolutely.
00:24:00,00:24:06,"That's a really good sustainable way of doing it, isn't it? Pop it back in the tub."
00:24:06,00:24:12,"Yeah, you're right. No, I wish that would be the children's book version of this story, Anna."
00:24:12,00:24:19,"This paper was a way of trying to use popular ethnology, because they put out an appeal on"
00:24:19,00:24:23,"radio to say, have you ever heard of this? Have you done it? And it turns out it was done into the"
00:24:23,00:24:29,1940s. And people listen to this radio show in Sweden. Wow. They found it. Yeah. And all over Northern
00:24:29,00:24:35,"Europe as well, including, including, including Colchester in Essex. No, yeah. There was someone who"
00:24:35,00:24:41,"wrote him from Colchester and said that in the 1970s, children who lived near a railway line would"
00:24:41,00:24:46,go to the railway line and gather slugs and sell them to the workforce on the trains. So they had
00:24:46,00:24:54,something to lubricate the wheels. That's right. It's in this paper. That's the workforce being
00:24:54,00:25:00,"kind to the kids. That's the workforce going, oh, yeah, that's so helpful. Thanks so much."
00:25:00,00:25:07,"Then using their industrial lubricant. Apparently, yeah. Apparently, there was a rumour in Denmark"
00:25:07,00:25:13,that German glass blowers would use black slugs to smear on their frame pans when they made pancakes
00:25:13,00:25:21,"instead of using oil. Is that a sick burn on the German glass blowers? It's hard to tell, isn't it?"
00:25:21,00:25:27,Cheap. Yeah. They said that they use badger lard or bacon rind or they used slugs if they couldn't
00:25:27,00:25:32,"get any of those. Badger lard. I mean, badger lard does send harder to get hold of than a slug."
00:25:32,00:25:38,Doesn't look like it could appear in a high quality restaurant now. I can really imagine it being
00:25:38,00:25:47,"a Michelin London restaurant with pancakes with badger lard and slug slime. There were some places,"
00:25:47,00:25:51,"oh, it's Nordic countries as well. Actually, children would sing rhymes to slugs."
00:25:51,00:25:55,Does that help them produce more slime? I don't think so. I can't remember what
00:25:55,00:25:59,"I can't remember. Can we hear one of the rhymes? Something else? No, I've forgotten it and I'm"
00:25:59,00:26:02,definitely not going to look it up. You forgot it when you committed it to memory.
00:26:04,00:26:10,"At some point. Shall I tell you? Shall I do it? I'm certain my pronunciation will be terrible,"
00:26:10,00:26:18,"but this is just reading it as it looks. So, sniggle sniggle snorey. Rack ut dinala mga horn."
00:26:18,00:26:27,"Sakadufa en skapa corn. Hem till dina unga, unga i but. And that means snail, snail,"
00:26:27,00:26:33,"snott. Reach out your longhorns and you will receive a bushel of barley to take home to your kids,"
00:26:33,00:26:40,"your kids in the nest. Ah, that's lovely, isn't it? So then they'd give this snail a bushel of barley."
00:26:40,00:26:49,"I think it was just nursery rhyme. The extra detail at the end, the kids in the nest,"
00:26:49,00:26:54,"so you give it to your kids, the kids in the nest. So sort of, I know where you live,"
00:26:54,00:26:58,"kind of statement. Wow, I didn't think it was quite that worried. It feels aggressive to me."
00:26:58,00:27:00,Dislugs make nests. I don't think these children know what's going on.
00:27:00,00:27:06,So many holes in these rhyme.
00:27:06,00:27:14,"Slugs are very right-hand side centric. So all the shit that's really important to them,"
00:27:14,00:27:18,"in fact, is on the right-hand side. They've got their breathing hole, which is the new mistone,"
00:27:18,00:27:21,"which if you look at a slug, you can see it. So cool. It's just like a big gaping,"
00:27:21,00:27:27,"well, it looks like a wound in their head, which is what they breathe through. But they also have"
00:27:27,00:27:31,"their genitals, I think. Their anus and their genitals are towards the front of their body,"
00:27:31,00:27:36,"because they evolved from snails and snails have to have all of that stuff at the front,"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"because if it stuck in their shell, you're just pouring in your own shell. So they've got their"
00:27:40,00:27:44,"anus and their genitals at the front, all on the right-hand side as well. But I think that would be"
00:27:44,00:27:49,"a really exciting plot point, everything being on the right-hand side thing. If you had, let's say,"
00:27:49,00:27:55,"a slug hospital drama, and you've got this slug spouse turning up, and the doctor slug says,"
00:27:55,00:28:01,"I'm so sorry, Mrs. Slug, one half of your husband's body was completely obliterated by the accident"
00:28:01,00:28:09,"with a cart. And then which half was obliterated? The left half. Oh, well, that's fine. And then,"
00:28:09,00:28:13,"you know, there's definitely that. Which half, and then the credits rule? I love it."
00:28:13,00:28:18,"I know, though, surely there must be some use to the other half of the slug. Otherwise,"
00:28:18,00:28:22,"all slugs would evolve into being half a slug. That's true. That's absolutely right. Well, maybe"
00:28:22,00:28:27,"they're on the way there. You know, in a million years' time, slugs will only be half a slug."
00:28:27,00:28:33,"And everyone will always say, I wonder where the other half is. You know, some slugs eat birds."
00:28:33,00:28:40,No. Nature's reversed itself. They're eating birds. It's actually a bit of a problem. I think
00:28:40,00:28:45,researchers in Poland were the first ones to discover this. And they looked in birds' nests where
00:28:45,00:28:51,"there are little chicks being nestlings. And they saw a slug there. They were like, no worries,"
00:28:51,00:28:55,just a slug. The mum will probably eat it. Came back a few days later. And the birds had been eaten.
00:28:55,00:29:01,And it turns out that slugs will nore away at little chicks in nests. And the mothers don't
00:29:01,00:29:05,"even stop them from doing it. Because, well, we think they haven't really evolved this defense"
00:29:05,00:29:09,mechanism yet. Because it doesn't happen often enough that they've evolved. So they just watch
00:29:09,00:29:14,"these slugs nore away using their regular, which is their tongue, which is covered in little teeth."
00:29:14,00:29:19,"And they eat the little birds alive. Wow. I have to say, the fact that it doesn't happen very"
00:29:19,00:29:24,"often is not an excuse for the bird mum. I would say if that happened once, that requires"
00:29:24,00:29:29,"intervention. I agree. I think that's evolution going wrong. If you don't automatically know,"
00:29:29,00:29:34,"if you see a slug eating your baby, you should stop it happening. Why I think it's quite interesting"
00:29:34,00:29:40,"is that this nursery rhyme said, ""Bushler Valley, to take home to your kids, kids in the nest."" It doesn't"
00:29:40,00:29:46,"say kids in your nest. So maybe these children in Denmark, they knew about this kind of behavior of"
00:29:46,00:29:51,"slugs. Oh my god, James. This is like the time you proved the minds right earlier this episode."
00:29:51,00:29:59,"Amazing. So slugs use for lubricants. Lots of other things have been used for lubricants in the past,"
00:29:59,00:30:05,haven't they? Seaweed used by people in Japan for thousands of years. If you get red seaweed and
00:30:05,00:30:12,"boil it up, it gives you this liquid called Karajinan. And it's extremely gelatinous and slippery,"
00:30:12,00:30:17,"and it's been used as lubricant forever. James, are you talking about tribology here?"
00:30:17,00:30:23,Am I? I think you are. So tribology is the science of friction and lubrication.
00:30:23,00:30:31,And it is such a recent science that it was only named in 1966. Wow. But it covers basically
00:30:31,00:30:37,"everything. Everything you can imagine, all mechanical processes have friction and lubrication"
00:30:37,00:30:42,"elements in them. So there's geotribology, which is about tectonic plates and glaciers."
00:30:42,00:30:48,"There's nanotribology, which is in computer disk storage. There's biotribology, which is hip joints"
00:30:48,00:30:53,and how they work and now replacement hips can stay working for longer or everything. And we met
00:30:53,00:30:58,a tribologist when we were in Vienna. You know what? I was just about to ask that. Was he not the guy
00:30:58,00:31:04,"who said he coined the word tribology? Well, I've come across different accounts of who coined it."
00:31:04,00:31:09,"I've heard that a guy called Peter Jost also did, but we met Friedrich Franek, who is a senior"
00:31:09,00:31:14,"tribologist in Vienna. And he was great. Yeah, kept slipping over, didn't he?"
00:31:14,00:31:21,"Yeah, but his card, his card outside was so well-oiled."
00:31:21,00:31:29,"That's amazing. Well, I believe him. He's our friend. Yeah. Yeah, let's go with him."
00:31:29,00:31:33,All right. I think that's how the royalty works. I was reading about nose grease.
00:31:33,00:31:39,"Oh, yeah. Do you know about this? No. So the the oiliest and greasiest bit on the human body"
00:31:39,00:31:45,"is the little bit that's connected between the nose and the face. And it's got so many uses,"
00:31:45,00:31:51,observatories with telescopes would use it to sort of minimize the scratches on the surfaces
00:31:51,00:31:55,"of the telescope. It would be really effective for that. And if you ever have a beer,"
00:31:55,00:31:59,"this is just for a tip. Next time you have a pint of beer, if the head of the beer is too much,"
00:31:59,00:32:06,you can take your nose grease and you can stir it into the head and it will make it will dissipate.
00:32:06,00:32:10,"I'll be trying that really quickly, not yet, because I read it this morning and I thought it might be."
00:32:10,00:32:18,"So we read once on QI that if you take earwax and put it into beer, then that will also make the"
00:32:18,00:32:23,"bubbles go away. And we were going to do it on the show, but no one thought to try it. And then on"
00:32:23,00:32:27,"the day of recording, we actually got some beer and we thought in rehearsal, let's just quickly"
00:32:27,00:32:33,try it to make sure it works and it really did not work. Just ended up with bubbly earwax
00:32:33,00:32:39,"seabere. Oh well, Dan, I can't wait to go out for a nice pint all of us when this is all over"
00:32:39,00:32:46,and just see you rubbing your nose and your glass. I'm not going to put my actual nose in the glass.
00:32:46,00:32:54,"White cut out the middle man of the figure. I don't think we produce enough grease, do we?"
00:32:54,00:32:58,We're all stroking this bit of our nose. I can see you're all doing the same as me.
00:32:58,00:33:02,"So this is the bit of your nose. Dan, when you said between the nose and the face, I thought you"
00:33:02,00:33:08,"meant on the inside. I couldn't work out what you meant, but you mean the outer bit below your eyes."
00:33:08,00:33:13,"I think it's specifically the bit between like, let's say your cheeks and your nostrils,"
00:33:13,00:33:19,"like that little indentation. The side bit of your nose. Yeah, those are greasy bits."
00:33:19,00:33:23,"Yeah, it's very soft actually. I'd never noticed before, but it is quite soft, but I still don't"
00:33:23,00:33:28,think it is enough to be stirring usefully into anything for culinary purposes. I think if you've
00:33:28,00:33:32,"got a telescope and a tiny little aperture, then I can see it might be useful for that."
00:33:32,00:33:36,"But if you're going to do it for a pint, you're probably going to have to go around the whole pub"
00:33:36,00:33:39,getting bittersy at everyone's nose. I can only see if you anything.
00:33:39,00:33:44,"By coincidence, I have these two things next to me. This is really a coincidence, but I could"
00:33:44,00:33:48,"test out. Oh, you could test it. Dan has a beer and a glass. There's no way we're not going to demand"
00:33:48,00:33:54,"people to say that. It's zero alcohol though, so I don't know if that might not produce a head."
00:33:54,00:34:07,"Get my nose. Okay, so here's the beer. I'm just pour it in. Here's my nose."
00:34:09,00:34:19,"This all stacks up so far. Wow, look at it dissolving immediately. Look at that. Oh, look at"
00:34:19,00:34:24,"that. It is disappearing. This is a good tip. If you're a barman and you ever pour a bad point,"
00:34:24,00:34:27,"just get some grease off your face, dip your finger in. Look at that. Okay, that actually,"
00:34:27,00:34:32,that is quite impressive. Now we do need to see it with a control where you're not using the grease.
00:34:33,00:34:39,"Maybe next week. Yes, next week's party. Tune in. Cool. That was good. Nice. Yeah, well done."
00:34:39,00:34:45,Good experiment. Well driven. I've got one more facts if we have time for one more on this one.
00:34:45,00:34:53,So I just read a story that happened in 2002 about a case of grease causing a lawsuit. So a man
00:34:53,00:35:02,sued a pub for slipping on pork chop grease. His name was Troy Bowrin and the story says a man who
00:35:02,00:35:07,slipped on a trail of grease left on a pub floor by a patron wearing pork chops on his feet was
00:35:07,00:35:15,"awarded more than 23,000 pounds yesterday by an Australian court. So many questions. Yep,"
00:35:15,00:35:22,Troy Bowrin. He broke his arm. He was at the Janallian in South Sydney and this was back in 1997
00:35:22,00:35:28,that the incident actually happened. And basically what happened was another guy there called Ross
00:35:28,00:35:35,"Lukeock had won the meat, the pork chops in a raffle and a pub raffle. But then the pub refused"
00:35:35,00:35:41,him service at the bar because he was barefoot. So he returned a short time later with the chops
00:35:41,00:35:46,"strapped to his feet and walked around everywhere, even playing pool in the pub. And"
00:35:46,00:35:52,poor old Troy Bowrin was then walking along and they hand cleaned away the grease left behind
00:35:52,00:35:56,and slipped on it and successfully sued both the pub and the man wearing the pork chops on his
00:35:56,00:35:58,"feet. And this guy was Australian. He said, wow."
00:35:58,00:36:09,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact. My fact is in 2019,"
00:36:09,00:36:16,"69 pilgrims made a journey from the Surn Abbas giant, which is that nude chalk man that's carved"
00:36:16,00:36:23,into the hillside in England to Surn in Geneva or as they put it from the large hard on to the large
00:36:23,00:36:30,Hadron. So this was a pilgrimage that happened April last year. 69 pilgrims got on a double
00:36:30,00:36:38,decker bus after starting a sort of pagan druid style ritual at the Surn Abbas giant. They went
00:36:38,00:36:43,through Italy and stayed in a place called Damanher which is a community that's up there and then
00:36:43,00:36:49,they went through to Switzerland where they ended up at the Surn large Hadron collider and they
00:36:49,00:36:56,performed another bizarre pagan ritual there. They wanted to immunize the Eschaton which is the
00:36:56,00:37:03,idea is that they wanted to bring the beauty of the afterworld into the current world. So heaven
00:37:03,00:37:07,basically brought into world. That was all very interesting down but the main bit I got from that is
00:37:07,00:37:12,that they went from England to Geneva and went through Italy. That's not it's not on the way.
00:37:12,00:37:20,There sounds like more of a jolly than a pilgrimage. I think your rice most pilgrimages are not on a
00:37:20,00:37:26,double decker bus either. But yeah so and this was done by someone called Daisy Campbell and it was
00:37:26,00:37:33,"told to me by a friend of fish, Dr David Bramwell who is a author and he was actually part of the"
00:37:33,00:37:39,group of 69 pilgrims except that he didn't go with them but he was one of the 69 he was at the
00:37:39,00:37:46,Surn giant. So we know that not all of them were there? Yeah I'm guessing so. 69 feels like
00:37:46,00:37:51,as a crucial number though. Was that just happy coincidence? No intentional. I guess you're right
00:37:51,00:37:57,maybe he was number 70 and I'm pretty sure that he said he was 69. Yeah if he's number 70 it ruins
00:37:57,00:38:03,the joke so yeah can't go. We should say they were doing it for a joke right so they are quite
00:38:03,00:38:08,funny and when you read the write-up it's obviously a very humorous thing they're doing this pagan
00:38:08,00:38:14,thing. Yes. And they call themselves discordians which is a sort of faux pseudo religion started in
00:38:14,00:38:20,the 60s and it's sort of based around chaos and chaos isn't important as order and stuff like that
00:38:20,00:38:28,right? Absolutely yeah and but they are a lot of people who are druids do it and they do they do buy
00:38:28,00:38:34,into a lot of magic and folk but yes it's all done with a great tongue and cheekness about it.
00:38:34,00:38:38,Can we just quickly mention this place that they visited in Italy because it's incredible
00:38:38,00:38:43,I'd never heard of this damn in her but I don't know. Drumwell's been there before hasn't he?
00:38:43,00:38:51,Yes he has yeah many times. I want to go. It's an extraordinary place it's a it's a community that was
00:38:51,00:38:58,set up by this one guy who claimed that he was the pre-incarnation of an alien from the future so
00:38:58,00:39:03,the idea is that there was a panel of aliens talking in the future about the destruction of planet
00:39:03,00:39:08,earth and they pinpointed it to the fact that earth lost its way in life and became a very negative
00:39:08,00:39:12,place and destroyed itself so he thought I'm going to stop that yeah James. It's just Andy's looking
00:39:12,00:39:17,quite skeptical about this story. Yeah a little bit. Wait till wait till you hear where it goes Andy.
00:39:17,00:39:27,So he pre-incarnated by thousands of thousands of years and landed himself in the Italian hills
00:39:27,00:39:33,and he set up this community and they decided under the cover of darkness to build a temple
00:39:33,00:39:39,to time travel that would help save humanity using just their hands largely to begin with and then
00:39:39,00:39:44,eventually drills and to look at pictures of it highly recommended look at damn in her it's one
00:39:44,00:39:50,of those beautiful things you'll ever see it's stunning. So this is aside from that is obviously just
00:39:50,00:39:55,a bunch of crazy people but these temples are unbelievable and they kept it secret for 15 years
00:39:55,00:40:00,didn't they so this little community in Italy digging a hundred feet underground under a mountain
00:40:00,00:40:06,and it was only in 1992 when someone reported them to the police and the police went and to be
00:40:06,00:40:11,fed the police the police said oh you've made some really really nice huge temples inside a mountain
00:40:11,00:40:16,good on you let's open it up to the public. I'm just thinking that when they were digging into this
00:40:16,00:40:20,mountain in northern Italy did they not come across a hundred thousand apples that are in there.
00:40:20,00:40:25,Just as one bar call back to last week. Yeah.
00:40:28,00:40:33,So they pitched up there they they saw the temples and then they went on to Surn and to yeah.
00:40:33,00:40:36,I don't understand anything that's been said in the last five minutes.
00:40:36,00:40:44,Well let's talk about the chalk avistrylam. So the Surn Abistrian we should say is a 180-foot
00:40:44,00:40:52,tall naked man with a club and he has an absolutely enormous penis. Yes. Yes is that fair to say.
00:40:52,00:40:56,Didn't always used to be as big. No that was I know this is the crazy thing this is the
00:40:57,00:41:04,sort of area 51 of Britain is this chalk giant penis which used to be tiny. No it used to be normal
00:41:04,00:41:11,sized. It was normal 12-foot long penis. It was 16 feet long which is a normal size for a giant
00:41:11,00:41:18,that size. So basically he was like he was 200 feet tall and he had a 200 inch penis so it's the
00:41:18,00:41:24,same as a six or tall man having a six inch penis so it's you know it's a completely normal size
00:41:24,00:41:32,but then in 1908 chalk cutters merged his penis with his belly button and made it seven feet longer
00:41:32,00:41:37,which now makes it look completely out of proportion. Now if that wasn't a chalk got a trying
00:41:37,00:41:41,to compensate for something I don't know why the phrase compensating for something was ever
00:41:41,00:41:49,invented. Do you know who found out about this disturbance because it's it's been described to
00:41:49,00:41:52,a few different people some people say it was down on the 50s by contractors and other but you know
00:41:52,00:41:59,blah blah blah or locals did it but Rodney Kassadin is a kind of freelance archaeologist and he
00:41:59,00:42:05,developed a system of working out where the soil had been disturbed and he said I've made a trial
00:42:05,00:42:10,run down the phallus and obtained electrical measurements indicating a joint so he worked out
00:42:10,00:42:15,that that the penis had definitely been extended to the former belly button and then the national
00:42:15,00:42:22,trust who owned the site they had to decide whether to give the certain abyss giant a penis a penis
00:42:22,00:42:30,ectomy penis trim reduction cut reduck a penis thank you a penis reduction and they decided not to do
00:42:30,00:42:34,it I guess because it's been a hundred years since it was extended and it must be that's now what
00:42:34,00:42:40,it's like but it and also because of the adverse PR that it would have created I think for them yeah
00:42:40,00:42:48,like squatters rights at that point yeah they do top it up every 25 years or so give it a sort of
00:42:48,00:42:59,"makeover and it's 17,000 tons of chalk that's used I'm not 17 what am I talking about yeah sorry"
00:42:59,00:43:05,"it's 17 tons of chalk that is used 17,000 very sorry um what a penis that would be"
00:43:07,00:43:18,the white cliffs of dover are no more yeah every 25 years except for when there's problems so they
00:43:18,00:43:24,had to give him a nose job at one point because erosion had been too unkind on him so they maybe he
00:43:24,00:43:32,was just trying to defone the beer did you read down did you read the report of the last the last job
00:43:32,00:43:38,they did because they it's volunteers who do it so it's you know there are dozens of people who go and
00:43:38,00:43:44,they they trim the grass verges because obviously it's cut into a chalk hillside and they interviewed
00:43:44,00:43:51,the national trust man because some chalk figures have now been redone in concrete which is obviously
00:43:51,00:43:56,easier but actually obviously it's not very historical and it's a bit it's a bit lazy and the
00:43:56,00:44:02,national trust man um called Martin Papworth said I think there would be an outcry if we tried to cut
00:44:02,00:44:13,corners says Papworth who ironically is here to help cut the corners yeah so we don't fully know
00:44:13,00:44:17,when this was made right we yeah I always assume this was quite ancient but there's a lot of
00:44:17,00:44:22,suggestion that it's dates from the 17th century because that's the first mention that we get of
00:44:22,00:44:28,it and a lot of theories about why it came about one is that it was a sort of satirical piece on
00:44:28,00:44:32,Oliver Cromwell and they believe that there were missing bits from it there used to be a dismembered
00:44:32,00:44:39,head at the bottom and a cloak in the other arm that's not holding the club but no one truly knows
00:44:39,00:44:43,because a lot of sources do claim that it's older don't they there was an article in the independent
00:44:43,00:44:49,that casually referred to it as 2000 years old but it seems impossible that this thing would have
00:44:49,00:44:56,"existed for 1,500 years and no one mentioned it until the 1694 that's what I mean surely"
00:44:56,00:45:00,someone would have written down at some point by the way we've got this massive naked man on a hill
00:45:00,00:45:06,there's a land survey in 1617 that talks about this hill and doesn't mention the massive naked man
00:45:06,00:45:11,and it just seems like if you were to buy a house and the survey came back and it didn't
00:45:11,00:45:16,mention there was a massive naked man on the side of your house you would complain wouldn't you
00:45:16,00:45:23,yeah you would you would there is one theory I've heard and I like this so much so the people of
00:45:23,00:45:29,Dorset were interviewed about it in the 18th century and this was a I think a local reverend who
00:45:29,00:45:35,is a bit of an amateur historian taking this record from the locals and the people there at the time
00:45:35,00:45:40,said that it represented a giant who had stolen sheep from the people living nearby
00:45:41,00:45:47,for his own food and then he'd lain down to rest in this field and the villagers had killed
00:45:47,00:45:53,the giant in his sleep and then they'd put an outline around him meaning that the chalk giant
00:45:53,00:45:58,would be a literal crime scene chalk I don't know these names draw in pop shows
00:45:58,00:46:05,when you have a murder and you see the chalk line on the floor they don't put the penis in there
00:46:06,00:46:17,so we have a log of us today final indignity that's brilliant it has been covered up for other
00:46:17,00:46:22,reasons in the past so in the 19th century classic Victorians they apparently they let foliage
00:46:22,00:46:29,grow discreetly over the penis so you couldn't see the penis in the Victorian age and then in the war
00:46:29,00:46:35,we covered up the certain giant and all of our other chalk hillsides I think which if you were
00:46:35,00:46:39,listening from a broad you should know that England is the south of England specifically just has
00:46:39,00:46:44,this weird habit of drawing massive chalk figures on hills and then come world war two we had to
00:46:44,00:46:48,sort of like paint a lot of them green or cover a lot of them and grass and stuff because they're
00:46:48,00:46:53,quite obvious from the sky you didn't want the German bombers to be able to use them as an
00:46:53,00:47:08,navigation like following the directs of the penis bristle this way okay that's it that is all
00:47:08,00:47:11,of our facts thank you so much for listening if you would like to get in contact with any of us
00:47:11,00:47:15,about the things that we have said over the course of this show you can find us on our Twitter
