00:00:00,00:00:02,(whimsical music)
00:00:02,00:00:04,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:04,00:00:07,(upbeat music)
00:00:07,00:00:12,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:12,00:00:15,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:15,00:00:18,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:20,My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here
00:00:20,00:00:24,"with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Anja Murray."
00:00:24,00:00:26,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:26,00:00:29,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:29,00:00:33,"and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."
00:00:33,00:00:35,My fact is that a group of scientists
00:00:35,00:00:37,is currently making their own lava.
00:00:37,00:00:40,Pretty cool.
00:00:40,00:00:43,"So there's a lot of scientists who are,"
00:00:43,00:00:47,the University of Buffalo's Center for GeoHazard Studies
00:00:47,00:00:48,and they want to study what it's like
00:00:48,00:00:50,"when lava and water meet,"
00:00:50,00:00:53,'cause it's something that you don't get to study a lot
00:00:53,00:00:56,"in the wild, in the natural world."
00:00:56,00:00:57,"But it's really important as well,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,"because when lava and water meet,"
00:00:59,00:01:02,"it gets really, really explosive as opposed to only"
00:01:02,00:01:03,normal lava explosivity.
00:01:03,00:01:06,And so they are making their own stuff
00:01:06,00:01:09,and they melt 10 gallons of basaltic rock
00:01:09,00:01:12,"at a time in a furnace at 2,500 degrees."
00:01:12,00:01:16,"- Is there not a thing about water and lava meeting,"
00:01:16,00:01:17,"which is related to the ladenfrost effects,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,one of James's favorite effects?
00:01:19,00:01:22,"I think it's, which is when two substances"
00:01:22,00:01:25,of vastly different temperatures meet each other
00:01:25,00:01:26,and it means that the water isn't caused
00:01:26,00:01:29,"to boil straight away, because this layer of gas"
00:01:29,00:01:32,suddenly forms between the water and the lava.
00:01:32,00:01:34,"And I think that might be what makes it so explosive,"
00:01:34,00:01:35,because this layer of gas forms
00:01:35,00:01:37,and then eventually that layer of gas collapses
00:01:37,00:01:40,and then this massive explosion happens to us.
00:01:40,00:01:41,- Do you know where they could have gone
00:01:41,00:01:43,to see lava meet water?
00:01:43,00:01:44,- No.
00:01:44,00:01:45,- 1973.
00:01:45,00:01:46,(laughing)
00:01:46,00:01:48,- They went to 1973.
00:01:48,00:01:51,"There's a nice landic town called Vest Mania,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,"I'm pronouncing that wrong, obviously."
00:01:53,00:01:55,"But in 1973, they had a volcano erupt"
00:01:55,00:01:57,"and the lava was heading towards this town,"
00:01:57,00:01:58,which was quite far away.
00:01:58,00:02:01,And what they decided to do was they got water cannons
00:02:01,00:02:04,and they pumped billions of gallons of water
00:02:04,00:02:06,at the lava that was approaching to stop it.
00:02:06,00:02:08,And they did it from months on end
00:02:08,00:02:11,and eventually did stop and so the town was saved.
00:02:11,00:02:13,- Some people would say it is harder for scientists
00:02:13,00:02:16,"to build a time machine and go back to 1973,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,possibly even than making their own lava.
00:02:18,00:02:19,- It would have been a better fact though.
00:02:19,00:02:22,"- Wasn't there a town, was it in Spain,"
00:02:22,00:02:25,"or Italy, where there was a volcano going off?"
00:02:25,00:02:27,The villagers kind of made a trench
00:02:27,00:02:30,so that the lava wouldn't go into their towns.
00:02:30,00:02:32,But instead they directed it into the next town.
00:02:32,00:02:33,(laughing)
00:02:33,00:02:34,- It was in Sicily.
00:02:34,00:02:36,- It was one mountaineer exploded.
00:02:36,00:02:38,The village was called Catania
00:02:38,00:02:40,and they dug an artificial breach
00:02:40,00:02:42,so to redirect the lava.
00:02:42,00:02:43,"And the really cool thing is they,"
00:02:43,00:02:45,do you know how they kept cool?
00:02:45,00:02:48,They wore wet sheep skins while they were working.
00:02:48,00:02:51,"- But they, the villagers who they redirected"
00:02:51,00:02:53,the lava flow to then redirected it back
00:02:53,00:02:55,to this other place called Boterno
00:02:55,00:02:58,and the Boternians just sent it right back that way.
00:02:58,00:02:59,- No!
00:02:59,00:02:59,- It's so funny.
00:02:59,00:03:02,- Do you know how to tell if a volcano explodes
00:03:02,00:03:04,"whether you're really, really, really in trouble?"
00:03:04,00:03:05,- No.
00:03:05,00:03:06,- And you look up at the spout of lava
00:03:06,00:03:08,that's coming out of the volcano.
00:03:08,00:03:09,"And if it's moving left or right,"
00:03:09,00:03:11,you're absolutely fine from your perspective.
00:03:11,00:03:15,"If it appears to be staying still, you're in trouble."
00:03:15,00:03:16,"- Well, because presumably that's coming towards you."
00:03:16,00:03:19,- Because it's exactly on the same axis as you.
00:03:19,00:03:20,- I'll be going directly away from you.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"- Well, it's not James, it's coming towards you."
00:03:22,00:03:23,(laughing)
00:03:23,00:03:23,- I'm being annoying.
00:03:23,00:03:25,(laughing)
00:03:25,00:03:28,- I find it amazing that volcanoes are made of lava.
00:03:28,00:03:29,I never really thought of that.
00:03:29,00:03:30,"I thought, oh, they're just made of rock"
00:03:30,00:03:32,that's sticking up and then the lava comes out of it.
00:03:32,00:03:34,But they're made of either lava or lava
00:03:34,00:03:37,"and ash in layers, building up over millions of years."
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- I thought what was amazing is,"
00:03:39,00:03:42,do you remember the tunnel going through the Alps?
00:03:42,00:03:44,"The Got-Hard tunnel, do you remember that?"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"And how, when they went through it,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,some of the time the rock was really hard
00:03:48,00:03:50,and then some of it was crumbly like sand.
00:03:50,00:03:53,- You always think of a mountain as being like solid
00:03:53,00:03:54,"all the way through, but it's amazing"
00:03:54,00:03:57,that there are gaps in there and little crumbly bits
00:03:57,00:03:58,and it's like a trifle.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"- Yeah, you said there are bits,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,"you said, 'cause we did on nice such things the news,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,there are bits which were as soft as butter.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- Yeah.
00:04:05,00:04:06,- But I can't believe that.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Actually.
00:04:07,00:04:08,- You can't believe it's butter.
00:04:08,00:04:11,(laughing)
00:04:11,00:04:13,- You'd be so annoyed if you were building on that mountain
00:04:13,00:04:15,or you're trying to get through that mountain
00:04:15,00:04:16,and your mate got the butter bit
00:04:16,00:04:18,and you've got the granite bit next to it.
00:04:18,00:04:20,- So you turned up with a massive boring machine
00:04:20,00:04:21,and he's just got a buster knife.
00:04:21,00:04:24,(laughing)
00:04:24,00:04:25,"- Actually, speaking of tunnels,"
00:04:25,00:04:28,there are lava-related tunnels on the moon.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"- Oh, there's the best thing I've read this week."
00:04:30,00:04:31,- It's so amazing.
00:04:31,00:04:34,"Yeah, and I can't believe I didn't know these existed."
00:04:34,00:04:36,"So we discovered this quite recently, I think,"
00:04:36,00:04:39,that the moon has these underground tunnels
00:04:39,00:04:43,and they were formed by lava flows 3.5 billion years ago.
00:04:43,00:04:46,"So lava would flow and then it solidifies on top,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,faster than it solidifies underneath.
00:04:48,00:04:51,So the top creates this roof and then underneath the roof
00:04:51,00:04:53,is hollowed out as the lava flows through it.
00:04:53,00:04:55,And so there are these hollow lava tunnels
00:04:55,00:04:58,and one of the ways we know this is because they have things
00:04:58,00:04:59,"called skylights in these tunnels,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,which is where a bit of them fall in
00:05:01,00:05:03,and then we see this hole that suddenly created
00:05:03,00:05:05,which shows us this tunnel underneath.
00:05:05,00:05:06,- It's so cool.
00:05:06,00:05:09,The reason that scientists are really interested in it
00:05:09,00:05:11,is because the idea of building these moon bases
00:05:11,00:05:14,that always get proposed one day will have a moon base.
00:05:14,00:05:15,They actually think so part of the problem
00:05:15,00:05:17,with moon bases is all the radiation coming in
00:05:17,00:05:20,and they think that these tubes could lead
00:05:20,00:05:22,to these sort of underground bunkers
00:05:22,00:05:23,where we could put the bases.
00:05:23,00:05:25,So they're now looking into these tubes
00:05:25,00:05:27,"and they've got probes that have been flying over,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,they've been sussing them out and trying to learn more.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"- So exciting. - Yeah, so it's amazing."
00:05:33,00:05:35,- You know how we've been discussing
00:05:35,00:05:37,"in the office recently, the football"
00:05:37,00:05:39,and Iceland has a lot of volcanoes?
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Well, the Icelandic football team"
00:05:41,00:05:45,until the 1950s played and practiced on lava.
00:05:45,00:05:47,They played on gravel which was made of crushed lava.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"- Wow, that's great."
00:05:48,00:05:50,- They wonder they're good these days.
00:05:50,00:05:53,- More impressive to do it on liquid lava
00:05:53,00:05:54,as it flows out of the volcano.
00:05:54,00:05:55,That would be pretty cool.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"'Cause also if you put your foot on lava,"
00:05:57,00:05:59,it's so hot that it sets fire to your foot.
00:05:59,00:06:00,So that would be quite cool.
00:06:00,00:06:01,You'd look like one of those cartoon characters
00:06:01,00:06:03,that has your shoes on fire.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- No, that would have been a very impressive."
00:06:04,00:06:05,- Yes.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"- Yeah, I mean it's not a practical idea."
00:06:08,00:06:10,- In cartoons you do see people falling into lava
00:06:10,00:06:13,but that would never happen 'cause lava's quite thick
00:06:13,00:06:15,and gloopy and more viscous and humans.
00:06:15,00:06:17,- Would you just fall onto it?
00:06:17,00:06:18,- You fall onto it and settle on fire.
00:06:18,00:06:19,- Right.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- Rather than kind of go, ""No!"""
00:06:21,00:06:22,and kind of the last thing you see
00:06:22,00:06:24,is your arm going into the lava here that's--
00:06:24,00:06:28,"- So what about the end of Terminator 2, spoiler alert,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,where Arnie of course goes into the liquid steel?
00:06:30,00:06:32,"- Well, is he not a robot?"
00:06:32,00:06:33,- He's made of metal.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"- Yeah, so it's slightly different to humans."
00:06:35,00:06:36,- It's a huge difference.
00:06:36,00:06:37,- Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:39,- He'll have a different density to humans.
00:06:39,00:06:40,- All right.
00:06:40,00:06:41,- They have researched it Andy.
00:06:41,00:06:43,They're not just making stuff up on the top of their heads.
00:06:43,00:06:44,"- Yeah, no, no, no."
00:06:44,00:06:46,- Have a swim in Terminator?
00:06:46,00:06:48,"- No, he doesn't, that's why."
00:06:48,00:06:50,(laughing)
00:06:50,00:06:54,- I was reading Mark Komode in Simon Mayo's book
00:06:54,00:06:56,and they were talking about movie endings
00:06:56,00:06:58,that don't quite make scientific sense
00:06:58,00:07:01,and one of them they say is that Lord of the Rings
00:07:01,00:07:03,"right at the end, for Frodo to go into Volcano,"
00:07:03,00:07:04,that wouldn't be possible
00:07:04,00:07:07,because you would just explode from the heat.
00:07:07,00:07:08,- Sure.
00:07:08,00:07:09,- Is that true?
00:07:09,00:07:10,- How dense are hobbits?
00:07:10,00:07:12,"I mean, these are all made up things aren't they?"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"- Volcanoes aren't made up,"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"but they're in a fancy world, so they could have them."
00:07:17,00:07:18,- Talking could have specified
00:07:18,00:07:21,that in Middle-earth volcanoes are a bit colder.
00:07:21,00:07:22,(laughing)
00:07:22,00:07:22,"- Oh yeah, that's true."
00:07:22,00:07:24,- Now you do have cold volcanoes.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Have you heard about this?
00:07:25,00:07:26,- No.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- Are you talking about fountains?
00:07:27,00:07:28,(laughing)
00:07:28,00:07:31,"- There is a volcano called Gelae Volcano,"
00:07:31,00:07:34,"which is near Lake Natron, which is in Tanzania"
00:07:34,00:07:39,and their lava is made out of natural carbonateite
00:07:39,00:07:42,and it has a different melting point to normal rock.
00:07:42,00:07:46,Which means it's a lot colder than normal volcanoes.
00:07:46,00:07:50,"I mean, it is 510 degrees Celsius, so it's not that cold,"
00:07:50,00:07:52,but it is that slight half the temperature
00:07:52,00:07:53,of a normal volcano.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"- Bring a jumper, you're saying."
00:07:55,00:07:56,- I'm saying it.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"- If you're gonna wear wet sheepskins,"
00:07:59,00:08:00,then you'll be better off at that one
00:08:00,00:08:02,than a normal volcano.
00:08:02,00:08:03,- It's a great tip.
00:08:03,00:08:04,- Okay.
00:08:04,00:08:05,- Although you do get ice lava.
00:08:05,00:08:06,- Really?
00:08:06,00:08:07,- What?
00:08:07,00:08:08,- How cool is this?
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Not on Earth on other planets,"
00:08:09,00:08:11,but they're in the solar system.
00:08:11,00:08:15,"There are ice volcanoes, also known as cryovolcanoes,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,"and they throw up not molten rocks,"
00:08:17,00:08:21,they throw up water or ammonia or methane in liquid form.
00:08:21,00:08:23,And then it's so cold on those planets
00:08:23,00:08:25,"that it freezes almost instantly,"
00:08:25,00:08:27,that crashes to the ground.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"And so that happens on Pluto,"
00:08:28,00:08:29,it happens on some other moons.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- That's very cool.
00:08:30,00:08:31,- Yeah.
00:08:31,00:08:33,- Has anyone seen a mud volcano?
00:08:33,00:08:34,"- Nope, no."
00:08:34,00:08:36,- I saw some of them in Romania last week.
00:08:36,00:08:38,You kind of drive up to the top of like a mountain.
00:08:38,00:08:40,It's kind of a flat plateau.
00:08:40,00:08:44,"And then you just have this bubbling mud,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"these little pits of bubbling mud,"
00:08:46,00:08:47,and then they kind of spurred out a little bit
00:08:47,00:08:49,and then rolled down the hill.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"And it's just, yeah, it's a really awesome,"
00:08:51,00:08:54,- It sounds like you'd expect some kind of slime monster
00:08:54,00:08:55,to emerge from it.
00:08:55,00:08:56,- Yeah.
00:08:56,00:08:57,- Is it dangerous?
00:08:57,00:08:58,- Is it dangerous?
00:08:58,00:08:59,- Yeah.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"- When you go there, they tell you not to touch it,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,but because it's in Romania
00:09:03,00:09:05,and they don't really seem to bother about health
00:09:05,00:09:06,"and safety too much,"
00:09:06,00:09:09,it's not like in Britain there would probably be fences
00:09:09,00:09:11,"and you won't be able to go within a mile of them,"
00:09:11,00:09:13,but actually you can go right up to them.
00:09:13,00:09:15,- And that's why you're missing a hand this week.
00:09:15,00:09:16,(all laughing)
00:09:16,00:09:17,That was actually eaten by the slime monster.
00:09:17,00:09:20,(laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:21,"- Okay, here's the thing."
00:09:21,00:09:23,"The largest volcano in the world,"
00:09:23,00:09:26,and he guesses as to which or where it is.
00:09:26,00:09:27,- In the world.
00:09:27,00:09:28,- In the world.
00:09:28,00:09:28,- Yeah.
00:09:28,00:09:29,- Is it underwater?
00:09:29,00:09:30,- It's underwater.
00:09:30,00:09:32,- It's called the Tamu Massif.
00:09:32,00:09:35,It's a thousand miles east of Japan underwater.
00:09:35,00:09:38,It is equivalent in area to the British Isles.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"It is 120,000 square miles in area as of volcano."
00:09:42,00:09:45,"It's not active thankfully,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,"but it's so gradual, the slope on it"
00:09:47,00:09:49,"that if you were on the seabed,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,you would not be able to tell which way it was
00:09:51,00:09:52,towards the top.
00:09:52,00:09:55,"It's really, really, really, really gradual towards the top."
00:09:55,00:09:59,"But it is, it does slope, and it is the size of Britain."
00:09:59,00:10:02,"- You know, scientists have made lava before."
00:10:02,00:10:06,"A couple of years ago, they made lava by heating up rock."
00:10:06,00:10:08,This was a scientist at Syracuse University
00:10:08,00:10:11,and it took them 70 hours to heat-rock and turn it into lava.
00:10:11,00:10:14,"And once they'd done it, they made the world's hottest barbecue."
00:10:14,00:10:15,"- It's hard enough, isn't it?"
00:10:15,00:10:18,To make sure that the outside of your chicken wing
00:10:18,00:10:21,is not burnt in the inside's coat.
00:10:21,00:10:23,It's gonna be charcoal on the outside
00:10:23,00:10:24,and completely rarer on the floor.
00:10:24,00:10:27,"- Yeah, apparently there was a chef called Sam Bompas"
00:10:27,00:10:28,who was present and he said it was the best steak
00:10:28,00:10:29,he'd ever had.
00:10:29,00:10:30,"- Yeah, right."
00:10:30,00:10:32,He's always going around saying that.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Bompas.
00:10:33,00:10:37,"Okay, so just quickly this is about making things artificially."
00:10:37,00:10:39,- Do you know what the hottest temperature that humans
00:10:39,00:10:41,have ever made is?
00:10:41,00:10:42,- What?
00:10:42,00:10:45,- 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit.
00:10:45,00:10:47,- And what's that in centre grade?
00:10:47,00:10:50,- It's only 4 trillion degrees Celsius.
00:10:50,00:10:51,"- I don't know what either of those numbers mean,"
00:10:51,00:10:53,but light is that hotter than...
00:10:53,00:10:56,"- To give you an example, that's 250,000 times hotter"
00:10:56,00:10:56,than the sun.
00:10:56,00:10:57,- Yeah.
00:10:57,00:10:59,- It's that Bismarck 75 million.
00:10:59,00:11:01,(laughing)
00:11:01,00:11:02,Fan-on or fan-on?
00:11:02,00:11:05,(laughing)
00:11:05,00:11:07,(upbeat music)
00:11:07,00:11:13,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is James."
00:11:13,00:11:16,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the word Timbuktu"
00:11:16,00:11:19,means woman with a sticky out belly button.
00:11:19,00:11:24,So this is a book that I'm reading the moment called
00:11:24,00:11:27,The Bad Ass Librarians of Timbuktu
00:11:27,00:11:29,by Joshua Hammer and it's a brilliant book
00:11:29,00:11:31,and this is just the first bite that I found in there
00:11:31,00:11:33,when I started reading it.
00:11:33,00:11:38,And nobody really actually knows why it comes from this phrase.
00:11:38,00:11:39,There's some thought that it might have been
00:11:39,00:11:42,the goddess that they look towards.
00:11:42,00:11:45,What I kind of thought is maybe it's just a belly button thing
00:11:45,00:11:48,and it could be that it's in some kind of depression.
00:11:48,00:11:49,I think Timbuktu's in like a depression
00:11:49,00:11:53,so it could be like it's the belly button of that area.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"- Although then that would be a real any, wouldn't it?"
00:11:55,00:11:56,"- Yeah, so it's a depression."
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Unless you're looking at it from the other side.
00:11:57,00:11:58,- You're right.
00:11:58,00:11:59,- From inside here.
00:11:59,00:12:01,(laughing)
00:12:01,00:12:02,You're right.
00:12:03,00:12:06,"No, I think there are some disagreements about the translation."
00:12:06,00:12:09,It could be large belly button rather than sticky out belly button.
00:12:09,00:12:10,- Okay.
00:12:10,00:12:12,- It's one of these kind of nobody quite knows
00:12:12,00:12:13,but this is the most likely.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"- That is condition, isn't it?"
00:12:14,00:12:16,There's a medical condition which gives you sticky out
00:12:16,00:12:17,of belly buttons.
00:12:17,00:12:18,- Is that so?
00:12:18,00:12:19,- And it's known in the area.
00:12:19,00:12:21,"- Yeah, and it's known in the area."
00:12:21,00:12:25,It does happen there so possibly that was a woman.
00:12:25,00:12:27,- I read actually on a Reddit thread
00:12:27,00:12:29,"and I couldn't verify it that someone said,"
00:12:29,00:12:33,"""As per my source, brackets the 1996 Guinness Book of World Records."""
00:12:33,00:12:35,"So if anyone's got that check it,"
00:12:35,00:12:38,the longest outie ever recorded was 11.9 inches.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"- Oh, come on."
00:12:40,00:12:40,(laughing)
00:12:40,00:12:42,- If someone's really screwed up the unbilical cord.
00:12:42,00:12:43,- If you have like a sensitive cord.
00:12:43,00:12:45,"- Oh, but that's not how it works."
00:12:45,00:12:46,"- Oh, so that's not it."
00:12:46,00:12:49,- A lot of people think that a belly button
00:12:49,00:12:51,is where they've got the unbilical cord but it's not.
00:12:51,00:12:53,- It always gets cut a couple of inches away
00:12:53,00:12:58,from the stomach but then the muscles seal themselves off
00:12:58,00:13:00,and that bit of skin just dries up.
00:13:00,00:13:01,And I don't know where it goes.
00:13:01,00:13:04,"I mean, there have been 90 billion of those things"
00:13:04,00:13:06,since humanity evolved.
00:13:06,00:13:08,- But you think there's some kind of a pit somewhere?
00:13:08,00:13:09,- There must be somewhere.
00:13:09,00:13:10,- Shed belly buttons.
00:13:10,00:13:11,(laughing)
00:13:11,00:13:14,"- But it's like, for instance, everyone's toenails"
00:13:14,00:13:16,are always growing and people trim them.
00:13:16,00:13:19,But it's not like there's a massive cave of toenails.
00:13:19,00:13:20,"- It says, ""Well, you know James."""
00:13:20,00:13:22,(laughing)
00:13:22,00:13:23,- Wait till we get to--
00:13:23,00:13:24,- Wait until we get to--
00:13:24,00:13:28,- So Tim Buck too.
00:13:28,00:13:28,- Yeah.
00:13:28,00:13:30,- Do you know what it's twinned with?
00:13:30,00:13:31,This is rather nice.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"It's twinned with ""Hey on Why."""
00:13:32,00:13:33,"- Oh, yeah."
00:13:33,00:13:37,"- And when it was announced, someone from ""Hey"" said,"
00:13:37,00:13:40,"""Tim Buck too"" is the oldest home of the written word in Africa."
00:13:40,00:13:43,It has a large number of private and public libraries
00:13:43,00:13:45,housing ancient Arabic and African manuscripts.
00:13:45,00:13:48,"""Hey on Why"" is the second hand book capital of the world."
00:13:48,00:13:49,(laughing)
00:13:49,00:13:50,- That's basically the same.
00:13:50,00:13:53,- Actually Tim Buck too had a few was twin with a few
00:13:53,00:13:55,"and actually, obviously that makes you not a twin"
00:13:55,00:13:56,as soon as you've got more than one.
00:13:56,00:13:57,- Yes.
00:13:57,00:13:59,- You can't be tripleted with.
00:13:59,00:14:01,- It's amazing looking into Tim Buck too
00:14:01,00:14:03,because I genuinely knew nothing about it.
00:14:03,00:14:05,I know the only thing I knew about it
00:14:05,00:14:07,was that it was a lyric in an Oliver song.
00:14:07,00:14:09,- Go to Tim Buck too and back again.
00:14:09,00:14:11,That's the only thing I knew about it.
00:14:11,00:14:12,- Yeah.
00:14:12,00:14:13,- And it turns out that it was this incredible
00:14:13,00:14:16,cultural hotspot for knowledge in the--
00:14:16,00:14:18,"- Well, that's why it's so good that it's twinned"
00:14:18,00:14:22,with the second half of the world.
00:14:22,00:14:23,Because actually it's right.
00:14:23,00:14:24,They do have loads of manuscripts.
00:14:24,00:14:27,And this book is about a guy who tried to take a load
00:14:27,00:14:29,of manuscripts away from Tim Buck too
00:14:29,00:14:32,to the Mali and Capital Bamako
00:14:32,00:14:34,because they were under threat by Islamists.
00:14:34,00:14:36,"- Yeah, and it's an amazing story, isn't it?"
00:14:36,00:14:37,- It's a great story.
00:14:37,00:14:38,- And they genuinely did it.
00:14:38,00:14:41,So Islamists were coming into Tim Buck too
00:14:41,00:14:43,and they thought we bet they're gonna try
00:14:43,00:14:44,and destroy our libraries
00:14:44,00:14:45,'cause they had hundreds of thousands
00:14:45,00:14:47,of really valuable manuscripts
00:14:47,00:14:50,"and lo and behold, a short while later, a few months later,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,then the libraries were sort of raised to the ground
00:14:52,00:14:54,and they'd managed to save and smuggle out of the country
00:14:54,00:14:56,"more than 300,000 manuscripts"
00:14:56,00:14:58,and a few hundred were left.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"So everyone thought when these libraries collapsed,"
00:15:00,00:15:01,"oh no, that's all gone."
00:15:01,00:15:03,And then these guys came out of the woodwork
00:15:03,00:15:04,"saying, don't worry about it."
00:15:04,00:15:06,We got rid of them.
00:15:06,00:15:07,- And where are they now?
00:15:07,00:15:09,- I'm not telling you.
00:15:09,00:15:10,(laughing)
00:15:10,00:15:12,'Cause this goes out on the internet.
00:15:12,00:15:16,- So why did Tim Buck too have a big collapse
00:15:16,00:15:20,"to the point where I read a 2006 survey of 150 Britons,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,34% did not believe it existed.
00:15:23,00:15:25,- So I've actually got the survey here
00:15:25,00:15:27,and this was reported by the sun
00:15:27,00:15:29,"under the headline Tim Buck, who?"
00:15:29,00:15:31,(laughing)
00:15:31,00:15:32,- God.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"- But anyway, the survey, I think this is the survey"
00:15:34,00:15:36,"we're talking about now, it was in 2010"
00:15:36,00:15:38,and it was of 18 to 30 year olds.
00:15:38,00:15:39,- Okay. - Okay.
00:15:39,00:15:41,"And of them, maybe it was the same,"
00:15:41,00:15:42,maybe it was different.
00:15:42,00:15:44,Half thought that Tim Buck too was made up.
00:15:44,00:15:47,10% thought that Kazakhstan wasn't real.
00:15:47,00:15:50,A third said that Atlantis was somewhere in Greece
00:15:50,00:15:53,and one person thought that France was in Spain.
00:15:53,00:15:56,(laughing)
00:15:56,00:15:59,"- But actually for a long time, Tim Buck too,"
00:15:59,00:16:00,people weren't sure whether it existed.
00:16:00,00:16:03,It was kind of a half legendary place in North Africa
00:16:03,00:16:06,"and because Europeans didn't really go to North Africa,"
00:16:06,00:16:09,a lot of people went to try and find this so-called city
00:16:09,00:16:12,where great education happened and so on.
00:16:12,00:16:13,"- And gold reserves, right?"
00:16:13,00:16:15,It was quite famous for its gold a few hundred years ago.
00:16:15,00:16:16,- Exactly.
00:16:16,00:16:20,The first Westerner in modernish times to try and find it
00:16:20,00:16:21,was a guy called John Lediard.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"And when he went, he'd never been to Africa."
00:16:24,00:16:26,He didn't know a single word of Arabic.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"And when he got to Cairo, he had a bilious complaint"
00:16:30,00:16:33,and decided to treat it with sulfuric acid
00:16:33,00:16:36,and took so much that he immediately died.
00:16:36,00:16:37,- Whoa!
00:16:37,00:16:39,- Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:40,"- Hang on, so he was just trying to find it."
00:16:40,00:16:41,He didn't make it.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"- Well, he got as far as Cairo."
00:16:43,00:16:46,"And then he saw some, what he thought was Gaviscan"
00:16:46,00:16:47,that was actually--
00:16:47,00:16:50,"If only he'd known a single word of Arabic,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,namely sulfuric acid.
00:16:53,00:16:54,"- It's not the first word you learn, though, is it?"
00:16:54,00:16:55,"- No, it's not."
00:16:55,00:16:56,- I'm deep into the textbook.
00:16:56,00:16:58,"- It's right at the back of the phrase book, isn't it?"
00:16:58,00:16:59,It's in the medical section.
00:16:59,00:17:03,You just do hello and where is the toilet and stuff like that.
00:17:03,00:17:04,- He probably could have done with where is the toilet.
00:17:04,00:17:07,It's not the way.
00:17:07,00:17:08,- Do you know about the first Westerner to get to Timbuktu?
00:17:08,00:17:09,- No.
00:17:09,00:17:10,- He was called Gordon Lang.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"Okay, he got there in 1826."
00:17:12,00:17:15,"And he was a Scott and he was an adventurer, basically."
00:17:15,00:17:16,About 30 years old.
00:17:16,00:17:19,And he had this huge competition between Britain and France
00:17:19,00:17:21,to get to Timbuktu.
00:17:21,00:17:22,"And they obviously had a head start up,"
00:17:22,00:17:23,"because they're closer, but--"
00:17:23,00:17:24,"- Yeah, 'cause we're in Spain."
00:17:24,00:17:25,- Yeah.
00:17:25,00:17:28,(laughing)
00:17:28,00:17:30,"He said to his parents, ""I shall do more than has ever been"
00:17:30,00:17:33,done before and shall show myself to me what I have ever
00:17:33,00:17:35,"considered myself a man of enterprise and genius."""
00:17:35,00:17:37,"Right, so big claim."
00:17:37,00:17:40,This is from a website called GreatBritishNutters.Blogspot.
00:17:40,00:17:41,(laughing)
00:17:41,00:17:42,Amazing.
00:17:42,00:17:44,So he got to Tripoli immediately proposed
00:17:44,00:17:45,"to the British consul's daughter,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"and she fell in love with them, and they got married."
00:17:47,00:17:49,"And then he said, ""Right, I'm off to Timbuktu."""
00:17:49,00:17:51,He thought it would take him a few weeks.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"The temperatures were huge, right."
00:17:53,00:17:55,120 degrees Fahrenheit.
00:17:55,00:17:58,The food was patties of dried fish and camel's milk.
00:17:58,00:17:59,Bandits everywhere.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"One night he was attacked in his tent by bandits,"
00:18:01,00:18:04,"as he was sleeping, hacked out with swords."
00:18:04,00:18:08,"He got 24 wounds, 18 of them serious."
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Next morning, he still said, ""Put me on my camel."""
00:18:10,00:18:13,"So he was strapped onto a camel for 400 miles,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,"seriously injured, kept going, right."
00:18:16,00:18:19,It took him over a year to get to Timbuktu.
00:18:19,00:18:23,"He finally got there after recuperating all of this stuff,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,and it was abandoned and poor.
00:18:25,00:18:27,It wasn't this great center of learning anymore.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"And then two days after he left,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,he was murdered in the desert by bandits.
00:18:31,00:18:34,"This is incredible, sort of awful journey."
00:18:34,00:18:36,And do we know if he thought it was worth it or?
00:18:36,00:18:37,"We don't know, because--"
00:18:37,00:18:38,Glad he went.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"It wasn't what he was looking for,"
00:18:40,00:18:41,"which is, like James says,"
00:18:41,00:18:42,this amazing center of learning at the university
00:18:42,00:18:44,and gold and books.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"You know, it wasn't like that anymore."
00:18:45,00:18:47,There's got to be a moment on that track
00:18:47,00:18:48,when you've been strapped to a camel.
00:18:48,00:18:52,And you've got hack woods from giant swords
00:18:52,00:18:56,"that you think he'd, ""Did I make the right call here?"""
00:18:56,00:18:58,"Just at least for a minute, he must have had doubts."
00:18:58,00:19:00,Just a second.
00:19:00,00:19:02,Do you know when we started thinking of Timbuktu
00:19:02,00:19:06,as that semi-fictitious far away place?
00:19:06,00:19:07,No.
00:19:07,00:19:10,"So you know how we say today, ""Oh, we'll send him to Timbuktu,"""
00:19:10,00:19:12,"because we know it's just constantly saying that,"
00:19:12,00:19:13,"right, I'll put it in that case."
00:19:13,00:19:15,I'm constantly hearing it.
00:19:15,00:19:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:18,00:19:20,It's actually an Oxford English Dictionary definition
00:19:20,00:19:21,"in its own right, the word."
00:19:21,00:19:23,"Yeah, of course, a long distance place."
00:19:23,00:19:26,"So it's been in use since Lady Duff Gordon,"
00:19:26,00:19:30,"the English writer, in the 1860s, was in Cairo."
00:19:30,00:19:31,And she was getting really fed up with the fact
00:19:31,00:19:35,that Cairo was being sort of gentrified.
00:19:35,00:19:39,So lots of other British people were coming there.
00:19:39,00:19:41,That was a serial cafe.
00:19:41,00:19:42,That was exactly a problem.
00:19:42,00:19:44,"So she wrote a letter back from Cairo saying,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,it's growing dreadfully cockney here.
00:19:46,00:19:48,I must go to Timbuktu instead.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"And that was the first reference of, you know,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,going to escape to a more distant place than this.
00:19:53,00:19:54,Yeah.
00:19:54,00:19:58,"So the idea that Timbuktu, the name,"
00:19:58,00:20:00,"meaning the sticky-outy belly button,"
00:20:00,00:20:04,"I started looking into what places, how their names were derived."
00:20:04,00:20:09,So it's thought that maybe Canberra means women's breasts.
00:20:09,00:20:11,No one quite knows where Canberra comes from in Australia.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"Yeah, they think it means meeting place as well,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,"because it derives from an Aboriginal word, but actually--"
00:20:17,00:20:19,But often they would meet at women's breasts.
00:20:19,00:20:21,So it's very confusing.
00:20:21,00:20:26,If there's more than one woman in the bar while you're meeting.
00:20:26,00:20:28,Manchester's named after breasts.
00:20:28,00:20:28,Yeah.
00:20:28,00:20:29,Is it?
00:20:29,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:33,"The man in Manchester comes from mum, like mummaries."
00:20:33,00:20:36,And it's because of the hills around Manchester.
00:20:36,00:20:39,So it should be called breastchester.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Yeah, chestchester."
00:20:40,00:20:43,It should be called breastchester.
00:20:43,00:20:44,And then this is my favorite.
00:20:44,00:20:45,This was named after someone.
00:20:45,00:20:49,There's a place called Anus Haven.
00:20:49,00:20:51,I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.
00:20:51,00:20:52,I don't think you are.
00:20:52,00:20:53,I think it is.
00:20:53,00:20:55,I think it's Anus Haven.
00:20:55,00:20:57,Or it could be Anus Haven.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"But the thing is, is that this place is in Armenia."
00:20:59,00:21:01,And it's named after a World War II hero
00:21:01,00:21:04,called Dr. Anus Haven Galilean.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"Anus Haven, actually, sounds like another cupboard in your house,"
00:21:06,00:21:11,that's it.
00:21:11,00:21:16,"OK, it's time for fact number three."
00:21:16,00:21:18,And that is Chuzinski.
00:21:18,00:21:22,My fact this week is that lovers hearts beat in sync.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"Gross, gross, gross, gross."
00:21:25,00:21:29,"This disgusting fact comes to you, courtesy of research"
00:21:29,00:21:32,that was done by the University of California Davis in 2013.
00:21:32,00:21:35,And it put couples in a room and it monitored their heart rates
00:21:35,00:21:38,and the couples weren't touching each other or speaking to each other.
00:21:38,00:21:38,So they were married.
00:21:38,00:21:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:41,00:21:44,Speaks to the married man.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"Right, so these couples didn't touch or speak to each other."
00:21:46,00:21:48,But it was found when their heart rates were monitored
00:21:48,00:21:50,that their hearts were beating in sync
00:21:50,00:21:52,and their breathing really closely matched.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"And then in this experiment, they"
00:21:54,00:21:55,mixed the people up a bit.
00:21:55,00:21:58,So they put males and females with people
00:21:58,00:21:59,that they weren't in a couple with.
00:21:59,00:22:02,So just like strangers in the room with them.
00:22:02,00:22:03,And their hearts wouldn't be in sync.
00:22:03,00:22:05,You know other things that synchronize.
00:22:05,00:22:07,Other occasions on which heart beats synchronize.
00:22:07,00:22:07,This is quite cool.
00:22:07,00:22:10,"So mothers and infants, their heart beats synchronize"
00:22:10,00:22:12,when they're just looking at each other.
00:22:12,00:22:15,"So a mother with her own baby, basically."
00:22:15,00:22:18,"Also, choirs, their heart rates rise and fall at the same time."
00:22:18,00:22:20,And they think that is a breathing thing as well.
00:22:20,00:22:22,Because some bits you need loads of breath
00:22:22,00:22:24,or when you breathe in your heart rate goes up.
00:22:24,00:22:28,"Well, and also dogs and their owners, sync heart beats."
00:22:28,00:22:28,Yeah.
00:22:28,00:22:30,According to research by pedigreech.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"Yeah, I know."
00:22:31,00:22:32,I know.
00:22:32,00:22:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:33,00:22:36,I love when you read where that research is coming from.
00:22:36,00:22:36,It always is.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Yeah.
00:22:37,00:22:39,Although I don't know how that helps with sails.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Well, what was interesting about that study was it"
00:22:40,00:22:43,basically said that when dogs are reunited with their owners
00:22:43,00:22:45,"after separation, then both those beings"
00:22:45,00:22:48,"heart start beating faster, which isn't necessarily"
00:22:48,00:22:49,them syncing.
00:22:49,00:22:51,It's presumably more likely than being quite excited
00:22:51,00:22:54,that they're seeing each other again.
00:22:54,00:22:56,Here's a cool thing about heart rates.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"Obviously, different animals hugely"
00:22:58,00:22:59,faster and slower depending.
00:22:59,00:23:02,And I think we may have even said before that so sperm
00:23:02,00:23:03,"whales have about nine beats per minute,"
00:23:03,00:23:06,shrews 835 beats per minute.
00:23:06,00:23:09,"If you put a whale in a room with a shrew,"
00:23:09,00:23:10,I'll put a stand.
00:23:10,00:23:11,They synchronize.
00:23:11,00:23:12,If they love us.
00:23:12,00:23:15,And the whale speeds up to 400 beats per minute
00:23:15,00:23:18,and immediately dies.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"No, OK, this is the really cool thing."
00:23:20,00:23:24,So the whale and the shrews hearts both deliver
00:23:24,00:23:28,over the lifetime 200 million liters of blood per kilo
00:23:28,00:23:29,of body weight.
00:23:29,00:23:32,So it's exactly the same rate for both animals.
00:23:32,00:23:36,"So in both animals, each gram of tissue over the animal's"
00:23:36,00:23:39,lifetime receives 38 liters of oxygen.
00:23:39,00:23:40,How weird is that?
00:23:40,00:23:41,This is a stupid question.
00:23:41,00:23:44,But is that true proportionally for most animals?
00:23:44,00:23:45,I think it'll be true.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"Well, yeah, I don't think it's not just those two, basically."
00:23:47,00:23:49,This is a sort of a rule of life.
00:23:49,00:23:52,"Yeah, it's true of all mammals, I think, pretty much."
00:23:52,00:23:54,But humans don't work in the same way.
00:23:54,00:23:57,So it was thought for a while that all mammals
00:23:57,00:23:59,had the same number of heartbeats in the lifetime
00:23:59,00:24:02,because the shorter lived animals beat much quicker
00:24:02,00:24:05,and the longer lived ones beat much slower.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"And it does kind of work a little bit,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,but it doesn't work with humans.
00:24:08,00:24:11,And I think the reason being that we have really good
00:24:11,00:24:13,"medication and stuff, so we live longer"
00:24:13,00:24:14,than we probably should do.
00:24:14,00:24:16,There's about a billion heartbeats.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"Most mammals, with some exceptions,"
00:24:18,00:24:19,"like humans, get a billion."
00:24:19,00:24:21,So it might still be worth getting into a relationship
00:24:21,00:24:23,with someone who has a very slow heartbeats.
00:24:23,00:24:24,With a sperm whale.
00:24:24,00:24:26,In an attempt to extend to life.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"But if you got-- let's say in the future,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,we managed to do heart transplants.
00:24:30,00:24:32,Is it a case of confusing a single heart
00:24:32,00:24:34,"that, how many times, it's personally beat?"
00:24:34,00:24:35,Or is it responding to the body?
00:24:35,00:24:38,"As in, if you take a heart that has had no beats"
00:24:38,00:24:39,and put it in the body of someone who's coming up
00:24:39,00:24:42,"to a billionth beat, will reset the clock?"
00:24:42,00:24:43,"The heart will keep going, yeah."
00:24:43,00:24:45,"I mean, if your heart's beaten a billion times,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,then it'll be much more time than the heart.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"Yeah, it's not that you can get to 90 years old"
00:24:49,00:24:50,and then put a child's heart in your body
00:24:50,00:24:52,and you're going to live for another 90 years.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"Well, someone's got to tell Rupert Murdoch."
00:24:55,00:24:57,But let's say that it's a heart collapse
00:24:57,00:24:59,that you had that leads to your death.
00:24:59,00:25:01,Would it eliminate the chances of that happening?
00:25:01,00:25:03,"Well, it's certainly true that if your heart is in trouble,"
00:25:03,00:25:06,"you can have a heart transplant, and it will help."
00:25:06,00:25:07,But did you know this?
00:25:07,00:25:09,You can transplant your heart into someone else
00:25:09,00:25:10,and still live.
00:25:10,00:25:11,No.
00:25:11,00:25:11,What?
00:25:11,00:25:12,OK.
00:25:12,00:25:13,So this is a medical procedure.
00:25:13,00:25:15,It doesn't happen very often.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"But say, for instance, I needed a heart and lung transplant"
00:25:18,00:25:20,from another person from NSA.
00:25:20,00:25:21,But done--
00:25:21,00:25:25,"I didn't sign anything, by the way."
00:25:25,00:25:26,And then done needed a heart transplant.
00:25:26,00:25:30,"What they can do is, because the heart and lung coming"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"from Anna would be better working together,"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"they can give me the heart and lung from Anna,"
00:25:35,00:25:36,and then I can give my heart to Dan.
00:25:36,00:25:38,So I've actually transplanted my heart
00:25:38,00:25:41,and received from another person who does occasionally happen.
00:25:41,00:25:43,Do I then give my heart and lungs to Anna?
00:25:43,00:25:45,"Yes, where am I getting my heart?"
00:25:45,00:25:46,I'm going to say what?
00:25:46,00:25:48,You don't make it in this kind of a story.
00:25:48,00:25:51,You're the person who is a donor.
00:25:51,00:25:54,Why doesn't Anna just give me the heart?
00:25:54,00:25:55,What was-- why were you the in between?
00:25:55,00:25:58,I really need-- let's say I really need a lung transplant.
00:25:58,00:26:01,The lungs will work better with a heart of Anna.
00:26:01,00:26:03,So Anna's lungs will work better with Anna's heart.
00:26:03,00:26:05,So I will get the heart and the lungs.
00:26:05,00:26:08,But my heart will then go to you because you need a heart.
00:26:08,00:26:08,"Yeah, got it."
00:26:08,00:26:09,And your lungs are fine.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Right.
00:26:10,00:26:13,So why am I not involved in this?
00:26:13,00:26:17,Do you know that laughing can increase your heart health?
00:26:17,00:26:19,So start cracking those jokes.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"Yeah, it vasodilates your blood vessels."
00:26:21,00:26:23,"So it increases the width of your blood vessels,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,and it means that you can pump more blood around your body.
00:26:25,00:26:28,"And it increases them by 22%, which is actually really significant."
00:26:28,00:26:30,So how much do you have to laugh for that?
00:26:30,00:26:32,I just more than--
00:26:32,00:26:35,You can instigate.
00:26:35,00:26:39,So they've also found that happiness can actually
00:26:39,00:26:41,damage the heart as well.
00:26:41,00:26:44,It's all to do with-- so there's that thing that it's
00:26:44,00:26:48,"called the Takotsubu cardiomyopathy, a broken heart syndrome."
00:26:48,00:26:50,It's the idea of broken heart.
00:26:50,00:26:52,And then you just kind of convince your heart.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"And in very rare cases, you convince it to the point of you dying."
00:26:55,00:26:59,And they've recently found that happiness can trigger the same thing.
00:26:59,00:27:02,"So it's a rare condition, but happiness has the same effect."
00:27:02,00:27:06,"It suddenly puts the heart into a kind of oddly stressed position,"
00:27:06,00:27:07,and that can lead to death as well.
00:27:07,00:27:09,So happiness can be dangerous.
00:27:09,00:27:13,"Is this why when you're in love, sometimes your heart feels uncomfortable?"
00:27:13,00:27:14,"That's just-- surely, that's just there."
00:27:14,00:27:16,Just the nerves in the trinalinia.
00:27:16,00:27:19,It's just interesting that the sort of physical sensations of emotion--
00:27:19,00:27:21,why should it be in the chest?
00:27:21,00:27:24,Why on earth should I feel anything in particular there?
00:27:24,00:27:26,"Because that's about fight or flight, isn't it?"
00:27:26,00:27:27,And why is it like that?
00:27:27,00:27:29,Because your heart is in the legs.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"Well, my-- nobody's got blood in it, isn't it?"
00:27:32,00:27:37,That means sense of Valentine's card to pitch the legs out.
00:27:37,00:27:40,When you make my ankle beat twice as fast.
00:27:40,00:27:41,You are my anus haven.
00:27:41,00:27:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:50,00:27:53,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:27:53,00:27:54,And that is my fact.
00:27:54,00:27:59,"My fact this week is that this year, Hugh Hefner sold the Playboy Mansion."
00:27:59,00:28:05,"It comes with 30 rooms, a pool, a tennis court, a zoo license, and Hugh Hefner."
00:28:05,00:28:06,So comes with Hugh Hefner.
00:28:06,00:28:09,"You get to keep Hugh Hefner, but this place comes with Hugh Hefner."
00:28:09,00:28:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:13,00:28:15,I got a tool.
00:28:15,00:28:19,The idea of being that he is now allowed to just live in this house until he dies.
00:28:19,00:28:21,That's the part of the deal that he did.
00:28:21,00:28:24,He ended up selling it to his neighbor.
00:28:24,00:28:28,"And I think they've known each other for a long time, so that seems to be an OK thing."
00:28:28,00:28:31,"But yeah, so it's been sold."
00:28:31,00:28:39,"And obviously, back in the '60s and '70s was known as the kind of Disney land of sexuality, basically."
00:28:39,00:28:40,It was because we love the misogyny.
00:28:40,00:28:41,"Yeah, exactly."
00:28:41,00:28:43,The Disney land of misogyny.
00:28:43,00:28:47,"But now it's sort of very dirty, very run down."
00:28:47,00:28:51,"And-- Yeah, you be dirty, not just sexually, it's literally dirty."
00:28:51,00:28:52,"It literally is, yeah."
00:28:52,00:28:53,It can't be filled.
00:28:53,00:28:54,It does contain a pipe organ.
00:28:54,00:28:55,It does.
00:28:55,00:28:56,That's not a euphemism.
00:28:56,00:28:57,Sorry.
00:28:57,00:28:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:58,00:29:00,To imagine Hugh Hefner asking if you want to see his pipe organ.
00:29:00,00:29:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Yeah, so he's in his 80s at the moment."
00:29:04,00:29:08,Do you guys know where he is going to be buried when he does pass away?
00:29:08,00:29:12,"Is he one of these people who has to be buried, like, on top of Marilyn Monroe?"
00:29:12,00:29:14,He's being buried right next to Marilyn Monroe.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Okay.
00:29:15,00:29:16,He bought the plot right next to her.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Yeah.
00:29:17,00:29:18,That's weird.
00:29:18,00:29:21,She was the first ever cover girl for Playboy.
00:29:21,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:24,And he's been obsessed with her his whole life in--
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Oh, well, it's not weird at all."
00:29:26,00:29:27,"Oh, sorry."
00:29:27,00:29:28,Just qualifying the weird person.
00:29:28,00:29:31,He put it in contact by saying he's obsessed with her.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Yeah.
00:29:32,00:29:34,It sounded like he had a healthy professional disinterested when he said that he bought the
00:29:34,00:29:35,cemetery plot next to hers.
00:29:35,00:29:38,That's what I could win to this.
00:29:38,00:29:41,I thought you were going to say that he was going to be buried in-- because one of the
00:29:41,00:29:44,places that the playboy mentioned has is a pet cemetery.
00:29:44,00:29:45,Did you know that?
00:29:45,00:29:46,It has a pet cemetery.
00:29:46,00:29:48,Presumably is where all the bunnies are buried.
00:29:48,00:29:49,Very good.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Thank you.
00:29:50,00:29:52,I have a hard attack.
00:29:52,00:29:53,Send Marianne.
00:29:53,00:29:57,"But, yeah, that one of his girlfriends had a whole bunch of small dogs, didn't she?"
00:29:57,00:30:02,And then the women who lived in the mansion said that they would be summoned to his bedroom
00:30:02,00:30:03,every Friday.
00:30:03,00:30:06,"And that's when he would give them that allowance, which I think was $1,000."
00:30:06,00:30:10,"And when they went to his bedroom, they had to wait for the first richer, which was him"
00:30:10,00:30:12,scraping all the dog poo off his bedroom floor.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"Oh, my God."
00:30:13,00:30:16,It's too sexy.
00:30:16,00:30:22,"In 2011, this was a story that happened 100 people fell ill after going to a party at the"
00:30:22,00:30:23,playboy mansion.
00:30:23,00:30:26,And they think it was because they were bacteria in the whirlpools bar.
00:30:26,00:30:30,Because they forgot to scrape the dog poo off of it.
00:30:30,00:30:31,I thought this was interesting.
00:30:31,00:30:34,40% of all of playboy's income comes from China.
00:30:34,00:30:42,"China, you don't mean they sell terracotta, like what they sell tea sets, so that's exactly."
00:30:42,00:30:50,"So yeah, in China, the country, and the interesting thing is that the magazine is not sold in China."
00:30:50,00:30:56,"So they licensed the bunny logo completely for things like perfumes, things like tracksuit"
00:30:56,00:30:57,clothing.
00:30:57,00:30:58,I always used to see that in Hong Kong.
00:30:58,00:31:04,"You would see kids wearing playboy outfits, but because in China, it doesn't have the sexual"
00:31:04,00:31:05,connotation.
00:31:05,00:31:09,"In fact, they completely rebrand it out there to be a more family-oriented thing."
00:31:09,00:31:10,"What is it, basically?"
00:31:10,00:31:11,It's just a big brand.
00:31:11,00:31:19,"There was a lady called Chloe Woodall, who bought some playboy for her VIP body spray from"
00:31:19,00:31:25,"I think it was Azda Romline, but it got substituted for it's a dog's life pet care kind and gentle"
00:31:25,00:31:26,shine.
00:31:26,00:31:34,"And she said, ""I do have a Staffordshire Bolteria, but how did they know that?"""
00:31:34,00:31:39,"You know, this really old idea that people used to say that they would read playboy for"
00:31:39,00:31:40,the articles.
00:31:40,00:31:46,"It is one edition of the magazine that can genuinely be claimed to have been read for just the writing,"
00:31:46,00:31:47,just for the articles.
00:31:47,00:31:52,"And that is something that's been published since the 1970s, the Braille version, they take"
00:31:52,00:31:53,out any of the nudity.
00:31:53,00:31:57,"So it's not as if they've made like 3D pictures or anything, purely words, and it's purely"
00:31:57,00:31:58,the articles.
00:31:58,00:32:01,"I think it was the first magazine that came in Braille, isn't it?"
00:32:01,00:32:02,What's it?
00:32:02,00:32:03,Really?
00:32:03,00:32:04,Yeah.
00:32:04,00:32:05,Private Eye.
00:32:05,00:32:08,"It used to have, and I think still has, an edition for partially sighted author blind people."
00:32:08,00:32:12,But I actually has an interesting connection with playboy.
00:32:12,00:32:16,Peter Cook went over to America to ask Hugh Heffner for funding for Private Eye.
00:32:16,00:32:20,"According to the official Peter Cook biography, Peter Cook for anyone listening overseas,"
00:32:20,00:32:25,"one of Britain's biggest comedians, Heffner Tom Pessoff, according to this biography, but"
00:32:25,00:32:29,it also meant that one of the best stories that I love about Peter Cook happened in this
00:32:29,00:32:30,period.
00:32:30,00:32:34,"He was at the Playboy Club, and there was this guy trying to get in and the bunny at"
00:32:34,00:32:35,the front didn't let him in.
00:32:35,00:32:39,"So he started yelling into the whole club going, ""Do you know who I am?"
00:32:39,00:32:40,"Do you know who I am?"""
00:32:40,00:32:43,"Peter Cook went up to him, and he then yelled to the rest of the club, ""I'm sorry, ladies"
00:32:43,00:32:44,and gentlemen.
00:32:44,00:32:46,Gentlemen doesn't seem to know who he is.
00:32:46,00:32:48,"Does anyone know who he is?"""
00:32:48,00:32:53,So the playboy mansion that they sold is not the first playboy mansion.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"There was one in Chicago, the first one."
00:32:56,00:32:57,It had 70 rooms.
00:32:57,00:32:59,It had a swim pool.
00:32:59,00:33:03,"It had all sorts of stuff, and now they've turned it into three family homes."
00:33:03,00:33:08,"So you can actually live there, I think students live there some of the time."
00:33:08,00:33:12,And it had a brass plate on the door with a Latin inscription under your Latin is quite
00:33:12,00:33:13,good.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Do you want to translate this?
00:33:14,00:33:19,"See Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare."
00:33:19,00:33:21,"If you don't, Osculas, look."
00:33:21,00:33:22,"No, it must be something like shake."
00:33:22,00:33:23,Of course you do.
00:33:23,00:33:24,Of course you do.
00:33:24,00:33:25,Right?
00:33:25,00:33:26,"Is it if you don't have an orgasm, you're not excited?"
00:33:26,00:33:27,Or something like that?
00:33:27,00:33:29,"See Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare."
00:33:29,00:33:30,Tintinare.
00:33:30,00:33:33,Don't impersonate Tintin in this building.
00:33:33,00:33:37,So Tintinare is wring as in wringing a buzzer.
00:33:37,00:33:38,Right.
00:33:38,00:33:41,"And so see Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare."
00:33:41,00:33:43,"If you're not shaking, don't wring."
00:33:43,00:33:44,Is it close?
00:33:44,00:33:45,But it's a rhyming thing.
00:33:45,00:33:46,Osculas.
00:33:46,00:33:47,Swinging.
00:33:47,00:33:48,Swinging.
00:33:48,00:33:49,"If you don't swing, don't wring."
00:33:49,00:33:50,"If you don't swing, don't wring."
00:33:50,00:33:51,Yes.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Ah.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"Latin put to good use, finally."
00:33:54,00:33:55,Yeah.
00:33:55,00:33:57,"I mean, yeah, it's horrible, but it's great."
00:33:57,00:33:58,Is the magazine still going?
00:33:58,00:33:59,"Yeah, it is."
00:33:59,00:34:04,"And they made a big change last year, which is they've stopped doing nudity."
00:34:04,00:34:05,That's the latest move.
00:34:05,00:34:08,I think they're just not working anymore.
00:34:08,00:34:09,Is it sort of a brand?
00:34:09,00:34:11,Is it now going more towards the brand thing?
00:34:11,00:34:12,I think so.
00:34:12,00:34:13,Yeah.
00:34:13,00:34:14,Yeah.
00:34:14,00:34:18,"I personally read it just for the party hosting tips, before a party."
00:34:18,00:34:20,Scrape all the dog extrovert off the floor.
00:34:20,00:34:24,"OK, that's it."
