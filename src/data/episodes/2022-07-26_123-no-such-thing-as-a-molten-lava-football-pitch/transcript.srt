1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 (whimsical music)

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,820
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,400
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,340
 Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,220
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,100
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,180
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,180
 with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Anja Murray.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,180
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,700
 and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,380
 My fact is that a group of scientists

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,840
 is currently making their own lava.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,100
 Pretty cool.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,540
 So there's a lot of scientists who are,

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,140
 the University of Buffalo's Center for GeoHazard Studies

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,940
 and they want to study what it's like

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,900
 when lava and water meet,

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,340
 'cause it's something that you don't get to study a lot

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,180
 in the wild, in the natural world.

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,220
 But it's really important as well,

22
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,140
 because when lava and water meet,

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,160
 it gets really, really explosive as opposed to only

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,900
 normal lava explosivity.

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,060
 And so they are making their own stuff

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,420
 and they melt 10 gallons of basaltic rock

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,940
 at a time in a furnace at 2,500 degrees.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,140
 - Is there not a thing about water and lava meeting,

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,880
 which is related to the ladenfrost effects,

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,900
 one of James's favorite effects?

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,500
 I think it's, which is when two substances

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,140
 of vastly different temperatures meet each other

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,780
 and it means that the water isn't caused

34
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,980
 to boil straight away, because this layer of gas

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,260
 suddenly forms between the water and the lava.

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,220
 And I think that might be what makes it so explosive,

37
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,900
 because this layer of gas forms

38
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,860
 and then eventually that layer of gas collapses

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,140
 and then this massive explosion happens to us.

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,380
 - Do you know where they could have gone

41
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,220
 to see lava meet water?

42
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,220
 - No.

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,620
 - 1973.

44
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,740
 (laughing)

45
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,580
 - They went to 1973.

46
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,460
 There's a nice landic town called Vest Mania,

47
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,020
 I'm pronouncing that wrong, obviously.

48
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,620
 But in 1973, they had a volcano erupt

49
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,580
 and the lava was heading towards this town,

50
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,860
 which was quite far away.

51
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,980
 And what they decided to do was they got water cannons

52
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,220
 and they pumped billions of gallons of water

53
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,420
 at the lava that was approaching to stop it.

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,180
 And they did it from months on end

55
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,100
 and eventually did stop and so the town was saved.

56
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,740
 - Some people would say it is harder for scientists

57
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,060
 to build a time machine and go back to 1973,

58
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,340
 possibly even than making their own lava.

59
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,820
 - It would have been a better fact though.

60
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,020
 - Wasn't there a town, was it in Spain,

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,180
 or Italy, where there was a volcano going off?

62
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,300
 The villagers kind of made a trench

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,220
 so that the lava wouldn't go into their towns.

64
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,780
 But instead they directed it into the next town.

65
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,620
 (laughing)

66
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,460
 - It was in Sicily.

67
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,940
 - It was one mountaineer exploded.

68
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,260
 The village was called Catania

69
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,420
 and they dug an artificial breach

70
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,300
 so to redirect the lava.

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,620
 And the really cool thing is they,

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,500
 do you know how they kept cool?

73
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,700
 They wore wet sheep skins while they were working.

74
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,140
 - But they, the villagers who they redirected

75
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,700
 the lava flow to then redirected it back

76
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,980
 to this other place called Boterno

77
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,300
 and the Boternians just sent it right back that way.

78
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
 - No!

79
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,980
 - It's so funny.

80
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,100
 - Do you know how to tell if a volcano explodes

81
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,460
 whether you're really, really, really in trouble?

82
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,300
 - No.

83
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,780
 - And you look up at the spout of lava

84
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,020
 that's coming out of the volcano.

85
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,980
 And if it's moving left or right,

86
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,620
 you're absolutely fine from your perspective.

87
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,140
 If it appears to be staying still, you're in trouble.

88
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,700
 - Well, because presumably that's coming towards you.

89
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,060
 - Because it's exactly on the same axis as you.

90
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,540
 - I'll be going directly away from you.

91
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,220
 - Well, it's not James, it's coming towards you.

92
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,060
 (laughing)

93
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,900
 - I'm being annoying.

94
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,020
 (laughing)

95
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,100
 - I find it amazing that volcanoes are made of lava.

96
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
 I never really thought of that.

97
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,420
 I thought, oh, they're just made of rock

98
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,220
 that's sticking up and then the lava comes out of it.

99
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,220
 But they're made of either lava or lava

100
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,620
 and ash in layers, building up over millions of years.

101
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,460
 - I thought what was amazing is,

102
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,620
 do you remember the tunnel going through the Alps?

103
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,540
 The Got-Hard tunnel, do you remember that?

104
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,260
 And how, when they went through it,

105
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,620
 some of the time the rock was really hard

106
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,980
 and then some of it was crumbly like sand.

107
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,140
 - You always think of a mountain as being like solid

108
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,580
 all the way through, but it's amazing

109
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,060
 that there are gaps in there and little crumbly bits

110
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,700
 and it's like a trifle.

111
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,300
 - Yeah, you said there are bits,

112
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,340
 you said, 'cause we did on nice such things the news,

113
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,260
 there are bits which were as soft as butter.

114
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,100
 - Yeah.

115
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,700
 - But I can't believe that.

116
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,540
 Actually.

117
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,940
 - You can't believe it's butter.

118
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,060
 (laughing)

119
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,500
 - You'd be so annoyed if you were building on that mountain

120
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,180
 or you're trying to get through that mountain

121
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,660
 and your mate got the butter bit

122
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,700
 and you've got the granite bit next to it.

123
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,420
 - So you turned up with a massive boring machine

124
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,900
 and he's just got a buster knife.

125
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,540
 (laughing)

126
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,860
 - Actually, speaking of tunnels,

127
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,740
 there are lava-related tunnels on the moon.

128
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
 - Oh, there's the best thing I've read this week.

129
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,940
 - It's so amazing.

130
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,140
 Yeah, and I can't believe I didn't know these existed.

131
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,740
 So we discovered this quite recently, I think,

132
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,180
 that the moon has these underground tunnels

133
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,460
 and they were formed by lava flows 3.5 billion years ago.

134
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,700
 So lava would flow and then it solidifies on top,

135
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,540
 faster than it solidifies underneath.

136
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,780
 So the top creates this roof and then underneath the roof

137
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,940
 is hollowed out as the lava flows through it.

138
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,780
 And so there are these hollow lava tunnels

139
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,100
 and one of the ways we know this is because they have things

140
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,940
 called skylights in these tunnels,

141
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,620
 which is where a bit of them fall in

142
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,660
 and then we see this hole that suddenly created

143
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,540
 which shows us this tunnel underneath.

144
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
 - It's so cool.

145
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,180
 The reason that scientists are really interested in it

146
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,620
 is because the idea of building these moon bases

147
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,220
 that always get proposed one day will have a moon base.

148
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,460
 They actually think so part of the problem

149
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,620
 with moon bases is all the radiation coming in

150
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,020
 and they think that these tubes could lead

151
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,300
 to these sort of underground bunkers

152
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,900
 where we could put the bases.

153
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,740
 So they're now looking into these tubes

154
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,860
 and they've got probes that have been flying over,

155
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,060
 they've been sussing them out and trying to learn more.

156
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,140
 - So exciting. - Yeah, so it's amazing.

157
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,980
 - You know how we've been discussing

158
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,500
 in the office recently, the football

159
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,580
 and Iceland has a lot of volcanoes?

160
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,500
 Well, the Icelandic football team

161
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,780
 until the 1950s played and practiced on lava.

162
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,900
 They played on gravel which was made of crushed lava.

163
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,740
 - Wow, that's great.

164
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,580
 - They wonder they're good these days.

165
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,100
 - More impressive to do it on liquid lava

166
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,620
 as it flows out of the volcano.

167
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,860
 That would be pretty cool.

168
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,620
 'Cause also if you put your foot on lava,

169
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,460
 it's so hot that it sets fire to your foot.

170
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,340
 So that would be quite cool.

171
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,780
 You'd look like one of those cartoon characters

172
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,060
 that has your shoes on fire.

173
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,820
 - No, that would have been a very impressive.

174
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,660
 - Yes.

175
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,260
 - Yeah, I mean it's not a practical idea.

176
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,900
 - In cartoons you do see people falling into lava

177
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,100
 but that would never happen 'cause lava's quite thick

178
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
 and gloopy and more viscous and humans.

179
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,140
 - Would you just fall onto it?

180
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,980
 - You fall onto it and settle on fire.

181
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,820
 - Right.

182
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,180
 - Rather than kind of go, "No!"

183
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,660
 and kind of the last thing you see

184
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
 is your arm going into the lava here that's--

185
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,060
 - So what about the end of Terminator 2, spoiler alert,

186
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,900
 where Arnie of course goes into the liquid steel?

187
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,740
 - Well, is he not a robot?

188
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,580
 - He's made of metal.

189
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,780
 - Yeah, so it's slightly different to humans.

190
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,620
 - It's a huge difference.

191
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,460
 - Yeah.

192
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,220
 - He'll have a different density to humans.

193
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,060
 - All right.

194
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,500
 - They have researched it Andy.

195
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,580
 They're not just making stuff up on the top of their heads.

196
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,420
 - Yeah, no, no, no.

197
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,220
 - Have a swim in Terminator?

198
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,020
 - No, he doesn't, that's why.

199
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,260
 (laughing)

200
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,900
 - I was reading Mark Komode in Simon Mayo's book

201
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
 and they were talking about movie endings

202
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,580
 that don't quite make scientific sense

203
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,500
 and one of them they say is that Lord of the Rings

204
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,860
 right at the end, for Frodo to go into Volcano,

205
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,700
 that wouldn't be possible

206
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,340
 because you would just explode from the heat.

207
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,180
 - Sure.

208
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,020
 - Is that true?

209
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,540
 - How dense are hobbits?

210
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,580
 I mean, these are all made up things aren't they?

211
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,620
 - Volcanoes aren't made up,

212
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,140
 but they're in a fancy world, so they could have them.

213
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,260
 - Talking could have specified

214
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,180
 that in Middle-earth volcanoes are a bit colder.

215
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,020
 (laughing)

216
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,860
 - Oh yeah, that's true.

217
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,180
 - Now you do have cold volcanoes.

218
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
 Have you heard about this?

219
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,020
 - No.

220
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
 - Are you talking about fountains?

221
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,700
 (laughing)

222
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,220
 - There is a volcano called Gelae Volcano,

223
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,940
 which is near Lake Natron, which is in Tanzania

224
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,060
 and their lava is made out of natural carbonateite

225
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,460
 and it has a different melting point to normal rock.

226
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,140
 Which means it's a lot colder than normal volcanoes.

227
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,460
 I mean, it is 510 degrees Celsius, so it's not that cold,

228
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,740
 but it is that slight half the temperature

229
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,740
 of a normal volcano.

230
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,420
 - Bring a jumper, you're saying.

231
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,260
 - I'm saying it.

232
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,300
 - If you're gonna wear wet sheepskins,

233
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,900
 then you'll be better off at that one

234
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,260
 than a normal volcano.

235
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,260
 - It's a great tip.

236
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,100
 - Okay.

237
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,780
 - Although you do get ice lava.

238
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,620
 - Really?

239
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,460
 - What?

240
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,300
 - How cool is this?

241
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,140
 Not on Earth on other planets,

242
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,380
 but they're in the solar system.

243
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,260
 There are ice volcanoes, also known as cryovolcanoes,

244
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,700
 and they throw up not molten rocks,

245
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,620
 they throw up water or ammonia or methane in liquid form.

246
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,660
 And then it's so cold on those planets

247
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,860
 that it freezes almost instantly,

248
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,020
 that crashes to the ground.

249
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,260
 And so that happens on Pluto,

250
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,740
 it happens on some other moons.

251
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,820
 - That's very cool.

252
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,660
 - Yeah.

253
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,220
 - Has anyone seen a mud volcano?

254
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,060
 - Nope, no.

255
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,300
 - I saw some of them in Romania last week.

256
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,780
 You kind of drive up to the top of like a mountain.

257
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,540
 It's kind of a flat plateau.

258
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,660
 And then you just have this bubbling mud,

259
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,180
 these little pits of bubbling mud,

260
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,780
 and then they kind of spurred out a little bit

261
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,260
 and then rolled down the hill.

262
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,380
 And it's just, yeah, it's a really awesome,

263
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,420
 - It sounds like you'd expect some kind of slime monster

264
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,740
 to emerge from it.

265
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,580
 - Yeah.

266
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,820
 - Is it dangerous?

267
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,660
 - Is it dangerous?

268
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,500
 - Yeah.

269
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,540
 - When you go there, they tell you not to touch it,

270
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,500
 but because it's in Romania

271
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,460
 and they don't really seem to bother about health

272
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,820
 and safety too much,

273
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,540
 it's not like in Britain there would probably be fences

274
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,220
 and you won't be able to go within a mile of them,

275
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,060
 but actually you can go right up to them.

276
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,500
 - And that's why you're missing a hand this week.

277
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,340
 (all laughing)

278
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,900
 That was actually eaten by the slime monster.

279
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,100
 (laughing)

280
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,180
 - Okay, here's the thing.

281
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,580
 The largest volcano in the world,

282
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,460
 and he guesses as to which or where it is.

283
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,300
 - In the world.

284
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,140
 - In the world.

285
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,980
 - Yeah.

286
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,820
 - Is it underwater?

287
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,660
 - It's underwater.

288
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
 - It's called the Tamu Massif.

289
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,180
 It's a thousand miles east of Japan underwater.

290
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,820
 It is equivalent in area to the British Isles.

291
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,940
 It is 120,000 square miles in area as of volcano.

292
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,740
 It's not active thankfully,

293
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,900
 but it's so gradual, the slope on it

294
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,500
 that if you were on the seabed,

295
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,380
 you would not be able to tell which way it was

296
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,220
 towards the top.

297
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,340
 It's really, really, really, really gradual towards the top.

298
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,820
 But it is, it does slope, and it is the size of Britain.

299
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,220
 - You know, scientists have made lava before.

300
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,260
 A couple of years ago, they made lava by heating up rock.

301
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,340
 This was a scientist at Syracuse University

302
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,060
 and it took them 70 hours to heat-rock and turn it into lava.

303
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,540
 And once they'd done it, they made the world's hottest barbecue.

304
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,900
 - It's hard enough, isn't it?

305
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,500
 To make sure that the outside of your chicken wing

306
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,340
 is not burnt in the inside's coat.

307
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,580
 It's gonna be charcoal on the outside

308
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,580
 and completely rarer on the floor.

309
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,180
 - Yeah, apparently there was a chef called Sam Bompas

310
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,780
 who was present and he said it was the best steak

311
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,620
 he'd ever had.

312
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,460
 - Yeah, right.

313
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,180
 He's always going around saying that.

314
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,660
 Bompas.

315
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,780
 Okay, so just quickly this is about making things artificially.

316
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,940
 - Do you know what the hottest temperature that humans

317
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,500
 have ever made is?

318
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
 - What?

319
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,940
 - 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit.

320
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,180
 - And what's that in centre grade?

321
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,180
 - It's only 4 trillion degrees Celsius.

322
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,860
 - I don't know what either of those numbers mean,

323
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,460
 but light is that hotter than...

324
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,020
 - To give you an example, that's 250,000 times hotter

325
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,860
 than the sun.

326
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,700
 - Yeah.

327
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,420
 - It's that Bismarck 75 million.

328
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
 (laughing)

329
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
 Fan-on or fan-on?

330
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,020
 (laughing)

331
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,600
 (upbeat music)

332
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,380
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is James.

333
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,580
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the word Timbuktu

334
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,660
 means woman with a sticky out belly button.

335
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,100
 So this is a book that I'm reading the moment called

336
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,140
 The Bad Ass Librarians of Timbuktu

337
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,940
 by Joshua Hammer and it's a brilliant book

338
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,980
 and this is just the first bite that I found in there

339
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,340
 when I started reading it.

340
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,140
 And nobody really actually knows why it comes from this phrase.

341
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,820
 There's some thought that it might have been

342
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,460
 the goddess that they look towards.

343
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,220
 What I kind of thought is maybe it's just a belly button thing

344
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,220
 and it could be that it's in some kind of depression.

345
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,980
 I think Timbuktu's in like a depression

346
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,220
 so it could be like it's the belly button of that area.

347
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,140
 - Although then that would be a real any, wouldn't it?

348
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,100
 - Yeah, so it's a depression.

349
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,860
 - Unless you're looking at it from the other side.

350
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,700
 - You're right.

351
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,940
 - From inside here.

352
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,500
 (laughing)

353
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,340
 You're right.

354
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,860
 No, I think there are some disagreements about the translation.

355
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,860
 It could be large belly button rather than sticky out belly button.

356
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,700
 - Okay.

357
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,060
 - It's one of these kind of nobody quite knows

358
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,460
 but this is the most likely.

359
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
 - That is condition, isn't it?

360
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,620
 There's a medical condition which gives you sticky out

361
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,740
 of belly buttons.

362
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,580
 - Is that so?

363
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,500
 - And it's known in the area.

364
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,660
 - Yeah, and it's known in the area.

365
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,180
 It does happen there so possibly that was a woman.

366
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,020
 - I read actually on a Reddit thread

367
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,900
 and I couldn't verify it that someone said,

368
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,820
 "As per my source, brackets the 1996 Guinness Book of World Records."

369
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,380
 So if anyone's got that check it,

370
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,580
 the longest outie ever recorded was 11.9 inches.

371
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,060
 - Oh, come on.

372
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,900
 (laughing)

373
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,700
 - If someone's really screwed up the unbilical cord.

374
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,980
 - If you have like a sensitive cord.

375
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,180
 - Oh, but that's not how it works.

376
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,500
 - Oh, so that's not it.

377
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,660
 - A lot of people think that a belly button

378
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,700
 is where they've got the unbilical cord but it's not.

379
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,780
 - It always gets cut a couple of inches away

380
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,380
 from the stomach but then the muscles seal themselves off

381
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,180
 and that bit of skin just dries up.

382
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,620
 And I don't know where it goes.

383
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,540
 I mean, there have been 90 billion of those things

384
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,340
 since humanity evolved.

385
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,460
 - But you think there's some kind of a pit somewhere?

386
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,300
 - There must be somewhere.

387
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,540
 - Shed belly buttons.

388
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,980
 (laughing)

389
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,540
 - But it's like, for instance, everyone's toenails

390
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,980
 are always growing and people trim them.

391
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,460
 But it's not like there's a massive cave of toenails.

392
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,620
 - It says, "Well, you know James."

393
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,860
 (laughing)

394
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,700
 - Wait till we get to--

395
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,540
 - Wait until we get to--

396
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,140
 - So Tim Buck too.

397
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,980
 - Yeah.

398
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,340
 - Do you know what it's twinned with?

399
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,180
 This is rather nice.

400
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,620
 It's twinned with "Hey on Why."

401
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,460
 - Oh, yeah.

402
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,660
 - And when it was announced, someone from "Hey" said,

403
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,300
 "Tim Buck too" is the oldest home of the written word in Africa.

404
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,100
 It has a large number of private and public libraries

405
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,700
 housing ancient Arabic and African manuscripts.

406
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,420
 "Hey on Why" is the second hand book capital of the world.

407
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,740
 (laughing)

408
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,820
 - That's basically the same.

409
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,300
 - Actually Tim Buck too had a few was twin with a few

410
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,460
 and actually, obviously that makes you not a twin

411
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,780
 as soon as you've got more than one.

412
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,620
 - Yes.

413
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,860
 - You can't be tripleted with.

414
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,420
 - It's amazing looking into Tim Buck too

415
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,980
 because I genuinely knew nothing about it.

416
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,420
 I know the only thing I knew about it

417
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,740
 was that it was a lyric in an Oliver song.

418
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,820
 - Go to Tim Buck too and back again.

419
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,460
 That's the only thing I knew about it.

420
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,300
 - Yeah.

421
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,660
 - And it turns out that it was this incredible

422
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,940
 cultural hotspot for knowledge in the--

423
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,900
 - Well, that's why it's so good that it's twinned

424
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,020
 with the second half of the world.

425
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,220
 Because actually it's right.

426
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,460
 They do have loads of manuscripts.

427
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,700
 And this book is about a guy who tried to take a load

428
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,740
 of manuscripts away from Tim Buck too

429
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,180
 to the Mali and Capital Bamako

430
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,580
 because they were under threat by Islamists.

431
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,820
 - Yeah, and it's an amazing story, isn't it?

432
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,660
 - It's a great story.

433
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,860
 - And they genuinely did it.

434
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,460
 So Islamists were coming into Tim Buck too

435
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,180
 and they thought we bet they're gonna try

436
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,340
 and destroy our libraries

437
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,780
 'cause they had hundreds of thousands

438
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,420
 of really valuable manuscripts

439
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,500
 and lo and behold, a short while later, a few months later,

440
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,660
 then the libraries were sort of raised to the ground

441
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,860
 and they'd managed to save and smuggle out of the country

442
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,820
 more than 300,000 manuscripts

443
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,300
 and a few hundred were left.

444
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 So everyone thought when these libraries collapsed,

445
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,740
 oh no, that's all gone.

446
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,180
 And then these guys came out of the woodwork

447
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,740
 saying, don't worry about it.

448
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,540
 We got rid of them.

449
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,860
 - And where are they now?

450
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,020
 - I'm not telling you.

451
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,300
 (laughing)

452
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,660
 'Cause this goes out on the internet.

453
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,300
 - So why did Tim Buck too have a big collapse

454
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,900
 to the point where I read a 2006 survey of 150 Britons,

455
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,100
 34% did not believe it existed.

456
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,020
 - So I've actually got the survey here

457
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,580
 and this was reported by the sun

458
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,540
 under the headline Tim Buck, who?

459
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,140
 (laughing)

460
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
 - God.

461
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,620
 - But anyway, the survey, I think this is the survey

462
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,300
 we're talking about now, it was in 2010

463
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,260
 and it was of 18 to 30 year olds.

464
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,100
 - Okay. - Okay.

465
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,660
 And of them, maybe it was the same,

466
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,500
 maybe it was different.

467
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,740
 Half thought that Tim Buck too was made up.

468
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,540
 10% thought that Kazakhstan wasn't real.

469
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,860
 A third said that Atlantis was somewhere in Greece

470
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,900
 and one person thought that France was in Spain.

471
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,780
 (laughing)

472
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,180
 - But actually for a long time, Tim Buck too,

473
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,700
 people weren't sure whether it existed.

474
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,580
 It was kind of a half legendary place in North Africa

475
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,420
 and because Europeans didn't really go to North Africa,

476
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,500
 a lot of people went to try and find this so-called city

477
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,460
 where great education happened and so on.

478
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
 - And gold reserves, right?

479
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,420
 It was quite famous for its gold a few hundred years ago.

480
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,260
 - Exactly.

481
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,020
 The first Westerner in modernish times to try and find it

482
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,860
 was a guy called John Lediard.

483
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,420
 And when he went, he'd never been to Africa.

484
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,900
 He didn't know a single word of Arabic.

485
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,500
 And when he got to Cairo, he had a bilious complaint

486
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,260
 and decided to treat it with sulfuric acid

487
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,260
 and took so much that he immediately died.

488
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,100
 - Whoa!

489
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
 - Yeah.

490
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,260
 - Hang on, so he was just trying to find it.

491
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
 He didn't make it.

492
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,700
 - Well, he got as far as Cairo.

493
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,900
 And then he saw some, what he thought was Gaviscan

494
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
 that was actually--

495
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,300
 If only he'd known a single word of Arabic,

496
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,140
 namely sulfuric acid.

497
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,740
 - It's not the first word you learn, though, is it?

498
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,580
 - No, it's not.

499
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,900
 - I'm deep into the textbook.

500
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,780
 - It's right at the back of the phrase book, isn't it?

501
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,940
 It's in the medical section.

502
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,260
 You just do hello and where is the toilet and stuff like that.

503
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,900
 - He probably could have done with where is the toilet.

504
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,180
 It's not the way.

505
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,980
 - Do you know about the first Westerner to get to Timbuktu?

506
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,820
 - No.

507
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,620
 - He was called Gordon Lang.

508
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,220
 Okay, he got there in 1826.

509
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,780
 And he was a Scott and he was an adventurer, basically.

510
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,980
 About 30 years old.

511
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,780
 And he had this huge competition between Britain and France

512
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,180
 to get to Timbuktu.

513
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,340
 And they obviously had a head start up,

514
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,940
 because they're closer, but--

515
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,980
 - Yeah, 'cause we're in Spain.

516
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,820
 - Yeah.

517
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,580
 (laughing)

518
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,700
 He said to his parents, "I shall do more than has ever been

519
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,020
 done before and shall show myself to me what I have ever

520
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,580
 considered myself a man of enterprise and genius."

521
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,460
 Right, so big claim.

522
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,580
 This is from a website called GreatBritishNutters.Blogspot.

523
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,420
 (laughing)

524
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,260
 Amazing.

525
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,300
 So he got to Tripoli immediately proposed

526
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,660
 to the British consul's daughter,

527
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,300
 and she fell in love with them, and they got married.

528
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,180
 And then he said, "Right, I'm off to Timbuktu."

529
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,420
 He thought it would take him a few weeks.

530
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,340
 The temperatures were huge, right.

531
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,060
 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

532
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,460
 The food was patties of dried fish and camel's milk.

533
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,500
 Bandits everywhere.

534
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,620
 One night he was attacked in his tent by bandits,

535
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,220
 as he was sleeping, hacked out with swords.

536
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,260
 He got 24 wounds, 18 of them serious.

537
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,380
 Next morning, he still said, "Put me on my camel."

538
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,340
 So he was strapped onto a camel for 400 miles,

539
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,020
 seriously injured, kept going, right.

540
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,500
 It took him over a year to get to Timbuktu.

541
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,780
 He finally got there after recuperating all of this stuff,

542
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,500
 and it was abandoned and poor.

543
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,900
 It wasn't this great center of learning anymore.

544
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,340
 And then two days after he left,

545
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,700
 he was murdered in the desert by bandits.

546
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,100
 This is incredible, sort of awful journey.

547
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,540
 And do we know if he thought it was worth it or?

548
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
 We don't know, because--

549
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,540
 Glad he went.

550
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,100
 It wasn't what he was looking for,

551
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
 which is, like James says,

552
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,900
 this amazing center of learning at the university

553
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,260
 and gold and books.

554
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,540
 You know, it wasn't like that anymore.

555
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,220
 There's got to be a moment on that track

556
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,860
 when you've been strapped to a camel.

557
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,660
 And you've got hack woods from giant swords

558
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,860
 that you think he'd, "Did I make the right call here?"

559
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,660
 Just at least for a minute, he must have had doubts.

560
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,620
 Just a second.

561
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,980
 Do you know when we started thinking of Timbuktu

562
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,580
 as that semi-fictitious far away place?

563
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
 No.

564
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,180
 So you know how we say today, "Oh, we'll send him to Timbuktu,"

565
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,380
 because we know it's just constantly saying that,

566
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,940
 right, I'll put it in that case.

567
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,100
 I'm constantly hearing it.

568
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,100
 [LAUGHTER]

569
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,220
 It's actually an Oxford English Dictionary definition

570
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,820
 in its own right, the word.

571
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,900
 Yeah, of course, a long distance place.

572
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,980
 So it's been in use since Lady Duff Gordon,

573
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,260
 the English writer, in the 1860s, was in Cairo.

574
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,980
 And she was getting really fed up with the fact

575
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,660
 that Cairo was being sort of gentrified.

576
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,180
 So lots of other British people were coming there.

577
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,220
 That was a serial cafe.

578
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,500
 That was exactly a problem.

579
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,900
 So she wrote a letter back from Cairo saying,

580
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,780
 it's growing dreadfully cockney here.

581
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,980
 I must go to Timbuktu instead.

582
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,420
 And that was the first reference of, you know,

583
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,900
 going to escape to a more distant place than this.

584
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,860
 Yeah.

585
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,140
 So the idea that Timbuktu, the name,

586
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,180
 meaning the sticky-outy belly button,

587
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,540
 I started looking into what places, how their names were derived.

588
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,580
 So it's thought that maybe Canberra means women's breasts.

589
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,860
 No one quite knows where Canberra comes from in Australia.

590
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,660
 Yeah, they think it means meeting place as well,

591
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,060
 because it derives from an Aboriginal word, but actually--

592
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,780
 But often they would meet at women's breasts.

593
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,340
 So it's very confusing.

594
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,380
 If there's more than one woman in the bar while you're meeting.

595
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,100
 Manchester's named after breasts.

596
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,980
 Yeah.

597
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,500
 Is it?

598
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:29,860
 Yeah.

599
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,820
 The man in Manchester comes from mum, like mummaries.

600
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,700
 And it's because of the hills around Manchester.

601
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,300
 So it should be called breastchester.

602
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
 Yeah, chestchester.

603
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,700
 It should be called breastchester.

604
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,540
 And then this is my favorite.

605
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,660
 This was named after someone.

606
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,780
 There's a place called Anus Haven.

607
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,780
 I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.

608
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,820
 I don't think you are.

609
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,660
 I think it is.

610
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,500
 I think it's Anus Haven.

611
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,060
 Or it could be Anus Haven.

612
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,660
 But the thing is, is that this place is in Armenia.

613
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,940
 And it's named after a World War II hero

614
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,740
 called Dr. Anus Haven Galilean.

615
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,940
 Anus Haven, actually, sounds like another cupboard in your house,

616
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,340
 that's it.

617
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,460
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

618
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,220
 And that is Chuzinski.

619
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,300
 My fact this week is that lovers hearts beat in sync.

620
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,660
 Gross, gross, gross, gross.

621
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,180
 This disgusting fact comes to you, courtesy of research

622
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,300
 that was done by the University of California Davis in 2013.

623
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,700
 And it put couples in a room and it monitored their heart rates

624
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,220
 and the couples weren't touching each other or speaking to each other.

625
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,980
 So they were married.

626
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,980
 [LAUGHTER]

627
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,100
 Speaks to the married man.

628
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,740
 Right, so these couples didn't touch or speak to each other.

629
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,700
 But it was found when their heart rates were monitored

630
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,340
 that their hearts were beating in sync

631
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,500
 and their breathing really closely matched.

632
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,620
 And then in this experiment, they

633
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
 mixed the people up a bit.

634
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,540
 So they put males and females with people

635
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,980
 that they weren't in a couple with.

636
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,020
 So just like strangers in the room with them.

637
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,380
 And their hearts wouldn't be in sync.

638
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,180
 You know other things that synchronize.

639
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,220
 Other occasions on which heart beats synchronize.

640
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,900
 This is quite cool.

641
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,340
 So mothers and infants, their heart beats synchronize

642
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,500
 when they're just looking at each other.

643
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,020
 So a mother with her own baby, basically.

644
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,740
 Also, choirs, their heart rates rise and fall at the same time.

645
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,220
 And they think that is a breathing thing as well.

646
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,260
 Because some bits you need loads of breath

647
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,420
 or when you breathe in your heart rate goes up.

648
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,100
 Well, and also dogs and their owners, sync heart beats.

649
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,700
 Yeah.

650
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
 According to research by pedigreech.

651
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
 Yeah, I know.

652
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
 I know.

653
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
 [LAUGHTER]

654
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,220
 I love when you read where that research is coming from.

655
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,860
 It always is.

656
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,260
 Yeah.

657
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,060
 Although I don't know how that helps with sails.

658
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,580
 Well, what was interesting about that study was it

659
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,300
 basically said that when dogs are reunited with their owners

660
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,980
 after separation, then both those beings

661
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,700
 heart start beating faster, which isn't necessarily

662
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,460
 them syncing.

663
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,980
 It's presumably more likely than being quite excited

664
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,140
 that they're seeing each other again.

665
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,260
 Here's a cool thing about heart rates.

666
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,100
 Obviously, different animals hugely

667
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,180
 faster and slower depending.

668
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,140
 And I think we may have even said before that so sperm

669
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,900
 whales have about nine beats per minute,

670
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,460
 shrews 835 beats per minute.

671
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,380
 If you put a whale in a room with a shrew,

672
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,260
 I'll put a stand.

673
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,060
 They synchronize.

674
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,300
 If they love us.

675
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,940
 And the whale speeds up to 400 beats per minute

676
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,860
 and immediately dies.

677
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,380
 No, OK, this is the really cool thing.

678
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,060
 So the whale and the shrews hearts both deliver

679
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,220
 over the lifetime 200 million liters of blood per kilo

680
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,860
 of body weight.

681
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,620
 So it's exactly the same rate for both animals.

682
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,020
 So in both animals, each gram of tissue over the animal's

683
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,660
 lifetime receives 38 liters of oxygen.

684
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,620
 How weird is that?

685
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,620
 This is a stupid question.

686
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,300
 But is that true proportionally for most animals?

687
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,500
 I think it'll be true.

688
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,580
 Well, yeah, I don't think it's not just those two, basically.

689
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,660
 This is a sort of a rule of life.

690
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,140
 Yeah, it's true of all mammals, I think, pretty much.

691
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,660
 But humans don't work in the same way.

692
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,220
 So it was thought for a while that all mammals

693
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,140
 had the same number of heartbeats in the lifetime

694
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,500
 because the shorter lived animals beat much quicker

695
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,140
 and the longer lived ones beat much slower.

696
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
 And it does kind of work a little bit,

697
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,500
 but it doesn't work with humans.

698
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,300
 And I think the reason being that we have really good

699
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,220
 medication and stuff, so we live longer

700
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,740
 than we probably should do.

701
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,100
 There's about a billion heartbeats.

702
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,260
 Most mammals, with some exceptions,

703
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,740
 like humans, get a billion.

704
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
 So it might still be worth getting into a relationship

705
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,580
 with someone who has a very slow heartbeats.

706
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,460
 With a sperm whale.

707
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,780
 In an attempt to extend to life.

708
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,100
 But if you got-- let's say in the future,

709
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,140
 we managed to do heart transplants.

710
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,180
 Is it a case of confusing a single heart

711
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,220
 that, how many times, it's personally beat?

712
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,740
 Or is it responding to the body?

713
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,020
 As in, if you take a heart that has had no beats

714
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,820
 and put it in the body of someone who's coming up

715
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,220
 to a billionth beat, will reset the clock?

716
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,460
 The heart will keep going, yeah.

717
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,460
 I mean, if your heart's beaten a billion times,

718
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,060
 then it'll be much more time than the heart.

719
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
 Yeah, it's not that you can get to 90 years old

720
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,620
 and then put a child's heart in your body

721
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,260
 and you're going to live for another 90 years.

722
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,580
 Well, someone's got to tell Rupert Murdoch.

723
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,780
 But let's say that it's a heart collapse

724
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,220
 that you had that leads to your death.

725
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,460
 Would it eliminate the chances of that happening?

726
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,620
 Well, it's certainly true that if your heart is in trouble,

727
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,060
 you can have a heart transplant, and it will help.

728
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,500
 But did you know this?

729
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,580
 You can transplant your heart into someone else

730
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,660
 and still live.

731
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,160
 No.

732
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,660
 What?

733
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,160
 OK.

734
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,660
 So this is a medical procedure.

735
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,140
 It doesn't happen very often.

736
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,060
 But say, for instance, I needed a heart and lung transplant

737
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,740
 from another person from NSA.

738
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,360
 But done--

739
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,020
 I didn't sign anything, by the way.

740
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,860
 And then done needed a heart transplant.

741
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,420
 What they can do is, because the heart and lung coming

742
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,880
 from Anna would be better working together,

743
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,220
 they can give me the heart and lung from Anna,

744
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,860
 and then I can give my heart to Dan.

745
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,620
 So I've actually transplanted my heart

746
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,180
 and received from another person who does occasionally happen.

747
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,700
 Do I then give my heart and lungs to Anna?

748
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,540
 Yes, where am I getting my heart?

749
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,340
 I'm going to say what?

750
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,260
 You don't make it in this kind of a story.

751
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,460
 You're the person who is a donor.

752
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,540
 Why doesn't Anna just give me the heart?

753
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,780
 What was-- why were you the in between?

754
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,820
 I really need-- let's say I really need a lung transplant.

755
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,580
 The lungs will work better with a heart of Anna.

756
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,660
 So Anna's lungs will work better with Anna's heart.

757
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,660
 So I will get the heart and the lungs.

758
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,100
 But my heart will then go to you because you need a heart.

759
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,920
 Yeah, got it.

760
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,940
 And your lungs are fine.

761
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,460
 Right.

762
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,860
 So why am I not involved in this?

763
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,500
 Do you know that laughing can increase your heart health?

764
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,380
 So start cracking those jokes.

765
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,740
 Yeah, it vasodilates your blood vessels.

766
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,980
 So it increases the width of your blood vessels,

767
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,780
 and it means that you can pump more blood around your body.

768
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,580
 And it increases them by 22%, which is actually really significant.

769
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,900
 So how much do you have to laugh for that?

770
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,220
 I just more than--

771
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,620
 You can instigate.

772
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,500
 So they've also found that happiness can actually

773
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 damage the heart as well.

774
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,260
 It's all to do with-- so there's that thing that it's

775
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,900
 called the Takotsubu cardiomyopathy, a broken heart syndrome.

776
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,620
 It's the idea of broken heart.

777
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,740
 And then you just kind of convince your heart.

778
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,860
 And in very rare cases, you convince it to the point of you dying.

779
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,260
 And they've recently found that happiness can trigger the same thing.

780
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,980
 So it's a rare condition, but happiness has the same effect.

781
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,260
 It suddenly puts the heart into a kind of oddly stressed position,

782
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,780
 and that can lead to death as well.

783
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,540
 So happiness can be dangerous.

784
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,620
 Is this why when you're in love, sometimes your heart feels uncomfortable?

785
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,860
 That's just-- surely, that's just there.

786
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,300
 Just the nerves in the trinalinia.

787
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,860
 It's just interesting that the sort of physical sensations of emotion--

788
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,580
 why should it be in the chest?

789
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,620
 Why on earth should I feel anything in particular there?

790
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,700
 Because that's about fight or flight, isn't it?

791
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,580
 And why is it like that?

792
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,660
 Because your heart is in the legs.

793
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,900
 Well, my-- nobody's got blood in it, isn't it?

794
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,860
 That means sense of Valentine's card to pitch the legs out.

795
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,220
 When you make my ankle beat twice as fast.

796
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,420
 You are my anus haven.

797
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,340
 [LAUGHTER]

798
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,300
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

799
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,660
 And that is my fact.

800
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,420
 My fact this week is that this year, Hugh Hefner sold the Playboy Mansion.

801
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,540
 It comes with 30 rooms, a pool, a tennis court, a zoo license, and Hugh Hefner.

802
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,940
 So comes with Hugh Hefner.

803
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,980
 You get to keep Hugh Hefner, but this place comes with Hugh Hefner.

804
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,140
 [LAUGHTER]

805
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,100
 I got a tool.

806
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,660
 The idea of being that he is now allowed to just live in this house until he dies.

807
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,980
 That's the part of the deal that he did.

808
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,900
 He ended up selling it to his neighbor.

809
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,940
 And I think they've known each other for a long time, so that seems to be an OK thing.

810
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,140
 But yeah, so it's been sold.

811
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:39,140
 And obviously, back in the '60s and '70s was known as the kind of Disney land of sexuality, basically.

812
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,900
 It was because we love the misogyny.

813
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,700
 Yeah, exactly.

814
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,020
 The Disney land of misogyny.

815
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,620
 But now it's sort of very dirty, very run down.

816
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,300
 And-- Yeah, you be dirty, not just sexually, it's literally dirty.

817
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
 It literally is, yeah.

818
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
 It can't be filled.

819
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,300
 It does contain a pipe organ.

820
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
 It does.

821
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,300
 That's not a euphemism.

822
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
 Sorry.

823
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
 [LAUGHTER]

824
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,700
 To imagine Hugh Hefner asking if you want to see his pipe organ.

825
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
 [LAUGHTER]

826
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,780
 Yeah, so he's in his 80s at the moment.

827
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,860
 Do you guys know where he is going to be buried when he does pass away?

828
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,060
 Is he one of these people who has to be buried, like, on top of Marilyn Monroe?

829
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,100
 He's being buried right next to Marilyn Monroe.

830
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
 Okay.

831
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,820
 He bought the plot right next to her.

832
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
 Yeah.

833
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,820
 That's weird.

834
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,740
 She was the first ever cover girl for Playboy.

835
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
 Yeah.

836
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,780
 And he's been obsessed with her his whole life in--

837
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,940
 Oh, well, it's not weird at all.

838
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
 Oh, sorry.

839
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
 Just qualifying the weird person.

840
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,140
 He put it in contact by saying he's obsessed with her.

841
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,140
 Yeah.

842
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,500
 It sounded like he had a healthy professional disinterested when he said that he bought the

843
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,980
 cemetery plot next to hers.

844
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,500
 That's what I could win to this.

845
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,780
 I thought you were going to say that he was going to be buried in-- because one of the

846
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,020
 places that the playboy mentioned has is a pet cemetery.

847
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
 Did you know that?

848
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
 It has a pet cemetery.

849
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,740
 Presumably is where all the bunnies are buried.

850
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
 Very good.

851
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
 Thank you.

852
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,740
 I have a hard attack.

853
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
 Send Marianne.

854
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,180
 But, yeah, that one of his girlfriends had a whole bunch of small dogs, didn't she?

855
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,140
 And then the women who lived in the mansion said that they would be summoned to his bedroom

856
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
 every Friday.

857
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,820
 And that's when he would give them that allowance, which I think was $1,000.

858
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,380
 And when they went to his bedroom, they had to wait for the first richer, which was him

859
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,940
 scraping all the dog poo off his bedroom floor.

860
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
 Oh, my God.

861
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,740
 It's too sexy.

862
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,820
 In 2011, this was a story that happened 100 people fell ill after going to a party at the

863
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
 playboy mansion.

864
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,900
 And they think it was because they were bacteria in the whirlpools bar.

865
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,180
 Because they forgot to scrape the dog poo off of it.

866
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,420
 I thought this was interesting.

867
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,540
 40% of all of playboy's income comes from China.

868
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:42,980
 China, you don't mean they sell terracotta, like what they sell tea sets, so that's exactly.

869
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:50,460
 So yeah, in China, the country, and the interesting thing is that the magazine is not sold in China.

870
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,680
 So they licensed the bunny logo completely for things like perfumes, things like tracksuit

871
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
 clothing.

872
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
 I always used to see that in Hong Kong.

873
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,060
 You would see kids wearing playboy outfits, but because in China, it doesn't have the sexual

874
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
 connotation.

875
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,020
 In fact, they completely rebrand it out there to be a more family-oriented thing.

876
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
 What is it, basically?

877
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,540
 It's just a big brand.

878
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:19,660
 There was a lady called Chloe Woodall, who bought some playboy for her VIP body spray from

879
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,660
 I think it was Azda Romline, but it got substituted for it's a dog's life pet care kind and gentle

880
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
 shine.

881
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:34,340
 And she said, "I do have a Staffordshire Bolteria, but how did they know that?"

882
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,500
 You know, this really old idea that people used to say that they would read playboy for

883
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 the articles.

884
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,620
 It is one edition of the magazine that can genuinely be claimed to have been read for just the writing,

885
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,780
 just for the articles.

886
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,020
 And that is something that's been published since the 1970s, the Braille version, they take

887
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
 out any of the nudity.

888
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,580
 So it's not as if they've made like 3D pictures or anything, purely words, and it's purely

889
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
 the articles.

890
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,820
 I think it was the first magazine that came in Braille, isn't it?

891
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
 What's it?

892
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
 Really?

893
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
 Yeah.

894
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
 Private Eye.

895
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,780
 It used to have, and I think still has, an edition for partially sighted author blind people.

896
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,100
 But I actually has an interesting connection with playboy.

897
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,180
 Peter Cook went over to America to ask Hugh Heffner for funding for Private Eye.

898
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,040
 According to the official Peter Cook biography, Peter Cook for anyone listening overseas,

899
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,020
 one of Britain's biggest comedians, Heffner Tom Pessoff, according to this biography, but

900
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,260
 it also meant that one of the best stories that I love about Peter Cook happened in this

901
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,260
 period.

902
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,220
 He was at the Playboy Club, and there was this guy trying to get in and the bunny at

903
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,740
 the front didn't let him in.

904
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,220
 So he started yelling into the whole club going, "Do you know who I am?

905
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
 Do you know who I am?"

906
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,420
 Peter Cook went up to him, and he then yelled to the rest of the club, "I'm sorry, ladies

907
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
 and gentlemen.

908
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,220
 Gentlemen doesn't seem to know who he is.

909
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,860
 Does anyone know who he is?"

910
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,740
 So the playboy mansion that they sold is not the first playboy mansion.

911
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,420
 There was one in Chicago, the first one.

912
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
 It had 70 rooms.

913
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,140
 It had a swim pool.

914
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,660
 It had all sorts of stuff, and now they've turned it into three family homes.

915
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,060
 So you can actually live there, I think students live there some of the time.

916
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,500
 And it had a brass plate on the door with a Latin inscription under your Latin is quite

917
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 good.

918
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,980
 Do you want to translate this?

919
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,660
 See Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare.

920
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,700
 If you don't, Osculas, look.

921
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,980
 No, it must be something like shake.

922
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
 Of course you do.

923
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
 Of course you do.

924
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
 Right?

925
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
 Is it if you don't have an orgasm, you're not excited?

926
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
 Or something like that?

927
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,980
 See Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare.

928
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
 Tintinare.

929
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,620
 Don't impersonate Tintin in this building.

930
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,460
 So Tintinare is wring as in wringing a buzzer.

931
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
 Right.

932
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,700
 And so see Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare.

933
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,460
 If you're not shaking, don't wring.

934
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
 Is it close?

935
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
 But it's a rhyming thing.

936
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
 Osculas.

937
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
 Swinging.

938
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
 Swinging.

939
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
 If you don't swing, don't wring.

940
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
 If you don't swing, don't wring.

941
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
 Yes.

942
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
 Ah.

943
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,460
 Latin put to good use, finally.

944
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
 Yeah.

945
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
 I mean, yeah, it's horrible, but it's great.

946
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,940
 Is the magazine still going?

947
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
 Yeah, it is.

948
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,660
 And they made a big change last year, which is they've stopped doing nudity.

949
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,660
 That's the latest move.

950
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,020
 I think they're just not working anymore.

951
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,420
 Is it sort of a brand?

952
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,660
 Is it now going more towards the brand thing?

953
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
 I think so.

954
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
 Yeah.

955
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
 Yeah.

956
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,060
 I personally read it just for the party hosting tips, before a party.

957
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,980
 Scrape all the dog extrovert off the floor.

958
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,980
 OK, that's it.

959
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
