00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 (whimsical music)

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.820
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.400
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.340
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.220
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.100
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.180
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Anja Murray.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.180
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.700
 and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.380
 My fact is that a group of scientists

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.840
 is currently making their own lava.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.100
 Pretty cool.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.540
 So there's a lot of scientists who are,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.140
 the University of Buffalo's Center for GeoHazard Studies

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.940
 and they want to study what it's like

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.900
 when lava and water meet,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.340
 'cause it's something that you don't get to study a lot

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180
 in the wild, in the natural world.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.220
 But it's really important as well,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.140
 because when lava and water meet,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 it gets really, really explosive as opposed to only

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.900
 normal lava explosivity.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.060
 And so they are making their own stuff

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.420
 and they melt 10 gallons of basaltic rock

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.940
 at a time in a furnace at 2,500 degrees.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.140
 - Is there not a thing about water and lava meeting,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.880
 which is related to the ladenfrost effects,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.900
 one of James's favorite effects?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.500
 I think it's, which is when two substances

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.140
 of vastly different temperatures meet each other

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780
 and it means that the water isn't caused

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.980
 to boil straight away, because this layer of gas

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.260
 suddenly forms between the water and the lava.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.220
 And I think that might be what makes it so explosive,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.900
 because this layer of gas forms

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.860
 and then eventually that layer of gas collapses

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.140
 and then this massive explosion happens to us.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.380
 - Do you know where they could have gone

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.220
 to see lava meet water?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.220
 - No.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.620
 - 1973.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.740
 (laughing)

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.580
 - They went to 1973.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.460
 There's a nice landic town called Vest Mania,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 I'm pronouncing that wrong, obviously.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.620
 But in 1973, they had a volcano erupt

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.580
 and the lava was heading towards this town,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.860
 which was quite far away.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.980
 And what they decided to do was they got water cannons

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.220
 and they pumped billions of gallons of water

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.420
 at the lava that was approaching to stop it.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.180
 And they did it from months on end

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.100
 and eventually did stop and so the town was saved.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.740
 - Some people would say it is harder for scientists

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.060
 to build a time machine and go back to 1973,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.340
 possibly even than making their own lava.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.820
 - It would have been a better fact though.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.020
 - Wasn't there a town, was it in Spain,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.180
 or Italy, where there was a volcano going off?

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.300
 The villagers kind of made a trench

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.220
 so that the lava wouldn't go into their towns.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.780
 But instead they directed it into the next town.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.620
 (laughing)

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.460
 - It was in Sicily.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.940
 - It was one mountaineer exploded.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.260
 The village was called Catania

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.420
 and they dug an artificial breach

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.300
 so to redirect the lava.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.620
 And the really cool thing is they,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.500
 do you know how they kept cool?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.700
 They wore wet sheep skins while they were working.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.140
 - But they, the villagers who they redirected

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.700
 the lava flow to then redirected it back

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.980
 to this other place called Boterno

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.300
 and the Boternians just sent it right back that way.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.140
 - No!

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.980
 - It's so funny.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.100
 - Do you know how to tell if a volcano explodes

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.460
 whether you're really, really, really in trouble?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.300
 - No.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.780
 - And you look up at the spout of lava

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.020
 that's coming out of the volcano.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.980
 And if it's moving left or right,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.620
 you're absolutely fine from your perspective.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.140
 If it appears to be staying still, you're in trouble.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.700
 - Well, because presumably that's coming towards you.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.060
 - Because it's exactly on the same axis as you.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.540
 - I'll be going directly away from you.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.220
 - Well, it's not James, it's coming towards you.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.060
 (laughing)

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.900
 - I'm being annoying.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.020
 (laughing)

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.100
 - I find it amazing that volcanoes are made of lava.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.100
 I never really thought of that.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.420
 I thought, oh, they're just made of rock

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.220
 that's sticking up and then the lava comes out of it.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.220
 But they're made of either lava or lava

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.620
 and ash in layers, building up over millions of years.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.460
 - I thought what was amazing is,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.620
 do you remember the tunnel going through the Alps?

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.540
 The Got-Hard tunnel, do you remember that?

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.260
 And how, when they went through it,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.620
 some of the time the rock was really hard

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.980
 and then some of it was crumbly like sand.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.140
 - You always think of a mountain as being like solid

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.580
 all the way through, but it's amazing

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.060
 that there are gaps in there and little crumbly bits

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.700
 and it's like a trifle.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.300
 - Yeah, you said there are bits,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.340
 you said, 'cause we did on nice such things the news,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.260
 there are bits which were as soft as butter.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.100
 - Yeah.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.700
 - But I can't believe that.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.540
 Actually.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.940
 - You can't believe it's butter.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.060
 (laughing)

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.500
 - You'd be so annoyed if you were building on that mountain

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.180
 or you're trying to get through that mountain

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.660
 and your mate got the butter bit

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.700
 and you've got the granite bit next to it.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.420
 - So you turned up with a massive boring machine

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.900
 and he's just got a buster knife.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.540
 (laughing)

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.860
 - Actually, speaking of tunnels,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.740
 there are lava-related tunnels on the moon.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.740
 - Oh, there's the best thing I've read this week.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.940
 - It's so amazing.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.140
 Yeah, and I can't believe I didn't know these existed.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.740
 So we discovered this quite recently, I think,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.180
 that the moon has these underground tunnels

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.460
 and they were formed by lava flows 3.5 billion years ago.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.700
 So lava would flow and then it solidifies on top,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.540
 faster than it solidifies underneath.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.780
 So the top creates this roof and then underneath the roof

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.940
 is hollowed out as the lava flows through it.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.780
 And so there are these hollow lava tunnels

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.100
 and one of the ways we know this is because they have things

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.940
 called skylights in these tunnels,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.620
 which is where a bit of them fall in

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.660
 and then we see this hole that suddenly created

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.540
 which shows us this tunnel underneath.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.380
 - It's so cool.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.180
 The reason that scientists are really interested in it

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.620
 is because the idea of building these moon bases

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.220
 that always get proposed one day will have a moon base.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.460
 They actually think so part of the problem

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.620
 with moon bases is all the radiation coming in

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.020
 and they think that these tubes could lead

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.300
 to these sort of underground bunkers

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.900
 where we could put the bases.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.740
 So they're now looking into these tubes

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.860
 and they've got probes that have been flying over,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.060
 they've been sussing them out and trying to learn more.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.140
 - So exciting. - Yeah, so it's amazing.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.980
 - You know how we've been discussing

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.500
 in the office recently, the football

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.580
 and Iceland has a lot of volcanoes?

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.500
 Well, the Icelandic football team

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.780
 until the 1950s played and practiced on lava.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.900
 They played on gravel which was made of crushed lava.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.740
 - Wow, that's great.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.580
 - They wonder they're good these days.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.100
 - More impressive to do it on liquid lava

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.620
 as it flows out of the volcano.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.860
 That would be pretty cool.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.620
 'Cause also if you put your foot on lava,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.460
 it's so hot that it sets fire to your foot.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.340
 So that would be quite cool.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.780
 You'd look like one of those cartoon characters

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.060
 that has your shoes on fire.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.820
 - No, that would have been a very impressive.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.660
 - Yes.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.260
 - Yeah, I mean it's not a practical idea.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.900
 - In cartoons you do see people falling into lava

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.100
 but that would never happen 'cause lava's quite thick

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.700
 and gloopy and more viscous and humans.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.140
 - Would you just fall onto it?

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.980
 - You fall onto it and settle on fire.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.820
 - Right.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.180
 - Rather than kind of go, "No!"

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.660
 and kind of the last thing you see

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.660
 is your arm going into the lava here that's--

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.060
 - So what about the end of Terminator 2, spoiler alert,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.900
 where Arnie of course goes into the liquid steel?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.740
 - Well, is he not a robot?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.580
 - He's made of metal.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.780
 - Yeah, so it's slightly different to humans.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.620
 - It's a huge difference.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.460
 - Yeah.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.220
 - He'll have a different density to humans.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.060
 - All right.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.500
 - They have researched it Andy.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.580
 They're not just making stuff up on the top of their heads.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.420
 - Yeah, no, no, no.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.220
 - Have a swim in Terminator?

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.020
 - No, he doesn't, that's why.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.260
 (laughing)

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.900
 - I was reading Mark Komode in Simon Mayo's book

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.900
 and they were talking about movie endings

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.580
 that don't quite make scientific sense

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.500
 and one of them they say is that Lord of the Rings

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.860
 right at the end, for Frodo to go into Volcano,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.700
 that wouldn't be possible

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.340
 because you would just explode from the heat.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.180
 - Sure.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.020
 - Is that true?

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.540
 - How dense are hobbits?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.580
 I mean, these are all made up things aren't they?

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.620
 - Volcanoes aren't made up,

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.140
 but they're in a fancy world, so they could have them.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.260
 - Talking could have specified

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.180
 that in Middle-earth volcanoes are a bit colder.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.020
 (laughing)

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.860
 - Oh yeah, that's true.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.180
 - Now you do have cold volcanoes.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.180
 Have you heard about this?

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.020
 - No.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.020
 - Are you talking about fountains?

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.700
 (laughing)

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.220
 - There is a volcano called Gelae Volcano,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.940
 which is near Lake Natron, which is in Tanzania

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.060
 and their lava is made out of natural carbonateite

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.460
 and it has a different melting point to normal rock.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.140
 Which means it's a lot colder than normal volcanoes.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.460
 I mean, it is 510 degrees Celsius, so it's not that cold,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.740
 but it is that slight half the temperature

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.740
 of a normal volcano.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.420
 - Bring a jumper, you're saying.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.260
 - I'm saying it.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.300
 - If you're gonna wear wet sheepskins,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.900
 then you'll be better off at that one

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.260
 than a normal volcano.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.260
 - It's a great tip.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.100
 - Okay.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.780
 - Although you do get ice lava.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.620
 - Really?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.460
 - What?

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.300
 - How cool is this?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.140
 Not on Earth on other planets,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.380
 but they're in the solar system.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.260
 There are ice volcanoes, also known as cryovolcanoes,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.700
 and they throw up not molten rocks,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.620
 they throw up water or ammonia or methane in liquid form.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.660
 And then it's so cold on those planets

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.860
 that it freezes almost instantly,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.020
 that crashes to the ground.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.260
 And so that happens on Pluto,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.740
 it happens on some other moons.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.820
 - That's very cool.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.660
 - Yeah.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.220
 - Has anyone seen a mud volcano?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.060
 - Nope, no.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.300
 - I saw some of them in Romania last week.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.780
 You kind of drive up to the top of like a mountain.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.540
 It's kind of a flat plateau.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.660
 And then you just have this bubbling mud,

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.180
 these little pits of bubbling mud,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.780
 and then they kind of spurred out a little bit

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.260
 and then rolled down the hill.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.380
 And it's just, yeah, it's a really awesome,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.420
 - It sounds like you'd expect some kind of slime monster

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.740
 to emerge from it.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.580
 - Yeah.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.820
 - Is it dangerous?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.660
 - Is it dangerous?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.500
 - Yeah.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.540
 - When you go there, they tell you not to touch it,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.500
 but because it's in Romania

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.460
 and they don't really seem to bother about health

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.820
 and safety too much,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.540
 it's not like in Britain there would probably be fences

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.220
 and you won't be able to go within a mile of them,

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.060
 but actually you can go right up to them.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.500
 - And that's why you're missing a hand this week.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.340
 (all laughing)

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.900
 That was actually eaten by the slime monster.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.100
 (laughing)

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.180
 - Okay, here's the thing.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.580
 The largest volcano in the world,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.460
 and he guesses as to which or where it is.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.300
 - In the world.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.140
 - In the world.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.980
 - Yeah.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.820
 - Is it underwater?

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.660
 - It's underwater.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.660
 - It's called the Tamu Massif.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.180
 It's a thousand miles east of Japan underwater.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.820
 It is equivalent in area to the British Isles.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.940
 It is 120,000 square miles in area as of volcano.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.740
 It's not active thankfully,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.900
 but it's so gradual, the slope on it

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.500
 that if you were on the seabed,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.380
 you would not be able to tell which way it was

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.220
 towards the top.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.340
 It's really, really, really, really gradual towards the top.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.820
 But it is, it does slope, and it is the size of Britain.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.220
 - You know, scientists have made lava before.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.260
 A couple of years ago, they made lava by heating up rock.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.340
 This was a scientist at Syracuse University

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.060
 and it took them 70 hours to heat-rock and turn it into lava.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.540
 And once they'd done it, they made the world's hottest barbecue.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.900
 - It's hard enough, isn't it?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.500
 To make sure that the outside of your chicken wing

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.340
 is not burnt in the inside's coat.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.580
 It's gonna be charcoal on the outside

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.580
 and completely rarer on the floor.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.180
 - Yeah, apparently there was a chef called Sam Bompas

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.780
 who was present and he said it was the best steak

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.620
 he'd ever had.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.460
 - Yeah, right.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.180
 He's always going around saying that.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.660
 Bompas.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.780
 Okay, so just quickly this is about making things artificially.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.940
 - Do you know what the hottest temperature that humans

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.500
 have ever made is?

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.340
 - What?

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.940
 - 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.180
 - And what's that in centre grade?

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.180
 - It's only 4 trillion degrees Celsius.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.860
 - I don't know what either of those numbers mean,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.460
 but light is that hotter than...

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.020
 - To give you an example, that's 250,000 times hotter

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.860
 than the sun.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.700
 - Yeah.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.420
 - It's that Bismarck 75 million.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.420
 (laughing)

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.420
 Fan-on or fan-on?

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.020
 (laughing)

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.600
 (upbeat music)

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.380
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is James.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.580
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the word Timbuktu

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.660
 means woman with a sticky out belly button.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.100
 So this is a book that I'm reading the moment called

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.140
 The Bad Ass Librarians of Timbuktu

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.940
 by Joshua Hammer and it's a brilliant book

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.980
 and this is just the first bite that I found in there

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.340
 when I started reading it.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.140
 And nobody really actually knows why it comes from this phrase.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.820
 There's some thought that it might have been

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.460
 the goddess that they look towards.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.220
 What I kind of thought is maybe it's just a belly button thing

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.220
 and it could be that it's in some kind of depression.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.980
 I think Timbuktu's in like a depression

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.220
 so it could be like it's the belly button of that area.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.140
 - Although then that would be a real any, wouldn't it?

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.100
 - Yeah, so it's a depression.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.860
 - Unless you're looking at it from the other side.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.700
 - You're right.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.940
 - From inside here.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.500
 (laughing)

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.340
 You're right.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.860
 No, I think there are some disagreements about the translation.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.860
 It could be large belly button rather than sticky out belly button.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.700
 - Okay.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.060
 - It's one of these kind of nobody quite knows

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.460
 but this is the most likely.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.460
 - That is condition, isn't it?

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.620
 There's a medical condition which gives you sticky out

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.740
 of belly buttons.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.580
 - Is that so?

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.500
 - And it's known in the area.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.660
 - Yeah, and it's known in the area.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.180
 It does happen there so possibly that was a woman.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.020
 - I read actually on a Reddit thread

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.900
 and I couldn't verify it that someone said,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.820
 "As per my source, brackets the 1996 Guinness Book of World Records."

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.380
 So if anyone's got that check it,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.580
 the longest outie ever recorded was 11.9 inches.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.060
 - Oh, come on.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.900
 (laughing)

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.700
 - If someone's really screwed up the unbilical cord.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.980
 - If you have like a sensitive cord.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.180
 - Oh, but that's not how it works.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.500
 - Oh, so that's not it.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.660
 - A lot of people think that a belly button

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.700
 is where they've got the unbilical cord but it's not.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.780
 - It always gets cut a couple of inches away

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.380
 from the stomach but then the muscles seal themselves off

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.180
 and that bit of skin just dries up.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.620
 And I don't know where it goes.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.540
 I mean, there have been 90 billion of those things

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.340
 since humanity evolved.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.460
 - But you think there's some kind of a pit somewhere?

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.300
 - There must be somewhere.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.540
 - Shed belly buttons.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.980
 (laughing)

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.540
 - But it's like, for instance, everyone's toenails

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.980
 are always growing and people trim them.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.460
 But it's not like there's a massive cave of toenails.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.620
 - It says, "Well, you know James."

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.860
 (laughing)

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.700
 - Wait till we get to--

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.540
 - Wait until we get to--

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.140
 - So Tim Buck too.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.980
 - Yeah.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.340
 - Do you know what it's twinned with?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.180
 This is rather nice.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.620
 It's twinned with "Hey on Why."

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.460
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.660
 - And when it was announced, someone from "Hey" said,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.300
 "Tim Buck too" is the oldest home of the written word in Africa.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.100
 It has a large number of private and public libraries

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.700
 housing ancient Arabic and African manuscripts.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.420
 "Hey on Why" is the second hand book capital of the world.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.740
 (laughing)

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.820
 - That's basically the same.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.300
 - Actually Tim Buck too had a few was twin with a few

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.460
 and actually, obviously that makes you not a twin

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.780
 as soon as you've got more than one.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.620
 - Yes.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.860
 - You can't be tripleted with.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.420
 - It's amazing looking into Tim Buck too

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.980
 because I genuinely knew nothing about it.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.420
 I know the only thing I knew about it

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.740
 was that it was a lyric in an Oliver song.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.820
 - Go to Tim Buck too and back again.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.460
 That's the only thing I knew about it.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.300
 - Yeah.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.660
 - And it turns out that it was this incredible

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.940
 cultural hotspot for knowledge in the--

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.900
 - Well, that's why it's so good that it's twinned

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.020
 with the second half of the world.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.220
 Because actually it's right.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.460
 They do have loads of manuscripts.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.700
 And this book is about a guy who tried to take a load

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.740
 of manuscripts away from Tim Buck too

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.180
 to the Mali and Capital Bamako

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.580
 because they were under threat by Islamists.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.820
 - Yeah, and it's an amazing story, isn't it?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.660
 - It's a great story.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.860
 - And they genuinely did it.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.460
 So Islamists were coming into Tim Buck too

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.180
 and they thought we bet they're gonna try

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.340
 and destroy our libraries

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.780
 'cause they had hundreds of thousands

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.420
 of really valuable manuscripts

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.500
 and lo and behold, a short while later, a few months later,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.660
 then the libraries were sort of raised to the ground

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.860
 and they'd managed to save and smuggle out of the country

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.820
 more than 300,000 manuscripts

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.300
 and a few hundred were left.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.300
 So everyone thought when these libraries collapsed,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.740
 oh no, that's all gone.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.180
 And then these guys came out of the woodwork

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.740
 saying, don't worry about it.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.540
 We got rid of them.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.860
 - And where are they now?

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.020
 - I'm not telling you.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.300
 (laughing)

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.660
 'Cause this goes out on the internet.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.300
 - So why did Tim Buck too have a big collapse

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.900
 to the point where I read a 2006 survey of 150 Britons,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.100
 34% did not believe it existed.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.020
 - So I've actually got the survey here

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.580
 and this was reported by the sun

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.540
 under the headline Tim Buck, who?

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.140
 (laughing)

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.140
 - God.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.620
 - But anyway, the survey, I think this is the survey

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.300
 we're talking about now, it was in 2010

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.260
 and it was of 18 to 30 year olds.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.100
 - Okay. - Okay.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.660
 And of them, maybe it was the same,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.500
 maybe it was different.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.740
 Half thought that Tim Buck too was made up.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.540
 10% thought that Kazakhstan wasn't real.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.860
 A third said that Atlantis was somewhere in Greece

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.900
 and one person thought that France was in Spain.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.780
 (laughing)

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.180
 - But actually for a long time, Tim Buck too,

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.700
 people weren't sure whether it existed.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.580
 It was kind of a half legendary place in North Africa

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.420
 and because Europeans didn't really go to North Africa,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.500
 a lot of people went to try and find this so-called city

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.460
 where great education happened and so on.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.460
 - And gold reserves, right?

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.420
 It was quite famous for its gold a few hundred years ago.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.260
 - Exactly.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.020
 The first Westerner in modernish times to try and find it

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.860
 was a guy called John Lediard.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.420
 And when he went, he'd never been to Africa.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.900
 He didn't know a single word of Arabic.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.500
 And when he got to Cairo, he had a bilious complaint

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.260
 and decided to treat it with sulfuric acid

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
 and took so much that he immediately died.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.100
 - Whoa!

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100
 - Yeah.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.260
 - Hang on, so he was just trying to find it.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.260
 He didn't make it.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.700
 - Well, he got as far as Cairo.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.900
 And then he saw some, what he thought was Gaviscan

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:47.900
 that was actually--

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.300
 If only he'd known a single word of Arabic,

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.140
 namely sulfuric acid.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.740
 - It's not the first word you learn, though, is it?

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.580
 - No, it's not.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.900
 - I'm deep into the textbook.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.780
 - It's right at the back of the phrase book, isn't it?

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.940
 It's in the medical section.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.260
 You just do hello and where is the toilet and stuff like that.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.900
 - He probably could have done with where is the toilet.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.180
 It's not the way.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.980
 - Do you know about the first Westerner to get to Timbuktu?

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.820
 - No.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.620
 - He was called Gordon Lang.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.220
 Okay, he got there in 1826.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.780
 And he was a Scott and he was an adventurer, basically.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.980
 About 30 years old.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.780
 And he had this huge competition between Britain and France

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.180
 to get to Timbuktu.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.340
 And they obviously had a head start up,

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.940
 because they're closer, but--

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.980
 - Yeah, 'cause we're in Spain.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.820
 - Yeah.

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.580
 (laughing)

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.700
 He said to his parents, "I shall do more than has ever been

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.020
 done before and shall show myself to me what I have ever

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.580
 considered myself a man of enterprise and genius."

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.460
 Right, so big claim.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.580
 This is from a website called GreatBritishNutters.Blogspot.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.420
 (laughing)

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.260
 Amazing.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.300
 So he got to Tripoli immediately proposed

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.660
 to the British consul's daughter,

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.300
 and she fell in love with them, and they got married.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.180
 And then he said, "Right, I'm off to Timbuktu."

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.420
 He thought it would take him a few weeks.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.340
 The temperatures were huge, right.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.060
 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.460
 The food was patties of dried fish and camel's milk.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.500
 Bandits everywhere.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.620
 One night he was attacked in his tent by bandits,

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.220
 as he was sleeping, hacked out with swords.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.260
 He got 24 wounds, 18 of them serious.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.380
 Next morning, he still said, "Put me on my camel."

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.340
 So he was strapped onto a camel for 400 miles,

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.020
 seriously injured, kept going, right.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.500
 It took him over a year to get to Timbuktu.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.780
 He finally got there after recuperating all of this stuff,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.500
 and it was abandoned and poor.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.900
 It wasn't this great center of learning anymore.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.340
 And then two days after he left,

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.700
 he was murdered in the desert by bandits.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.100
 This is incredible, sort of awful journey.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.540
 And do we know if he thought it was worth it or?

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.540
 We don't know, because--

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.540
 Glad he went.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.100
 It wasn't what he was looking for,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.100
 which is, like James says,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.900
 this amazing center of learning at the university

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.260
 and gold and books.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.540
 You know, it wasn't like that anymore.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.220
 There's got to be a moment on that track

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.860
 when you've been strapped to a camel.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.660
 And you've got hack woods from giant swords

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.860
 that you think he'd, "Did I make the right call here?"

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.660
 Just at least for a minute, he must have had doubts.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.620
 Just a second.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.980
 Do you know when we started thinking of Timbuktu

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.580
 as that semi-fictitious far away place?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.580
 No.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.180
 So you know how we say today, "Oh, we'll send him to Timbuktu,"

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.380
 because we know it's just constantly saying that,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.940
 right, I'll put it in that case.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.100
 I'm constantly hearing it.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.220
 It's actually an Oxford English Dictionary definition

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.820
 in its own right, the word.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.900
 Yeah, of course, a long distance place.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.980
 So it's been in use since Lady Duff Gordon,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.260
 the English writer, in the 1860s, was in Cairo.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.980
 And she was getting really fed up with the fact

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.660
 that Cairo was being sort of gentrified.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.180
 So lots of other British people were coming there.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.220
 That was a serial cafe.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.500
 That was exactly a problem.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.900
 So she wrote a letter back from Cairo saying,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.780
 it's growing dreadfully cockney here.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.980
 I must go to Timbuktu instead.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.420
 And that was the first reference of, you know,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.900
 going to escape to a more distant place than this.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.860
 Yeah.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.140
 So the idea that Timbuktu, the name,

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.180
 meaning the sticky-outy belly button,

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.540
 I started looking into what places, how their names were derived.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.580
 So it's thought that maybe Canberra means women's breasts.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.860
 No one quite knows where Canberra comes from in Australia.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.660
 Yeah, they think it means meeting place as well,

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.060
 because it derives from an Aboriginal word, but actually--

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.780
 But often they would meet at women's breasts.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.340
 So it's very confusing.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.380
 If there's more than one woman in the bar while you're meeting.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.100
 Manchester's named after breasts.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.980
 Yeah.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.500
 Is it?

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:29.860
 Yeah.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.820
 The man in Manchester comes from mum, like mummaries.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.700
 And it's because of the hills around Manchester.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.300
 So it should be called breastchester.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.300
 Yeah, chestchester.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.700
 It should be called breastchester.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.540
 And then this is my favorite.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.660
 This was named after someone.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.780
 There's a place called Anus Haven.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.780
 I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.820
 I don't think you are.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.660
 I think it is.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.500
 I think it's Anus Haven.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.060
 Or it could be Anus Haven.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.660
 But the thing is, is that this place is in Armenia.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.940
 And it's named after a World War II hero

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.740
 called Dr. Anus Haven Galilean.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.940
 Anus Haven, actually, sounds like another cupboard in your house,

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.340
 that's it.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.460
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.220
 And that is Chuzinski.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.300
 My fact this week is that lovers hearts beat in sync.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.660
 Gross, gross, gross, gross.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.180
 This disgusting fact comes to you, courtesy of research

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.300
 that was done by the University of California Davis in 2013.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.700
 And it put couples in a room and it monitored their heart rates

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.220
 and the couples weren't touching each other or speaking to each other.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.980
 So they were married.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.100
 Speaks to the married man.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.740
 Right, so these couples didn't touch or speak to each other.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.700
 But it was found when their heart rates were monitored

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.340
 that their hearts were beating in sync

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.500
 and their breathing really closely matched.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.620
 And then in this experiment, they

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.620
 mixed the people up a bit.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.540
 So they put males and females with people

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.980
 that they weren't in a couple with.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.020
 So just like strangers in the room with them.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.380
 And their hearts wouldn't be in sync.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.180
 You know other things that synchronize.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.220
 Other occasions on which heart beats synchronize.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:07.900
 This is quite cool.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.340
 So mothers and infants, their heart beats synchronize

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.500
 when they're just looking at each other.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.020
 So a mother with her own baby, basically.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.740
 Also, choirs, their heart rates rise and fall at the same time.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.220
 And they think that is a breathing thing as well.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.260
 Because some bits you need loads of breath

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.420
 or when you breathe in your heart rate goes up.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.100
 Well, and also dogs and their owners, sync heart beats.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:28.700
 Yeah.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.700
 According to research by pedigreech.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.700
 Yeah, I know.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.700
 I know.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.220
 I love when you read where that research is coming from.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:36.860
 It always is.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.260
 Yeah.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.060
 Although I don't know how that helps with sails.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.580
 Well, what was interesting about that study was it

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.300
 basically said that when dogs are reunited with their owners

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.980
 after separation, then both those beings

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.700
 heart start beating faster, which isn't necessarily

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.460
 them syncing.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.980
 It's presumably more likely than being quite excited

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.140
 that they're seeing each other again.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.260
 Here's a cool thing about heart rates.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.100
 Obviously, different animals hugely

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.180
 faster and slower depending.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.140
 And I think we may have even said before that so sperm

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.900
 whales have about nine beats per minute,

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.460
 shrews 835 beats per minute.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.380
 If you put a whale in a room with a shrew,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.260
 I'll put a stand.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.060
 They synchronize.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.300
 If they love us.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.940
 And the whale speeds up to 400 beats per minute

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.860
 and immediately dies.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.380
 No, OK, this is the really cool thing.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.060
 So the whale and the shrews hearts both deliver

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.220
 over the lifetime 200 million liters of blood per kilo

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.860
 of body weight.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.620
 So it's exactly the same rate for both animals.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.020
 So in both animals, each gram of tissue over the animal's

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.660
 lifetime receives 38 liters of oxygen.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.620
 How weird is that?

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.620
 This is a stupid question.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.300
 But is that true proportionally for most animals?

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.500
 I think it'll be true.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.580
 Well, yeah, I don't think it's not just those two, basically.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.660
 This is a sort of a rule of life.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.140
 Yeah, it's true of all mammals, I think, pretty much.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.660
 But humans don't work in the same way.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.220
 So it was thought for a while that all mammals

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.140
 had the same number of heartbeats in the lifetime

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.500
 because the shorter lived animals beat much quicker

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.140
 and the longer lived ones beat much slower.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.140
 And it does kind of work a little bit,

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.500
 but it doesn't work with humans.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.300
 And I think the reason being that we have really good

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.220
 medication and stuff, so we live longer

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.740
 than we probably should do.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.100
 There's about a billion heartbeats.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.260
 Most mammals, with some exceptions,

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.740
 like humans, get a billion.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.740
 So it might still be worth getting into a relationship

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.580
 with someone who has a very slow heartbeats.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.460
 With a sperm whale.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.780
 In an attempt to extend to life.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.100
 But if you got-- let's say in the future,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.140
 we managed to do heart transplants.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.180
 Is it a case of confusing a single heart

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.220
 that, how many times, it's personally beat?

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.740
 Or is it responding to the body?

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.020
 As in, if you take a heart that has had no beats

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.820
 and put it in the body of someone who's coming up

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.220
 to a billionth beat, will reset the clock?

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.460
 The heart will keep going, yeah.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.460
 I mean, if your heart's beaten a billion times,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.060
 then it'll be much more time than the heart.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.060
 Yeah, it's not that you can get to 90 years old

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.620
 and then put a child's heart in your body

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.260
 and you're going to live for another 90 years.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.580
 Well, someone's got to tell Rupert Murdoch.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.780
 But let's say that it's a heart collapse

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.220
 that you had that leads to your death.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.460
 Would it eliminate the chances of that happening?

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.620
 Well, it's certainly true that if your heart is in trouble,

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.060
 you can have a heart transplant, and it will help.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.500
 But did you know this?

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.580
 You can transplant your heart into someone else

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.660
 and still live.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.160
 No.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:11.660
 What?

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.160
 OK.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.660
 So this is a medical procedure.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.140
 It doesn't happen very often.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.060
 But say, for instance, I needed a heart and lung transplant

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.740
 from another person from NSA.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.360
 But done--

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.020
 I didn't sign anything, by the way.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.860
 And then done needed a heart transplant.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.420
 What they can do is, because the heart and lung coming

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.880
 from Anna would be better working together,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.220
 they can give me the heart and lung from Anna,

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.860
 and then I can give my heart to Dan.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.620
 So I've actually transplanted my heart

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.180
 and received from another person who does occasionally happen.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.700
 Do I then give my heart and lungs to Anna?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.540
 Yes, where am I getting my heart?

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.340
 I'm going to say what?

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.260
 You don't make it in this kind of a story.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.460
 You're the person who is a donor.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.540
 Why doesn't Anna just give me the heart?

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.780
 What was-- why were you the in between?

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.820
 I really need-- let's say I really need a lung transplant.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.580
 The lungs will work better with a heart of Anna.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.660
 So Anna's lungs will work better with Anna's heart.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.660
 So I will get the heart and the lungs.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.100
 But my heart will then go to you because you need a heart.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.920
 Yeah, got it.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.940
 And your lungs are fine.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.460
 Right.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.860
 So why am I not involved in this?

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.500
 Do you know that laughing can increase your heart health?

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.380
 So start cracking those jokes.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.740
 Yeah, it vasodilates your blood vessels.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.980
 So it increases the width of your blood vessels,

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.780
 and it means that you can pump more blood around your body.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.580
 And it increases them by 22%, which is actually really significant.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.900
 So how much do you have to laugh for that?

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.220
 I just more than--

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.620
 You can instigate.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.500
 So they've also found that happiness can actually

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.500
 damage the heart as well.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.260
 It's all to do with-- so there's that thing that it's

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.900
 called the Takotsubu cardiomyopathy, a broken heart syndrome.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.620
 It's the idea of broken heart.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.740
 And then you just kind of convince your heart.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.860
 And in very rare cases, you convince it to the point of you dying.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.260
 And they've recently found that happiness can trigger the same thing.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.980
 So it's a rare condition, but happiness has the same effect.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.260
 It suddenly puts the heart into a kind of oddly stressed position,

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.780
 and that can lead to death as well.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.540
 So happiness can be dangerous.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.620
 Is this why when you're in love, sometimes your heart feels uncomfortable?

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.860
 That's just-- surely, that's just there.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.300
 Just the nerves in the trinalinia.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.860
 It's just interesting that the sort of physical sensations of emotion--

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.580
 why should it be in the chest?

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.620
 Why on earth should I feel anything in particular there?

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.700
 Because that's about fight or flight, isn't it?

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.580
 And why is it like that?

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.660
 Because your heart is in the legs.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.900
 Well, my-- nobody's got blood in it, isn't it?

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.860
 That means sense of Valentine's card to pitch the legs out.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.220
 When you make my ankle beat twice as fast.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.420
 You are my anus haven.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.300
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.660
 And that is my fact.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.420
 My fact this week is that this year, Hugh Hefner sold the Playboy Mansion.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:05.540
 It comes with 30 rooms, a pool, a tennis court, a zoo license, and Hugh Hefner.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.940
 So comes with Hugh Hefner.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.980
 You get to keep Hugh Hefner, but this place comes with Hugh Hefner.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.100
 I got a tool.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.660
 The idea of being that he is now allowed to just live in this house until he dies.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.980
 That's the part of the deal that he did.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.900
 He ended up selling it to his neighbor.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.940
 And I think they've known each other for a long time, so that seems to be an OK thing.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.140
 But yeah, so it's been sold.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:39.140
 And obviously, back in the '60s and '70s was known as the kind of Disney land of sexuality, basically.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.900
 It was because we love the misogyny.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.700
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.020
 The Disney land of misogyny.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.620
 But now it's sort of very dirty, very run down.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.300
 And-- Yeah, you be dirty, not just sexually, it's literally dirty.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.300
 It literally is, yeah.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.300
 It can't be filled.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.300
 It does contain a pipe organ.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.300
 It does.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.300
 That's not a euphemism.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.300
 Sorry.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.700
 To imagine Hugh Hefner asking if you want to see his pipe organ.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.780
 Yeah, so he's in his 80s at the moment.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.860
 Do you guys know where he is going to be buried when he does pass away?

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.060
 Is he one of these people who has to be buried, like, on top of Marilyn Monroe?

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.100
 He's being buried right next to Marilyn Monroe.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.100
 Okay.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.820
 He bought the plot right next to her.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.820
 Yeah.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.820
 That's weird.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.740
 She was the first ever cover girl for Playboy.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.740
 Yeah.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.780
 And he's been obsessed with her his whole life in--

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.940
 Oh, well, it's not weird at all.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.940
 Oh, sorry.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.940
 Just qualifying the weird person.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.140
 He put it in contact by saying he's obsessed with her.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.140
 Yeah.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.500
 It sounded like he had a healthy professional disinterested when he said that he bought the

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.980
 cemetery plot next to hers.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.500
 That's what I could win to this.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.780
 I thought you were going to say that he was going to be buried in-- because one of the

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.020
 places that the playboy mentioned has is a pet cemetery.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.020
 Did you know that?

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.020
 It has a pet cemetery.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.740
 Presumably is where all the bunnies are buried.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.740
 Very good.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.740
 Thank you.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.740
 I have a hard attack.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.740
 Send Marianne.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.180
 But, yeah, that one of his girlfriends had a whole bunch of small dogs, didn't she?

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.140
 And then the women who lived in the mansion said that they would be summoned to his bedroom

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.140
 every Friday.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.820
 And that's when he would give them that allowance, which I think was $1,000.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.380
 And when they went to his bedroom, they had to wait for the first richer, which was him

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.940
 scraping all the dog poo off his bedroom floor.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.940
 Oh, my God.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.740
 It's too sexy.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:22.820
 In 2011, this was a story that happened 100 people fell ill after going to a party at the

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.820
 playboy mansion.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.900
 And they think it was because they were bacteria in the whirlpools bar.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.180
 Because they forgot to scrape the dog poo off of it.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.420
 I thought this was interesting.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.540
 40% of all of playboy's income comes from China.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:42.980
 China, you don't mean they sell terracotta, like what they sell tea sets, so that's exactly.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:50.460
 So yeah, in China, the country, and the interesting thing is that the magazine is not sold in China.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:56.680
 So they licensed the bunny logo completely for things like perfumes, things like tracksuit

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.680
 clothing.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.680
 I always used to see that in Hong Kong.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.060
 You would see kids wearing playboy outfits, but because in China, it doesn't have the sexual

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.060
 connotation.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.020
 In fact, they completely rebrand it out there to be a more family-oriented thing.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.020
 What is it, basically?

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.540
 It's just a big brand.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:19.660
 There was a lady called Chloe Woodall, who bought some playboy for her VIP body spray from

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:25.660
 I think it was Azda Romline, but it got substituted for it's a dog's life pet care kind and gentle

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.660
 shine.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:34.340
 And she said, "I do have a Staffordshire Bolteria, but how did they know that?"

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:39.500
 You know, this really old idea that people used to say that they would read playboy for

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.500
 the articles.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:46.620
 It is one edition of the magazine that can genuinely be claimed to have been read for just the writing,

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.780
 just for the articles.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:52.020
 And that is something that's been published since the 1970s, the Braille version, they take

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.020
 out any of the nudity.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.580
 So it's not as if they've made like 3D pictures or anything, purely words, and it's purely

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.580
 the articles.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.820
 I think it was the first magazine that came in Braille, isn't it?

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:02.820
 What's it?

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.820
 Really?

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.820
 Yeah.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.820
 Private Eye.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.780
 It used to have, and I think still has, an edition for partially sighted author blind people.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.100
 But I actually has an interesting connection with playboy.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.180
 Peter Cook went over to America to ask Hugh Heffner for funding for Private Eye.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.040
 According to the official Peter Cook biography, Peter Cook for anyone listening overseas,

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:25.020
 one of Britain's biggest comedians, Heffner Tom Pessoff, according to this biography, but

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.260
 it also meant that one of the best stories that I love about Peter Cook happened in this

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.260
 period.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:34.220
 He was at the Playboy Club, and there was this guy trying to get in and the bunny at

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.740
 the front didn't let him in.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.220
 So he started yelling into the whole club going, "Do you know who I am?

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.220
 Do you know who I am?"

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.420
 Peter Cook went up to him, and he then yelled to the rest of the club, "I'm sorry, ladies

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.420
 and gentlemen.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.220
 Gentlemen doesn't seem to know who he is.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.860
 Does anyone know who he is?"

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.740
 So the playboy mansion that they sold is not the first playboy mansion.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.420
 There was one in Chicago, the first one.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.420
 It had 70 rooms.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.140
 It had a swim pool.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.660
 It had all sorts of stuff, and now they've turned it into three family homes.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.060
 So you can actually live there, I think students live there some of the time.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.500
 And it had a brass plate on the door with a Latin inscription under your Latin is quite

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.500
 good.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.980
 Do you want to translate this?

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.660
 See Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.700
 If you don't, Osculas, look.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.980
 No, it must be something like shake.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.980
 Of course you do.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.980
 Of course you do.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980
 Right?

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.980
 Is it if you don't have an orgasm, you're not excited?

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.980
 Or something like that?

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.980
 See Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.980
 Tintinare.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.620
 Don't impersonate Tintin in this building.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.460
 So Tintinare is wring as in wringing a buzzer.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.460
 Right.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.700
 And so see Non-Osculas, Noly Tintinare.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.460
 If you're not shaking, don't wring.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.460
 Is it close?

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.460
 But it's a rhyming thing.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.460
 Osculas.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.460
 Swinging.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.460
 Swinging.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.460
 If you don't swing, don't wring.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.460
 If you don't swing, don't wring.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.460
 Yes.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.460
 Ah.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.460
 Latin put to good use, finally.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.460
 Yeah.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.460
 I mean, yeah, it's horrible, but it's great.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.940
 Is the magazine still going?

00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.940
 Yeah, it is.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.660
 And they made a big change last year, which is they've stopped doing nudity.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.660
 That's the latest move.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.020
 I think they're just not working anymore.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.420
 Is it sort of a brand?

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.660
 Is it now going more towards the brand thing?

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.660
 I think so.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.660
 Yeah.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.660
 Yeah.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.060
 I personally read it just for the party hosting tips, before a party.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.980
 Scrape all the dog extrovert off the floor.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.980
 OK, that's it.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.980
 That's all of our facts.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.460
