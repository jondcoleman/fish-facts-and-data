00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:02,00:00:03,of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:00:03,00:00:05,"Before we get going, we just wanna let you know"
00:00:05,00:00:08,that this is a particularly interesting episode.
00:00:08,00:00:10,It's what we like to call a crossover episode.
00:00:10,00:00:12,"You may be aware of crossover movies,"
00:00:12,00:00:14,take the latest Avengers movie
00:00:14,00:00:16,where they had Guardians of the Galaxy involved.
00:00:16,00:00:20,We've decided to do a crossover episode with ourselves.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"It's very ambitious, but I think we've managed it."
00:00:24,00:00:25,"- We screwed up, didn't we, Dan?"
00:00:25,00:00:26,"- We did, we screwed up."
00:00:26,00:00:29,"We were in Wellington, we were on stage,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"Wellington is in New Zealand,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"and we were recording a show as part of our tour,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,and we've only just found out that the final two facts
00:00:37,00:00:40,"are missing, the recording is gone."
00:00:40,00:00:42,"- Or the final one and a half facts, I think,"
00:00:42,00:00:43,"and you'll notice, I believe."
00:00:43,00:00:44,"- Yeah, so what it'll sound like"
00:00:44,00:00:47,"is that all of our jokes are falling really, really flat."
00:00:47,00:00:49,(laughing)
00:00:49,00:00:50,- How will listeners tell the difference?
00:00:50,00:00:52,(laughing)
00:00:52,00:00:54,"- Okay, so listen carefully,"
00:00:54,00:00:55,'cause you might actually miss it.
00:00:55,00:00:57,"We'll do our best to make sure it's flagged up,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,"but if we've done our job well, you won't notice."
00:00:59,00:01:01,"- Okay, on with the show."
00:01:01,00:01:03,(bell rings)
00:01:03,00:01:04,- Do you know what it is?
00:01:04,00:01:05,- Who the fuck is this?
00:01:05,00:01:06,(bell rings)
00:01:06,00:01:07,- Who the fuck is that?
00:01:07,00:01:08,(bell rings)
00:01:08,00:01:09,Do you know what it is?
00:01:09,00:01:12,(upbeat music)
00:01:12,00:01:14,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:01:14,00:01:17,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"", a weekly podcast."
00:01:17,00:01:20,"This week, coming to you from Wellington!"
00:01:20,00:01:23,(audience cheering)
00:01:28,00:01:30,"- My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,"and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:01:33,00:01:35,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,"
00:01:35,00:01:38,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:38,00:01:41,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:01:41,00:01:45,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:45,00:01:49,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Chazinski."
00:01:49,00:01:52,- My fact is that if a lamb starts being born
00:01:52,00:01:54,"the wrong way up, the farmer pushes it"
00:01:54,00:01:57,right back up into the womb and gets it to start again.
00:01:57,00:01:59,(audience laughing)
00:01:59,00:02:03,"And I thought I'd do a fact about sheep, because we're here."
00:02:03,00:02:06,(audience laughing)
00:02:06,00:02:08,"- Wow, that is a risky start, Anna."
00:02:08,00:02:11,"- See, not everyone in the room is a sheep farmer."
00:02:11,00:02:12,(audience laughing)
00:02:12,00:02:14,"But on the size of love, about half of the mile."
00:02:14,00:02:15,"- Yeah, but."
00:02:15,00:02:20,"- So yeah, I think I first came across as a New Yorker piece"
00:02:20,00:02:22,"that was an interview with a guy called James Rebanks,"
00:02:22,00:02:24,who's a sheep farmer in Cumbria in the UK.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"And he was saying, yeah, most lambs,"
00:02:26,00:02:28,"if they're being born well, they come out like a diver."
00:02:28,00:02:30,So it's like head and front legs first.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"But if the legs and the head come out in the wrong order,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"at all, you literally have to shove it right back up there"
00:02:34,00:02:37,and rearrange them in order that they come out
00:02:37,00:02:38,the right way.
00:02:38,00:02:42,And so he gave various instances of ways
00:02:42,00:02:42,that it could go wrong.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"So if the legs come out without a head,"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"then you have to go, that means the head."
00:02:47,00:02:49,That doesn't mean it's left the head right behind
00:02:49,00:02:51,in the uterus.
00:02:51,00:02:53,It just means the head's a bit bent.
00:02:53,00:02:55,So you've got to return it and rearrange it.
00:02:55,00:02:57,"And when you do rearrange it, they have"
00:02:57,00:03:00,to cup the mouth of the lamb so that the lamb's teeth don't tear
00:03:00,00:03:02,at the birthing canal in the uterus.
00:03:02,00:03:03,Crikey.
00:03:03,00:03:05,It's a combination of extremely sweet and extremely
00:03:05,00:03:06,disgusting.
00:03:06,00:03:10,I'm yet to hear the sweet part.
00:03:10,00:03:12,He's helping the little lamb get out intact.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"OK, where do you put it like that?"
00:03:14,00:03:17,What does the sheep think as the baby's birthing
00:03:17,00:03:20,is suddenly pushed back in like that?
00:03:20,00:03:23,That's got to be the weirdest experience ever.
00:03:23,00:03:24,We don't have any records on what they think.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"But they must be concerned, right?"
00:03:26,00:03:30,I read a thing that sheep have an incredible peripheral vision.
00:03:30,00:03:32,They've not that incredible that they can see up there.
00:03:32,00:03:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:36,00:03:38,But they think they can go almost to 360.
00:03:38,00:03:40,"They've almost got 360 views, which are nice."
00:03:40,00:03:42,It's almost impossible to sneak up on them.
00:03:42,00:03:44,Yeah.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"There's piece of a lot of experience, doesn't it?"
00:03:46,00:03:51,"Almost, but not quite."
00:03:51,00:03:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:54,00:03:56,But they must as it's being shoved back in.
00:03:56,00:03:59,"They must have us put in like, what are you doing?"
00:03:59,00:04:01,You can see you.
00:04:01,00:04:02,They're very dappy.
00:04:02,00:04:04,"I mean, genuinely, they are quite--"
00:04:04,00:04:06,"I think they're quite crap mothers, at least at the start."
00:04:06,00:04:11,So I read so many farming blogs and turns out
00:04:11,00:04:14,you are very bad at knowing which ones are their babies.
00:04:14,00:04:16,And the babies are very bad at knowing which ones are their mothers.
00:04:16,00:04:18,And they're constantly getting confused about this
00:04:18,00:04:20,and going off with the wrong parent.
00:04:20,00:04:22,And so a lamb will accidentally pick the wrong parent
00:04:22,00:04:25,that won't be able to produce milk and so it'll starve.
00:04:25,00:04:29,"And there's this weird thing where farmers,"
00:04:29,00:04:32,"sometimes, a lamb will be born and be an orphan,"
00:04:32,00:04:33,so that you might die in childbirth.
00:04:33,00:04:36,And it's an amazing thing that farmers do to trick
00:04:36,00:04:40,use into believing that another lamb is their lamb.
00:04:40,00:04:43,And what they do is there'll be a you that's pregnant
00:04:43,00:04:44,with one lamb.
00:04:44,00:04:45,And it gives birth to it.
00:04:45,00:04:47,And the farmer then he's to trick the you
00:04:47,00:04:49,into thinking it's about to have twins.
00:04:49,00:04:52,"And so what he does, prepare yourselves,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,"is, first of all, he covers the orphan lamb"
00:04:54,00:04:58,in the birthing fluid so that it smells right from the other one.
00:04:58,00:05:01,And he ties its legs together because often that lamb's
00:05:01,00:05:03,"day old or so, and they can run away."
00:05:03,00:05:05,"And if you're just given birth or something,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,it's very unusual for it to immediately go
00:05:07,00:05:09,gallopanting over the fields.
00:05:09,00:05:13,And then what he does is he sort of puts inserts his hand
00:05:13,00:05:18,into the you and pretends that his hand is the second lamb
00:05:18,00:05:19,that's being born.
00:05:19,00:05:22,And then you will be convinced that she's having contractions
00:05:22,00:05:24,and think that she's giving birth and you keep it in there.
00:05:24,00:05:25,And then you whip it out.
00:05:25,00:05:28,And then you quickly do the magic trick of quickly
00:05:28,00:05:31,shoving the orphan lamb under the used nose.
00:05:31,00:05:33,"And then things, oh, that must be what just came out of me."
00:05:33,00:05:37,I've got effects about lambing sound effects.
00:05:37,00:05:40,So this is from the long running radio four
00:05:40,00:05:42,show the archers.
00:05:42,00:05:44,They have a style guide on how to do the sound effect
00:05:44,00:05:45,of a lamb being born.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Wow.
00:05:46,00:05:49,So you have to overlay agitated barring.
00:05:49,00:05:51,That's very important.
00:05:51,00:05:53,So there's barring going on and it sounds stressed.
00:05:53,00:05:55,And then you put a soaking wet towel on your shoulder.
00:05:55,00:05:56,It's really heavy.
00:05:56,00:05:58,And then you squeeze a huge amount of yogurt
00:05:58,00:06:00,through your gloved hands.
00:06:00,00:06:02,And then you drop the wet towel onto a bed
00:06:02,00:06:04,of old recording tape.
00:06:04,00:06:06,Wow.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Why don't they just use the recording
00:06:07,00:06:10,of an actual lamb being born?
00:06:10,00:06:11,"Often they don't sound right, do they?"
00:06:11,00:06:13,"When you do the actual thing, it"
00:06:13,00:06:14,doesn't sound like what you would expect.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"It might happen that if you recorded that,"
00:06:16,00:06:19,it would just sound like an old towel being dropped off
00:06:19,00:06:22,of some yogurt as if it's trained.
00:06:22,00:06:25,I thought I would find out what farmers did.
00:06:25,00:06:26,But I forgot to look on the blogs.
00:06:26,00:06:28,I went on to Reddit.
00:06:28,00:06:32,And there was an AMA with a sheep farmer.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"And one of the top questions was,"
00:06:34,00:06:38,why do they have such shitty asses?
00:06:38,00:06:41,The farmers are the sheep.
00:06:41,00:06:43,They were speaking about the sheep.
00:06:43,00:06:44,"The guy said, this is true."
00:06:44,00:06:46,As though they have zero control or awareness
00:06:46,00:06:48,of what comes out.
00:06:48,00:06:51,And they actually sell jackets to go over the sheep
00:06:51,00:06:53,to protect the wool from getting dirty for those
00:06:53,00:06:55,who want super clean wool.
00:06:55,00:06:58,So you get some sheep who are wearing like an all-in-one
00:06:58,00:07:00,onesie with a little hole.
00:07:00,00:07:01,And it keeps them clean.
00:07:01,00:07:06,And will that be made of a previous sheep?
00:07:06,00:07:08,"Well, there is one thing that they do."
00:07:08,00:07:11,"Again, if they want a you to adopt an orphan sheep,"
00:07:11,00:07:15,they will shave the wool off one of its real offspring
00:07:15,00:07:18,and then put it on the other one as a disguise.
00:07:18,00:07:21,So they literally wear the other lambs clothes.
00:07:21,00:07:23,So it's like a sheep in sheep's clothing.
00:07:23,00:07:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:26,00:07:27,It's a lamin lambs clothing.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"But yeah, I think everyone gets the idea."
00:07:29,00:07:30,It's a great clever.
00:07:30,00:07:32,Did you know that sheep have their own weather forecast?
00:07:32,00:07:33,What?
00:07:33,00:07:34,"In the UK, sheep have their own weather forecast."
00:07:34,00:07:35,"No, they don't."
00:07:35,00:07:35,They do.
00:07:35,00:07:36,It's just been launched.
00:07:36,00:07:37,It's in Bristol.
00:07:37,00:07:40,"And it's a traffic light system of warnings, which"
00:07:40,00:07:42,measures whether-- and it works out the risk of-- there's
00:07:42,00:07:45,a very particular parasite they get called pneumatodirus.
00:07:45,00:07:46,"And if you are a pneumatodirus, and I've"
00:07:46,00:07:49,"pronounced it wrong, please don't write in."
00:07:49,00:07:50,But it's very useful.
00:07:50,00:07:53,The only problem with it is that they
00:07:53,00:07:57,have not called it the sheeping forecast.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Guys?
00:07:58,00:07:59,"Thank you, growing there."
00:07:59,00:08:01,When you met a supportive hearty chuckle.
00:08:01,00:08:04,"So it's a forecast not of weather, but of parasites?"
00:08:04,00:08:05,Yes.
00:08:05,00:08:08,"Well, it's weather, which tells you when the parasites are"
00:08:08,00:08:09,going to be coming in.
00:08:09,00:08:09,Wow.
00:08:09,00:08:11,And it tells the humans not the sheep.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"It's really a focus of farmers, isn't it?"
00:08:13,00:08:17,"Or do the sheep gather around 5 p.m. every Monday, actually?"
00:08:17,00:08:19,There'll be a lot of parasites out there tonight.
00:08:19,00:08:22,"Look, lively, stay sharp."
00:08:22,00:08:26,That's-- I was reading a medical report about--
00:08:26,00:08:27,it just gives you virus.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"It talks about viruses and parasites and so on, that come up."
00:08:29,00:08:31,And these people who are reading it
00:08:31,00:08:34,"noticed a very odd entry in it, which"
00:08:34,00:08:37,is that a few people who were farmers who
00:08:37,00:08:41,were involved in castrating lambs when they were born
00:08:41,00:08:43,got very ill very quickly.
00:08:43,00:08:45,And it was 12 people who got ill.
00:08:45,00:08:47,But they worked out that two of them got ill
00:08:47,00:08:50,because they were castrating with an old method that still
00:08:50,00:08:52,"goes on these days, not completely,"
00:08:52,00:08:55,but in the 1800s all the time.
00:08:55,00:08:56,They castrate using their teeth.
00:08:56,00:09:01,So these are humans who go and two of these guys
00:09:01,00:09:04,were castrating these lambs with their teeth.
00:09:04,00:09:06,And they got very ill.
00:09:06,00:09:09,One of my best friends has done that in Australia.
00:09:09,00:09:10,- Really? - In Western Australia.
00:09:10,00:09:11,- Yep. - Did they get ill?
00:09:11,00:09:14,"He's-- well, he's pretty insane, but he's not sick."
00:09:14,00:09:15,"Oh, OK."
00:09:15,00:09:18,"I think he is sick, yeah."
00:09:18,00:09:19,"And they go by on a conveyor belt, right?"
00:09:19,00:09:20,"And you lie underneath them, and he just"
00:09:20,00:09:21,weaponize one by one.
00:09:21,00:09:23,What?
00:09:23,00:09:27,"Well, you come up like jaws, but you just go bite off the balls."
00:09:27,00:09:29,"It's your friend, Australian."
00:09:29,00:09:30,He lived in Australia for a year.
00:09:30,00:09:31,"Well, he was British."
00:09:31,00:09:32,Yeah.
00:09:32,00:09:35,Feels like they kind of saw him coming down there.
00:09:35,00:09:36,"Yeah, we all do this, mate."
00:09:36,00:09:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:38,00:09:42,This guy looks like I'll bite the balls off anything.
00:09:42,00:09:45,Do you know how farmers can tell when she perv made it?
00:09:45,00:09:46,This is an interesting thing.
00:09:46,00:09:48,"Well, they wait nine months."
00:09:48,00:09:50,Yeah.
00:09:50,00:09:52,"So what they do-- well, in a lot of farms, what they do is"
00:09:52,00:09:56,they draw on the males with crayon.
00:09:56,00:09:57,OK?
00:09:57,00:09:59,"And then, if they come back later--"
00:09:59,00:10:00,so they draw on the underside of the males with crayon.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"And if they come back later, because you"
00:10:02,00:10:04,"can't be watching the sheep all the time, it's--"
00:10:04,00:10:06,Oh.
00:10:06,00:10:08,"It might be chalk here, but in some places,"
00:10:08,00:10:11,"and in the sources I found, it was crayon."
00:10:11,00:10:14,"Anyway, if they come back later and the females got crayon,"
00:10:14,00:10:17,or chalk?
00:10:17,00:10:21,"On her back, then they know that mating has occurred."
00:10:21,00:10:23,"But you wouldn't think that crayon would work, right?"
00:10:23,00:10:24,"Yeah, you'd--"
00:10:24,00:10:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:28,00:10:30,It too harking.
00:10:32,00:10:37,"Hey, another weird thing that happens to female pregnant--"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"sorry, sheep-- is that they get really heavy with the weight"
00:10:40,00:10:42,and their wool gets really heavy.
00:10:42,00:10:45,"So sometimes they lose balance, and they tip over."
00:10:45,00:10:48,"And they fall on their back, like a turtle,"
00:10:48,00:10:49,and they can't get back up.
00:10:49,00:10:50,So they get stuck.
00:10:50,00:10:54,So farmers have to go and bring pregnant sheep back onto their feet.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"Otherwise, they've just stuck their upside down."
00:10:56,00:10:57,"Wow, really?"
00:10:57,00:10:57,Yeah.
00:10:57,00:10:58,Sheep spinning.
00:10:58,00:10:59,"They are stupid, aren't they?"
00:10:59,00:11:01,They are.
00:11:01,00:11:03,Someone sent me a text in the break.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"And I can't remember who it is, and I've turned my phone off,"
00:11:05,00:11:08,"sorry, but they said that when it snows,"
00:11:08,00:11:12,the sheep can't believe that the grass is underneath the snow.
00:11:12,00:11:14,They think it's just disappeared.
00:11:14,00:11:17,And so they'll just starve to death if you don't kind of clear
00:11:17,00:11:18,them a little clearing.
00:11:18,00:11:20,Is it another one of those magic tricks
00:11:20,00:11:23,"they think have happened, like the swapping of the land?"
00:11:23,00:11:26,"And apparently, like cows and cattle, they all clear it away."
00:11:26,00:11:28,But sheep are just stupid.
00:11:28,00:11:32,They sometimes-- so they have to groom their lambs when they give birth to them.
00:11:32,00:11:36,And sometimes they get so carried away with grooming that they bite their tails off.
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Wait, sorry."
00:11:37,00:11:38,The mother.
00:11:38,00:11:42,I thought you meant this was your friend biting.
00:11:42,00:11:44,I think your friend just really likes lamb.
00:11:44,00:11:48,"But yeah, the mothers, they've got to lick off all the afterbirth and stuff,"
00:11:48,00:11:51,"but they get really excited, and they'll bite the umbilical cord,"
00:11:51,00:11:52,and they'll just bite the tail off.
00:11:52,00:11:55,"And the farmers don't know what to do because you're not supposed to get involved,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"because otherwise, that might separate the mother from the lamb."
00:11:57,00:12:00,"And so they just have to watch, sort of going, no, stop it."
00:12:00,00:12:02,Stop biting them tail of your child.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"Oh, my God."
00:12:04,00:12:07,"Guys, we're going to have to move on shortly to our next fact."
00:12:07,00:12:09,"Just one last thing, Mary had a little lamb."
00:12:09,00:12:12,The nursery rhyme is based on a true story.
00:12:12,00:12:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:15,00:12:16,You know that?
00:12:16,00:12:17,Yeah.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Well, there's nothing supernatural in there already."
00:12:19,00:12:20,Yeah.
00:12:20,00:12:22,It's just about someone called Mary who had a little lamb.
00:12:22,00:12:23,It's a quite believable--
00:12:23,00:12:26,And the sheep followed her wherever she-- it's a good herder.
00:12:26,00:12:30,"She's-- yeah, it's a very-- what's your point, Andy?"
00:12:30,00:12:31,Was she famous?
00:12:31,00:12:32,Was she a famous Mary?
00:12:32,00:12:33,She was not.
00:12:33,00:12:36,She was a woman called Mary Sawyer.
00:12:36,00:12:38,It was a Massachusetts in 1830.
00:12:38,00:12:43,"She had a lamb, and it followed her all over the place, and then a friend."
00:12:43,00:12:44,Interesting.
00:12:44,00:12:45,"No, no, no, the interesting thing thing was,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,"it's fleece was as white as snow, and then--"
00:12:48,00:12:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:51,00:12:54,"So when I've disappeared, where am I?"
00:12:54,00:12:57,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:12:57,00:13:01,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:13:01,00:13:03,"My fact is that the Netflix category,"
00:13:03,00:13:10,"Gory Canadian Revenge Movies, only has one film in it."
00:13:10,00:13:12,"Wow, on what's the film, Deena?"
00:13:12,00:13:12,I don't.
00:13:12,00:13:14,I'm going to rip it down.
00:13:14,00:13:17,Sauce.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"Your research today has been very lax,"
00:13:18,00:13:23,because it's of reciting nursery rhymes and having a fun fact.
00:13:23,00:13:26,So what the thing that happens is there
00:13:26,00:13:28,are these microcategories on Netflix.
00:13:28,00:13:30,"And if you have a Netflix account, you might have seen them."
00:13:30,00:13:36,"So goofy werewolf comedies is one, or sentimental movies"
00:13:36,00:13:38,about horses for ages 11 to 12.
00:13:38,00:13:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:43,00:13:45,And some of them-- this is the bizarre thing.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"Netflix has made 76,897 unique categories,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,according to the last count done.
00:13:51,00:13:53,And some of them have nothing in them.
00:13:53,00:13:57,So that feel good romantic Spanish language TV show.
00:13:57,00:13:59,"Netflix has none, but they've created the category,"
00:13:59,00:14:00,because some will exist.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Wow.
00:14:01,00:14:05,"So for instance, skiing, nonfiction, none of those."
00:14:05,00:14:08,"Iranian comedies, none of those."
00:14:08,00:14:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:09,00:14:11,So we're just waiting to discover them.
00:14:11,00:14:12,I guess so.
00:14:12,00:14:15,It's like when they knew India existed and they tried to find it.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"If you pitch a show to Netflix to make,"
00:14:17,00:14:19,"they'll probably be like, well, it's a shit idea,"
00:14:19,00:14:22,but we need one of those.
00:14:22,00:14:23,You've got the money.
00:14:23,00:14:27,They actually-- there was a role that was advertised in the UK
00:14:27,00:14:30,for someone specifically to create these kind of categories.
00:14:30,00:14:33,So the idea was they advertised for someone
00:14:33,00:14:35,who would basically binge watch Netflix.
00:14:35,00:14:37,They would just sit and watch movie after movie.
00:14:37,00:14:38,"And while they were watching, they"
00:14:38,00:14:40,would think of unique different tags
00:14:40,00:14:42,that they could give to each of those movies
00:14:42,00:14:44,to create these kind of categories.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"But the other thing is, they have professional watches."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"So this is-- this fact is from a piece in The Atlantic, which"
00:14:49,00:14:51,was fantastic.
00:14:51,00:14:55,"It was a journalist who ran a script to download all 76,000."
00:14:55,00:14:57,"The guys who professionally watch Netflix,"
00:14:57,00:15:00,they tag movies with all kinds of data.
00:15:00,00:15:04,So it's not just how rude the plot is or whether there's violence.
00:15:04,00:15:06,They tag how conclusive the plot is.
00:15:06,00:15:08,They tag how moral the characters are.
00:15:08,00:15:10,And they just analyze everything.
00:15:10,00:15:13,And all they want is to get you to watch more Netflix.
00:15:13,00:15:16,"So one of them said, you might like what I consider"
00:15:16,00:15:17,to be horrible movies.
00:15:17,00:15:20,But my job right now is to get you to watch all those horrible
00:15:20,00:15:21,movies that you want.
00:15:21,00:15:24,And they have thousands of categories designed specifically
00:15:24,00:15:25,for that.
00:15:25,00:15:27,Who's specifically looking for things like this?
00:15:27,00:15:28,That's what's so weird.
00:15:28,00:15:31,Who wants a thing that's 80% conclusive
00:15:31,00:15:32,with moderately moral characters?
00:15:32,00:15:34,No one's searching for that in every week.
00:15:34,00:15:35,That sounds fun.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"No, OK, maybe."
00:15:37,00:15:40,"Also, I think that there are films in their categorization"
00:15:40,00:15:42,filling isn't very good.
00:15:42,00:15:44,So one of the ones that has nothing in it
00:15:44,00:15:46,is suspenseful time travel movies.
00:15:46,00:15:48,There's definitely got to be some of those.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Back to the future is suspenseful, right?"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"Yes, yeah."
00:15:52,00:15:54,Sentimental action and adventure.
00:15:54,00:15:56,There must be one sentimental action film out there.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"Yeah, not everything's on Netflix, though."
00:15:58,00:16:00,"That's the issue, I guess."
00:16:00,00:16:03,"Back to the future, I don't think is on Netflix."
00:16:03,00:16:04,"Therefore, maybe they're just waiting to--"
00:16:04,00:16:07,"Yeah, it is, then, apparently."
00:16:07,00:16:11,That guy at the back watched it this morning.
00:16:11,00:16:14,Right after birthing his lambs.
00:16:14,00:16:18,So Netflix released a load of their stats from 2017.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"And apparently, someone in New Zealand"
00:16:20,00:16:25,"watched grown-ups 331 times, like you."
00:16:25,00:16:26,Great movie.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Absolutely.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"Great movie, but 331 times in a year."
00:16:30,00:16:33,"Apparently, there's a podcast called ""The worst idea"
00:16:33,00:16:34,"of all time"" where they tell you to do that."
00:16:34,00:16:36,So that's why they did that.
00:16:36,00:16:38,"Ah, cool."
00:16:38,00:16:41,And there was one viewer in Antarctica
00:16:41,00:16:43,who binged on Shameless.
00:16:43,00:16:44,And there was one person in America
00:16:44,00:16:46,who watched the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie
00:16:46,00:16:49,every single day for a year.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Wow.
00:16:50,00:16:53,I'd rather do that than watch the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean
00:16:53,00:16:54,movie once.
00:16:54,00:16:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:56,00:17:01,"Netflix has shamed people for this, though."
00:17:01,00:17:03,"They sent our tweet in December last year,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"saying, ""To the 53 people who've"
00:17:05,00:17:09,"been watching a Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days,"
00:17:09,00:17:10,"who hurt you?"""
00:17:10,00:17:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:12,00:17:14,"Oh, that's pretty mean."
00:17:14,00:17:19,"It's a combination of mean, creepy."
00:17:19,00:17:22,Just one more thing that they've got about category-wise.
00:17:22,00:17:27,They've got so many things starring the actor Raymond Burr.
00:17:27,00:17:28,Uh-huh.
00:17:28,00:17:29,Yeah.
00:17:29,00:17:31,They've got suspenseful movies starring Raymond Burr.
00:17:31,00:17:34,They've got cerebral mysteries starring Raymond Burr.
00:17:34,00:17:38,They've got understated suspenseful dramas starring Raymond Burr.
00:17:38,00:17:42,They've got about 15 Raymond Burr exclusive categories.
00:17:42,00:17:43,It's very bizarre.
00:17:43,00:17:45,That's so good.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"I know Netflix, I guess, from the last, let's say,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,"five years, I think that's when I started using it."
00:17:51,00:17:55,I had no idea that Netflix has been around since 1997.
00:17:55,00:17:56,It's an extremely old company.
00:17:56,00:17:58,It was extremely old.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"It's not general electric, is it?"
00:18:01,00:18:05,It's old for what-- I think most people
00:18:05,00:18:10,"perceive to be very, you know, 2000s, at least 2010s,"
00:18:10,00:18:11,something like that.
00:18:11,00:18:12,It's kind of that thing.
00:18:12,00:18:14,So I was looking into it.
00:18:14,00:18:16,And it's a very interesting backstory.
00:18:16,00:18:20,There's a number of stories that their creator and Netflix
00:18:20,00:18:22,founder read Hastings puts out.
00:18:22,00:18:25,One is that he got a very big bill for a VHS
00:18:25,00:18:27,that he sent back into late.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"It was Apollo 13, and he thought there's"
00:18:29,00:18:30,got to be a better system.
00:18:30,00:18:32,So he created it.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"And what it used to be is, like all those things"
00:18:34,00:18:36,"where you would order a DVD off the internet,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,the difference was rather than getting a booklet that
00:18:38,00:18:40,told you everything that was in it.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"Back in 1997, there was a website that would send you"
00:18:43,00:18:45,"a VHS, and so you would just pick it from the website"
00:18:45,00:18:46,and order it.
00:18:46,00:18:48,So we already had a web presence back then.
00:18:48,00:18:49,"But yeah, that's--"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"I remember when it was just DVDs, and they send you DVDs"
00:18:51,00:18:54,"through the post, and that still exists, that business."
00:18:54,00:18:55,And it's still making money.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"But actually, in 2000, Reed Hastings approached"
00:18:58,00:19:01,blockbusters and asked them to buy Netflix
00:19:01,00:19:04,"for $50 million, the entire company."
00:19:04,00:19:06,And they refused.
00:19:06,00:19:07,And--
00:19:07,00:19:07,Wow.
00:19:07,00:19:11,"That did not age well, that decision, didn't it?"
00:19:11,00:19:13,"Just one tiny little nugget about Reed Hastings,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,when I was reading into him.
00:19:15,00:19:18,"His grandfather was a very famous physicist,"
00:19:18,00:19:23,and he was very important in the roles of inventing radar
00:19:23,00:19:26,and the atomic bomb for World War II.
00:19:26,00:19:31,And President Roosevelt said of Reed's grandfather
00:19:31,00:19:34,that he was a civilian who was second perhaps only
00:19:34,00:19:37,to Winston Churchill in facilitating the allied victory
00:19:37,00:19:38,in World War II.
00:19:38,00:19:42,So his grandfather is a seriously important character.
00:19:42,00:19:45,"Yeah, sort of an unknown name to the general public."
00:19:45,00:19:48,"Wow, they've both made equally important contributions,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,"I would say, to the able happiness of the world."
00:19:51,00:19:53,The Reed Hastings story about its inception
00:19:53,00:19:56,"is quite amused as me, because there is this story he tells"
00:19:56,00:19:58,"when it starts, how did you come up with Netflix?"
00:19:58,00:20:01,"He says, I was overcharged for a film."
00:20:01,00:20:02,And I was charged $40.
00:20:02,00:20:04,"It was a poly 13, charged $40."
00:20:04,00:20:05,I'd lost the film.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"He said, I didn't want to tell my wife about it."
00:20:07,00:20:09,"And I said to myself, am I really"
00:20:09,00:20:11,going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late
00:20:11,00:20:14,"fee, which I would say is marriage is on shaky ground,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,if that's going to compromise its integrity?
00:20:17,00:20:20,"But so then he thought, OK, I'm going to start up"
00:20:20,00:20:21,a new company that doesn't do this.
00:20:21,00:20:24,But his co-founder is called Mark Randolph.
00:20:24,00:20:26,And he just keeps killing this story.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"So maybe he's exaggerated the story over time,"
00:20:28,00:20:31,or he's piecing things together that weren't together at the time.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"And Mark Randolph, every time he's interviewed,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,"is like, no, it's bullshit, Reed Hastings story."
00:20:35,00:20:36,"No, no, it didn't happen."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"But it's a nice story, isn't it?"
00:20:38,00:20:39,So I let him tell it.
00:20:39,00:20:41,Wow.
00:20:41,00:20:43,"Oh, I'm getting a story straight, guys."
00:20:43,00:20:46,"So Netflix and chill is the thing, isn't it?"
00:20:46,00:20:48,There's an article on fusion.com
00:20:48,00:20:50,about the history of that phrase.
00:20:50,00:20:52,And they said that the first use was in January 2009
00:20:52,00:20:55,by @NoFaceNina on Twitter.
00:20:55,00:21:01,"And by summer of 2014, it had a slightly sexual meaning."
00:21:01,00:21:04,"And then by October, so a few months later,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,someone said that Netflix and chill never
00:21:06,00:21:10,"means Netflix and chill now, these days, lol."
00:21:10,00:21:15,"OK, so that was @itisIsak on Twitter."
00:21:15,00:21:16,How many A's is that?
00:21:16,00:21:17,Quite a lot.
00:21:17,00:21:20,"Well, maybe I just pressed the key too long on my keyboard,"
00:21:20,00:21:21,I'm sure.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"And then by the end of that year, it was all over Twitter."
00:21:24,00:21:27,"And then by August 2015, US parents"
00:21:27,00:21:30,were asking their kids what Netflix and chill meant.
00:21:30,00:21:31,And they were using it.
00:21:31,00:21:33,And that became the end of the meme.
00:21:33,00:21:38,"So basically, it lasted for less than six years"
00:21:38,00:21:40,from going from nothing to cool.
00:21:40,00:21:42,To don't say that anymore.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:46,My wife didn't know what Netflix and chill meant.
00:21:46,00:21:48,The sexual context of it.
00:21:48,00:21:48,And whenever--
00:21:48,00:21:50,"No, she had a baby, don't you?"
00:21:50,00:21:52,"We do have a baby, yeah."
00:21:52,00:21:54,And we were watching grownups for the 50th time
00:21:54,00:21:57,when we conceived him.
00:21:57,00:22:00,"But we-- yeah, so whenever work finished for her,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,"her bosses would be like, what are you up to tonight?"
00:22:02,00:22:05,"I'm just going to be home with my husband, Netflix and chill."
00:22:05,00:22:07,"She thought, oh, we're just chilling."
00:22:07,00:22:11,"And I told her on a train what it meant and her face went, what?"
00:22:11,00:22:13,But at least she wasn't saying I'm going home
00:22:13,00:22:15,"to see my mum, Netflix and chill, you know?"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"Like the husband, that's actually OK."
00:22:17,00:22:18,That's true.
00:22:18,00:22:20,Do you know that Netflix knows exactly
00:22:20,00:22:22,when you will get hooked on a series?
00:22:22,00:22:25,"This is quite creepy, but it's also quite interesting."
00:22:25,00:22:28,So it works out the exact point.
00:22:28,00:22:30,The definition of being hooked is it
00:22:30,00:22:33,works out the exact point at which 70% of people
00:22:33,00:22:35,go on to finish the series.
00:22:35,00:22:37,So that's the definition of being hooked.
00:22:37,00:22:41,"So breaking bad, you will be hooked by episode 2"
00:22:41,00:22:42,on average.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"How I met your mother, episode 8."
00:22:44,00:22:47,I wonder with breaking bad if it's quicker to get hooked
00:22:47,00:22:51,watching the show or taking Crystal Mep?
00:22:51,00:22:54,Yeah.
00:22:54,00:22:57,The Big Bang Theory apparently never.
00:22:57,00:23:05,"And for fans of the Big Bang Theory, that was a laugh."
00:23:11,00:23:15,We have made a powerful enemy to actually talk.
00:23:15,00:23:19,"Just on the subject of breaking bad and drugs and being hooked,"
00:23:19,00:23:23,Netflix actually co-created drugs and released drugs.
00:23:23,00:23:25,"Well, it's a really old company, isn't it?"
00:23:25,00:23:27,Yeah.
00:23:27,00:23:31,"No, Netflix co-created a set of cannabis strains"
00:23:31,00:23:34,based on a selection of its popular original shows.
00:23:34,00:23:35,And they did this.
00:23:35,00:23:37,It was a pop-up event in West Hollywood
00:23:37,00:23:40,for the alternative herbal health services
00:23:40,00:23:42,and the set of drugs that you could buy
00:23:42,00:23:44,were called the Netflix collection.
00:23:44,00:23:46,And they were a part of helping to create these.
00:23:46,00:23:49,So you could get ones that were made to tie in oranges
00:23:49,00:23:52,"and new black, you were tying with that."
00:23:52,00:23:54,"There were ones for arrested development,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,which were labeled the banana stand-cush.
00:23:56,00:24:01,"Yeah, ideally for a big yellow joint."
00:24:01,00:24:03,That was the thing.
00:24:03,00:24:06,And they did it for the Grace and Frankie TV show as well.
00:24:06,00:24:10,"So you can buy cannabis, which is co-created"
00:24:10,00:24:12,by Netflix and smoke it while you binge.
00:24:12,00:24:15,"And do they do the thing where you have two toaks and you go,"
00:24:15,00:24:16,"oh, that's good."
00:24:16,00:24:18,"And someone comes up and goes, I think you might also"
00:24:18,00:24:19,"like this, by the way."
00:24:19,00:24:21,You say this?
00:24:21,00:24:23,And maybe this one over there.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Yeah.
00:24:24,00:24:26,"They don't make any profit from it, by the way."
00:24:26,00:24:28,It was just that they just want to get people high.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Come on.
00:24:29,00:24:34,"Did you know there is a Spanish platform, which is related?"
00:24:34,00:24:37,"In fact, no, sorry, legally, it's unrelated."
00:24:37,00:24:41,"But there is a Spanish platform called Napflex, which"
00:24:41,00:24:44,"is TV to fall asleep very easily, too."
00:24:44,00:24:45,And it might just be me.
00:24:45,00:24:49,But I think all the stuff on it sounds really good.
00:24:49,00:24:50,So there's a big bang theory.
00:24:50,00:24:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:54,00:24:58,"Please, please edit those jokes at the show."
00:24:58,00:25:00,"Do you have the hope of having to come here on that one day, then?"
00:25:00,00:25:03,"No, I just don't want to be killed by an army of nerds."
00:25:03,00:25:04,I just don't know.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"They've got-- you might like this, James."
00:25:06,00:25:09,We've got a four-hour video of the World Chess Championship 2013.
00:25:09,00:25:10,You like chess?
00:25:10,00:25:10,"Yes, I do."
00:25:10,00:25:13,I subscribe to a special chess channel.
00:25:13,00:25:15,Do you?
00:25:15,00:25:19,And I have a one-slug in a fan's of the big bang theory.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Yeah.
00:25:20,00:25:23,So Napflex ran a competition to fix its algorithm.
00:25:23,00:25:25,So the thing it does where it recommends stuff
00:25:25,00:25:27,"that you might like, it has been a massively difficult thing"
00:25:27,00:25:29,to achieve over the years.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"In 2006, there was a $1 million award for anyone"
00:25:32,00:25:35,who could improve the recommendations algorithm.
00:25:35,00:25:38,So it could actually recommend stuff that you genuinely would like.
00:25:38,00:25:39,And it took three years to be won.
00:25:39,00:25:41,It was won by this collective.
00:25:41,00:25:44,And it improved the accuracy of the one they had by 10%.
00:25:44,00:25:46,And it's so weird.
00:25:46,00:25:48,So all these coders were competing for it.
00:25:48,00:25:49,It took three years.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"And then the people who won, and the people who came second,"
00:25:52,00:25:55,only submitted their bits 20 minutes apart.
00:25:55,00:25:57,So they lost $1 million by 20 minutes.
00:25:57,00:25:58,Wow.
00:25:58,00:26:00,But the main challenge for these coders
00:26:00,00:26:02,is Napoleon Dynamite.
00:26:02,00:26:03,So--
00:26:03,00:26:04,How do you mean?
00:26:04,00:26:06,No algorithms seem to know if someone's
00:26:06,00:26:10,going to like Napoleon Dynamite.
00:26:10,00:26:10,That was it.
00:26:10,00:26:11,And that was the challenge it was set.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"It was like, can you work out if someone will like Napoleon Dynamite?"
00:26:14,00:26:15,Because we don't know.
00:26:15,00:26:17,There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.
00:26:17,00:26:18,Wow.
00:26:18,00:26:18,That's incredible.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"So I'm making $1 million in 20 minutes, which"
00:26:21,00:26:25,"is, coincidentally, what the cost of the big bank theory do."
00:26:25,00:26:28,"We're going to have to move on in the set, guys, for our next fact."
00:26:28,00:26:30,Did you see the survey that Napflex did last year
00:26:30,00:26:32,on how people are watching?
00:26:32,00:26:35,"And so two-thirds of people watch Napflex in public now,"
00:26:35,00:26:38,"or watch Stream in public, which I think is weird."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"Do you mean like on the train, or on the bus?"
00:26:40,00:26:41,"Yeah, on the train, on the commuter work, whatever."
00:26:41,00:26:45,"I know I have a phone from 2001, so maybe that's why I don't do it."
00:26:45,00:26:49,"So this is last year, and it found that 65% of people"
00:26:49,00:26:52,have burst out laughing on public transport while watching it.
00:26:52,00:26:56,"20% have cried in public, and then been embarrassed about it."
00:26:56,00:26:59,But 27% of people who've been streaming stuff
00:26:59,00:27:01,"in public on public transport, for example,"
00:27:01,00:27:03,have had strangers interrupt them while they're
00:27:03,00:27:07,watching to start talking about the show that they're watching.
00:27:07,00:27:09,Is that a thing?
00:27:09,00:27:13,I once-- OK.
00:27:13,00:27:15,I was in Japan once.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"I was in Tokyo, and I was on one of the subway trains."
00:27:18,00:27:21,And I noticed the phone of the guy sitting next to me.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"He was a wester guy, and he was listening"
00:27:23,00:27:26,to no such thing as a fish.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"And I-- no, hang on."
00:27:28,00:27:32,"He was-- no, wait, the story hang on."
00:27:32,00:27:35,"He was watching QI, and I leaned over to him,"
00:27:35,00:27:41,"and I said, I wrote that, and he did not believe me."
00:27:41,00:27:45,"And I know from the way he said, oh, OK."
00:27:45,00:27:47,And they got off at the next stop.
00:27:47,00:27:51,"On the flight over from Australia to New Zealand,"
00:27:51,00:27:53,"there was a guy sat in front of me, you, and Anna,"
00:27:53,00:27:55,who was listening to no such thing as a fish.
00:27:55,00:27:56,"Yeah, that's right."
00:27:56,00:27:57,And we were chatting behind him.
00:27:57,00:28:02,He must have been so freaked out when he took his headphones off.
00:28:02,00:28:07,This has all got a bit more boring very quickly.
00:28:07,00:28:09,"We need to move on to our next fact, guys."
00:28:09,00:28:13,"OK, and it's time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:28:13,00:28:16,"OK, my fact this week is that in Sacred Maché combat,"
00:28:16,00:28:19,"the aim was not to kill your opponent,"
00:28:19,00:28:22,but to knock his hat off.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"And the loser didn't go off that easily,"
00:28:23,00:28:26,"though, because he would immediately be sacrificed."
00:28:26,00:28:28,"No, you lose your hat."
00:28:28,00:28:33,"But fortunately, you won't have a head anymore to put it on."
00:28:33,00:28:37,So the Maché were a civilization from Peru.
00:28:37,00:28:41,And I learned this last year when I visited the Laco Museum
00:28:41,00:28:43,of Pre-Columbian Art in Lima.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"And we know about this because all we know about these people,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,"they're really mysterious, but everything"
00:28:47,00:28:49,we know comes from their pottery.
00:28:49,00:28:53,And we have kind of the like little cartoons of what happens.
00:28:53,00:28:54,So that's how we know about it.
00:28:54,00:28:55,That's very cool.
00:28:55,00:28:57,What kind of hats are they?
00:28:57,00:28:58,Is it like a top hat?
00:28:58,00:28:59,"Because the top hat would be quite easy to knock off,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,but then a beanie is quite difficult.
00:29:02,00:29:03,That's true.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"And a bike helmet, almost impossible."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Yeah.
00:29:05,00:29:09,They were large feathery kind of feather pieces.
00:29:09,00:29:09,Sounds easy.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Sounds easy.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"Yeah, it is easy."
00:29:11,00:29:14,"Well, really, they just wanted someone to sacrifice."
00:29:14,00:29:16,"Yeah, I don't think they really gave a shit who it was."
00:29:16,00:29:19,"And I think sometimes they also then sacrifice the winner,"
00:29:19,00:29:19,right?
00:29:19,00:29:21,"There's someone who's the thing in me, so I don't know how I can go."
00:29:21,00:29:23,"But they'd sacrifice a guy whose hat got knocked off,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,"but then they thought the gods also deserved their best warriors,"
00:29:25,00:29:28,so they would sometimes also sacrifice the one
00:29:28,00:29:29,who'd won the battle.
00:29:29,00:29:29,Wow.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"It's a real catch, 22."
00:29:31,00:29:32,"That's terrible, yeah."
00:29:32,00:29:33,"Oh, it is."
00:29:33,00:29:34,"It's a matter of the pre-show interview,"
00:29:34,00:29:35,like the pre-match interviews.
00:29:35,00:29:37,How are you feeling about the match?
00:29:37,00:29:37,Not good.
00:29:37,00:29:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:40,00:29:43,"Yeah, I didn't know that they made rubber balls."
00:29:43,00:29:45,"Yes, they did."
00:29:45,00:29:46,"Some of them, yeah."
00:29:46,00:29:47,"The old mechs, especially."
00:29:47,00:29:49,"Yes, the sum of me, so Americans, they made rubber balls."
00:29:49,00:29:51,"And they could make a match, different compounds."
00:29:51,00:29:52,This is very cool.
00:29:52,00:29:55,And some of them had the scientists believe
00:29:55,00:29:59,"that they made 16,000 balls a year in special rubber ball factories."
00:29:59,00:30:00,Wow.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Yeah, this is--"
00:30:01,00:30:02,"Yeah, this is impressive."
00:30:02,00:30:04,"This is very true, though, does it?"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"Not factories, come on."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"It's got the word fact in it, James."
00:30:08,00:30:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:10,00:30:13,Is this the mezzo-American ballgame that we're talking about?
00:30:13,00:30:15,Is this-- I thought that was a much slightly slightly different
00:30:15,00:30:18,to Sacred Mote hat combat.
00:30:18,00:30:20,It's the later mezzo-American ballgame.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Yeah, they play with these balls,"
00:30:21,00:30:22,and it's a crazy game.
00:30:22,00:30:25,"And again, historians are not quite sure"
00:30:25,00:30:26,whether when the loser and the winner
00:30:26,00:30:28,are determined who were the ones that
00:30:28,00:30:32,were murdered and sacrificed off the back of it.
00:30:32,00:30:34,So they think it might have been the losers who got sacrificed.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"But actually, the gods were more interested"
00:30:36,00:30:38,in the best blood and the most skillful.
00:30:38,00:30:42,"So actually, you would probably kill the better team,"
00:30:42,00:30:43,the winners.
00:30:43,00:30:46,And there was this extra thing where they would chop their heads off.
00:30:46,00:30:48,And some historians believe that then
00:30:48,00:30:50,they took the heads of the opponents
00:30:50,00:30:52,and then used those as a post-match ballgame
00:30:52,00:30:54,to then play with their heads.
00:30:54,00:30:56,There are pictures of that happening.
00:30:56,00:30:56,Pictures?
00:30:56,00:31:00,"Yeah, the drawings that we have of them doing that."
00:31:00,00:31:02,And they would also drink out of them sometimes.
00:31:02,00:31:06,So the post-match skull would be used as a drinking vessel.
00:31:06,00:31:07,Wow.
00:31:07,00:31:08,They would recycle.
00:31:08,00:31:10,"It's not a way to drive up the quality of the game,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,"I think, to kill good teams and bad teams alike."
00:31:13,00:31:14,Yeah.
00:31:14,00:31:16,I think that's why we should say they almost certainly
00:31:16,00:31:19,didn't do this the vast majority of the time.
00:31:19,00:31:21,"I read a really good analogy, which was,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,"imagine if in 5,000 years people looked"
00:31:23,00:31:26,at all of the Christian art that we have now
00:31:26,00:31:27,"and thought, wow, this is so weird."
00:31:27,00:31:29,"They just crucified people left, right, and set"
00:31:29,00:31:31,her every time they went to church.
00:31:31,00:31:33,Just because that's the thing that remains.
00:31:33,00:31:34,The image that remains.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"It probably did happen, but probably not often."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"Yeah, they seem to have really disliked"
00:31:40,00:31:42,a particular look in people.
00:31:42,00:31:44,"And if you had a beard and you had dark hair,"
00:31:44,00:31:45,you'd be crucified.
00:31:45,00:31:46,There was--
00:31:46,00:31:50,"So they do have really interesting pottery, the Maché people."
00:31:50,00:31:54,And there was an exhibition in Paris a few years ago
00:31:54,00:31:56,about it was called Sex Death and Sacrifice
00:31:56,00:31:57,in the Maché religion.
00:31:57,00:32:00,"And it had to have a warning on the way in about explicit content,"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"even though this is from how long ago, 2,000 years ago?"
00:32:04,00:32:05,"Yeah, best part of that."
00:32:05,00:32:06,But have you seen it?
00:32:06,00:32:09,Because it is pretty hard-cut.
00:32:09,00:32:12,I've got some good things on my computer
00:32:12,00:32:13,that stop me having to look at that sort of thing.
00:32:13,00:32:14,"Well, I do not have that."
00:32:14,00:32:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:16,00:32:18,"Although actually in Venice, I went to this museum."
00:32:18,00:32:23,"So this Laco museum, they have an annex for erotic pottery."
00:32:23,00:32:24,Your pottery.
00:32:24,00:32:30,"There's also, if you can't get down to Lima,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,there's a really good article on Traveller.com
00:32:32,00:32:35,about that annex entitled Fifty Shades of Clay.
00:32:35,00:32:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:39,00:32:40,Superb.
00:32:40,00:32:44,"But in the museum, they're under different categories."
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Like Netflix, kind of."
00:32:45,00:32:50,"And there's the union of animals, fruits, and deities,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,sexual activity of the dead.
00:32:53,00:32:55,That's not in Netflix category.
00:32:55,00:32:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:57,00:33:00,I better have that special thing on your Netflix.
00:33:00,00:33:02,It doesn't let you watch those.
00:33:02,00:33:04,It costs between animals.
00:33:04,00:33:07,"That includes frogs, mice, dogs, llamas, monkeys,"
00:33:07,00:33:08,and ears of corn.
00:33:08,00:33:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:11,00:33:12,Wow.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"In that museum, they have a part of a man receiving oral sex"
00:33:15,00:33:17,"that they call in the museum, the Bill Clinton pot."
00:33:17,00:33:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:22,00:33:25,Is it-- they were such an advanced civilization
00:33:25,00:33:27,that bought trade.
00:33:27,00:33:28,Incredible.
00:33:28,00:33:29,They are.
00:33:29,00:33:30,"When these are referred to, they're always referred"
00:33:30,00:33:31,to as sex pots.
00:33:31,00:33:34,"And this is in, like, archaeological papers."
00:33:34,00:33:36,And they talk about the amount of sex pots.
00:33:36,00:33:38,And you can't take it seriously at all.
00:33:38,00:33:39,"Crass over, Crass over."
00:33:39,00:33:39,Oh my god.
00:33:39,00:33:41,"It's a Crass over, Crass over."
00:33:41,00:33:41,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:33:41,00:33:42,"What they can do, what they're going to do,"
00:33:42,00:33:43,how they're going to get it together?
00:33:43,00:33:45,Oh.
00:33:45,00:33:46,"Yeah, so the Mocce are--"
00:33:46,00:33:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:49,00:33:51,"OK, so where were we, guys?"
00:33:51,00:33:52,How about you would just tell us about--
00:33:52,00:33:55,"I don't know, James, it was three months ago."
00:33:55,00:33:57,You would tell us about sex pots.
00:33:57,00:33:59,"Ah, sex pots."
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Yes, but actually, I wanted to move on now"
00:34:01,00:34:03,to talk about knocking hats off.
00:34:03,00:34:03,Can we do that?
00:34:03,00:34:04,This is a fact about knocking hats off.
00:34:04,00:34:06,"That's right, yeah."
00:34:06,00:34:09,"So I was looking into the history of that,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,an easy thing to research.
00:34:11,00:34:13,"And I found out that 200 years ago, in the Ottoman Empire,"
00:34:13,00:34:15,"if you knocked off someone's turban,"
00:34:15,00:34:16,it was punishable by death.
00:34:16,00:34:17,Wow.
00:34:17,00:34:19,And I discovered this because I was reading an account
00:34:19,00:34:23,"in 1799 of a Christian who was taken to court,"
00:34:23,00:34:27,because they were accused of knocking off a Muslim's turban.
00:34:27,00:34:28,"And the Christian's explanation, which"
00:34:28,00:34:30,"seemed to be believed by the court,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"was that the Muslim had been wearing a blue turban, which"
00:34:32,00:34:35,looked exactly like the turban that his friend usually wore.
00:34:35,00:34:37,"So he said he'd knocked it off as a prank,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,because he thought it was his mate.
00:34:38,00:34:39,And then the guy had turned around and it wasn't.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"And in fact, he ended up getting off Scott free,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,and the judge ended up punishing the Muslim for wearing
00:34:44,00:34:47,a blue turban when he was supposed to be wearing a green one.
00:34:47,00:34:48,"Oh, no, that's cool."
00:34:48,00:34:50,"I got a couple of hat things, just very quickly."
00:34:50,00:34:52,"On George Orwell's 110th birthday,"
00:34:52,00:34:55,it was celebrated in a little Dutch town
00:34:55,00:34:59,by these artists putting little hats on every single CCTV
00:34:59,00:35:01,camera around there.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Apparently it's loaded.
00:35:02,00:35:03,"Well, just to make them look cute."
00:35:03,00:35:06,"Just to sort of show how his vision has come true, basically,"
00:35:06,00:35:07,from the book.
00:35:07,00:35:10,I don't remember the hats being in the book.
00:35:10,00:35:12,"It was the unedited, unabridged."
00:35:12,00:35:13,Yeah.
00:35:13,00:35:14,Party version.
00:35:14,00:35:16,It's those hats that you get on innocent smoothie bottles.
00:35:16,00:35:19,They came originally from 1984 CCTV.
00:35:19,00:35:21,It's very sweet.
00:35:21,00:35:22,Here's another one.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"Paul Petrol, the cartoon for kids."
00:35:24,00:35:25,Don't know if you guys know it.
00:35:25,00:35:26,No.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Massive cartoon.
00:35:27,00:35:28,It's ginormous.
00:35:28,00:35:29,"You're backing me up, right?"
00:35:29,00:35:31,It's ginormous.
00:35:31,00:35:31,They had to--
00:35:31,00:35:33,"Dad, who are you talking to?"
00:35:33,00:35:37,I was pretending a well-entered audience member was here.
00:35:37,00:35:38,"Am I right, guys?"
00:35:38,00:35:39,It's massive.
00:35:39,00:35:40,There we go.
00:35:40,00:35:42,"Shit, one came back with us."
00:35:42,00:35:44,"Yeah, Paul Petrol."
00:35:44,00:35:46,"They had to recall a firefighting hat that they had,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,because it turned out it was a fire hazard.
00:35:49,00:35:50,"Yeah, I'm reading."
00:35:50,00:35:51,"Yeah, so, yeah."
00:35:51,00:35:54,I need to record that.
00:35:54,00:35:56,"OK, is time for our final fact to the show."
00:35:56,00:35:58,And that's my fact.
00:35:58,00:36:03,"My fact, nine weeks ago, is that pseudonyms that Elton John"
00:36:03,00:36:06,has used when checking into a hotel include
00:36:06,00:36:11,"Sir Binky Poodleclip, Judas Fart, and the Marquis of Minge."
00:36:11,00:36:14,You did that last time.
00:36:14,00:36:15,It's Marquis.
00:36:15,00:36:15,It's Marquis.
00:36:15,00:36:18,"Marquis, because a Marquis is a big tent."
00:36:18,00:36:19,"Well, you have weddings and stuff."
00:36:19,00:36:23,"And a Marquis of Minge is a completely different thing, I think."
00:36:23,00:36:26,I seem to remember the audience who well-entered thought
00:36:26,00:36:28,"that was quite amusing, as well."
00:36:28,00:36:30,"I mean, I think was that an intentional attempt"
00:36:30,00:36:31,to recreate the atmosphere?
00:36:31,00:36:33,Or was you've forgotten the 10 minutes of ribbing
00:36:33,00:36:35,"that you got behind, actually?"
00:36:35,00:36:37,You think I've learned?
00:36:37,00:36:40,"Anyway, the tent of Minge, the Binky Poodleclip,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,"too, is not."
00:36:42,00:36:43,"Anyway, he does this when he goes to hotels."
00:36:43,00:36:45,"Obviously, a lot of people do that anyway."
00:36:45,00:36:48,Celebrities like to give themselves a pseudonym
00:36:48,00:36:51,so that the press can't find them and fans can't find them
00:36:51,00:36:51,when they're in town.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"He likes to pick these particularly dirty ones,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,because it actually affects the people
00:36:55,00:36:57,trying to get in touch with him that he knows.
00:36:57,00:37:00,"So, for example, he said that his mother keeps complaining"
00:37:00,00:37:02,"to him saying things like, ""I can't believe you've asked me"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"to ring and ask for a sehorus pussy."""
00:37:04,00:37:06,It's enough like that.
00:37:06,00:37:10,He's also gone for a Humphrey Handbag and Bobo Latrine.
00:37:10,00:37:12,"Yeah, I'm Brian Bigbum."
00:37:12,00:37:14,Nice.
00:37:14,00:37:15,You say they're so dirty.
00:37:15,00:37:18,"They're like an eight-year-old version of dirty, aren't they?"
00:37:18,00:37:19,"Actually, what I quite like, as well,"
00:37:19,00:37:22,"is that his name itself is a pseudonym, anyway."
00:37:22,00:37:22,Yeah.
00:37:22,00:37:24,He could probably go back to his original name.
00:37:24,00:37:25,What are they old Dwight?
00:37:25,00:37:28,"Regional Dwight, and he has a middle name."
00:37:28,00:37:29,"Yes, is it Hercules?"
00:37:29,00:37:30,"That's right, yeah."
00:37:30,00:37:33,"Have you thought Elton John and Regional Dwight,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,they're all first names.
00:37:35,00:37:37,"So, both of his names are those weird names"
00:37:37,00:37:38,where two people have the first name.
00:37:38,00:37:39,Yeah.
00:37:39,00:37:40,"Yeah, you're right."
00:37:40,00:37:42,Like Steve Martin or David Cameron.
00:37:42,00:37:44,But we can't go on doing this all day.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"It's really, it's a fun game to play at home"
00:37:46,00:37:48,is to think of people who've got two first names.
00:37:48,00:37:49,"But actually, of all those names,"
00:37:49,00:37:52,I would say Elton is the least first name of all of them.
00:37:52,00:37:53,And he's chosen that as his first name.
00:37:53,00:37:54,That's true.
00:37:54,00:37:55,"Yeah, you're right."
00:37:55,00:37:56,Ben Elton.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Ben Elton.
00:37:57,00:37:58,"Yeah, Ben Elton."
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Oh, god."
00:37:59,00:38:01,"Honestly, I've got a list of about 30,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,which I compiled a few years ago.
00:38:03,00:38:05,I remember us all compiling them together.
00:38:05,00:38:06,I like that you've turned this into it
00:38:06,00:38:08,being your solo project.
00:38:08,00:38:10,Is that how you all remember the broadcasts?
00:38:10,00:38:12,(laughing)
00:38:12,00:38:14,"Just to quickly say, Hercules is the middle name"
00:38:14,00:38:15,"of his pseudonym, Elton John."
00:38:15,00:38:16,That's right.
00:38:16,00:38:17,It's not his real name.
00:38:17,00:38:20,I heard that he named it after the horse
00:38:20,00:38:23,in that old sitcom Steps on Sun.
00:38:23,00:38:24,But I don't know if that's true.
00:38:24,00:38:26,"Oh, I really don't know if that's true."
00:38:26,00:38:28,"The middle name, Hercules."
00:38:28,00:38:29,Yeah.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Yeah.
00:38:30,00:38:30,It wasn't the horse's middle name.
00:38:30,00:38:31,There was it.
00:38:31,00:38:33,It was the horse's first and only name.
00:38:33,00:38:34,He only had one name.
00:38:34,00:38:36,It was like Madonna in that respect.
00:38:36,00:38:37,"Well, it might not have been."
00:38:37,00:38:38,You just never know a horse's surname
00:38:38,00:38:40,because they get very little post.
00:38:40,00:38:41,(laughing)
00:38:41,00:38:42,Very good point.
00:38:42,00:38:43,Yeah.
00:38:43,00:38:45,"On musical pseudonyms,"
00:38:45,00:38:47,Elton John recorded a version of Lucy
00:38:47,00:38:49,in the Sky with Diamonds in 1973
00:38:49,00:38:51,and John Lennon played on it.
00:38:51,00:38:52,"But lots of the Beatles,"
00:38:52,00:38:53,"when they're recording other things,"
00:38:53,00:38:54,they use pseudonyms.
00:38:54,00:38:58,And John Lennon's was Winston O Boogey.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Nice.
00:38:59,00:38:59,Yeah.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"Winston, of course, being his middle name,"
00:39:01,00:39:02,John Lennon's middle name.
00:39:02,00:39:03,Ah!
00:39:03,00:39:05,"And O Boogey being his mother's maiden name, I think."
00:39:05,00:39:06,Yes.
00:39:06,00:39:08,I always hate doing Beatles facts with Dan here
00:39:08,00:39:10,'cause he has to pretend to be excited to learn it.
00:39:10,00:39:12,But you know that he knows all of them.
00:39:12,00:39:14,I have a test for Dan.
00:39:14,00:39:15,Go on.
00:39:15,00:39:16,A Beatles test.
00:39:16,00:39:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:16,00:39:17,"So John Lennon and Paul McCartney,"
00:39:17,00:39:20,they only played one gig together as a double act.
00:39:20,00:39:22,It was in 1960 at a pub in Caversham.
00:39:22,00:39:24,What were they called?
00:39:24,00:39:27,"Er, well, I can't remember."
00:39:27,00:39:28,They were called the Nirk twins.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"Yeah, that's right."
00:39:29,00:39:30,(laughing)
00:39:30,00:39:31,"Oh, you should have given him more time."
00:39:31,00:39:32,Yeah.
00:39:32,00:39:33,You should have given up so many times.
00:39:33,00:39:35,(laughing)
00:39:35,00:39:37,"There were only three people drinking in the pub,"
00:39:37,00:39:38,and nobody knew who they were anyway.
00:39:38,00:39:41,It's so easy for you to just say the Nirk twins now.
00:39:41,00:39:42,The Nirk twins?
00:39:42,00:39:43,That's right.
00:39:43,00:39:44,Yes.
00:39:44,00:39:46,(laughing)
00:39:46,00:39:48,Someone else who chooses funny names
00:39:48,00:39:51,"in order to embarrass people is Kate Beckinsale,"
00:39:51,00:39:54,who says that she chooses the name Segoni Beaver
00:39:54,00:39:55,"when she books into hotels,"
00:39:55,00:39:57,"because she really likes, well, first of all,"
00:39:57,00:39:59,"'cause she really admires Segoni Weaver,"
00:39:59,00:40:00,"and there's no way of saying that,"
00:40:00,00:40:02,which actually seems like not a way to admire someone.
00:40:02,00:40:03,(laughing)
00:40:03,00:40:04,And also because she says her husband hates it
00:40:04,00:40:06,when hotel employees call him Mr. Beaver.
00:40:06,00:40:08,(laughing)
00:40:08,00:40:09,Which you can understand.
00:40:09,00:40:11,I don't believe her isn't the first name
00:40:11,00:40:12,if you're thinking about that.
00:40:12,00:40:13,"No, no."
00:40:13,00:40:14,(laughing)
00:40:14,00:40:16,"I get confused by this checking into hotels thing,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,'cause I think they just ask you for a passport
00:40:18,00:40:19,"when you check into a hotel,"
00:40:19,00:40:21,"and no one, I don't think Kate Beckinsale"
00:40:21,00:40:22,has had a passport made up.
00:40:22,00:40:23,Exactly.
00:40:23,00:40:24,Or it's a labor affair.
00:40:24,00:40:26,"You have to give a credit card or something, don't you?"
00:40:26,00:40:26,Exactly.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"Except Elton John, when he does get to these hotels,"
00:40:28,00:40:30,"he sends his pseudonym ahead,"
00:40:30,00:40:33,and they used to make up office stationery for him
00:40:33,00:40:34,when he arrived in the room.
00:40:34,00:40:35,"It would have his pseudonym on it,"
00:40:35,00:40:37,"headed paper, and so on."
00:40:37,00:40:39,"Which is quite cool, so, you know."
00:40:39,00:40:40,Yeah.
00:40:40,00:40:41,"I think you have to be famous, don't you?"
00:40:41,00:40:43,"So I think our personal experience, I suppose,"
00:40:43,00:40:45,"is them just looking at your passport or credit card,"
00:40:45,00:40:48,"but maybe if you're Elton John or John Lennon,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"they make some, you know, allowances."
00:40:50,00:40:52,We've got a marquee coming to the hotel.
00:40:52,00:40:53,(laughing)
00:40:53,00:40:54,Better give it a big room.
00:40:54,00:40:56,(laughing)
00:40:56,00:40:58,So I'm confused talking of passports.
00:40:58,00:41:01,"People seem to book flights under pseudonyms a lot,"
00:41:01,00:41:02,or they claim that they do.
00:41:02,00:41:04,So Marinin Monroe apparently book flights
00:41:04,00:41:06,under the name Zelda Zonk.
00:41:06,00:41:07,"Again, not a thing you can actually do"
00:41:07,00:41:09,when you're booking a flight in my experience.
00:41:09,00:41:10,You could in the '50s or '60s.
00:41:10,00:41:12,Johnny Depp says he does it.
00:41:12,00:41:15,Johnny Depp claims that he's always giving himself pseudonyms
00:41:15,00:41:16,and he books loads of tickets in that name.
00:41:16,00:41:18,"I reckon he must take private jets, right?"
00:41:18,00:41:19,Yeah.
00:41:19,00:41:20,Poor him.
00:41:20,00:41:22,"Johnny Depp at the moment, he's like, basically,"
00:41:22,00:41:24,"he spends all his money on ridiculous things, doesn't he?"
00:41:24,00:41:25,Yeah.
00:41:25,00:41:29,"Yeah, like he shuts Hunter S. Thompson's ashes into space"
00:41:29,00:41:30,and stuff like that.
00:41:30,00:41:31,Yeah.
00:41:31,00:41:33,So I reckon he's a private jet guy.
00:41:33,00:41:33,Yeah.
00:41:33,00:41:35,"But also, actually, Elton John has been in trouble"
00:41:35,00:41:37,"for spending too much money, hasn't he?"
00:41:37,00:41:37,Has he?
00:41:37,00:41:42,He was suing someone for not looking after his expenses properly.
00:41:42,00:41:45,"And in that court case, they said that he spent"
00:41:45,00:41:48,"£40 million over a 20-month period,"
00:41:48,00:41:52,"including £293,000 on flowers."
00:41:52,00:41:53,Wow.
00:41:53,00:41:54,"That's a lot of flowers, isn't it?"
00:41:54,00:41:56,"And they asked him in court, they said,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,do you have any reason to think that these figures
00:41:58,00:41:58,are inaccurate?
00:41:58,00:42:00,"And Elton John said, probably not."
00:42:00,00:42:05,"And he said, really, £293,000 on flowers alone,"
00:42:05,00:42:06,is that even possible?
00:42:06,00:42:10,"And Elton John said, yes, I like flowers."
00:42:10,00:42:11,Fair enough.
00:42:11,00:42:12,He knows his own mind.
00:42:12,00:42:14,Check-off used to write under pseudonyms
00:42:14,00:42:15,when he submitted short stories.
00:42:15,00:42:16,And he had really good ones.
00:42:16,00:42:18,So he submitted stories to magazines with names
00:42:18,00:42:21,"that included man without a spleen, which"
00:42:21,00:42:22,was his most common.
00:42:22,00:42:25,So he wrote 119 short stories under the name
00:42:25,00:42:26,man without a spleen.
00:42:26,00:42:28,He also was doctor without patients.
00:42:28,00:42:31,"And my brother's brother, for no particular reason."
00:42:31,00:42:32,"He was a doctor, wasn't he?"
00:42:32,00:42:34,"He was a doctor, yeah, yeah."
00:42:34,00:42:35,I wonder if he took his own spleen out
00:42:35,00:42:37,to make him run faster.
00:42:37,00:42:38,"Because that's the thing, isn't it?"
00:42:38,00:42:39,"If you take your spleen out, you run faster."
00:42:39,00:42:41,"It's not a common thing, is it?"
00:42:41,00:42:42,No.
00:42:42,00:42:43,But it is a fact that James had been trying
00:42:43,00:42:45,to get into the podcast for the last six months.
00:42:45,00:42:47,I could go set it.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"I'd go, sure."
00:42:48,00:42:50,I think you crowbar it in this fact as well.
00:42:50,00:42:53,I'm a Wellington.
00:42:53,00:42:56,"I've a fact I didn't say in the Wellington show, actually."
00:42:56,00:42:58,This is about musical student names and musical doubles.
00:42:58,00:42:59,So have you heard of the band The Zombies?
00:42:59,00:43:03,"They're big six T's, and they're not really big anymore."
00:43:03,00:43:04,But they only became famous two years
00:43:04,00:43:06,after they broke up.
00:43:06,00:43:07,"So that was probably-- yeah, the song was"
00:43:07,00:43:09,"""Time of the Season"" that went really big for them."
00:43:09,00:43:12,"But they didn't know they were famous in the USA,"
00:43:12,00:43:13,because they were a British band.
00:43:13,00:43:14,And communications were much worse then.
00:43:14,00:43:16,So there was a band from Dallas who just pretended
00:43:16,00:43:19,to be The Zombies and went on tour as The Zombies.
00:43:19,00:43:21,Very successfully.
00:43:21,00:43:24,"And then, bizarrely, in 1969, there were two separate bands"
00:43:24,00:43:26,touring America as The Zombies being managed
00:43:26,00:43:29,by a proper record label and everything.
00:43:29,00:43:30,Are the fake zombies that had a training period?
00:43:30,00:43:32,Do you think that the fake zombies bit the other guys
00:43:32,00:43:34,that they became fake zombies?
00:43:34,00:43:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:36,00:43:37,That's amazing.
00:43:37,00:43:38,I know.
00:43:38,00:43:40,Nobody notices that the lead singer was the wrong sex.
00:43:40,00:43:42,I've just completed different sex
00:43:42,00:43:43,from the actual zombies that came.
00:43:43,00:43:46,"Actually, British zombies ever got to America are."
00:43:46,00:43:47,I don't know.
00:43:47,00:43:48,I don't know.
00:43:48,00:43:49,Amazing.
00:43:49,00:43:50,"Yeah, bizarre."
00:43:50,00:43:54,Do you know the person who's acted in more plays than anyone else?
00:43:54,00:43:56,And this is related to pseudonyms?
00:43:56,00:43:58,Is it Garrick?
00:43:58,00:43:59,No.
00:43:59,00:44:00,Is it someone who's got a lot of pseudonyms?
00:44:00,00:44:03,"It's actually a pseudonym, not a person."
00:44:03,00:44:04,Oh.
00:44:04,00:44:07,"Is it, like, Alan Smithy or something like that?"
00:44:07,00:44:08,It's George Spellvin.
00:44:08,00:44:12,"So this is a name that's a credit that's been going on since 1886,"
00:44:12,00:44:13,"which is that if you're in a play,"
00:44:13,00:44:15,"if you're doing a performance that A, your turn"
00:44:15,00:44:17,"bar has to be credited for, because it doesn't suit"
00:44:17,00:44:20,"your reputation, or sometimes if you're playing two roles"
00:44:20,00:44:21,"in the same play and in the program,"
00:44:21,00:44:24,you don't want to give away that you're that person as well.
00:44:24,00:44:26,You call yourself George Spellvin.
00:44:26,00:44:28,And it's been happening since 1882.
00:44:28,00:44:31,And there are various different ones in different countries.
00:44:31,00:44:35,So it's George Eau Spellvin in an Italian play.
00:44:35,00:44:37,It's George Et or Georgina when it's French.
00:44:37,00:44:38,And yeah.
00:44:38,00:44:39,It's brilliant.
00:44:39,00:44:40,"The last one, the last case actually,"
00:44:40,00:44:44,"was in 1988 in Edwin Druid, the Dictatory character,"
00:44:44,00:44:46,"which we talked about, that musical--"
00:44:46,00:44:47,the Edwin Druid musical.
00:44:47,00:44:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:48,00:44:49,"Oh, cool."
00:44:49,00:44:50,"That's so weird, because the Alan Smithy thing"
00:44:50,00:44:52,goes on post-production.
00:44:52,00:44:55,"So just to explain, that is the same thing, but with movies, right?"
00:44:55,00:44:55,Exactly.
00:44:55,00:44:57,And it usually is for screenwriters.
00:44:57,00:44:59,When a screenwriter hates the fact
00:44:59,00:45:01,"that it's been rewritten so much, they want their name off it."
00:45:01,00:45:03,And Alan Smithy is in its place.
00:45:03,00:45:05,"But again, that's post-production usually,"
00:45:05,00:45:08,whereas this sounds like you're in the moment
00:45:08,00:45:09,embarrassed of the thing that you're in.
00:45:09,00:45:11,"And all the rest of the cast are going, oh, really?"
00:45:11,00:45:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:13,00:45:15,"Actually, we'll never mind."
00:45:15,00:45:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:19,00:45:21,"You have to finish that, though."
00:45:21,00:45:22,"I don't know, I don't know."
00:45:22,00:45:23,It's going to be-- it's going to be your atters.
00:45:23,00:45:24,Yeah.
00:45:24,00:45:25,"Yeah, yeah, sorry."
00:45:25,00:45:26,That's what you're going for.
00:45:26,00:45:27,I'm not parting the ass.
00:45:27,00:45:28,Yeah.
00:45:28,00:45:30,Which nationality will he go for?
00:45:30,00:45:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:34,00:45:38,"So things in hotels, like what you can ask for."
00:45:38,00:45:39,Yeah.
00:45:39,00:45:41,I saw a website where they asked a lot of people who worked
00:45:41,00:45:41,in hotels.
00:45:41,00:45:46,And there was someone in Seattle who had someone who came
00:45:46,00:45:48,to the hotel who asked for a pillow fort.
00:45:48,00:45:50,"And apparently, this happens quite a lot."
00:45:50,00:45:52,"But these guys, as well as a pillow fort,"
00:45:52,00:45:55,they wanted a towel folded in the shape of an elephant.
00:45:55,00:45:58,"And if possible, a sexy picture of some fruit on the night"
00:45:58,00:45:59,table.
00:45:59,00:46:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:46:00,00:46:02,And did I tell them to do it?
00:46:02,00:46:03,They sure did.
00:46:03,00:46:04,Wow.
00:46:04,00:46:05,How did they make the fruit sexy?
00:46:05,00:46:08,Was it carving or was it positioning?
00:46:08,00:46:10,I think it's just a banana and two plums.
00:46:10,00:46:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:46:14,00:46:15,I don't know.
00:46:15,00:46:17,They didn't say what it was.
00:46:17,00:46:17,It's a shame.
00:46:17,00:46:21,So much opportunity to be creative there.
00:46:21,00:46:22,Just on names.
00:46:22,00:46:24,There's a guy who's written a dictionary of surnames.
00:46:24,00:46:27,"I think a couple of years ago, he's called Patrick Hanks."
00:46:27,00:46:29,And he looked into the most likely meanings for surnames.
00:46:29,00:46:33,And do you know what Shakespeare probably meant?
00:46:33,00:46:36,"So just light, literally, shaking a spear?"
00:46:36,00:46:38,"Yes, you're going to get there."
00:46:38,00:46:41,Is someone in a battle?
00:46:41,00:46:42,You've gone the wrong direction.
00:46:42,00:46:45,It was a medieval term for masturbator.
00:46:45,00:46:46,"Oh, I was so far away."
00:46:46,00:46:47,Shaking a spear.
00:46:47,00:46:49,I felt like you'd picked the right direction
00:46:49,00:46:50,for once you went highbrow.
00:46:50,00:46:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:46:52,00:46:53,"Who would have thought, wow, is that right?"
00:46:53,00:46:54,Is that right?
00:46:54,00:46:57,"Yeah, probably from an obscene medieval term for masturbator."
00:46:57,00:47:02,So was it still known that meaning when Shakespeare
00:47:02,00:47:03,was writing his place?
00:47:03,00:47:04,He's not clear.
00:47:04,00:47:05,"But it could well be that, yeah, you'd"
00:47:05,00:47:08,go and see Romeo and Juliet by the great masturbator.
00:47:08,00:47:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:47:09,00:47:10,He would have worked it out.
00:47:10,00:47:12,He was a great linguist.
00:47:12,00:47:13,He would have worked it out.
00:47:13,00:47:15,Because he was always doing little double entendres
00:47:15,00:47:16,"and stuff, wasn't it?"
00:47:16,00:47:17,That's true.
00:47:17,00:47:18,He was.
00:47:18,00:47:20,There were some very rude ones.
00:47:20,00:47:22,I won't repeat them now.
00:47:22,00:47:25,"But does that mean one of his great, great, great, great grand"
00:47:25,00:47:27,fathers was a masturbator?
00:47:27,00:47:28,Is that what we're saying?
00:47:28,00:47:29,"Yeah, for it as a job, I guess."
00:47:29,00:47:30,Yeah.
00:47:30,00:47:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:47:34,00:47:35,Smith is blacksmith.
00:47:35,00:47:39,"Masturbators, masturbators."
00:47:39,00:47:43,"The medievalized street for the smitty bakery,"
00:47:43,00:47:44,the masturbatorium.
00:47:44,00:47:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:47:46,00:47:47,It's very sad.
00:47:47,00:47:51,We used to have three masturbatorians on this street.
00:47:51,00:47:53,They will become charity masturbatorians now.
00:47:53,00:47:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:47:55,00:48:01,"OK, that's it."
00:48:01,00:48:02,That is all of our facts.
