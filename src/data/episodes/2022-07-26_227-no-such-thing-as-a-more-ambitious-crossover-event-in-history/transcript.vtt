WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.480
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.620
 Before we get going, we just wanna let you know

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.120
 that this is a particularly interesting episode.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.560
 It's what we like to call a crossover episode.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.680
 You may be aware of crossover movies,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.440
 take the latest Avengers movie

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.640
 where they had Guardians of the Galaxy involved.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.040
 We've decided to do a crossover episode with ourselves.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.000
 It's very ambitious, but I think we've managed it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 - We screwed up, didn't we, Dan?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.960
 - We did, we screwed up.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.720
 We were in Wellington, we were on stage,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.440
 Wellington is in New Zealand,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.160
 and we were recording a show as part of our tour,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.800
 and we've only just found out that the final two facts

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.080
 are missing, the recording is gone.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.120
 - Or the final one and a half facts, I think,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.560
 and you'll notice, I believe.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.880
 - Yeah, so what it'll sound like

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.840
 is that all of our jokes are falling really, really flat.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.280
 (laughing)

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.760
 - How will listeners tell the difference?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.480
 (laughing)

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.000
 - Okay, so listen carefully,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.440
 'cause you might actually miss it.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.320
 We'll do our best to make sure it's flagged up,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.680
 but if we've done our job well, you won't notice.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 - Okay, on with the show.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.640
 (bell rings)

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.640
 - Do you know what it is?

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.640
 - Who the fuck is this?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 (bell rings)

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 - Who the fuck is that?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 (bell rings)

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 Do you know what it is?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.080
 (upbeat music)

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.920
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish", a weekly podcast.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.760
 This week, coming to you from Wellington!

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 (audience cheering)

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.960
 - My name is Dan Schreiber,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.480
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.880
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.520
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.640
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.400
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.040
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Chazinski.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.240
 - My fact is that if a lamb starts being born

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.360
 the wrong way up, the farmer pushes it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.440
 right back up into the womb and gets it to start again.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.160
 (audience laughing)

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.280
 And I thought I'd do a fact about sheep, because we're here.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.080
 (audience laughing)

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.760
 - Wow, that is a risky start, Anna.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.480
 - See, not everyone in the room is a sheep farmer.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.920
 (audience laughing)

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.840
 But on the size of love, about half of the mile.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.680
 - Yeah, but.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.120
 - So yeah, I think I first came across as a New Yorker piece

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.560
 that was an interview with a guy called James Rebanks,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.840
 who's a sheep farmer in Cumbria in the UK.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.320
 And he was saying, yeah, most lambs,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.600
 if they're being born well, they come out like a diver.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.240
 So it's like head and front legs first.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.480
 But if the legs and the head come out in the wrong order,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.920
 at all, you literally have to shove it right back up there

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.520
 and rearrange them in order that they come out

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.440
 the right way.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.040
 And so he gave various instances of ways

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.880
 that it could go wrong.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.160
 So if the legs come out without a head,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.680
 then you have to go, that means the head.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.840
 That doesn't mean it's left the head right behind

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.240
 in the uterus.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.440
 It just means the head's a bit bent.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.520
 So you've got to return it and rearrange it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.160
 And when you do rearrange it, they have

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.920
 to cup the mouth of the lamb so that the lamb's teeth don't tear

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.600
 at the birthing canal in the uterus.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 Crikey.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.960
 It's a combination of extremely sweet and extremely

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.920
 disgusting.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.720
 I'm yet to hear the sweet part.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.920
 He's helping the little lamb get out intact.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.640
 OK, where do you put it like that?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.160
 What does the sheep think as the baby's birthing

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.720
 is suddenly pushed back in like that?

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080
 That's got to be the weirdest experience ever.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.760
 We don't have any records on what they think.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.560
 But they must be concerned, right?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.440
 I read a thing that sheep have an incredible peripheral vision.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.840
 They've not that incredible that they can see up there.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.520
 But they think they can go almost to 360.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.520
 They've almost got 360 views, which are nice.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.760
 It's almost impossible to sneak up on them.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.160
 Yeah.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.120
 There's piece of a lot of experience, doesn't it?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.360
 Almost, but not quite.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.400
 But they must as it's being shoved back in.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.880
 They must have us put in like, what are you doing?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.120
 You can see you.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.320
 They're very dappy.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.720
 I mean, genuinely, they are quite--

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.760
 I think they're quite crap mothers, at least at the start.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.840
 So I read so many farming blogs and turns out

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.520
 you are very bad at knowing which ones are their babies.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.360
 And the babies are very bad at knowing which ones are their mothers.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.480
 And they're constantly getting confused about this

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.240
 and going off with the wrong parent.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.800
 And so a lamb will accidentally pick the wrong parent

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680
 that won't be able to produce milk and so it'll starve.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.320
 And there's this weird thing where farmers,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.000
 sometimes, a lamb will be born and be an orphan,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.680
 so that you might die in childbirth.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.360
 And it's an amazing thing that farmers do to trick

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.640
 use into believing that another lamb is their lamb.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.200
 And what they do is there'll be a you that's pregnant

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.360
 with one lamb.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.680
 And it gives birth to it.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.800
 And the farmer then he's to trick the you

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.880
 into thinking it's about to have twins.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.600
 And so what he does, prepare yourselves,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.880
 is, first of all, he covers the orphan lamb

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.360
 in the birthing fluid so that it smells right from the other one.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.720
 And he ties its legs together because often that lamb's

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.920
 day old or so, and they can run away.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.400
 And if you're just given birth or something,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.600
 it's very unusual for it to immediately go

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.440
 gallopanting over the fields.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.840
 And then what he does is he sort of puts inserts his hand

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.240
 into the you and pretends that his hand is the second lamb

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.440
 that's being born.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.800
 And then you will be convinced that she's having contractions

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.840
 and think that she's giving birth and you keep it in there.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.640
 And then you whip it out.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.080
 And then you quickly do the magic trick of quickly

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.040
 shoving the orphan lamb under the used nose.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.640
 And then things, oh, that must be what just came out of me.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.840
 I've got effects about lambing sound effects.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.880
 So this is from the long running radio four

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.440
 show the archers.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.520
 They have a style guide on how to do the sound effect

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.840
 of a lamb being born.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840
 Wow.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.720
 So you have to overlay agitated barring.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.160
 That's very important.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.040
 So there's barring going on and it sounds stressed.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.480
 And then you put a soaking wet towel on your shoulder.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480
 It's really heavy.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.440
 And then you squeeze a huge amount of yogurt

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.160
 through your gloved hands.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.840
 And then you drop the wet towel onto a bed

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.440
 of old recording tape.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.320
 Wow.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.920
 Why don't they just use the recording

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.080
 of an actual lamb being born?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.880
 Often they don't sound right, do they?

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.240
 When you do the actual thing, it

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.600
 doesn't sound like what you would expect.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.400
 It might happen that if you recorded that,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.680
 it would just sound like an old towel being dropped off

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.400
 of some yogurt as if it's trained.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.680
 I thought I would find out what farmers did.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.920
 But I forgot to look on the blogs.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.720
 I went on to Reddit.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.680
 And there was an AMA with a sheep farmer.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.840
 And one of the top questions was,

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.240
 why do they have such shitty asses?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 The farmers are the sheep.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.000
 They were speaking about the sheep.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.480
 The guy said, this is true.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.920
 As though they have zero control or awareness

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.840
 of what comes out.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.520
 And they actually sell jackets to go over the sheep

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.600
 to protect the wool from getting dirty for those

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.680
 who want super clean wool.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.280
 So you get some sheep who are wearing like an all-in-one

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.440
 onesie with a little hole.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.760
 And it keeps them clean.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.520
 And will that be made of a previous sheep?

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.960
 Well, there is one thing that they do.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.760
 Again, if they want a you to adopt an orphan sheep,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.880
 they will shave the wool off one of its real offspring

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.600
 and then put it on the other one as a disguise.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.840
 So they literally wear the other lambs clothes.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.480
 So it's like a sheep in sheep's clothing.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.720
 It's a lamin lambs clothing.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.360
 But yeah, I think everyone gets the idea.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.200
 It's a great clever.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.600
 Did you know that sheep have their own weather forecast?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.120
 What?

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.560
 In the UK, sheep have their own weather forecast.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.240
 No, they don't.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.760
 They do.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760
 It's just been launched.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760
 It's in Bristol.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.480
 And it's a traffic light system of warnings, which

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.200
 measures whether-- and it works out the risk of-- there's

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.520
 a very particular parasite they get called pneumatodirus.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.960
 And if you are a pneumatodirus, and I've

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.400
 pronounced it wrong, please don't write in.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.840
 But it's very useful.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.080
 The only problem with it is that they

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.280
 have not called it the sheeping forecast.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.080
 Guys?

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.080
 Thank you, growing there.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.920
 When you met a supportive hearty chuckle.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.960
 So it's a forecast not of weather, but of parasites?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.280
 Yes.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.000
 Well, it's weather, which tells you when the parasites are

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.040
 going to be coming in.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.800
 Wow.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.000
 And it tells the humans not the sheep.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.680
 It's really a focus of farmers, isn't it?

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.520
 Or do the sheep gather around 5 p.m. every Monday, actually?

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.040
 There'll be a lot of parasites out there tonight.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.640
 Look, lively, stay sharp.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.120
 That's-- I was reading a medical report about--

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.240
 it just gives you virus.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.760
 It talks about viruses and parasites and so on, that come up.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.600
 And these people who are reading it

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.000
 noticed a very odd entry in it, which

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.680
 is that a few people who were farmers who

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.840
 were involved in castrating lambs when they were born

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.520
 got very ill very quickly.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.400
 And it was 12 people who got ill.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.600
 But they worked out that two of them got ill

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.560
 because they were castrating with an old method that still

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.800
 goes on these days, not completely,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.040
 but in the 1800s all the time.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.880
 They castrate using their teeth.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.960
 So these are humans who go and two of these guys

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.840
 were castrating these lambs with their teeth.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.960
 And they got very ill.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.640
 One of my best friends has done that in Australia.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.760
 - Really? - In Western Australia.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.840
 - Yep. - Did they get ill?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.920
 He's-- well, he's pretty insane, but he's not sick.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.440
 Oh, OK.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.080
 I think he is sick, yeah.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.520
 And they go by on a conveyor belt, right?

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.840
 And you lie underneath them, and he just

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.600
 weaponize one by one.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.200
 What?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.360
 Well, you come up like jaws, but you just go bite off the balls.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.400
 It's your friend, Australian.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.720
 He lived in Australia for a year.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.680
 Well, he was British.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.200
 Yeah.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.120
 Feels like they kind of saw him coming down there.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.440
 Yeah, we all do this, mate.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.760
 This guy looks like I'll bite the balls off anything.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.680
 Do you know how farmers can tell when she perv made it?

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.400
 This is an interesting thing.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.080
 Well, they wait nine months.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.000
 Yeah.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.840
 So what they do-- well, in a lot of farms, what they do is

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.480
 they draw on the males with crayon.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480
 OK?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.280
 And then, if they come back later--

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.960
 so they draw on the underside of the males with crayon.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.360
 And if they come back later, because you

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.760
 can't be watching the sheep all the time, it's--

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.880
 Oh.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.880
 It might be chalk here, but in some places,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.920
 and in the sources I found, it was crayon.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.600
 Anyway, if they come back later and the females got crayon,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 or chalk?

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.240
 On her back, then they know that mating has occurred.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.640
 But you wouldn't think that crayon would work, right?

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.880
 Yeah, you'd--

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.080
 It too harking.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.400
 Hey, another weird thing that happens to female pregnant--

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.840
 sorry, sheep-- is that they get really heavy with the weight

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.920
 and their wool gets really heavy.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.680
 So sometimes they lose balance, and they tip over.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.000
 And they fall on their back, like a turtle,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.320
 and they can't get back up.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.120
 So they get stuck.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.320
 So farmers have to go and bring pregnant sheep back onto their feet.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.360
 Otherwise, they've just stuck their upside down.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.200
 Wow, really?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.720
 Yeah.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.400
 Sheep spinning.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.640
 They are stupid, aren't they?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.040
 They are.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.920
 Someone sent me a text in the break.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.680
 And I can't remember who it is, and I've turned my phone off,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.680
 sorry, but they said that when it snows,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.440
 the sheep can't believe that the grass is underneath the snow.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.920
 They think it's just disappeared.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.520
 And so they'll just starve to death if you don't kind of clear

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.600
 them a little clearing.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.200
 Is it another one of those magic tricks

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.120
 they think have happened, like the swapping of the land?

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.880
 And apparently, like cows and cattle, they all clear it away.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.480
 But sheep are just stupid.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.240
 They sometimes-- so they have to groom their lambs when they give birth to them.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.400
 And sometimes they get so carried away with grooming that they bite their tails off.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.720
 Wait, sorry.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.800
 The mother.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.040
 I thought you meant this was your friend biting.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.960
 I think your friend just really likes lamb.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.560
 But yeah, the mothers, they've got to lick off all the afterbirth and stuff,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.680
 but they get really excited, and they'll bite the umbilical cord,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.840
 and they'll just bite the tail off.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.360
 And the farmers don't know what to do because you're not supposed to get involved,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.920
 because otherwise, that might separate the mother from the lamb.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.800
 And so they just have to watch, sort of going, no, stop it.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.760
 Stop biting them tail of your child.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.280
 Oh, my God.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.200
 Guys, we're going to have to move on shortly to our next fact.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.800
 Just one last thing, Mary had a little lamb.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.040
 The nursery rhyme is based on a true story.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360
 You know that?

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.360
 Yeah.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.160
 Well, there's nothing supernatural in there already.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160
 Yeah.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.520
 It's just about someone called Mary who had a little lamb.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.880
 It's a quite believable--

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.400
 And the sheep followed her wherever she-- it's a good herder.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.600
 She's-- yeah, it's a very-- what's your point, Andy?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.720
 Was she famous?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.720
 Was she a famous Mary?

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.520
 She was not.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.640
 She was a woman called Mary Sawyer.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.520
 It was a Massachusetts in 1830.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.480
 She had a lamb, and it followed her all over the place, and then a friend.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.000
 Interesting.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.960
 No, no, no, the interesting thing thing was,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.280
 it's fleece was as white as snow, and then--

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.480
 So when I've disappeared, where am I?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.280
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.800
 My fact is that the Netflix category,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.640
 Gory Canadian Revenge Movies, only has one film in it.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.160
 Wow, on what's the film, Deena?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.840
 I don't.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.760
 I'm going to rip it down.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.280
 Sauce.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.960
 Your research today has been very lax,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.400
 because it's of reciting nursery rhymes and having a fun fact.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.520
 So what the thing that happens is there

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.600
 are these microcategories on Netflix.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.760
 And if you have a Netflix account, you might have seen them.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:36.080
 So goofy werewolf comedies is one, or sentimental movies

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.240
 about horses for ages 11 to 12.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.280
 And some of them-- this is the bizarre thing.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.960
 Netflix has made 76,897 unique categories,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.720
 according to the last count done.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.920
 And some of them have nothing in them.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.560
 So that feel good romantic Spanish language TV show.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.520
 Netflix has none, but they've created the category,

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.920
 because some will exist.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.760
 Wow.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.720
 So for instance, skiing, nonfiction, none of those.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.320
 Iranian comedies, none of those.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.600
 So we're just waiting to discover them.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.400
 I guess so.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.760
 It's like when they knew India existed and they tried to find it.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.920
 If you pitch a show to Netflix to make,

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.760
 they'll probably be like, well, it's a shit idea,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.320
 but we need one of those.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.880
 You've got the money.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.320
 They actually-- there was a role that was advertised in the UK

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.800
 for someone specifically to create these kind of categories.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.440
 So the idea was they advertised for someone

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.920
 who would basically binge watch Netflix.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.720
 They would just sit and watch movie after movie.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.800
 And while they were watching, they

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.840
 would think of unique different tags

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.480
 that they could give to each of those movies

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.480
 to create these kind of categories.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.560
 But the other thing is, they have professional watches.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.840
 So this is-- this fact is from a piece in The Atlantic, which

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.040
 was fantastic.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.160
 It was a journalist who ran a script to download all 76,000.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.760
 The guys who professionally watch Netflix,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.280
 they tag movies with all kinds of data.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.440
 So it's not just how rude the plot is or whether there's violence.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.560
 They tag how conclusive the plot is.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.720
 They tag how moral the characters are.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.840
 And they just analyze everything.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.480
 And all they want is to get you to watch more Netflix.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.200
 So one of them said, you might like what I consider

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.560
 to be horrible movies.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.240
 But my job right now is to get you to watch all those horrible

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.760
 movies that you want.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.840
 And they have thousands of categories designed specifically

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.360
 for that.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.480
 Who's specifically looking for things like this?

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.320
 That's what's so weird.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.080
 Who wants a thing that's 80% conclusive

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.640
 with moderately moral characters?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.920
 No one's searching for that in every week.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.880
 That sounds fun.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.680
 No, OK, maybe.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.920
 Also, I think that there are films in their categorization

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.120
 filling isn't very good.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.200
 So one of the ones that has nothing in it

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.760
 is suspenseful time travel movies.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.520
 There's definitely got to be some of those.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.520
 Back to the future is suspenseful, right?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.200
 Yes, yeah.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.120
 Sentimental action and adventure.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.960
 There must be one sentimental action film out there.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.760
 Yeah, not everything's on Netflix, though.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.520
 That's the issue, I guess.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.000
 Back to the future, I don't think is on Netflix.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.880
 Therefore, maybe they're just waiting to--

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.880
 Yeah, it is, then, apparently.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.200
 That guy at the back watched it this morning.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.600
 Right after birthing his lambs.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.400
 So Netflix released a load of their stats from 2017.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.400
 And apparently, someone in New Zealand

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.240
 watched grown-ups 331 times, like you.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.520
 Great movie.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.280
 Absolutely.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.920
 Great movie, but 331 times in a year.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.000
 Apparently, there's a podcast called "The worst idea

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.920
 of all time" where they tell you to do that.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.840
 So that's why they did that.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.520
 Ah, cool.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.040
 And there was one viewer in Antarctica

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.240
 who binged on Shameless.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.600
 And there was one person in America

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.880
 who watched the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.800
 every single day for a year.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.640
 Wow.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.280
 I'd rather do that than watch the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.240
 movie once.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.440
 Netflix has shamed people for this, though.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.320
 They sent our tweet in December last year,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.800
 saying, "To the 53 people who've

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.760
 been watching a Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.720
 who hurt you?"

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.280
 Oh, that's pretty mean.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:19.720
 It's a combination of mean, creepy.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.800
 Just one more thing that they've got about category-wise.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.520
 They've got so many things starring the actor Raymond Burr.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.040
 Uh-huh.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040
 Yeah.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.440
 They've got suspenseful movies starring Raymond Burr.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.640
 They've got cerebral mysteries starring Raymond Burr.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.560
 They've got understated suspenseful dramas starring Raymond Burr.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.560
 They've got about 15 Raymond Burr exclusive categories.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.640
 It's very bizarre.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.720
 That's so good.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.840
 I know Netflix, I guess, from the last, let's say,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.200
 five years, I think that's when I started using it.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.040
 I had no idea that Netflix has been around since 1997.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.760
 It's an extremely old company.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.160
 It was extremely old.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.800
 It's not general electric, is it?

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.160
 It's old for what-- I think most people

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.840
 perceive to be very, you know, 2000s, at least 2010s,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.720
 something like that.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.560
 It's kind of that thing.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.200
 So I was looking into it.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.520
 And it's a very interesting backstory.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.240
 There's a number of stories that their creator and Netflix

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.640
 founder read Hastings puts out.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.760
 One is that he got a very big bill for a VHS

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.800
 that he sent back into late.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.720
 It was Apollo 13, and he thought there's

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.840
 got to be a better system.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.120
 So he created it.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.320
 And what it used to be is, like all those things

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.840
 where you would order a DVD off the internet,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.920
 the difference was rather than getting a booklet that

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.200
 told you everything that was in it.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.000
 Back in 1997, there was a website that would send you

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.880
 a VHS, and so you would just pick it from the website

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.400
 and order it.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.280
 So we already had a web presence back then.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.040
 But yeah, that's--

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.520
 I remember when it was just DVDs, and they send you DVDs

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.040
 through the post, and that still exists, that business.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.720
 And it's still making money.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.880
 But actually, in 2000, Reed Hastings approached

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.760
 blockbusters and asked them to buy Netflix

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.960
 for $50 million, the entire company.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.320
 And they refused.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.320
 And--

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.960
 Wow.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.360
 That did not age well, that decision, didn't it?

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.880
 Just one tiny little nugget about Reed Hastings,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.320
 when I was reading into him.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.480
 His grandfather was a very famous physicist,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.640
 and he was very important in the roles of inventing radar

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.400
 and the atomic bomb for World War II.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.280
 And President Roosevelt said of Reed's grandfather

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.240
 that he was a civilian who was second perhaps only

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.320
 to Winston Churchill in facilitating the allied victory

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.840
 in World War II.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.880
 So his grandfather is a seriously important character.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.960
 Yeah, sort of an unknown name to the general public.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.320
 Wow, they've both made equally important contributions,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.560
 I would say, to the able happiness of the world.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.560
 The Reed Hastings story about its inception

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.800
 is quite amused as me, because there is this story he tells

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.280
 when it starts, how did you come up with Netflix?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.000
 He says, I was overcharged for a film.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.880
 And I was charged $40.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.440
 It was a poly 13, charged $40.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.480
 I'd lost the film.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.720
 He said, I didn't want to tell my wife about it.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.200
 And I said to myself, am I really

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.800
 going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.560
 fee, which I would say is marriage is on shaky ground,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.760
 if that's going to compromise its integrity?

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.720
 But so then he thought, OK, I'm going to start up

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.920
 a new company that doesn't do this.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.640
 But his co-founder is called Mark Randolph.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.520
 And he just keeps killing this story.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.920
 So maybe he's exaggerated the story over time,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.680
 or he's piecing things together that weren't together at the time.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.480
 And Mark Randolph, every time he's interviewed,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.400
 is like, no, it's bullshit, Reed Hastings story.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.600
 No, no, it didn't happen.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.080
 But it's a nice story, isn't it?

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.280
 So I let him tell it.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.040
 Wow.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.320
 Oh, I'm getting a story straight, guys.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.680
 So Netflix and chill is the thing, isn't it?

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.200
 There's an article on fusion.com

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.160
 about the history of that phrase.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.880
 And they said that the first use was in January 2009

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.800
 by @NoFaceNina on Twitter.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:01.240
 And by summer of 2014, it had a slightly sexual meaning.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.160
 And then by October, so a few months later,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.320
 someone said that Netflix and chill never

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.040
 means Netflix and chill now, these days, lol.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:15.000
 OK, so that was @itisIsak on Twitter.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.320
 How many A's is that?

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.880
 Quite a lot.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.600
 Well, maybe I just pressed the key too long on my keyboard,

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.960
 I'm sure.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.640
 And then by the end of that year, it was all over Twitter.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.480
 And then by August 2015, US parents

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.080
 were asking their kids what Netflix and chill meant.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.480
 And they were using it.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.120
 And that became the end of the meme.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.280
 So basically, it lasted for less than six years

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.680
 from going from nothing to cool.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.160
 To don't say that anymore.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.200
 Yeah.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.600
 My wife didn't know what Netflix and chill meant.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.120
 The sexual context of it.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.880
 And whenever--

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.280
 No, she had a baby, don't you?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.280
 We do have a baby, yeah.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.680
 And we were watching grownups for the 50th time

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.040
 when we conceived him.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.080
 But we-- yeah, so whenever work finished for her,

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.040
 her bosses would be like, what are you up to tonight?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.000
 I'm just going to be home with my husband, Netflix and chill.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.040
 She thought, oh, we're just chilling.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.920
 And I told her on a train what it meant and her face went, what?

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.480
 But at least she wasn't saying I'm going home

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.760
 to see my mum, Netflix and chill, you know?

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.200
 Like the husband, that's actually OK.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.640
 That's true.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.360
 Do you know that Netflix knows exactly

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.840
 when you will get hooked on a series?

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.800
 This is quite creepy, but it's also quite interesting.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.720
 So it works out the exact point.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.520
 The definition of being hooked is it

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.400
 works out the exact point at which 70% of people

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.120
 go on to finish the series.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.320
 So that's the definition of being hooked.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.680
 So breaking bad, you will be hooked by episode 2

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.800
 on average.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.760
 How I met your mother, episode 8.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.800
 I wonder with breaking bad if it's quicker to get hooked

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.680
 watching the show or taking Crystal Mep?

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.960
 Yeah.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.160
 The Big Bang Theory apparently never.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:05.800
 And for fans of the Big Bang Theory, that was a laugh.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.840
 We have made a powerful enemy to actually talk.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.600
 Just on the subject of breaking bad and drugs and being hooked,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.160
 Netflix actually co-created drugs and released drugs.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.360
 Well, it's a really old company, isn't it?

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.560
 Yeah.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.400
 No, Netflix co-created a set of cannabis strains

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.040
 based on a selection of its popular original shows.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.160
 And they did this.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.200
 It was a pop-up event in West Hollywood

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.720
 for the alternative herbal health services

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.800
 and the set of drugs that you could buy

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.280
 were called the Netflix collection.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.880
 And they were a part of helping to create these.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.840
 So you could get ones that were made to tie in oranges

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.160
 and new black, you were tying with that.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.480
 There were ones for arrested development,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.800
 which were labeled the banana stand-cush.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.560
 Yeah, ideally for a big yellow joint.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.040
 That was the thing.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.680
 And they did it for the Grace and Frankie TV show as well.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.560
 So you can buy cannabis, which is co-created

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.640
 by Netflix and smoke it while you binge.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.800
 And do they do the thing where you have two toaks and you go,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.640
 oh, that's good.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.400
 And someone comes up and goes, I think you might also

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.560
 like this, by the way.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.000
 You say this?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.760
 And maybe this one over there.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.280
 Yeah.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.000
 They don't make any profit from it, by the way.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.640
 It was just that they just want to get people high.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640
 Come on.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.960
 Did you know there is a Spanish platform, which is related?

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.280
 In fact, no, sorry, legally, it's unrelated.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.560
 But there is a Spanish platform called Napflex, which

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.800
 is TV to fall asleep very easily, too.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800
 And it might just be me.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.040
 But I think all the stuff on it sounds really good.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.480
 So there's a big bang theory.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.360
 Please, please edit those jokes at the show.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.520
 Do you have the hope of having to come here on that one day, then?

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.080
 No, I just don't want to be killed by an army of nerds.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.680
 I just don't know.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.160
 They've got-- you might like this, James.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.400
 We've got a four-hour video of the World Chess Championship 2013.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.000
 You like chess?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.480
 Yes, I do.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.960
 I subscribe to a special chess channel.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.080
 Do you?

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.680
 And I have a one-slug in a fan's of the big bang theory.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.440
 Yeah.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.600
 So Napflex ran a competition to fix its algorithm.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.200
 So the thing it does where it recommends stuff

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.680
 that you might like, it has been a massively difficult thing

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.000
 to achieve over the years.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.960
 In 2006, there was a $1 million award for anyone

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.560
 who could improve the recommendations algorithm.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.360
 So it could actually recommend stuff that you genuinely would like.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.680
 And it took three years to be won.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.400
 It was won by this collective.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.800
 And it improved the accuracy of the one they had by 10%.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.000
 And it's so weird.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 So all these coders were competing for it.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.160
 It took three years.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.360
 And then the people who won, and the people who came second,

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.680
 only submitted their bits 20 minutes apart.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.960
 So they lost $1 million by 20 minutes.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.480
 Wow.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.960
 But the main challenge for these coders

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.680
 is Napoleon Dynamite.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.480
 So--

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.200
 How do you mean?

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.440
 No algorithms seem to know if someone's

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.040
 going to like Napoleon Dynamite.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.560
 That was it.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.880
 And that was the challenge it was set.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.160
 It was like, can you work out if someone will like Napoleon Dynamite?

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.200
 Because we don't know.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.000
 There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Wow.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.840
 That's incredible.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.560
 So I'm making $1 million in 20 minutes, which

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.920
 is, coincidentally, what the cost of the big bank theory do.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.400
 We're going to have to move on in the set, guys, for our next fact.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.600
 Did you see the survey that Napflex did last year

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.000
 on how people are watching?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.280
 And so two-thirds of people watch Napflex in public now,

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.200
 or watch Stream in public, which I think is weird.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.120
 Do you mean like on the train, or on the bus?

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.600
 Yeah, on the train, on the commuter work, whatever.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.720
 I know I have a phone from 2001, so maybe that's why I don't do it.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.520
 So this is last year, and it found that 65% of people

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.200
 have burst out laughing on public transport while watching it.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.040
 20% have cried in public, and then been embarrassed about it.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.000
 But 27% of people who've been streaming stuff

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.640
 in public on public transport, for example,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.760
 have had strangers interrupt them while they're

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.600
 watching to start talking about the show that they're watching.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.320
 Is that a thing?

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.920
 I once-- OK.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.480
 I was in Japan once.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.480
 I was in Tokyo, and I was on one of the subway trains.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.480
 And I noticed the phone of the guy sitting next to me.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.080
 He was a wester guy, and he was listening

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.440
 to no such thing as a fish.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.840
 And I-- no, hang on.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.280
 He was-- no, wait, the story hang on.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.640
 He was watching QI, and I leaned over to him,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.320
 and I said, I wrote that, and he did not believe me.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.840
 And I know from the way he said, oh, OK.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.800
 And they got off at the next stop.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.120
 On the flight over from Australia to New Zealand,

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.960
 there was a guy sat in front of me, you, and Anna,

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.720
 who was listening to no such thing as a fish.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.560
 Yeah, that's right.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.960
 And we were chatting behind him.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.920
 He must have been so freaked out when he took his headphones off.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.280
 This has all got a bit more boring very quickly.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.000
 We need to move on to our next fact, guys.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.120
 OK, and it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.920
 OK, my fact this week is that in Sacred Maché combat,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.120
 the aim was not to kill your opponent,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.400
 but to knock his hat off.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.960
 And the loser didn't go off that easily,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.600
 though, because he would immediately be sacrificed.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.760
 No, you lose your hat.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.640
 But fortunately, you won't have a head anymore to put it on.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.680
 So the Maché were a civilization from Peru.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.000
 And I learned this last year when I visited the Laco Museum

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.320
 of Pre-Columbian Art in Lima.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.880
 And we know about this because all we know about these people,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.640
 they're really mysterious, but everything

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.640
 we know comes from their pottery.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.000
 And we have kind of the like little cartoons of what happens.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.760
 So that's how we know about it.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.520
 That's very cool.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.480
 What kind of hats are they?

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.320
 Is it like a top hat?

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.760
 Because the top hat would be quite easy to knock off,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.560
 but then a beanie is quite difficult.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.080
 That's true.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.680
 And a bike helmet, almost impossible.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.800
 Yeah.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.040
 They were large feathery kind of feather pieces.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.880
 Sounds easy.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.680
 Sounds easy.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.880
 Yeah, it is easy.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.200
 Well, really, they just wanted someone to sacrifice.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.720
 Yeah, I don't think they really gave a shit who it was.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.320
 And I think sometimes they also then sacrifice the winner,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:19.520
 right?

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.360
 There's someone who's the thing in me, so I don't know how I can go.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.400
 But they'd sacrifice a guy whose hat got knocked off,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.960
 but then they thought the gods also deserved their best warriors,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.120
 so they would sometimes also sacrifice the one

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.280
 who'd won the battle.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:29.560
 Wow.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.120
 It's a real catch, 22.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.600
 That's terrible, yeah.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.360
 Oh, it is.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.760
 It's a matter of the pre-show interview,

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.960
 like the pre-match interviews.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.200
 How are you feeling about the match?

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.800
 Not good.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.880
 Yeah, I didn't know that they made rubber balls.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.000
 Yes, they did.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.120
 Some of them, yeah.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.200
 The old mechs, especially.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.600
 Yes, the sum of me, so Americans, they made rubber balls.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.360
 And they could make a match, different compounds.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.040
 This is very cool.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.600
 And some of them had the scientists believe

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.800
 that they made 16,000 balls a year in special rubber ball factories.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.400
 Wow.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.400
 Yeah, this is--

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.280
 Yeah, this is impressive.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.640
 This is very true, though, does it?

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.640
 Not factories, come on.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.080
 It's got the word fact in it, James.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.240
 Is this the mezzo-American ballgame that we're talking about?

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.560
 Is this-- I thought that was a much slightly slightly different

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.360
 to Sacred Mote hat combat.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.240
 It's the later mezzo-American ballgame.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.680
 Yeah, they play with these balls,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.640
 and it's a crazy game.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.000
 And again, historians are not quite sure

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.840
 whether when the loser and the winner

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.600
 are determined who were the ones that

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.280
 were murdered and sacrificed off the back of it.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.640
 So they think it might have been the losers who got sacrificed.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.360
 But actually, the gods were more interested

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.800
 in the best blood and the most skillful.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.400
 So actually, you would probably kill the better team,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.000
 the winners.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.160
 And there was this extra thing where they would chop their heads off.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.640
 And some historians believe that then

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.040
 they took the heads of the opponents

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.720
 and then used those as a post-match ballgame

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.520
 to then play with their heads.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.400
 There are pictures of that happening.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:56.960
 Pictures?

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.440
 Yeah, the drawings that we have of them doing that.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.320
 And they would also drink out of them sometimes.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.040
 So the post-match skull would be used as a drinking vessel.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040
 Wow.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040
 They would recycle.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.080
 It's not a way to drive up the quality of the game,

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.440
 I think, to kill good teams and bad teams alike.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440
 Yeah.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.880
 I think that's why we should say they almost certainly

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.600
 didn't do this the vast majority of the time.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.520
 I read a really good analogy, which was,

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.720
 imagine if in 5,000 years people looked

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.120
 at all of the Christian art that we have now

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.720
 and thought, wow, this is so weird.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.760
 They just crucified people left, right, and set

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.240
 her every time they went to church.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.720
 Just because that's the thing that remains.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.960
 The image that remains.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.720
 It probably did happen, but probably not often.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.640
 Yeah, they seem to have really disliked

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.280
 a particular look in people.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.080
 And if you had a beard and you had dark hair,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.840
 you'd be crucified.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.840
 There was--

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.800
 So they do have really interesting pottery, the Maché people.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.080
 And there was an exhibition in Paris a few years ago

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.200
 about it was called Sex Death and Sacrifice

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.240
 in the Maché religion.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.720
 And it had to have a warning on the way in about explicit content,

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.360
 even though this is from how long ago, 2,000 years ago?

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.840
 Yeah, best part of that.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.760
 But have you seen it?

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.120
 Because it is pretty hard-cut.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.120
 I've got some good things on my computer

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.680
 that stop me having to look at that sort of thing.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.960
 Well, I do not have that.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.960
 Although actually in Venice, I went to this museum.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.480
 So this Laco museum, they have an annex for erotic pottery.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.480
 Your pottery.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.480
 There's also, if you can't get down to Lima,

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.240
 there's a really good article on Traveller.com

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.000
 about that annex entitled Fifty Shades of Clay.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.280
 Superb.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.920
 But in the museum, they're under different categories.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920
 Like Netflix, kind of.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.960
 And there's the union of animals, fruits, and deities,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.680
 sexual activity of the dead.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.360
 That's not in Netflix category.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.000
 I better have that special thing on your Netflix.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.400
 It doesn't let you watch those.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.240
 It costs between animals.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.280
 That includes frogs, mice, dogs, llamas, monkeys,

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.400
 and ears of corn.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.000
 Wow.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.720
 In that museum, they have a part of a man receiving oral sex

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.960
 that they call in the museum, the Bill Clinton pot.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.480
 Is it-- they were such an advanced civilization

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.000
 that bought trade.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.480
 Incredible.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.000
 They are.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.520
 When these are referred to, they're always referred

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.520
 to as sex pots.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.560
 And this is in, like, archaeological papers.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.680
 And they talk about the amount of sex pots.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.480
 And you can't take it seriously at all.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.440
 Crass over, Crass over.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:39.960
 Oh my god.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.160
 It's a Crass over, Crass over.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.880
 What they can do, what they're going to do,

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.760
 how they're going to get it together?

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.360
 Oh.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.560
 Yeah, so the Mocce are--

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.840
 OK, so where were we, guys?

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.840
 How about you would just tell us about--

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.360
 I don't know, James, it was three months ago.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.720
 You would tell us about sex pots.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.200
 Ah, sex pots.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.240
 Yes, but actually, I wanted to move on now

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.000
 to talk about knocking hats off.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.520
 Can we do that?

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.960
 This is a fact about knocking hats off.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.320
 That's right, yeah.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.440
 So I was looking into the history of that,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.000
 an easy thing to research.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.920
 And I found out that 200 years ago, in the Ottoman Empire,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.320
 if you knocked off someone's turban,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.800
 it was punishable by death.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.560
 Wow.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.800
 And I discovered this because I was reading an account

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.680
 in 1799 of a Christian who was taken to court,

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.120
 because they were accused of knocking off a Muslim's turban.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.920
 And the Christian's explanation, which

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.040
 seemed to be believed by the court,

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.720
 was that the Muslim had been wearing a blue turban, which

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.480
 looked exactly like the turban that his friend usually wore.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.080
 So he said he'd knocked it off as a prank,

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.320
 because he thought it was his mate.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.920
 And then the guy had turned around and it wasn't.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.280
 And in fact, he ended up getting off Scott free,

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.880
 and the judge ended up punishing the Muslim for wearing

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.160
 a blue turban when he was supposed to be wearing a green one.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.080
 Oh, no, that's cool.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.360
 I got a couple of hat things, just very quickly.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.920
 On George Orwell's 110th birthday,

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.000
 it was celebrated in a little Dutch town

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.360
 by these artists putting little hats on every single CCTV

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.280
 camera around there.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.400
 Apparently it's loaded.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.640
 Well, just to make them look cute.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.600
 Just to sort of show how his vision has come true, basically,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.760
 from the book.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.160
 I don't remember the hats being in the book.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.560
 It was the unedited, unabridged.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.360
 Yeah.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.200
 Party version.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.240
 It's those hats that you get on innocent smoothie bottles.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.000
 They came originally from 1984 CCTV.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 It's very sweet.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.320
 Here's another one.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.680
 Paul Petrol, the cartoon for kids.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.600
 Don't know if you guys know it.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.120
 No.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.120
 Massive cartoon.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.600
 It's ginormous.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.560
 You're backing me up, right?

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.040
 It's ginormous.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.760
 They had to--

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.040
 Dad, who are you talking to?

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.280
 I was pretending a well-entered audience member was here.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.120
 Am I right, guys?

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.520
 It's massive.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.400
 There we go.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.840
 Shit, one came back with us.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.160
 Yeah, Paul Petrol.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.960
 They had to recall a firefighting hat that they had,

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.240
 because it turned out it was a fire hazard.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.240
 Yeah, I'm reading.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.440
 Yeah, so, yeah.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.000
 I need to record that.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.800
 OK, is time for our final fact to the show.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.040
 And that's my fact.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.320
 My fact, nine weeks ago, is that pseudonyms that Elton John

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.080
 has used when checking into a hotel include

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.600
 Sir Binky Poodleclip, Judas Fart, and the Marquis of Minge.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.160
 You did that last time.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.000
 It's Marquis.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.800
 It's Marquis.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.000
 Marquis, because a Marquis is a big tent.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.240
 Well, you have weddings and stuff.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.960
 And a Marquis of Minge is a completely different thing, I think.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.160
 I seem to remember the audience who well-entered thought

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.040
 that was quite amusing, as well.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.560
 I mean, I think was that an intentional attempt

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.800
 to recreate the atmosphere?

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.600
 Or was you've forgotten the 10 minutes of ribbing

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.280
 that you got behind, actually?

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.680
 You think I've learned?

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.320
 Anyway, the tent of Minge, the Binky Poodleclip,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.000
 too, is not.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.800
 Anyway, he does this when he goes to hotels.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.640
 Obviously, a lot of people do that anyway.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.120
 Celebrities like to give themselves a pseudonym

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.040
 so that the press can't find them and fans can't find them

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.920
 when they're in town.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.920
 He likes to pick these particularly dirty ones,

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.640
 because it actually affects the people

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.400
 trying to get in touch with him that he knows.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.360
 So, for example, he said that his mother keeps complaining

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.480
 to him saying things like, "I can't believe you've asked me

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.640
 to ring and ask for a sehorus pussy."

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.480
 It's enough like that.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.920
 He's also gone for a Humphrey Handbag and Bobo Latrine.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.960
 Yeah, I'm Brian Bigbum.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.480
 Nice.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.800
 You say they're so dirty.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.520
 They're like an eight-year-old version of dirty, aren't they?

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.640
 Actually, what I quite like, as well,

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.320
 is that his name itself is a pseudonym, anyway.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:22.840
 Yeah.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.520
 He could probably go back to his original name.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.560
 What are they old Dwight?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.360
 Regional Dwight, and he has a middle name.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.600
 Yes, is it Hercules?

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.440
 That's right, yeah.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.440
 Have you thought Elton John and Regional Dwight,

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.040
 they're all first names.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.080
 So, both of his names are those weird names

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.840
 where two people have the first name.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.680
 Yeah.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.520
 Yeah, you're right.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.840
 Like Steve Martin or David Cameron.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.560
 But we can't go on doing this all day.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.360
 It's really, it's a fun game to play at home

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.200
 is to think of people who've got two first names.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.520
 But actually, of all those names,

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.360
 I would say Elton is the least first name of all of them.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.840
 And he's chosen that as his first name.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.680
 That's true.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.520
 Yeah, you're right.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.360
 Ben Elton.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.320
 Ben Elton.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.720
 Yeah, Ben Elton.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.640
 Oh, god.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.520
 Honestly, I've got a list of about 30,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.200
 which I compiled a few years ago.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.160
 I remember us all compiling them together.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.800
 I like that you've turned this into it

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.560
 being your solo project.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.280
 Is that how you all remember the broadcasts?

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.480
 (laughing)

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.680
 Just to quickly say, Hercules is the middle name

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.960
 of his pseudonym, Elton John.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.800
 That's right.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.640
 It's not his real name.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.320
 I heard that he named it after the horse

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.680
 in that old sitcom Steps on Sun.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.840
 But I don't know if that's true.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.960
 Oh, I really don't know if that's true.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.320
 The middle name, Hercules.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.160
 Yeah.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.000
 Yeah.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.840
 It wasn't the horse's middle name.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.680
 There was it.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.160
 It was the horse's first and only name.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.000
 He only had one name.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.320
 It was like Madonna in that respect.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.160
 Well, it might not have been.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.440
 You just never know a horse's surname

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.200
 because they get very little post.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.240
 (laughing)

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.080
 Very good point.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.240
 Yeah.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.040
 On musical pseudonyms,

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.000
 Elton John recorded a version of Lucy

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.240
 in the Sky with Diamonds in 1973

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.240
 and John Lennon played on it.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.880
 But lots of the Beatles,

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.840
 when they're recording other things,

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.960
 they use pseudonyms.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.280
 And John Lennon's was Winston O Boogey.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.120
 Nice.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.960
 Yeah.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.560
 Winston, of course, being his middle name,

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.480
 John Lennon's middle name.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.320
 Ah!

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.720
 And O Boogey being his mother's maiden name, I think.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720
 Yes.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.440
 I always hate doing Beatles facts with Dan here

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.760
 'cause he has to pretend to be excited to learn it.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.720
 But you know that he knows all of them.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.360
 I have a test for Dan.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.200
 Go on.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.040
 A Beatles test.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.800
 So John Lennon and Paul McCartney,

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.160
 they only played one gig together as a double act.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.960
 It was in 1960 at a pub in Caversham.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.160
 What were they called?

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.000
 Er, well, I can't remember.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.120
 They were called the Nirk twins.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.200
 Yeah, that's right.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.040
 (laughing)

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.640
 Oh, you should have given him more time.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.480
 Yeah.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480
 You should have given up so many times.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.000
 (laughing)

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.080
 There were only three people drinking in the pub,

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.720
 and nobody knew who they were anyway.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.760
 It's so easy for you to just say the Nirk twins now.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.680
 The Nirk twins?

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.520
 That's right.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.360
 Yes.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.480
 (laughing)

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.400
 Someone else who chooses funny names

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.200
 in order to embarrass people is Kate Beckinsale,

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.440
 who says that she chooses the name Segoni Beaver

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.880
 when she books into hotels,

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.680
 because she really likes, well, first of all,

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.240
 'cause she really admires Segoni Weaver,

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.280
 and there's no way of saying that,

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.200
 which actually seems like not a way to admire someone.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.040
 (laughing)

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.760
 And also because she says her husband hates it

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.800
 when hotel employees call him Mr. Beaver.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.320
 (laughing)

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320
 Which you can understand.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.640
 I don't believe her isn't the first name

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.480
 if you're thinking about that.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.320
 No, no.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.160
 (laughing)

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.160
 I get confused by this checking into hotels thing,

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.040
 'cause I think they just ask you for a passport

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040
 when you check into a hotel,

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.560
 and no one, I don't think Kate Beckinsale

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.880
 has had a passport made up.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.720
 Exactly.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.560
 Or it's a labor affair.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.040
 You have to give a credit card or something, don't you?

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.880
 Exactly.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.960
 Except Elton John, when he does get to these hotels,

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.680
 he sends his pseudonym ahead,

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.360
 and they used to make up office stationery for him

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.360
 when he arrived in the room.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.720
 It would have his pseudonym on it,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.600
 headed paper, and so on.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.200
 Which is quite cool, so, you know.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.040
 Yeah.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.320
 I think you have to be famous, don't you?

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.200
 So I think our personal experience, I suppose,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.320
 is them just looking at your passport or credit card,

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.120
 but maybe if you're Elton John or John Lennon,

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.360
 they make some, you know, allowances.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.800
 We've got a marquee coming to the hotel.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.640
 (laughing)

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.800
 Better give it a big room.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.600
 (laughing)

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.120
 So I'm confused talking of passports.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.520
 People seem to book flights under pseudonyms a lot,

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.960
 or they claim that they do.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.880
 So Marinin Monroe apparently book flights

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.240
 under the name Zelda Zonk.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.800
 Again, not a thing you can actually do

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.120
 when you're booking a flight in my experience.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.960
 You could in the '50s or '60s.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.920
 Johnny Depp says he does it.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.080
 Johnny Depp claims that he's always giving himself pseudonyms

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.240
 and he books loads of tickets in that name.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.880
 I reckon he must take private jets, right?

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.720
 Yeah.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.560
 Poor him.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.320
 Johnny Depp at the moment, he's like, basically,

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.720
 he spends all his money on ridiculous things, doesn't he?

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.560
 Yeah.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.360
 Yeah, like he shuts Hunter S. Thompson's ashes into space

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.200
 and stuff like that.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.040
 Yeah.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.080
 So I reckon he's a private jet guy.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.920
 Yeah.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.400
 But also, actually, Elton John has been in trouble

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.000
 for spending too much money, hasn't he?

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.840
 Has he?

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.840
 He was suing someone for not looking after his expenses properly.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.600
 And in that court case, they said that he spent

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.680
 £40 million over a 20-month period,

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.400
 including £293,000 on flowers.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.240
 Wow.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.760
 That's a lot of flowers, isn't it?

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.240
 And they asked him in court, they said,

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.040
 do you have any reason to think that these figures

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:58.880
 are inaccurate?

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.880
 And Elton John said, probably not.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.280
 And he said, really, £293,000 on flowers alone,

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.840
 is that even possible?

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.080
 And Elton John said, yes, I like flowers.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.320
 Fair enough.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.640
 He knows his own mind.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.080
 Check-off used to write under pseudonyms

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.400
 when he submitted short stories.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.400
 And he had really good ones.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.920
 So he submitted stories to magazines with names

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.960
 that included man without a spleen, which

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.640
 was his most common.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.600
 So he wrote 119 short stories under the name

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.960
 man without a spleen.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.800
 He also was doctor without patients.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.640
 And my brother's brother, for no particular reason.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.600
 He was a doctor, wasn't he?

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.280
 He was a doctor, yeah, yeah.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.800
 I wonder if he took his own spleen out

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.040
 to make him run faster.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.120
 Because that's the thing, isn't it?

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.880
 If you take your spleen out, you run faster.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.040
 It's not a common thing, is it?

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.280
 No.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.880
 But it is a fact that James had been trying

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.960
 to get into the podcast for the last six months.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.000
 I could go set it.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.080
 I'd go, sure.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.320
 I think you crowbar it in this fact as well.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.160
 I'm a Wellington.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.000
 I've a fact I didn't say in the Wellington show, actually.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.160
 This is about musical student names and musical doubles.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.880
 So have you heard of the band The Zombies?

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.120
 They're big six T's, and they're not really big anymore.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.720
 But they only became famous two years

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.120
 after they broke up.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.640
 So that was probably-- yeah, the song was

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.560
 "Time of the Season" that went really big for them.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.040
 But they didn't know they were famous in the USA,

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.000
 because they were a British band.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.560
 And communications were much worse then.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.760
 So there was a band from Dallas who just pretended

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.720
 to be The Zombies and went on tour as The Zombies.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.120
 Very successfully.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.120
 And then, bizarrely, in 1969, there were two separate bands

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.800
 touring America as The Zombies being managed

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.280
 by a proper record label and everything.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.840
 Are the fake zombies that had a training period?

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.920
 Do you think that the fake zombies bit the other guys

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.440
 that they became fake zombies?

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.720
 That's amazing.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.160
 I know.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.960
 Nobody notices that the lead singer was the wrong sex.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.680
 I've just completed different sex

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.920
 from the actual zombies that came.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.440
 Actually, British zombies ever got to America are.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.760
 I don't know.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.440
 I don't know.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.240
 Amazing.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.800
 Yeah, bizarre.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.280
 Do you know the person who's acted in more plays than anyone else?

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.760
 And this is related to pseudonyms?

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.560
 Is it Garrick?

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.080
 No.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.720
 Is it someone who's got a lot of pseudonyms?

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.560
 It's actually a pseudonym, not a person.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.560
 Oh.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.120
 Is it, like, Alan Smithy or something like that?

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.800
 It's George Spellvin.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.320
 So this is a name that's a credit that's been going on since 1886,

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.680
 which is that if you're in a play,

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.120
 if you're doing a performance that A, your turn

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.560
 bar has to be credited for, because it doesn't suit

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.160
 your reputation, or sometimes if you're playing two roles

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.600
 in the same play and in the program,

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.480
 you don't want to give away that you're that person as well.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.160
 You call yourself George Spellvin.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.280
 And it's been happening since 1882.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.280
 And there are various different ones in different countries.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.000
 So it's George Eau Spellvin in an Italian play.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.960
 It's George Et or Georgina when it's French.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.760
 And yeah.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.280
 It's brilliant.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.840
 The last one, the last case actually,

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.440
 was in 1988 in Edwin Druid, the Dictatory character,

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.400
 which we talked about, that musical--

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.560
 the Edwin Druid musical.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360
 Oh, cool.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.960
 That's so weird, because the Alan Smithy thing

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.520
 goes on post-production.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.200
 So just to explain, that is the same thing, but with movies, right?

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.720
 Exactly.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.400
 And it usually is for screenwriters.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.240
 When a screenwriter hates the fact

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.560
 that it's been rewritten so much, they want their name off it.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.240
 And Alan Smithy is in its place.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.080
 But again, that's post-production usually,

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.160
 whereas this sounds like you're in the moment

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.680
 embarrassed of the thing that you're in.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.800
 And all the rest of the cast are going, oh, really?

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.840
 Actually, we'll never mind.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.120
 You have to finish that, though.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.160
 I don't know, I don't know.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.840
 It's going to be-- it's going to be your atters.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.840
 Yeah.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.840
 Yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.800
 That's what you're going for.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.600
 I'm not parting the ass.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.720
 Yeah.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.600
 Which nationality will he go for?

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.480
 So things in hotels, like what you can ask for.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.160
 Yeah.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.200
 I saw a website where they asked a lot of people who worked

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.960
 in hotels.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.280
 And there was someone in Seattle who had someone who came

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.040
 to the hotel who asked for a pillow fort.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.400
 And apparently, this happens quite a lot.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.360
 But these guys, as well as a pillow fort,

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.480
 they wanted a towel folded in the shape of an elephant.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.720
 And if possible, a sexy picture of some fruit on the night

00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.760
 table.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.080
 And did I tell them to do it?

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.160
 They sure did.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.160
 Wow.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.480
 How did they make the fruit sexy?

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.720
 Was it carving or was it positioning?

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.720
 I think it's just a banana and two plums.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.000
 I don't know.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.160
 They didn't say what it was.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:17.960
 It's a shame.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.800
 So much opportunity to be creative there.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.880
 Just on names.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.880
 There's a guy who's written a dictionary of surnames.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.240
 I think a couple of years ago, he's called Patrick Hanks.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.520
 And he looked into the most likely meanings for surnames.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.080
 And do you know what Shakespeare probably meant?

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.120
 So just light, literally, shaking a spear?

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.560
 Yes, you're going to get there.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.000
 Is someone in a battle?

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.280
 You've gone the wrong direction.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.000
 It was a medieval term for masturbator.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.880
 Oh, I was so far away.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.760
 Shaking a spear.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.400
 I felt like you'd picked the right direction

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.600
 for once you went highbrow.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.720
 Who would have thought, wow, is that right?

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.400
 Is that right?

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.600
 Yeah, probably from an obscene medieval term for masturbator.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.160
 So was it still known that meaning when Shakespeare

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.440
 was writing his place?

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.240
 He's not clear.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.640
 But it could well be that, yeah, you'd

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.120
 go and see Romeo and Juliet by the great masturbator.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.360
 He would have worked it out.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.200
 He was a great linguist.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.560
 He would have worked it out.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.920
 Because he was always doing little double entendres

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.760
 and stuff, wasn't it?

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.760
 That's true.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.280
 He was.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.640
 There were some very rude ones.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.680
 I won't repeat them now.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.840
 But does that mean one of his great, great, great, great grand

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.880
 fathers was a masturbator?

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.640
 Is that what we're saying?

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.960
 Yeah, for it as a job, I guess.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960
 Yeah.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.960
 Smith is blacksmith.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.320
 Masturbators, masturbators.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.120
 The medievalized street for the smitty bakery,

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.360
 the masturbatorium.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.400
 It's very sad.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.120
 We used to have three masturbatorians on this street.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.560
 They will become charity masturbatorians now.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:01.280
 OK, that's it.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.280
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.720
