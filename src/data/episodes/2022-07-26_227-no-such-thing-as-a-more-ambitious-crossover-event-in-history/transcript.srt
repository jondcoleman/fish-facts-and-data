00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,480
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,620
 Before we get going, we just wanna let you know

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,120
 that this is a particularly interesting episode.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,560
 It's what we like to call a crossover episode.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,680
 You may be aware of crossover movies,

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,440
 take the latest Avengers movie

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,640
 where they had Guardians of the Galaxy involved.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,040
 We've decided to do a crossover episode with ourselves.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,000
 It's very ambitious, but I think we've managed it.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,560
 - We screwed up, didn't we, Dan?

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,960
 - We did, we screwed up.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,720
 We were in Wellington, we were on stage,

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,440
 Wellington is in New Zealand,

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,160
 and we were recording a show as part of our tour,

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,800
 and we've only just found out that the final two facts

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,080
 are missing, the recording is gone.

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,120
 - Or the final one and a half facts, I think,

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,560
 and you'll notice, I believe.

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,880
 - Yeah, so what it'll sound like

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,840
 is that all of our jokes are falling really, really flat.

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,280
 (laughing)

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,760
 - How will listeners tell the difference?

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,480
 (laughing)

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
 - Okay, so listen carefully,

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
 'cause you might actually miss it.

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,320
 We'll do our best to make sure it's flagged up,

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,680
 but if we've done our job well, you won't notice.

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,320
 - Okay, on with the show.

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,640
 (bell rings)

31
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
 - Do you know what it is?

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
 - Who the fuck is this?

33
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
 (bell rings)

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
 - Who the fuck is that?

35
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
 (bell rings)

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
 Do you know what it is?

37
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,080
 (upbeat music)

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,920
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

39
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,880
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish", a weekly podcast.

40
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,760
 This week, coming to you from Wellington!

41
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,760
 (audience cheering)

42
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,960
 - My name is Dan Schreiber,

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,480
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

44
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,880
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,

45
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,520
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,640
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

47
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,400
 and in no particular order, here we go.

48
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,040
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Chazinski.

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
 - My fact is that if a lamb starts being born

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,360
 the wrong way up, the farmer pushes it

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,440
 right back up into the womb and gets it to start again.

52
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,160
 (audience laughing)

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,280
 And I thought I'd do a fact about sheep, because we're here.

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,080
 (audience laughing)

55
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,760
 - Wow, that is a risky start, Anna.

56
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,480
 - See, not everyone in the room is a sheep farmer.

57
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,920
 (audience laughing)

58
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,840
 But on the size of love, about half of the mile.

59
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
 - Yeah, but.

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,120
 - So yeah, I think I first came across as a New Yorker piece

61
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,560
 that was an interview with a guy called James Rebanks,

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,840
 who's a sheep farmer in Cumbria in the UK.

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,320
 And he was saying, yeah, most lambs,

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,600
 if they're being born well, they come out like a diver.

65
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,240
 So it's like head and front legs first.

66
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,480
 But if the legs and the head come out in the wrong order,

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,920
 at all, you literally have to shove it right back up there

68
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,520
 and rearrange them in order that they come out

69
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,440
 the right way.

70
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,040
 And so he gave various instances of ways

71
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,880
 that it could go wrong.

72
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,160
 So if the legs come out without a head,

73
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,680
 then you have to go, that means the head.

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,840
 That doesn't mean it's left the head right behind

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
 in the uterus.

76
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,440
 It just means the head's a bit bent.

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,520
 So you've got to return it and rearrange it.

78
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,160
 And when you do rearrange it, they have

79
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,920
 to cup the mouth of the lamb so that the lamb's teeth don't tear

80
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,600
 at the birthing canal in the uterus.

81
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 Crikey.

82
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,960
 It's a combination of extremely sweet and extremely

83
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,920
 disgusting.

84
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,720
 I'm yet to hear the sweet part.

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,920
 He's helping the little lamb get out intact.

86
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,640
 OK, where do you put it like that?

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,160
 What does the sheep think as the baby's birthing

88
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,720
 is suddenly pushed back in like that?

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,080
 That's got to be the weirdest experience ever.

90
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,760
 We don't have any records on what they think.

91
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,560
 But they must be concerned, right?

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,440
 I read a thing that sheep have an incredible peripheral vision.

93
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,840
 They've not that incredible that they can see up there.

94
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,040
 [LAUGHTER]

95
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,520
 But they think they can go almost to 360.

96
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
 They've almost got 360 views, which are nice.

97
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,760
 It's almost impossible to sneak up on them.

98
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,160
 Yeah.

99
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,120
 There's piece of a lot of experience, doesn't it?

100
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,360
 Almost, but not quite.

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,360
 [LAUGHTER]

102
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,400
 But they must as it's being shoved back in.

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,880
 They must have us put in like, what are you doing?

104
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
 You can see you.

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,320
 They're very dappy.

106
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,720
 I mean, genuinely, they are quite--

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,760
 I think they're quite crap mothers, at least at the start.

108
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,840
 So I read so many farming blogs and turns out

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,520
 you are very bad at knowing which ones are their babies.

110
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,360
 And the babies are very bad at knowing which ones are their mothers.

111
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,480
 And they're constantly getting confused about this

112
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,240
 and going off with the wrong parent.

113
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,800
 And so a lamb will accidentally pick the wrong parent

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
 that won't be able to produce milk and so it'll starve.

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,320
 And there's this weird thing where farmers,

116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,000
 sometimes, a lamb will be born and be an orphan,

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,680
 so that you might die in childbirth.

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,360
 And it's an amazing thing that farmers do to trick

119
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,640
 use into believing that another lamb is their lamb.

120
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,200
 And what they do is there'll be a you that's pregnant

121
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,360
 with one lamb.

122
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,680
 And it gives birth to it.

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,800
 And the farmer then he's to trick the you

124
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,880
 into thinking it's about to have twins.

125
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,600
 And so what he does, prepare yourselves,

126
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,880
 is, first of all, he covers the orphan lamb

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,360
 in the birthing fluid so that it smells right from the other one.

128
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,720
 And he ties its legs together because often that lamb's

129
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,920
 day old or so, and they can run away.

130
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,400
 And if you're just given birth or something,

131
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,600
 it's very unusual for it to immediately go

132
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
 gallopanting over the fields.

133
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
 And then what he does is he sort of puts inserts his hand

134
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240
 into the you and pretends that his hand is the second lamb

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,440
 that's being born.

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,800
 And then you will be convinced that she's having contractions

137
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,840
 and think that she's giving birth and you keep it in there.

138
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,640
 And then you whip it out.

139
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,080
 And then you quickly do the magic trick of quickly

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,040
 shoving the orphan lamb under the used nose.

141
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,640
 And then things, oh, that must be what just came out of me.

142
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,840
 I've got effects about lambing sound effects.

143
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,880
 So this is from the long running radio four

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,440
 show the archers.

145
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,520
 They have a style guide on how to do the sound effect

146
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,840
 of a lamb being born.

147
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
 Wow.

148
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,720
 So you have to overlay agitated barring.

149
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,160
 That's very important.

150
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,040
 So there's barring going on and it sounds stressed.

151
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,480
 And then you put a soaking wet towel on your shoulder.

152
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 It's really heavy.

153
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,440
 And then you squeeze a huge amount of yogurt

154
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,160
 through your gloved hands.

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,840
 And then you drop the wet towel onto a bed

156
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,440
 of old recording tape.

157
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,320
 Wow.

158
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,920
 Why don't they just use the recording

159
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,080
 of an actual lamb being born?

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,880
 Often they don't sound right, do they?

161
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,240
 When you do the actual thing, it

162
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,600
 doesn't sound like what you would expect.

163
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,400
 It might happen that if you recorded that,

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,680
 it would just sound like an old towel being dropped off

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
 of some yogurt as if it's trained.

166
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
 I thought I would find out what farmers did.

167
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
 But I forgot to look on the blogs.

168
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,720
 I went on to Reddit.

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,680
 And there was an AMA with a sheep farmer.

170
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,840
 And one of the top questions was,

171
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,240
 why do they have such shitty asses?

172
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,240
 The farmers are the sheep.

173
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,000
 They were speaking about the sheep.

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,480
 The guy said, this is true.

175
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,920
 As though they have zero control or awareness

176
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,840
 of what comes out.

177
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,520
 And they actually sell jackets to go over the sheep

178
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,600
 to protect the wool from getting dirty for those

179
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,680
 who want super clean wool.

180
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,280
 So you get some sheep who are wearing like an all-in-one

181
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,440
 onesie with a little hole.

182
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,760
 And it keeps them clean.

183
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,520
 And will that be made of a previous sheep?

184
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,960
 Well, there is one thing that they do.

185
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,760
 Again, if they want a you to adopt an orphan sheep,

186
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,880
 they will shave the wool off one of its real offspring

187
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,600
 and then put it on the other one as a disguise.

188
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,840
 So they literally wear the other lambs clothes.

189
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,480
 So it's like a sheep in sheep's clothing.

190
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,440
 [LAUGHTER]

191
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,720
 It's a lamin lambs clothing.

192
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,360
 But yeah, I think everyone gets the idea.

193
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,200
 It's a great clever.

194
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,600
 Did you know that sheep have their own weather forecast?

195
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,120
 What?

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
 In the UK, sheep have their own weather forecast.

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,240
 No, they don't.

198
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,760
 They do.

199
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
 It's just been launched.

200
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
 It's in Bristol.

201
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,480
 And it's a traffic light system of warnings, which

202
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,200
 measures whether-- and it works out the risk of-- there's

203
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,520
 a very particular parasite they get called pneumatodirus.

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
 And if you are a pneumatodirus, and I've

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,400
 pronounced it wrong, please don't write in.

206
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,840
 But it's very useful.

207
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,080
 The only problem with it is that they

208
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,280
 have not called it the sheeping forecast.

209
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,080
 Guys?

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
 Thank you, growing there.

211
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,920
 When you met a supportive hearty chuckle.

212
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,960
 So it's a forecast not of weather, but of parasites?

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,280
 Yes.

214
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
 Well, it's weather, which tells you when the parasites are

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
 going to be coming in.

216
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,800
 Wow.

217
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
 And it tells the humans not the sheep.

218
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,680
 It's really a focus of farmers, isn't it?

219
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,520
 Or do the sheep gather around 5 p.m. every Monday, actually?

220
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,040
 There'll be a lot of parasites out there tonight.

221
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,640
 Look, lively, stay sharp.

222
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,120
 That's-- I was reading a medical report about--

223
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,240
 it just gives you virus.

224
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,760
 It talks about viruses and parasites and so on, that come up.

225
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,600
 And these people who are reading it

226
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
 noticed a very odd entry in it, which

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,680
 is that a few people who were farmers who

228
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,840
 were involved in castrating lambs when they were born

229
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
 got very ill very quickly.

230
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,400
 And it was 12 people who got ill.

231
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,600
 But they worked out that two of them got ill

232
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,560
 because they were castrating with an old method that still

233
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
 goes on these days, not completely,

234
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
 but in the 1800s all the time.

235
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,880
 They castrate using their teeth.

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,960
 So these are humans who go and two of these guys

237
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,840
 were castrating these lambs with their teeth.

238
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,960
 And they got very ill.

239
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,640
 One of my best friends has done that in Australia.

240
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,760
 - Really? - In Western Australia.

241
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,840
 - Yep. - Did they get ill?

242
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,920
 He's-- well, he's pretty insane, but he's not sick.

243
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,440
 Oh, OK.

244
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
 I think he is sick, yeah.

245
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,520
 And they go by on a conveyor belt, right?

246
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,840
 And you lie underneath them, and he just

247
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,600
 weaponize one by one.

248
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
 What?

249
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
 Well, you come up like jaws, but you just go bite off the balls.

250
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,400
 It's your friend, Australian.

251
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,720
 He lived in Australia for a year.

252
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
 Well, he was British.

253
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,200
 Yeah.

254
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,120
 Feels like they kind of saw him coming down there.

255
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,440
 Yeah, we all do this, mate.

256
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,760
 [LAUGHTER]

257
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 This guy looks like I'll bite the balls off anything.

258
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,680
 Do you know how farmers can tell when she perv made it?

259
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,400
 This is an interesting thing.

260
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,080
 Well, they wait nine months.

261
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
 Yeah.

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,840
 So what they do-- well, in a lot of farms, what they do is

263
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,480
 they draw on the males with crayon.

264
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
 OK?

265
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,280
 And then, if they come back later--

266
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,960
 so they draw on the underside of the males with crayon.

267
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
 And if they come back later, because you

268
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,760
 can't be watching the sheep all the time, it's--

269
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,880
 Oh.

270
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
 It might be chalk here, but in some places,

271
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920
 and in the sources I found, it was crayon.

272
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,600
 Anyway, if they come back later and the females got crayon,

273
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 or chalk?

274
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,240
 On her back, then they know that mating has occurred.

275
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,640
 But you wouldn't think that crayon would work, right?

276
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,880
 Yeah, you'd--

277
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,040
 [LAUGHTER]

278
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,080
 It too harking.

279
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,400
 Hey, another weird thing that happens to female pregnant--

280
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,840
 sorry, sheep-- is that they get really heavy with the weight

281
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,920
 and their wool gets really heavy.

282
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,680
 So sometimes they lose balance, and they tip over.

283
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
 And they fall on their back, like a turtle,

284
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,320
 and they can't get back up.

285
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
 So they get stuck.

286
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,320
 So farmers have to go and bring pregnant sheep back onto their feet.

287
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,360
 Otherwise, they've just stuck their upside down.

288
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,200
 Wow, really?

289
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,720
 Yeah.

290
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,400
 Sheep spinning.

291
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,640
 They are stupid, aren't they?

292
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,040
 They are.

293
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
 Someone sent me a text in the break.

294
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
 And I can't remember who it is, and I've turned my phone off,

295
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,680
 sorry, but they said that when it snows,

296
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,440
 the sheep can't believe that the grass is underneath the snow.

297
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,920
 They think it's just disappeared.

298
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,520
 And so they'll just starve to death if you don't kind of clear

299
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,600
 them a little clearing.

300
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
 Is it another one of those magic tricks

301
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,120
 they think have happened, like the swapping of the land?

302
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,880
 And apparently, like cows and cattle, they all clear it away.

303
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
 But sheep are just stupid.

304
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
 They sometimes-- so they have to groom their lambs when they give birth to them.

305
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,400
 And sometimes they get so carried away with grooming that they bite their tails off.

306
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,720
 Wait, sorry.

307
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,800
 The mother.

308
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,040
 I thought you meant this was your friend biting.

309
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,960
 I think your friend just really likes lamb.

310
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,560
 But yeah, the mothers, they've got to lick off all the afterbirth and stuff,

311
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,680
 but they get really excited, and they'll bite the umbilical cord,

312
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,840
 and they'll just bite the tail off.

313
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,360
 And the farmers don't know what to do because you're not supposed to get involved,

314
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
 because otherwise, that might separate the mother from the lamb.

315
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
 And so they just have to watch, sort of going, no, stop it.

316
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,760
 Stop biting them tail of your child.

317
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,280
 Oh, my God.

318
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,200
 Guys, we're going to have to move on shortly to our next fact.

319
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,800
 Just one last thing, Mary had a little lamb.

320
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,040
 The nursery rhyme is based on a true story.

321
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,360
 [LAUGHTER]

322
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
 You know that?

323
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 Yeah.

324
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,160
 Well, there's nothing supernatural in there already.

325
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
 Yeah.

326
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,520
 It's just about someone called Mary who had a little lamb.

327
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,880
 It's a quite believable--

328
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,400
 And the sheep followed her wherever she-- it's a good herder.

329
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,600
 She's-- yeah, it's a very-- what's your point, Andy?

330
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,720
 Was she famous?

331
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
 Was she a famous Mary?

332
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,520
 She was not.

333
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,640
 She was a woman called Mary Sawyer.

334
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
 It was a Massachusetts in 1830.

335
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,480
 She had a lamb, and it followed her all over the place, and then a friend.

336
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,000
 Interesting.

337
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,960
 No, no, no, the interesting thing thing was,

338
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,280
 it's fleece was as white as snow, and then--

339
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,920
 [LAUGHTER]

340
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,480
 So when I've disappeared, where am I?

341
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

342
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,280
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

343
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,800
 My fact is that the Netflix category,

344
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:10,640
 Gory Canadian Revenge Movies, only has one film in it.

345
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,160
 Wow, on what's the film, Deena?

346
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,840
 I don't.

347
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,760
 I'm going to rip it down.

348
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,280
 Sauce.

349
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,960
 Your research today has been very lax,

350
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,400
 because it's of reciting nursery rhymes and having a fun fact.

351
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,520
 So what the thing that happens is there

352
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,600
 are these microcategories on Netflix.

353
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,760
 And if you have a Netflix account, you might have seen them.

354
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,080
 So goofy werewolf comedies is one, or sentimental movies

355
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,240
 about horses for ages 11 to 12.

356
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,360
 [LAUGHTER]

357
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,280
 And some of them-- this is the bizarre thing.

358
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,960
 Netflix has made 76,897 unique categories,

359
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,720
 according to the last count done.

360
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,920
 And some of them have nothing in them.

361
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,560
 So that feel good romantic Spanish language TV show.

362
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,520
 Netflix has none, but they've created the category,

363
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,920
 because some will exist.

364
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,760
 Wow.

365
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,720
 So for instance, skiing, nonfiction, none of those.

366
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,320
 Iranian comedies, none of those.

367
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,360
 [LAUGHTER]

368
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
 So we're just waiting to discover them.

369
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,400
 I guess so.

370
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,760
 It's like when they knew India existed and they tried to find it.

371
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
 If you pitch a show to Netflix to make,

372
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
 they'll probably be like, well, it's a shit idea,

373
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
 but we need one of those.

374
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,880
 You've got the money.

375
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,320
 They actually-- there was a role that was advertised in the UK

376
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,800
 for someone specifically to create these kind of categories.

377
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,440
 So the idea was they advertised for someone

378
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
 who would basically binge watch Netflix.

379
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,720
 They would just sit and watch movie after movie.

380
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,800
 And while they were watching, they

381
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,840
 would think of unique different tags

382
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,480
 that they could give to each of those movies

383
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 to create these kind of categories.

384
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,560
 But the other thing is, they have professional watches.

385
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,840
 So this is-- this fact is from a piece in The Atlantic, which

386
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
 was fantastic.

387
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,160
 It was a journalist who ran a script to download all 76,000.

388
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,760
 The guys who professionally watch Netflix,

389
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,280
 they tag movies with all kinds of data.

390
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,440
 So it's not just how rude the plot is or whether there's violence.

391
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,560
 They tag how conclusive the plot is.

392
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
 They tag how moral the characters are.

393
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,840
 And they just analyze everything.

394
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,480
 And all they want is to get you to watch more Netflix.

395
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,200
 So one of them said, you might like what I consider

396
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,560
 to be horrible movies.

397
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,240
 But my job right now is to get you to watch all those horrible

398
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
 movies that you want.

399
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,840
 And they have thousands of categories designed specifically

400
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,360
 for that.

401
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,480
 Who's specifically looking for things like this?

402
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,320
 That's what's so weird.

403
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,080
 Who wants a thing that's 80% conclusive

404
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,640
 with moderately moral characters?

405
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,920
 No one's searching for that in every week.

406
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,880
 That sounds fun.

407
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,680
 No, OK, maybe.

408
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,920
 Also, I think that there are films in their categorization

409
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,120
 filling isn't very good.

410
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,200
 So one of the ones that has nothing in it

411
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,760
 is suspenseful time travel movies.

412
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,520
 There's definitely got to be some of those.

413
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 Back to the future is suspenseful, right?

414
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,200
 Yes, yeah.

415
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,120
 Sentimental action and adventure.

416
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,960
 There must be one sentimental action film out there.

417
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,760
 Yeah, not everything's on Netflix, though.

418
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,520
 That's the issue, I guess.

419
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,000
 Back to the future, I don't think is on Netflix.

420
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,880
 Therefore, maybe they're just waiting to--

421
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 Yeah, it is, then, apparently.

422
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,200
 That guy at the back watched it this morning.

423
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
 Right after birthing his lambs.

424
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,400
 So Netflix released a load of their stats from 2017.

425
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
 And apparently, someone in New Zealand

426
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,240
 watched grown-ups 331 times, like you.

427
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,520
 Great movie.

428
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,280
 Absolutely.

429
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,920
 Great movie, but 331 times in a year.

430
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,000
 Apparently, there's a podcast called "The worst idea

431
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,920
 of all time" where they tell you to do that.

432
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,840
 So that's why they did that.

433
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,520
 Ah, cool.

434
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,040
 And there was one viewer in Antarctica

435
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,240
 who binged on Shameless.

436
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,600
 And there was one person in America

437
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,880
 who watched the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie

438
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,800
 every single day for a year.

439
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,640
 Wow.

440
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,280
 I'd rather do that than watch the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean

441
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,240
 movie once.

442
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,760
 [LAUGHTER]

443
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,440
 Netflix has shamed people for this, though.

444
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,320
 They sent our tweet in December last year,

445
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,800
 saying, "To the 53 people who've

446
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,760
 been watching a Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days,

447
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,720
 who hurt you?"

448
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
 [LAUGHTER]

449
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,280
 Oh, that's pretty mean.

450
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,720
 It's a combination of mean, creepy.

451
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,800
 Just one more thing that they've got about category-wise.

452
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,520
 They've got so many things starring the actor Raymond Burr.

453
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,040
 Uh-huh.

454
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
 Yeah.

455
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,440
 They've got suspenseful movies starring Raymond Burr.

456
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
 They've got cerebral mysteries starring Raymond Burr.

457
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,560
 They've got understated suspenseful dramas starring Raymond Burr.

458
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,560
 They've got about 15 Raymond Burr exclusive categories.

459
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,640
 It's very bizarre.

460
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,720
 That's so good.

461
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,840
 I know Netflix, I guess, from the last, let's say,

462
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,200
 five years, I think that's when I started using it.

463
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,040
 I had no idea that Netflix has been around since 1997.

464
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,760
 It's an extremely old company.

465
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,160
 It was extremely old.

466
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,800
 It's not general electric, is it?

467
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,160
 It's old for what-- I think most people

468
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,840
 perceive to be very, you know, 2000s, at least 2010s,

469
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,720
 something like that.

470
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,560
 It's kind of that thing.

471
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,200
 So I was looking into it.

472
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,520
 And it's a very interesting backstory.

473
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,240
 There's a number of stories that their creator and Netflix

474
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
 founder read Hastings puts out.

475
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
 One is that he got a very big bill for a VHS

476
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,800
 that he sent back into late.

477
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,720
 It was Apollo 13, and he thought there's

478
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,840
 got to be a better system.

479
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,120
 So he created it.

480
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,320
 And what it used to be is, like all those things

481
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,840
 where you would order a DVD off the internet,

482
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,920
 the difference was rather than getting a booklet that

483
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,200
 told you everything that was in it.

484
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,000
 Back in 1997, there was a website that would send you

485
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,880
 a VHS, and so you would just pick it from the website

486
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,400
 and order it.

487
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,280
 So we already had a web presence back then.

488
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,040
 But yeah, that's--

489
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,520
 I remember when it was just DVDs, and they send you DVDs

490
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,040
 through the post, and that still exists, that business.

491
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,720
 And it's still making money.

492
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,880
 But actually, in 2000, Reed Hastings approached

493
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,760
 blockbusters and asked them to buy Netflix

494
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,960
 for $50 million, the entire company.

495
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
 And they refused.

496
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 And--

497
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,960
 Wow.

498
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,360
 That did not age well, that decision, didn't it?

499
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,880
 Just one tiny little nugget about Reed Hastings,

500
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,320
 when I was reading into him.

501
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,480
 His grandfather was a very famous physicist,

502
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,640
 and he was very important in the roles of inventing radar

503
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,400
 and the atomic bomb for World War II.

504
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,280
 And President Roosevelt said of Reed's grandfather

505
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,240
 that he was a civilian who was second perhaps only

506
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,320
 to Winston Churchill in facilitating the allied victory

507
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,840
 in World War II.

508
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,880
 So his grandfather is a seriously important character.

509
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,960
 Yeah, sort of an unknown name to the general public.

510
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,320
 Wow, they've both made equally important contributions,

511
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,560
 I would say, to the able happiness of the world.

512
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
 The Reed Hastings story about its inception

513
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,800
 is quite amused as me, because there is this story he tells

514
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,280
 when it starts, how did you come up with Netflix?

515
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,000
 He says, I was overcharged for a film.

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,880
 And I was charged $40.

517
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
 It was a poly 13, charged $40.

518
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,480
 I'd lost the film.

519
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,720
 He said, I didn't want to tell my wife about it.

520
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
 And I said to myself, am I really

521
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,800
 going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late

522
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,560
 fee, which I would say is marriage is on shaky ground,

523
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,760
 if that's going to compromise its integrity?

524
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,720
 But so then he thought, OK, I'm going to start up

525
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,920
 a new company that doesn't do this.

526
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,640
 But his co-founder is called Mark Randolph.

527
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,520
 And he just keeps killing this story.

528
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,920
 So maybe he's exaggerated the story over time,

529
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,680
 or he's piecing things together that weren't together at the time.

530
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
 And Mark Randolph, every time he's interviewed,

531
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,400
 is like, no, it's bullshit, Reed Hastings story.

532
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,600
 No, no, it didn't happen.

533
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,080
 But it's a nice story, isn't it?

534
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,280
 So I let him tell it.

535
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,040
 Wow.

536
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,320
 Oh, I'm getting a story straight, guys.

537
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,680
 So Netflix and chill is the thing, isn't it?

538
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,200
 There's an article on fusion.com

539
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,160
 about the history of that phrase.

540
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,880
 And they said that the first use was in January 2009

541
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,800
 by @NoFaceNina on Twitter.

542
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,240
 And by summer of 2014, it had a slightly sexual meaning.

543
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,160
 And then by October, so a few months later,

544
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,320
 someone said that Netflix and chill never

545
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,040
 means Netflix and chill now, these days, lol.

546
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,000
 OK, so that was @itisIsak on Twitter.

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,320
 How many A's is that?

548
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,880
 Quite a lot.

549
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,600
 Well, maybe I just pressed the key too long on my keyboard,

550
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,960
 I'm sure.

551
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,640
 And then by the end of that year, it was all over Twitter.

552
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,480
 And then by August 2015, US parents

553
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,080
 were asking their kids what Netflix and chill meant.

554
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,480
 And they were using it.

555
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,120
 And that became the end of the meme.

556
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,280
 So basically, it lasted for less than six years

557
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,680
 from going from nothing to cool.

558
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,160
 To don't say that anymore.

559
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
 Yeah.

560
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,600
 My wife didn't know what Netflix and chill meant.

561
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,120
 The sexual context of it.

562
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,880
 And whenever--

563
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,280
 No, she had a baby, don't you?

564
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
 We do have a baby, yeah.

565
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,680
 And we were watching grownups for the 50th time

566
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,040
 when we conceived him.

567
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,080
 But we-- yeah, so whenever work finished for her,

568
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,040
 her bosses would be like, what are you up to tonight?

569
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,000
 I'm just going to be home with my husband, Netflix and chill.

570
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,040
 She thought, oh, we're just chilling.

571
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,920
 And I told her on a train what it meant and her face went, what?

572
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,480
 But at least she wasn't saying I'm going home

573
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,760
 to see my mum, Netflix and chill, you know?

574
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,200
 Like the husband, that's actually OK.

575
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
 That's true.

576
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,360
 Do you know that Netflix knows exactly

577
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,840
 when you will get hooked on a series?

578
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,800
 This is quite creepy, but it's also quite interesting.

579
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,720
 So it works out the exact point.

580
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,520
 The definition of being hooked is it

581
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,400
 works out the exact point at which 70% of people

582
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,120
 go on to finish the series.

583
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,320
 So that's the definition of being hooked.

584
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,680
 So breaking bad, you will be hooked by episode 2

585
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,800
 on average.

586
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,760
 How I met your mother, episode 8.

587
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,800
 I wonder with breaking bad if it's quicker to get hooked

588
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,680
 watching the show or taking Crystal Mep?

589
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,960
 Yeah.

590
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,160
 The Big Bang Theory apparently never.

591
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:05,800
 And for fans of the Big Bang Theory, that was a laugh.

592
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,840
 We have made a powerful enemy to actually talk.

593
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,600
 Just on the subject of breaking bad and drugs and being hooked,

594
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,160
 Netflix actually co-created drugs and released drugs.

595
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,360
 Well, it's a really old company, isn't it?

596
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,560
 Yeah.

597
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,400
 No, Netflix co-created a set of cannabis strains

598
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,040
 based on a selection of its popular original shows.

599
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,160
 And they did this.

600
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,200
 It was a pop-up event in West Hollywood

601
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
 for the alternative herbal health services

602
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,800
 and the set of drugs that you could buy

603
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,280
 were called the Netflix collection.

604
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,880
 And they were a part of helping to create these.

605
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,840
 So you could get ones that were made to tie in oranges

606
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,160
 and new black, you were tying with that.

607
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,480
 There were ones for arrested development,

608
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,800
 which were labeled the banana stand-cush.

609
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,560
 Yeah, ideally for a big yellow joint.

610
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,040
 That was the thing.

611
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,680
 And they did it for the Grace and Frankie TV show as well.

612
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,560
 So you can buy cannabis, which is co-created

613
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,640
 by Netflix and smoke it while you binge.

614
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,800
 And do they do the thing where you have two toaks and you go,

615
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,640
 oh, that's good.

616
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,400
 And someone comes up and goes, I think you might also

617
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,560
 like this, by the way.

618
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,000
 You say this?

619
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,760
 And maybe this one over there.

620
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,280
 Yeah.

621
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,000
 They don't make any profit from it, by the way.

622
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,640
 It was just that they just want to get people high.

623
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
 Come on.

624
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,960
 Did you know there is a Spanish platform, which is related?

625
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,280
 In fact, no, sorry, legally, it's unrelated.

626
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,560
 But there is a Spanish platform called Napflex, which

627
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,800
 is TV to fall asleep very easily, too.

628
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 And it might just be me.

629
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,040
 But I think all the stuff on it sounds really good.

630
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,480
 So there's a big bang theory.

631
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,040
 [LAUGHTER]

632
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,360
 Please, please edit those jokes at the show.

633
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,520
 Do you have the hope of having to come here on that one day, then?

634
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,080
 No, I just don't want to be killed by an army of nerds.

635
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,680
 I just don't know.

636
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,160
 They've got-- you might like this, James.

637
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,400
 We've got a four-hour video of the World Chess Championship 2013.

638
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,000
 You like chess?

639
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,480
 Yes, I do.

640
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,960
 I subscribe to a special chess channel.

641
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,080
 Do you?

642
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,680
 And I have a one-slug in a fan's of the big bang theory.

643
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,440
 Yeah.

644
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,600
 So Napflex ran a competition to fix its algorithm.

645
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
 So the thing it does where it recommends stuff

646
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,680
 that you might like, it has been a massively difficult thing

647
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,000
 to achieve over the years.

648
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,960
 In 2006, there was a $1 million award for anyone

649
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,560
 who could improve the recommendations algorithm.

650
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,360
 So it could actually recommend stuff that you genuinely would like.

651
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,680
 And it took three years to be won.

652
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,400
 It was won by this collective.

653
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,800
 And it improved the accuracy of the one they had by 10%.

654
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,000
 And it's so weird.

655
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 So all these coders were competing for it.

656
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,160
 It took three years.

657
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,360
 And then the people who won, and the people who came second,

658
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,680
 only submitted their bits 20 minutes apart.

659
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,960
 So they lost $1 million by 20 minutes.

660
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,480
 Wow.

661
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
 But the main challenge for these coders

662
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,680
 is Napoleon Dynamite.

663
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,480
 So--

664
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,200
 How do you mean?

665
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,440
 No algorithms seem to know if someone's

666
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,040
 going to like Napoleon Dynamite.

667
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,560
 That was it.

668
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,880
 And that was the challenge it was set.

669
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,160
 It was like, can you work out if someone will like Napoleon Dynamite?

670
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,200
 Because we don't know.

671
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
 There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.

672
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Wow.

673
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,840
 That's incredible.

674
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,560
 So I'm making $1 million in 20 minutes, which

675
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,920
 is, coincidentally, what the cost of the big bank theory do.

676
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,400
 We're going to have to move on in the set, guys, for our next fact.

677
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,600
 Did you see the survey that Napflex did last year

678
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,000
 on how people are watching?

679
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,280
 And so two-thirds of people watch Napflex in public now,

680
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,200
 or watch Stream in public, which I think is weird.

681
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,120
 Do you mean like on the train, or on the bus?

682
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,600
 Yeah, on the train, on the commuter work, whatever.

683
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,720
 I know I have a phone from 2001, so maybe that's why I don't do it.

684
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,520
 So this is last year, and it found that 65% of people

685
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,200
 have burst out laughing on public transport while watching it.

686
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,040
 20% have cried in public, and then been embarrassed about it.

687
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,000
 But 27% of people who've been streaming stuff

688
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,640
 in public on public transport, for example,

689
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,760
 have had strangers interrupt them while they're

690
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,600
 watching to start talking about the show that they're watching.

691
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,320
 Is that a thing?

692
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,920
 I once-- OK.

693
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,480
 I was in Japan once.

694
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,480
 I was in Tokyo, and I was on one of the subway trains.

695
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,480
 And I noticed the phone of the guy sitting next to me.

696
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,080
 He was a wester guy, and he was listening

697
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,440
 to no such thing as a fish.

698
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,840
 And I-- no, hang on.

699
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,280
 He was-- no, wait, the story hang on.

700
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,640
 He was watching QI, and I leaned over to him,

701
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,320
 and I said, I wrote that, and he did not believe me.

702
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,840
 And I know from the way he said, oh, OK.

703
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,800
 And they got off at the next stop.

704
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,120
 On the flight over from Australia to New Zealand,

705
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,960
 there was a guy sat in front of me, you, and Anna,

706
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,720
 who was listening to no such thing as a fish.

707
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,560
 Yeah, that's right.

708
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,960
 And we were chatting behind him.

709
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,920
 He must have been so freaked out when he took his headphones off.

710
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,280
 This has all got a bit more boring very quickly.

711
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,000
 We need to move on to our next fact, guys.

712
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,120
 OK, and it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

713
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,920
 OK, my fact this week is that in Sacred Maché combat,

714
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,120
 the aim was not to kill your opponent,

715
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,400
 but to knock his hat off.

716
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,960
 And the loser didn't go off that easily,

717
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,600
 though, because he would immediately be sacrificed.

718
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,760
 No, you lose your hat.

719
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,640
 But fortunately, you won't have a head anymore to put it on.

720
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,680
 So the Maché were a civilization from Peru.

721
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,000
 And I learned this last year when I visited the Laco Museum

722
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,320
 of Pre-Columbian Art in Lima.

723
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,880
 And we know about this because all we know about these people,

724
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,640
 they're really mysterious, but everything

725
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
 we know comes from their pottery.

726
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,000
 And we have kind of the like little cartoons of what happens.

727
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,760
 So that's how we know about it.

728
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,520
 That's very cool.

729
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,480
 What kind of hats are they?

730
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,320
 Is it like a top hat?

731
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
 Because the top hat would be quite easy to knock off,

732
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,560
 but then a beanie is quite difficult.

733
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,080
 That's true.

734
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,680
 And a bike helmet, almost impossible.

735
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,800
 Yeah.

736
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,040
 They were large feathery kind of feather pieces.

737
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,880
 Sounds easy.

738
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,680
 Sounds easy.

739
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,880
 Yeah, it is easy.

740
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,200
 Well, really, they just wanted someone to sacrifice.

741
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,720
 Yeah, I don't think they really gave a shit who it was.

742
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,320
 And I think sometimes they also then sacrifice the winner,

743
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,520
 right?

744
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
 There's someone who's the thing in me, so I don't know how I can go.

745
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,400
 But they'd sacrifice a guy whose hat got knocked off,

746
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,960
 but then they thought the gods also deserved their best warriors,

747
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,120
 so they would sometimes also sacrifice the one

748
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,280
 who'd won the battle.

749
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,560
 Wow.

750
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,120
 It's a real catch, 22.

751
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,600
 That's terrible, yeah.

752
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,360
 Oh, it is.

753
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,760
 It's a matter of the pre-show interview,

754
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,960
 like the pre-match interviews.

755
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
 How are you feeling about the match?

756
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,800
 Not good.

757
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,560
 [LAUGHTER]

758
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,880
 Yeah, I didn't know that they made rubber balls.

759
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,000
 Yes, they did.

760
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,120
 Some of them, yeah.

761
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,200
 The old mechs, especially.

762
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
 Yes, the sum of me, so Americans, they made rubber balls.

763
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,360
 And they could make a match, different compounds.

764
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,040
 This is very cool.

765
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,600
 And some of them had the scientists believe

766
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,800
 that they made 16,000 balls a year in special rubber ball factories.

767
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,400
 Wow.

768
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 Yeah, this is--

769
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,280
 Yeah, this is impressive.

770
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,640
 This is very true, though, does it?

771
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
 Not factories, come on.

772
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
 It's got the word fact in it, James.

773
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,440
 [LAUGHTER]

774
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,240
 Is this the mezzo-American ballgame that we're talking about?

775
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,560
 Is this-- I thought that was a much slightly slightly different

776
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,360
 to Sacred Mote hat combat.

777
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,240
 It's the later mezzo-American ballgame.

778
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,680
 Yeah, they play with these balls,

779
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,640
 and it's a crazy game.

780
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,000
 And again, historians are not quite sure

781
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,840
 whether when the loser and the winner

782
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,600
 are determined who were the ones that

783
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,280
 were murdered and sacrificed off the back of it.

784
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,640
 So they think it might have been the losers who got sacrificed.

785
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,360
 But actually, the gods were more interested

786
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,800
 in the best blood and the most skillful.

787
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,400
 So actually, you would probably kill the better team,

788
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,000
 the winners.

789
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,160
 And there was this extra thing where they would chop their heads off.

790
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,640
 And some historians believe that then

791
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,040
 they took the heads of the opponents

792
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,720
 and then used those as a post-match ballgame

793
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,520
 to then play with their heads.

794
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,400
 There are pictures of that happening.

795
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,960
 Pictures?

796
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,440
 Yeah, the drawings that we have of them doing that.

797
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,320
 And they would also drink out of them sometimes.

798
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,040
 So the post-match skull would be used as a drinking vessel.

799
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 Wow.

800
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
 They would recycle.

801
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,080
 It's not a way to drive up the quality of the game,

802
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,440
 I think, to kill good teams and bad teams alike.

803
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
 Yeah.

804
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,880
 I think that's why we should say they almost certainly

805
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,600
 didn't do this the vast majority of the time.

806
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,520
 I read a really good analogy, which was,

807
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,720
 imagine if in 5,000 years people looked

808
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,120
 at all of the Christian art that we have now

809
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,720
 and thought, wow, this is so weird.

810
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,760
 They just crucified people left, right, and set

811
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,240
 her every time they went to church.

812
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,720
 Just because that's the thing that remains.

813
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,960
 The image that remains.

814
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,720
 It probably did happen, but probably not often.

815
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,640
 Yeah, they seem to have really disliked

816
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,280
 a particular look in people.

817
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,080
 And if you had a beard and you had dark hair,

818
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,840
 you'd be crucified.

819
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
 There was--

820
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,800
 So they do have really interesting pottery, the Maché people.

821
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,080
 And there was an exhibition in Paris a few years ago

822
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,200
 about it was called Sex Death and Sacrifice

823
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,240
 in the Maché religion.

824
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,720
 And it had to have a warning on the way in about explicit content,

825
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,360
 even though this is from how long ago, 2,000 years ago?

826
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,840
 Yeah, best part of that.

827
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,760
 But have you seen it?

828
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,120
 Because it is pretty hard-cut.

829
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,120
 I've got some good things on my computer

830
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,680
 that stop me having to look at that sort of thing.

831
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,960
 Well, I do not have that.

832
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,840
 [LAUGHTER]

833
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,960
 Although actually in Venice, I went to this museum.

834
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,480
 So this Laco museum, they have an annex for erotic pottery.

835
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
 Your pottery.

836
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,480
 There's also, if you can't get down to Lima,

837
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,240
 there's a really good article on Traveller.com

838
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,000
 about that annex entitled Fifty Shades of Clay.

839
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,280
 [LAUGHTER]

840
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
 Superb.

841
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,920
 But in the museum, they're under different categories.

842
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
 Like Netflix, kind of.

843
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,960
 And there's the union of animals, fruits, and deities,

844
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,680
 sexual activity of the dead.

845
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,360
 That's not in Netflix category.

846
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,800
 [LAUGHTER]

847
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,000
 I better have that special thing on your Netflix.

848
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,400
 It doesn't let you watch those.

849
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,240
 It costs between animals.

850
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,280
 That includes frogs, mice, dogs, llamas, monkeys,

851
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,400
 and ears of corn.

852
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,200
 [LAUGHTER]

853
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,000
 Wow.

854
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,720
 In that museum, they have a part of a man receiving oral sex

855
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,960
 that they call in the museum, the Bill Clinton pot.

856
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,960
 [LAUGHTER]

857
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,480
 Is it-- they were such an advanced civilization

858
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,000
 that bought trade.

859
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,480
 Incredible.

860
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,000
 They are.

861
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,520
 When these are referred to, they're always referred

862
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
 to as sex pots.

863
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,560
 And this is in, like, archaeological papers.

864
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,680
 And they talk about the amount of sex pots.

865
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,480
 And you can't take it seriously at all.

866
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,440
 Crass over, Crass over.

867
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,960
 Oh my god.

868
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,160
 It's a Crass over, Crass over.

869
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

870
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,880
 What they can do, what they're going to do,

871
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,760
 how they're going to get it together?

872
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,360
 Oh.

873
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,560
 Yeah, so the Mocce are--

874
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,560
 [LAUGHTER]

875
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,840
 OK, so where were we, guys?

876
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
 How about you would just tell us about--

877
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,360
 I don't know, James, it was three months ago.

878
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,720
 You would tell us about sex pots.

879
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,200
 Ah, sex pots.

880
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,240
 Yes, but actually, I wanted to move on now

881
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,000
 to talk about knocking hats off.

882
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,520
 Can we do that?

883
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,960
 This is a fact about knocking hats off.

884
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,320
 That's right, yeah.

885
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,440
 So I was looking into the history of that,

886
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,000
 an easy thing to research.

887
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,920
 And I found out that 200 years ago, in the Ottoman Empire,

888
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,320
 if you knocked off someone's turban,

889
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,800
 it was punishable by death.

890
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,560
 Wow.

891
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,800
 And I discovered this because I was reading an account

892
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,680
 in 1799 of a Christian who was taken to court,

893
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,120
 because they were accused of knocking off a Muslim's turban.

894
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,920
 And the Christian's explanation, which

895
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,040
 seemed to be believed by the court,

896
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,720
 was that the Muslim had been wearing a blue turban, which

897
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,480
 looked exactly like the turban that his friend usually wore.

898
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,080
 So he said he'd knocked it off as a prank,

899
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,320
 because he thought it was his mate.

900
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,920
 And then the guy had turned around and it wasn't.

901
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,280
 And in fact, he ended up getting off Scott free,

902
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,880
 and the judge ended up punishing the Muslim for wearing

903
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,160
 a blue turban when he was supposed to be wearing a green one.

904
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,080
 Oh, no, that's cool.

905
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,360
 I got a couple of hat things, just very quickly.

906
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,920
 On George Orwell's 110th birthday,

907
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,000
 it was celebrated in a little Dutch town

908
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,360
 by these artists putting little hats on every single CCTV

909
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,280
 camera around there.

910
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
 Apparently it's loaded.

911
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,640
 Well, just to make them look cute.

912
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,600
 Just to sort of show how his vision has come true, basically,

913
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,760
 from the book.

914
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,160
 I don't remember the hats being in the book.

915
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,560
 It was the unedited, unabridged.

916
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,360
 Yeah.

917
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,200
 Party version.

918
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,240
 It's those hats that you get on innocent smoothie bottles.

919
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,000
 They came originally from 1984 CCTV.

920
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 It's very sweet.

921
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,320
 Here's another one.

922
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,680
 Paul Petrol, the cartoon for kids.

923
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,600
 Don't know if you guys know it.

924
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,120
 No.

925
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
 Massive cartoon.

926
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,600
 It's ginormous.

927
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,560
 You're backing me up, right?

928
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,040
 It's ginormous.

929
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,760
 They had to--

930
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,040
 Dad, who are you talking to?

931
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,280
 I was pretending a well-entered audience member was here.

932
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,120
 Am I right, guys?

933
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,520
 It's massive.

934
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
 There we go.

935
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,840
 Shit, one came back with us.

936
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,160
 Yeah, Paul Petrol.

937
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,960
 They had to recall a firefighting hat that they had,

938
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,240
 because it turned out it was a fire hazard.

939
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
 Yeah, I'm reading.

940
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,440
 Yeah, so, yeah.

941
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,000
 I need to record that.

942
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,800
 OK, is time for our final fact to the show.

943
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,040
 And that's my fact.

944
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,320
 My fact, nine weeks ago, is that pseudonyms that Elton John

945
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,080
 has used when checking into a hotel include

946
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,600
 Sir Binky Poodleclip, Judas Fart, and the Marquis of Minge.

947
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,160
 You did that last time.

948
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,000
 It's Marquis.

949
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,800
 It's Marquis.

950
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,000
 Marquis, because a Marquis is a big tent.

951
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,240
 Well, you have weddings and stuff.

952
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,960
 And a Marquis of Minge is a completely different thing, I think.

953
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,160
 I seem to remember the audience who well-entered thought

954
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,040
 that was quite amusing, as well.

955
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,560
 I mean, I think was that an intentional attempt

956
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,800
 to recreate the atmosphere?

957
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,600
 Or was you've forgotten the 10 minutes of ribbing

958
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,280
 that you got behind, actually?

959
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,680
 You think I've learned?

960
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,320
 Anyway, the tent of Minge, the Binky Poodleclip,

961
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,000
 too, is not.

962
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,800
 Anyway, he does this when he goes to hotels.

963
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,640
 Obviously, a lot of people do that anyway.

964
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,120
 Celebrities like to give themselves a pseudonym

965
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,040
 so that the press can't find them and fans can't find them

966
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,920
 when they're in town.

967
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
 He likes to pick these particularly dirty ones,

968
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,640
 because it actually affects the people

969
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,400
 trying to get in touch with him that he knows.

970
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,360
 So, for example, he said that his mother keeps complaining

971
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,480
 to him saying things like, "I can't believe you've asked me

972
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,640
 to ring and ask for a sehorus pussy."

973
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,480
 It's enough like that.

974
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,920
 He's also gone for a Humphrey Handbag and Bobo Latrine.

975
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,960
 Yeah, I'm Brian Bigbum.

976
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,480
 Nice.

977
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,800
 You say they're so dirty.

978
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,520
 They're like an eight-year-old version of dirty, aren't they?

979
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,640
 Actually, what I quite like, as well,

980
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,320
 is that his name itself is a pseudonym, anyway.

981
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,840
 Yeah.

982
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,520
 He could probably go back to his original name.

983
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,560
 What are they old Dwight?

984
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,360
 Regional Dwight, and he has a middle name.

985
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,600
 Yes, is it Hercules?

986
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,440
 That's right, yeah.

987
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,440
 Have you thought Elton John and Regional Dwight,

988
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,040
 they're all first names.

989
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,080
 So, both of his names are those weird names

990
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,840
 where two people have the first name.

991
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,680
 Yeah.

992
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,520
 Yeah, you're right.

993
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,840
 Like Steve Martin or David Cameron.

994
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,560
 But we can't go on doing this all day.

995
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,360
 It's really, it's a fun game to play at home

996
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,200
 is to think of people who've got two first names.

997
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,520
 But actually, of all those names,

998
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,360
 I would say Elton is the least first name of all of them.

999
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,840
 And he's chosen that as his first name.

1000
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,680
 That's true.

1001
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,520
 Yeah, you're right.

1002
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,360
 Ben Elton.

1003
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,320
 Ben Elton.

1004
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,720
 Yeah, Ben Elton.

1005
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,640
 Oh, god.

1006
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,520
 Honestly, I've got a list of about 30,

1007
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,200
 which I compiled a few years ago.

1008
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,160
 I remember us all compiling them together.

1009
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,800
 I like that you've turned this into it

1010
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,560
 being your solo project.

1011
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,280
 Is that how you all remember the broadcasts?

1012
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,480
 (laughing)

1013
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,680
 Just to quickly say, Hercules is the middle name

1014
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,960
 of his pseudonym, Elton John.

1015
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,800
 That's right.

1016
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,640
 It's not his real name.

1017
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,320
 I heard that he named it after the horse

1018
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,680
 in that old sitcom Steps on Sun.

1019
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,840
 But I don't know if that's true.

1020
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,960
 Oh, I really don't know if that's true.

1021
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
 The middle name, Hercules.

1022
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,160
 Yeah.

1023
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,000
 Yeah.

1024
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
 It wasn't the horse's middle name.

1025
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,680
 There was it.

1026
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,160
 It was the horse's first and only name.

1027
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,000
 He only had one name.

1028
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,320
 It was like Madonna in that respect.

1029
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,160
 Well, it might not have been.

1030
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,440
 You just never know a horse's surname

1031
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,200
 because they get very little post.

1032
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,240
 (laughing)

1033
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,080
 Very good point.

1034
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,240
 Yeah.

1035
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,040
 On musical pseudonyms,

1036
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,000
 Elton John recorded a version of Lucy

1037
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,240
 in the Sky with Diamonds in 1973

1038
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
 and John Lennon played on it.

1039
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,880
 But lots of the Beatles,

1040
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,840
 when they're recording other things,

1041
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,960
 they use pseudonyms.

1042
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,280
 And John Lennon's was Winston O Boogey.

1043
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
 Nice.

1044
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,960
 Yeah.

1045
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,560
 Winston, of course, being his middle name,

1046
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,480
 John Lennon's middle name.

1047
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,320
 Ah!

1048
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,720
 And O Boogey being his mother's maiden name, I think.

1049
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
 Yes.

1050
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,440
 I always hate doing Beatles facts with Dan here

1051
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,760
 'cause he has to pretend to be excited to learn it.

1052
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,720
 But you know that he knows all of them.

1053
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,360
 I have a test for Dan.

1054
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,200
 Go on.

1055
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,040
 A Beatles test.

1056
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,880
 Oh, yeah.

1057
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,800
 So John Lennon and Paul McCartney,

1058
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,160
 they only played one gig together as a double act.

1059
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,960
 It was in 1960 at a pub in Caversham.

1060
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
 What were they called?

1061
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,000
 Er, well, I can't remember.

1062
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,120
 They were called the Nirk twins.

1063
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,200
 Yeah, that's right.

1064
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,040
 (laughing)

1065
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,640
 Oh, you should have given him more time.

1066
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,480
 Yeah.

1067
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
 You should have given up so many times.

1068
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,000
 (laughing)

1069
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,080
 There were only three people drinking in the pub,

1070
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,720
 and nobody knew who they were anyway.

1071
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,760
 It's so easy for you to just say the Nirk twins now.

1072
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,680
 The Nirk twins?

1073
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,520
 That's right.

1074
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,360
 Yes.

1075
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,480
 (laughing)

1076
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
 Someone else who chooses funny names

1077
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,200
 in order to embarrass people is Kate Beckinsale,

1078
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,440
 who says that she chooses the name Segoni Beaver

1079
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,880
 when she books into hotels,

1080
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,680
 because she really likes, well, first of all,

1081
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,240
 'cause she really admires Segoni Weaver,

1082
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,280
 and there's no way of saying that,

1083
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,200
 which actually seems like not a way to admire someone.

1084
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,040
 (laughing)

1085
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,760
 And also because she says her husband hates it

1086
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,800
 when hotel employees call him Mr. Beaver.

1087
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,320
 (laughing)

1088
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
 Which you can understand.

1089
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,640
 I don't believe her isn't the first name

1090
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,480
 if you're thinking about that.

1091
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
 No, no.

1092
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,160
 (laughing)

1093
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
 I get confused by this checking into hotels thing,

1094
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,040
 'cause I think they just ask you for a passport

1095
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
 when you check into a hotel,

1096
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,560
 and no one, I don't think Kate Beckinsale

1097
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,880
 has had a passport made up.

1098
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,720
 Exactly.

1099
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,560
 Or it's a labor affair.

1100
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,040
 You have to give a credit card or something, don't you?

1101
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,880
 Exactly.

1102
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,960
 Except Elton John, when he does get to these hotels,

1103
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,680
 he sends his pseudonym ahead,

1104
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,360
 and they used to make up office stationery for him

1105
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
 when he arrived in the room.

1106
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,720
 It would have his pseudonym on it,

1107
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,600
 headed paper, and so on.

1108
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,200
 Which is quite cool, so, you know.

1109
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,040
 Yeah.

1110
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,320
 I think you have to be famous, don't you?

1111
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,200
 So I think our personal experience, I suppose,

1112
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,320
 is them just looking at your passport or credit card,

1113
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,120
 but maybe if you're Elton John or John Lennon,

1114
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,360
 they make some, you know, allowances.

1115
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,800
 We've got a marquee coming to the hotel.

1116
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,640
 (laughing)

1117
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,800
 Better give it a big room.

1118
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,600
 (laughing)

1119
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,120
 So I'm confused talking of passports.

1120
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,520
 People seem to book flights under pseudonyms a lot,

1121
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,960
 or they claim that they do.

1122
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,880
 So Marinin Monroe apparently book flights

1123
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,240
 under the name Zelda Zonk.

1124
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,800
 Again, not a thing you can actually do

1125
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,120
 when you're booking a flight in my experience.

1126
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,960
 You could in the '50s or '60s.

1127
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,920
 Johnny Depp says he does it.

1128
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,080
 Johnny Depp claims that he's always giving himself pseudonyms

1129
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,240
 and he books loads of tickets in that name.

1130
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,880
 I reckon he must take private jets, right?

1131
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,720
 Yeah.

1132
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,560
 Poor him.

1133
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,320
 Johnny Depp at the moment, he's like, basically,

1134
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,720
 he spends all his money on ridiculous things, doesn't he?

1135
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,560
 Yeah.

1136
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,360
 Yeah, like he shuts Hunter S. Thompson's ashes into space

1137
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,200
 and stuff like that.

1138
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,040
 Yeah.

1139
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,080
 So I reckon he's a private jet guy.

1140
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,920
 Yeah.

1141
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,400
 But also, actually, Elton John has been in trouble

1142
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
 for spending too much money, hasn't he?

1143
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,840
 Has he?

1144
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,840
 He was suing someone for not looking after his expenses properly.

1145
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,600
 And in that court case, they said that he spent

1146
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,680
 £40 million over a 20-month period,

1147
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,400
 including £293,000 on flowers.

1148
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,240
 Wow.

1149
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,760
 That's a lot of flowers, isn't it?

1150
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,240
 And they asked him in court, they said,

1151
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,040
 do you have any reason to think that these figures

1152
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,880
 are inaccurate?

1153
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
 And Elton John said, probably not.

1154
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,280
 And he said, really, £293,000 on flowers alone,

1155
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,840
 is that even possible?

1156
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,080
 And Elton John said, yes, I like flowers.

1157
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,320
 Fair enough.

1158
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,640
 He knows his own mind.

1159
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,080
 Check-off used to write under pseudonyms

1160
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,400
 when he submitted short stories.

1161
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
 And he had really good ones.

1162
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,920
 So he submitted stories to magazines with names

1163
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,960
 that included man without a spleen, which

1164
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,640
 was his most common.

1165
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,600
 So he wrote 119 short stories under the name

1166
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,960
 man without a spleen.

1167
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,800
 He also was doctor without patients.

1168
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,640
 And my brother's brother, for no particular reason.

1169
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,600
 He was a doctor, wasn't he?

1170
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,280
 He was a doctor, yeah, yeah.

1171
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,800
 I wonder if he took his own spleen out

1172
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,040
 to make him run faster.

1173
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,120
 Because that's the thing, isn't it?

1174
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,880
 If you take your spleen out, you run faster.

1175
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,040
 It's not a common thing, is it?

1176
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,280
 No.

1177
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,880
 But it is a fact that James had been trying

1178
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,960
 to get into the podcast for the last six months.

1179
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,000
 I could go set it.

1180
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,080
 I'd go, sure.

1181
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,320
 I think you crowbar it in this fact as well.

1182
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,160
 I'm a Wellington.

1183
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,000
 I've a fact I didn't say in the Wellington show, actually.

1184
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,160
 This is about musical student names and musical doubles.

1185
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,880
 So have you heard of the band The Zombies?

1186
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,120
 They're big six T's, and they're not really big anymore.

1187
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,720
 But they only became famous two years

1188
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,120
 after they broke up.

1189
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,640
 So that was probably-- yeah, the song was

1190
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,560
 "Time of the Season" that went really big for them.

1191
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,040
 But they didn't know they were famous in the USA,

1192
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,000
 because they were a British band.

1193
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,560
 And communications were much worse then.

1194
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,760
 So there was a band from Dallas who just pretended

1195
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,720
 to be The Zombies and went on tour as The Zombies.

1196
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,120
 Very successfully.

1197
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,120
 And then, bizarrely, in 1969, there were two separate bands

1198
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,800
 touring America as The Zombies being managed

1199
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,280
 by a proper record label and everything.

1200
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,840
 Are the fake zombies that had a training period?

1201
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,920
 Do you think that the fake zombies bit the other guys

1202
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,440
 that they became fake zombies?

1203
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1204
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,720
 That's amazing.

1205
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,160
 I know.

1206
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,960
 Nobody notices that the lead singer was the wrong sex.

1207
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,680
 I've just completed different sex

1208
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,920
 from the actual zombies that came.

1209
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,440
 Actually, British zombies ever got to America are.

1210
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,760
 I don't know.

1211
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,440
 I don't know.

1212
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,240
 Amazing.

1213
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,800
 Yeah, bizarre.

1214
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,280
 Do you know the person who's acted in more plays than anyone else?

1215
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,760
 And this is related to pseudonyms?

1216
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,560
 Is it Garrick?

1217
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,080
 No.

1218
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,720
 Is it someone who's got a lot of pseudonyms?

1219
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,560
 It's actually a pseudonym, not a person.

1220
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
 Oh.

1221
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,120
 Is it, like, Alan Smithy or something like that?

1222
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,800
 It's George Spellvin.

1223
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,320
 So this is a name that's a credit that's been going on since 1886,

1224
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,680
 which is that if you're in a play,

1225
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,120
 if you're doing a performance that A, your turn

1226
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,560
 bar has to be credited for, because it doesn't suit

1227
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,160
 your reputation, or sometimes if you're playing two roles

1228
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,600
 in the same play and in the program,

1229
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,480
 you don't want to give away that you're that person as well.

1230
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,160
 You call yourself George Spellvin.

1231
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,280
 And it's been happening since 1882.

1232
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,280
 And there are various different ones in different countries.

1233
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,000
 So it's George Eau Spellvin in an Italian play.

1234
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,960
 It's George Et or Georgina when it's French.

1235
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,760
 And yeah.

1236
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,280
 It's brilliant.

1237
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,840
 The last one, the last case actually,

1238
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,440
 was in 1988 in Edwin Druid, the Dictatory character,

1239
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,400
 which we talked about, that musical--

1240
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,560
 the Edwin Druid musical.

1241
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,360
 Oh, yeah.

1242
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
 Oh, cool.

1243
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,960
 That's so weird, because the Alan Smithy thing

1244
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,520
 goes on post-production.

1245
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,200
 So just to explain, that is the same thing, but with movies, right?

1246
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,720
 Exactly.

1247
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,400
 And it usually is for screenwriters.

1248
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,240
 When a screenwriter hates the fact

1249
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,560
 that it's been rewritten so much, they want their name off it.

1250
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,240
 And Alan Smithy is in its place.

1251
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,080
 But again, that's post-production usually,

1252
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,160
 whereas this sounds like you're in the moment

1253
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,680
 embarrassed of the thing that you're in.

1254
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,800
 And all the rest of the cast are going, oh, really?

1255
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,840
 [LAUGHTER]

1256
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
 Actually, we'll never mind.

1257
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,840
 [LAUGHTER]

1258
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,120
 You have to finish that, though.

1259
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,160
 I don't know, I don't know.

1260
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,840
 It's going to be-- it's going to be your atters.

1261
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
 Yeah.

1262
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
 Yeah, yeah, sorry.

1263
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,800
 That's what you're going for.

1264
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,600
 I'm not parting the ass.

1265
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,720
 Yeah.

1266
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,600
 Which nationality will he go for?

1267
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,200
 [LAUGHTER]

1268
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,480
 So things in hotels, like what you can ask for.

1269
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,160
 Yeah.

1270
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,200
 I saw a website where they asked a lot of people who worked

1271
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,960
 in hotels.

1272
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,280
 And there was someone in Seattle who had someone who came

1273
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,040
 to the hotel who asked for a pillow fort.

1274
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,400
 And apparently, this happens quite a lot.

1275
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,360
 But these guys, as well as a pillow fort,

1276
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,480
 they wanted a towel folded in the shape of an elephant.

1277
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,720
 And if possible, a sexy picture of some fruit on the night

1278
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,760
 table.

1279
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
 [LAUGHTER]

1280
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,080
 And did I tell them to do it?

1281
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,160
 They sure did.

1282
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
 Wow.

1283
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,480
 How did they make the fruit sexy?

1284
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,720
 Was it carving or was it positioning?

1285
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
 I think it's just a banana and two plums.

1286
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,200
 [LAUGHTER]

1287
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,000
 I don't know.

1288
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,160
 They didn't say what it was.

1289
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,960
 It's a shame.

1290
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,800
 So much opportunity to be creative there.

1291
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,880
 Just on names.

1292
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,880
 There's a guy who's written a dictionary of surnames.

1293
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,240
 I think a couple of years ago, he's called Patrick Hanks.

1294
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,520
 And he looked into the most likely meanings for surnames.

1295
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,080
 And do you know what Shakespeare probably meant?

1296
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,120
 So just light, literally, shaking a spear?

1297
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,560
 Yes, you're going to get there.

1298
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,000
 Is someone in a battle?

1299
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,280
 You've gone the wrong direction.

1300
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,000
 It was a medieval term for masturbator.

1301
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,880
 Oh, I was so far away.

1302
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,760
 Shaking a spear.

1303
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,400
 I felt like you'd picked the right direction

1304
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,600
 for once you went highbrow.

1305
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,080
 [LAUGHTER]

1306
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,720
 Who would have thought, wow, is that right?

1307
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,400
 Is that right?

1308
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,600
 Yeah, probably from an obscene medieval term for masturbator.

1309
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,160
 So was it still known that meaning when Shakespeare

1310
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,440
 was writing his place?

1311
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,240
 He's not clear.

1312
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,640
 But it could well be that, yeah, you'd

1313
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,120
 go and see Romeo and Juliet by the great masturbator.

1314
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,360
 [LAUGHTER]

1315
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
 He would have worked it out.

1316
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,200
 He was a great linguist.

1317
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,560
 He would have worked it out.

1318
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,920
 Because he was always doing little double entendres

1319
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,760
 and stuff, wasn't it?

1320
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
 That's true.

1321
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,280
 He was.

1322
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,640
 There were some very rude ones.

1323
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,680
 I won't repeat them now.

1324
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,840
 But does that mean one of his great, great, great, great grand

1325
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,880
 fathers was a masturbator?

1326
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,640
 Is that what we're saying?

1327
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,960
 Yeah, for it as a job, I guess.

1328
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,960
 Yeah.

1329
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,760
 [LAUGHTER]

1330
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,960
 Smith is blacksmith.

1331
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,320
 Masturbators, masturbators.

1332
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,120
 The medievalized street for the smitty bakery,

1333
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,360
 the masturbatorium.

1334
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1335
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,400
 It's very sad.

1336
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,120
 We used to have three masturbatorians on this street.

1337
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,560
 They will become charity masturbatorians now.

1338
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,400

1339
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,280
 OK, that's it.
