WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
 (upbeat music)

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi everyone, just before we start this show,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.960
 I wanted to let you know that James and I

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.920
 are going to be doing a talk chat,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.280
 a lecture at the Hay Festival in Hay on Y,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.520
 next Wednesday, the 29th of May,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.040
 and we are gonna be chatting about our new release

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.360
 of the paperback, A Load of Old Balls,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.040
 which is all the most interesting facts

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.080
 and things we learned about sports.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.180
 It's for sports lovers, it's for sports haters,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.960
 it's for sports skeptics,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 you've got Mary Queen of Scots football in there,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.440
 you've got Michael Palin's Concord Tournament,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.800
 you've got lacrosse games involving over 100,000 players.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.120
 There's something for everyone.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400
 Do come and listen to us.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.240
 Hay is such a fun festival anyway,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.600
 so to get tickets for that,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.120
 and while you're there,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600
 obviously buy tickets for our tour,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.840
 if you haven't already, which you should have.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.960
 On with the show.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.540
 (upbeat music)

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.840
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.340
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.980
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.140
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.620
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.740
 James Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.860
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.560
 of our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.400
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.600
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.880
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the coroner

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.740
 who did the autopsy of President McKinley

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.340
 injected part of him into a dog.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.700
 So, he was autopsied by two doctors

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.140
 called Harvey Gaylord and Herman Matzinger,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.760
 and Matzinger wanted to find out

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.180
 whether the bullet that killed McKinley

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.940
 had been poisoned or had some bacteria on it,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.140
 like a biological weapon.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.220
 And so, the way he did it was he took samples

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.740
 from the wound and he injected parts of it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.300
 into some rabbits and a dog,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.580
 and wanted to see how the rabbits and dogs reacted,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.460
 because if there was poison on the bullet,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.940
 maybe they would die and that would be evidence

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 that he'd been poisoned as well as shot.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.860
 - And?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.060
 - And it turns out that the thing that killed him

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 was the bullet that went right through his body.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.060
 - Yeah, the dog was fine, wasn't it?

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.500
 In the notes that were given, sort of said,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 he was acting fine, doesn't mention the rabbit.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.700
 - No, it doesn't mention the rabbit.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.540
 It said that he was acting well, the dog,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.180
 but his body temperature was around 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.500
 - Is that good or bad for a dog?

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.020
 - It's bad for a dog.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.260
 It should be a bit lower than that.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.220
 - You can react badly to an injection,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.420
 I certainly do at any time.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.860
 I get a raised temperature.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.420
 We should say this was 1901 as well,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.780
 just for anyone who's not up on their presidents,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.100
 President McKinley around 20th-ish.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.340
 - 25th, I think?

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.180
 - He was 25th president, that's right.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.940
 - So why am I talking about this today

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.620
 if it was something that happened around 1900?

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.900
 Well, we don't talk to us anymore.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.180
 (laughing)

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180
 - This is a new feature.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.100
 - Well, in the news this year,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.380
 there was an auction site called the Raab Collection

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.900
 and they found the personal papers

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.980
 of this Dr. Herman Matzinga

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.940
 and that gave us all of this information

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.860
 about him injecting the president into the dog,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.500
 which we didn't know until this year.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.340
 - That's very cool.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.220
 - He was actually, no wonder he liked animals

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.820
 'cause he was a buffalo doctor.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.220
 And when I say buffalo doctor,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.900
 he was a doctor who lived in the city of Buffalo

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780
 in New York. - Who's that Matzinga?

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.580
 - That was Matzinga, yeah, right.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.140
 I just thought I'd try and trick you guys there.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.980
 - Good trick.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.540
 But he wasn't the first man

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.740
 to even look after McKinley when he came in.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.620
 That was a different man called Dr. Mann

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.300
 and Dr. Mann, Dr. Matthew Mann,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.420
 and he wasn't even a proper surgeon.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.740
 He was a gynecologist.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.500
 He was a gynecological surgeon.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.340
 - Oh no.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.660
 - This man has no vagina.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.460
 - It's all going into openings, isn't it?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.900
 When someone's been shot.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.580
 - That's true. - What a comforting thing to hear.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.340
 Dr. Anna says you lie on the operating table.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.340
 Look, it's all just stuff going in places.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.380
 Don't worry.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.540
 - It's all holes in the body.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.820
 - Let's inspect your chest vagina now.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.460
 - Oh, the exit vagina is a lot bigger.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.180
 - But the weird thing is

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.340
 Thomas Edison gets involved at this point.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.420
 - Of course he does.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.900
 - He sent to Buffalo a new X-ray machine,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.580
 which is exactly like first ever episode of the podcast,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.140
 James Garfield's shot.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.740
 In that case, it was Alexander Graham Bell

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.740
 sending a proto-metal detector.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.620
 Basically all new technologies were at some point

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.460
 just being tried on presidents who have been assassinated.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.060
 - So basically if God forbid the American president

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.620
 gets shot in the next couple of years,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.020
 they'll probably send a chat bot.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.860
 - Yeah.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.420
 (all laughing)

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.260
 - That's amazing.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.940
 So autopsies have come a long way

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.900
 since the days of injecting stuff into animals.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.940
 And I didn't know really about body farms.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.020
 - That sounds grim.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.220
 - And yet it is.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.540
 (all laughing)

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.980
 So they were basically invented by this guy called Billy Bass.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.100
 I remember that singing fish.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.980
 - No, not Billy.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.620
 - Bigmouth Billy Bass is singing fish.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.540
 - Wait, so he did body farms

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.260
 and then he did novelty singing fish?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.100
 - Fairly so.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.140
 Or it could be that they are different.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.980
 - People.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.380
 - So this guy called Bill Bass

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.260
 was a forensic anthropologist in the 60s and 70s.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.460
 And he realized that we didn't know much

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.180
 about what happens to bodies when they decompose.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.620
 And so he kind of bought up some farmland

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.300
 and decided to collect loads and loads of dead bodies.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.420
 And it's still going today.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.660
 And there are now a few body farms around the world

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.580
 and they're extraordinary places.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.940
 - It does sound like an excuse, doesn't it?

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.260
 When the police come and they say,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.420
 why have you got hundreds of dead bodies buried in your field?

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.980
 - Well, also 'cause they're buried in really odd scenarios

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.940
 'cause they're stored in the boots of cars, for instance.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.060
 - In pools of water, buried under rubble and in concrete.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.460
 - No, this is my body allotment.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.540
 I want one day to have a whole farm,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.300
 but I've only got one so far.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.140
 - Yeah, they're incredible.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.460
 And we've learned so much about forensics from them.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.340
 And yeah, they do things like,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.380
 you'll be walking through a field

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.460
 and you might not see any bodies,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.100
 but you might see pipes sticking up out of the ground.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.300
 And that's 'cause there are bodies underground

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.620
 and they're connected to pipes, which are collecting gases

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.820
 and the gases will determine what bodies smell of

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.780
 and that's so that we can develop machines in the future

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.500
 that can detect them by smell.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.980
 - That is stunning. - That's classy.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.300
 Leaving your body to science like that

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.740
 is a really good thing to do.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.260
 As in, well, I hope I have the gumption to do that.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.140
 I felt that we established

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.700
 you won't have any body remaining

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.740
 after we got to it from last week's episode.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.700
 It's a fun little callback

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.620
 if you haven't listened to last week's episode yet.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.740
 Find out what's gonna happen to me

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.780
 when these three get their hands on me.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.580
 - So the father of autopsy, what people call that

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.860
 is a guy called Karl Rokitansky.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.580
 And he came up with the idea of like looking

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.740
 at the internal organs to diagnose disease on the outside.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.260
 He personally performed 30,000 autopsies

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.100
 and supervised another 70,000.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.180
 - Sorry, 30,000? - Yeah.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.060
 - That's one a day for like ages.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.700
 (laughing)

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.060
 - It's one a day for a hundred years, isn't it?

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.900
 - Yeah. - Wasn't it?

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.380
 - Yeah, he did more than one a day.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.540
 It's the way he got through that.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.380
 - Clever.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.180
 - It's weekends, that's evenings, that's your birthday.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.340
 Maybe you do more on your birthday.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.820
 I don't know if you're the father of it.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.740
 - So I got a question.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.780
 I think Andy's the best one to answer this.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.620
 - Okay.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.740
 - But Dan might be able to answer

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.740
 and Anna definitely won't.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.580
 - Interesting.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.420
 - So it's guy's stuff.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.260
 - He's called Karl Rokitansky.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.860
 And where do you know that name from?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.820
 - Karl Rokitansky. - Rokitansky.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.660
 - Rokitansky.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.060
 - What are you guys both into?

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.900
 - Something that I associate with both of you,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.580
 which is shit movies.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.900
 - Oh.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.100
 - Was he in?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.460
 - Adam Sandler's real name.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.660
 (all laughing)

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.580
 - Actually, it's unfair to call this a shit movie.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.540
 It's actually a classic,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.020
 but it's the kind of movie you two would like.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.060
 - Pacific Rim 2.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.980
 (all laughing)

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.700
 - He gave his name to Max Rokitansky,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.780
 who is the main character in the film series Mad Max.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.020
 - Oh. - That's amazing.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.820
 And that's 'cause George Miller, who directed it,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.260
 he was working as a doctor when he was getting funds for it.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.100
 - What, George Miller?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.100
 - That's amazing. - That's very cool.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.060
 - Yeah, George Miller's career has been amazing.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.900
 He's done Mad Max.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.860
 He did Babe 2 Pig in the City, Happy Feet,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.940
 and then more Mad Max.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.780
 - Yeah, this weird fund.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.900
 What was it called, the latest one?

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.580
 - The one's second to last.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.500
 - Fury Road. - Fury Road.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.020
 - He's like in his 70s radies

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.980
 when he comes out to make that again.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.300
 Like he's-- - And the new ones out shortly?

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.140
 - Yeah.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.980
 - Anyway.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.820
 - So why does he--

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.460
 - This is why I thought these two liked this answer.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.860
 - I have actually seen Mad Max uncharacteristically.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.580
 I thought it was very dystopian.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.100
 I'd rather be locked on a body bath.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:42.940
 - Yeah.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.780
 - You know what?

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.900
 The plot was not lost on you.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.540
 (all laughing)

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.380
 - Oh, dear.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.460
 James, I have a different father of autopsy.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.580
 - Oh, yeah, go on.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.340
 - Mondino De Liuzzi.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.060
 - Oh, I can't hear this again.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.900
 - Is it?

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.740
 Can we hear this again?

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.380
 - Who is the father of autopsy and me?

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.900
 - Don't do that, look.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.420
 - Most episodes.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.620
 (all laughing)

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.420
 - Mondino De Liuzzi was the Restorer of Anatomy.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.380
 He was Italian, if you couldn't tell.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.900
 (all laughing)

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.380
 At the University of Bologna.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.700
 And Anatomy was a band,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.220
 except for once every five years you could do a dissection.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.060
 - Wow.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.900
 - Dissection.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.940
 - Is this like what's that film where sort of every 10 years

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.980
 or something, you can all kill each other?

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.820
 - The Purge.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.660
 - Yeah.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.740
 This is basically the Purge.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.580
 - Oh my God, Anna.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.340
 You are in your dystopian worlds today.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.180
 - I am, yeah.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.020
 - Amazing.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.620
 - So De Liuzzi, he became the first person

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.820
 to do a dissection, document it and publish his findings.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.820
 And it was the first documented public dissection

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.420
 in 1700 years.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.260
 - Right.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.100
 - Amazing.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.780
 But weirdly, senior people like him,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.380
 they would not do the actual dissection themselves.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.980
 So there's a picture of this happening.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.940
 And it was in the 14th century.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.260
 Senior people like him, they wouldn't do the dissection.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.620
 He would sit on a big elevated chair above the action.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.460
 - Like a tennis umpire.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.300
 - Exactly like that.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.140
 And he was reading aloud from a book.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.580
 I'm bringing him a book of Anatomy.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.700
 - No balls, please.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.860
 (all laughing)

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.100
 - And he was commenting on,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.220
 he was reading Galen's Anatomy to the audience and saying,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.060
 look, now you're gonna say,

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.340
 there was just a sort of barber surgeon

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.860
 actually doing the procedure.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.140
 And also, do we ever mention the ostensor?

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.980
 That was basically someone with one of those pointers

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.740
 whose job was to just point out the bits

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.060
 that were being autopsyed or examined or whatever.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.700
 - Separate to the guy on the chair.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.020
 - The guy on the chair is talking you through it.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.860
 - 'Cause he can't reach,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.860
 he'd need a very long ostensor.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.740
 - Exactly, I mean, they can go very long, those.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.580
 That's true.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.580
 The ostensor is just there going,

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.020
 "Vada, there's the pancreas, uh-huh, front door."

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.940
 - Yeah, they became really popular,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.300
 didn't they, dissections in Italy especially.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.900
 Around the time of the 16th century,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.620
 they were so popular, you could buy flap anatomies.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.740
 And a flap anatomy was like a book with flaps in it,

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.700
 you know, like a kid's book,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.380
 where you could lift up the flaps and say,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.300
 "Oh, look, there's the gallbladder."

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.340
 - Oh, yeah, so cool. - Isn't that cool?

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.180
 - Wow.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.620
 - I can't believe that technology is that old.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.460
 - I don't know.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.460
 - Well, I mean, the technology is quite basic for a flap.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.740
 (laughing)

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.500
 Literally just a piece of paper.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.580
 But I don't know if there were any kids books

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.900
 that did that before then, I can't imagine that would have.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.260
 So I think the original kids flap book was probably this.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.740
 - That's great. - Wow.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.300
 - Have you heard of vampire autopsies?

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.140
 These are very weird.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.540
 These are a real thing that used to happen.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.140
 There was concern that if you were dug up

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.300
 and you were very well preserved,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.980
 you might be a vampire.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.820
 And there was this big superstition

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.540
 that tuberculosis was an inherited disease.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.060
 So the dead could drain the life of their descendants.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.340
 Actually, those people had TB,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.300
 but the idea was that they were kind of being drained

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.420
 by the people who died.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.460
 And there was a theory that the body of the dead person

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.980
 had to be destroyed to protect the health of the living.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.740
 The last one of these happened in 1949.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.580
 - What?

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.420
 - I know.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.260
 - Was it to kill them,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.420
 to stop them vampirizing other people in 1949?

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.420
 - Yeah. - Right.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.540
 - Very weird.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.140
 We should have done my spooky voice for that.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.740
 - Yeah. - Come on.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.860
 - I read about a very interesting autopsy

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.540
 that happened in 1533.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.380
 And it was an autopsy that was done on two children

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.820
 who were infant twins who were conjoined.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.820
 And the question was, are these two children,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.540
 two children with two souls or one soul?

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.900
 And the autopsy was to determine that to work out,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.100
 is there one soul between two kids?

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.500
 - How many souls did they find?

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.340
 - They found two.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.180
 - Oh, did they?

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.420
 - Yeah, they found two because there's a Greek idea

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.660
 that the soul resided in the heart

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.220
 and they found two hearts within the conjoined twins.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.940
 Therefore, that was the answer that they were given.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.060
 But that was like a very theological specific autopsy.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.740
 - I think the important part of that was

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.900
 that these children hadn't been baptized,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.940
 but they would baptize people after their death,

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.780
 wouldn't they?

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.700
 And so, if they only had one soul,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.180
 they'd only have to have one baptism.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.020
 But if they had two souls,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.860
 they'd have to have two baptisms.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.340
 - Surely, less effort just to do the double baptism.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.340
 You know, just let's do two, cover up.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.660
 - Yeah, but if you baptize twice,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.380
 then that undoes the effect of the first baptism.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.220
 - Absolutely.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.340
 - Yeah, it's like being bonked on the head

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.220
 by something, losing your memory.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.980
 - Oh, right, the second bonk brings it back.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.820
 I see.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.580
 Another autopsy, which was quite amazing,

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.500
 was a little bit later on in 2010.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.380
 And this is the amazing stuff they can reveal now.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.460
 So this was a robbery in Oregon

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.620
 and it was two men in masks

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.380
 who tried to rob a cafe or coffee kiosk at gunpoint.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.020
 And the guy who was managing the kiosk

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.780
 also whipped out a gun 'cause it was America.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.700
 And he managed to shoot one of the people

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.540
 who was robbing him,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.220
 but the other one got away.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.900
 Now, they did an autopsy on the one robber that he'd shot

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.580
 and they looked in his belly

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.500
 and there was a still intact French fry in his stomach.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.620
 Now, we know about how much French fries degrade

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.540
 and how good I digest.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.340
 So they knew that he must have eaten a French fry

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.700
 sort of in the last hour.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.940
 Not only that, but someone doing the autopsy

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.740
 managed to identify it as a Wendy's French fry.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.580
 - Come on.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.420
 (laughing)

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.260
 - Give me a break.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.340
 I think I could tell the difference

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.660
 between a Burger King and the McDonald's one for sure.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.500
 - There you go.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.340
 - Someone tasted it.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.180
 They drew straws.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.020
 - Yeah.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.980
 - So it's a Wendy's fry.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.820
 - Wendy's fry.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.620
 So they just looked all the nearby Wendy's restaurants

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.820
 'cause there couldn't have been more than an hour ago

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.660
 he ate it.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.060
 And they looked at the security footage

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.820
 and there was one within an hour.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.580
 And they did indeed find the pictures of the two people

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.580
 on CCTV and found the other guy.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.740
 - Wow.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.620
 I'm gonna hear how they know it was a Wendy's fry.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.020
 I'm sure, I mean, I believe it.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.260
 I just, I'm just curious.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.100
 - Yeah.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.340
 - We don't have Wendy's here.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.060
 So we don't have, if you can let us know

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.180
 if Wendy's fries are particularly,

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.500
 maybe they're S-shaped or something.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.340
 - Moral of the story is always chew your food.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.380
 - That's a really good point.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.620
 Why is the fry intact?

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.020
 - I mean, he's literally inhaled that fry, hasn't he?

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.180
 - Oh my God, I'd be so easy to autopsy

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.180
 if I committed a crime.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.820
 All my food enters my body and completely intact.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.060
 (laughing)

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.640
 (upbeat music)

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.100
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.020
 And that is Andy.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.420
 My fact is that England's worst ever pennies

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.260
 are worth 350 pounds each.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.580
 - Hmm.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.900
 - Well, they may be some of the best.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.620
 These are coins called the Tealby pennies, right?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.660
 And this is a story of a man.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.420
 Well, why am I telling you this fact today?

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.420
 Well, I'll tell you.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.380
 (laughing)

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.180
 - Is this gonna be a new feature now?

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.900
 I'm gonna start finding it quite tedious, I think.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.180
 - Basically, there's a man called Tony House,

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.020
 which I love.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.660
 He's a metal detectorist and he was out

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.060
 and detecting away and he found a stash of pennies,

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.340
 ancient ones, they're from the 12th century.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.300
 He found one and then he found 600 more.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.540
 (laughing)

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.420
 - That's like if you see one and two in your house.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.260
 - Exactly.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.940
 (laughing)

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.100
 And they're worth about 350 quid each.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.780
 And the thing about them is they're really,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.660
 really low quality coins.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.020
 They are badly made, they're hard to read.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.260
 The image is just hopelessly stamped.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.980
 They're from the reign of Henry II.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.700
 They're named after Tealby in Lincolnshire,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.660
 which is where 5,000 of them were found

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.860
 in a huge cache in the 19th century.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.700
 - Ah, cache.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.140
 - And they're just really ropey coins.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.300
 - So why are they worth so much,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.300
 just 'cause they're old now and rare?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.140
 - Rare, maybe?

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.980
 They're old, they're pretty rare.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.820
 - I thought they were quite a lot of them.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.380
 - Well, I was on a numismatist website called Numsock,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.140
 which was really good.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.940
 It says this coinage is renowned for its ugly appearance,

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.500
 bad craftsmanship and careless execution.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.140
 To collect Tealby pennies in the first place,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.020
 it grounds you as a little strange.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.980
 (laughing)

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.820
 - Yeah.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.700
 - Right, to be strange in the numismatist world

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.540
 is truly strangeness.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.980
 I kind of absolutely love numismatism, in fact,

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.020
 even though it's really hard to say.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.500
 And I love coin research because, A, it's so reliable.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.380
 It's such reliable history, there's no spurious,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.500
 oh, what was this used for?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.180
 Because all the information that you need is on this coin.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.380
 It's like, there's a date, there's a face,

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.660
 it's a physical thing.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.500
 And people--

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.820
 - You're saying we have no mystery coins

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.980
 that we don't know the stories behind?

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.940
 I mean, we will have some mystery coins.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.660
 Don't worry, Dan, there are the alien theories out there,

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.500
 I'm sure.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.380
 - Good, 'cause all my research.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.460
 - But people are also so obsessed.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.420
 I was on a Reddit thread,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.460
 which was started by someone who said,

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.020
 "I ranked all the Roman emperors for their coinage

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.940
 "based on its artistic value, variety,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.580
 "collectibility and historical value.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.900
 "Feel free to ask me about the rankings."

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.180
 And everyone did.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.540
 (laughing)

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.460
 - That is really tragic of no one else's life.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.300
 (laughing)

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.500
 - Oh, don't you worry.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.340
 - Anyone?

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.420
 - Thousands.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.460
 I can tell you that Claudius wasn't high enough.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.580
 And Claudius, of course,

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.340
 was responsible for the return to realism

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.420
 instead of the vaguely Hellenistic idealism

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.580
 on previous coins.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.700
 So he should have had at least an A rank,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.140
 according to one person.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.260
 (laughing)

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.900
 One person just said, "I feel insulted

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.340
 "you ranked Nero as high as Augustus."

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.900
 And this is not as an emperor,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.260
 this is his coinage.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.100
 (laughing)

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.180
 - Right.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.100
 - You were saying about there being no dubious coins,

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.060
 Anna, which did backtrack on Inferness, but--

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.300
 - I guess, yeah.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.220
 - I have an interesting thing that I found,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.340
 which is about rainbow cups.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.580
 Don't know if you guys found this.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.020
 - Was it related to the moon cup?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.620
 (laughing)

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.620
 - In the fact that they're cup shaped, both.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.460
 - Okay.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.300
 - Only.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.180
 So these are coins that are cup shaped,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.500
 and you find them, especially in Germany,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.660
 and you'll find them in fields.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.580
 But these are often found after it had been raining,

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.820
 but then it was sunny straight afterwards.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.300
 Because not only are they kind of pushed forward

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.420
 by the muddiness,

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.500
 but also water gets into the cup-ness,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.340
 and it shines, and they're really easy to find,

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.780
 because the reflection of the light comes off.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.940
 And people associated them with rainbows.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.300
 And according to Discover Magazine,

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.980
 which is usually a pretty good source,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.980
 this is the reason that we have like a crock of gold

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.260
 at the end of a rainbow.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.100
 - Oh, no.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.660
 - People, whenever there was a rainbow,

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.460
 they would find these cup shaped coins.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.300
 - Very good.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.140
 - That's awesome.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.940
 - And apparently there were tribes of Southern Germany

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.820
 that were Celtic tribes that moved up into Ireland,

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.580
 and that's why the Irish associated with leprechauns.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.540
 - I love that.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.460
 That's amazing.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.300
 - Isn't that cool?

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.140
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.980
 - That's great.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.620
 I've got a favorite coin.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.460
 - Yeah.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.300
 - You've got a double eagle.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.140
 This is an American coin,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.620
 and it was a $10 coin issued in 1933.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.540
 Half a million of them were struck,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.420
 but they weren't issued as legal tender.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.540
 'Cause in 1933, the Great Depression, blah, blah, blah,

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.620
 banking crisis, gold coins are outlawed as legal tender.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.740
 It is now illegal to own a double eagle one.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.580
 - What?

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.100
 - Yeah, they're all technically U.S. government property.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.820
 - Because they never put them out.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.020
 You can't have accidentally got one in your change

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.860
 and own it.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.700
 - I see.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.860
 - If you have one, it must've been stolen.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.380
 I think there is one, isn't there?

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.780
 - There's one, so there are two in the Smithsonian,

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.620
 which is kind of different,

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.700
 but then there's one which is not illegal to own.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.260
 I can't work out exactly why that's the only one

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.100
 that's not illegal to own,

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.340
 but it was sold in 2021 at auction for nearly 50 million

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.180
 pounds.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.020
 - Wow.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.900
 - What happened was a few of them were stolen

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.780
 and found their way into private hands via a jeweler

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.780
 called Israel Svit, who was from Philadelphia.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.540
 And when they came to light, they would just get confiscated

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.980
 'cause you weren't allowed to have them.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.420
 But one of them got sold to King Farouk of Egypt.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.020
 And he wrote to the Treasury Department said,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.980
 "I have this coin, is it okay if I keep it?"

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.500
 And they hadn't discovered the theft at that stage,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.660
 so they didn't realize that they'd been stolen.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.660
 And so they replied to him saying,

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.620
 "Yeah, you can keep it."

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.460
 - Wow, that's good.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.300
 - And that's the one.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.740
 That's the one that if it ever comes up,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.060
 is the one that gets sold at auction.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.900
 - Amazing.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.740
 - Wow.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.580
 - So that's, I think, unique.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.420
 - That is.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.240
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.060
 - Just while we're on American coins,

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.860
 in 2007, there was a coin that was minted

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.620
 which had an image of JFK on it.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.580
 And if you pressed a button on the coin,

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.300
 it played a short excerpt of his Iqbin Einbilina.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.020
 So it had little technology in it to do that.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.020
 - No, I don't believe that was legal tendancy.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.460
 (laughing)

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.860
 - Do you know where that was minted?

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.820
 What country that was for?

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.660
 - Germany.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.780
 - Sounds it right.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.620
 Mongolia.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.540
 (laughing)

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.380
 - Lovely.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.980
 - Do you guys know that the first book written

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.220
 about the history of the coin

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.540
 was called the Ass and Party Bus?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.020
 - The Ass and Party Bus?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.140
 - Is that right?

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.020
 Is that a Latin book?

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:00.940
 - I see.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.860
 - It's actually the ass at Party Bus.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.940
 So I have translated two of the words.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.060
 - Of ass and--

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.740
 - Party Bus means like parts of.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.140
 - Ass was like an old Roman coin.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.660
 - Oh, that's great.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.580
 - Published in 1514 by Huiam Boudd,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.700
 and to be honest, is quite boring.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.420
 (laughing)

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.220
 - But you read the whole thing, presumably.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.660
 - Yeah, the first 10 pages are about

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.800
 the etymology of the word ass.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.640
 Then it goes on about--

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.700
 - I bet you read that so voraciously.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.540
 - Yeah.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.380
 - That's brilliant.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.220
 - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.340
 - They were big.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.700
 - One actually amazing thing,

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.820
 speaking of Romans and coins,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.380
 is that coins are the reason

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.100
 that we're still discovering Roman emperors.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.380
 Which I, sorry, I just still, I didn't know.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.220
 - Wow.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.700
 - We discovered our latest Roman emperor in 2022.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.460
 - No, no, no, it's true.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.460
 - Who were we missing?

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.300
 - This is--

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.140
 - It's not a biggie.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.860
 It's not like in between Nero.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.820
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, to Augustus actually.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.420
 It only came to light.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.620
 No, this is the great Sponsienus.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.460
 (laughing)

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.380
 - Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a legit one.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.220
 - Hi, I'm doing it.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.920
 Oh, would you like to sponsor my anus?

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.600
 (laughing)

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.280
 - This is from, well, we think it's from the disaster century,

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.700
 whatever it's called, the crisis century in the Roman period,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.740
 which was like the third century,

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.960
 when it was all falling to pieces

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.020
 and there were sort of 1900 emperors.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.300
 But the reason he's only just come to light

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.640
 is because there were these coins found

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.660
 in Transylvania in the 1700s,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.580
 which were assumed to be fake,

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.420
 and people looked at them and said they were true.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.400
 - Andy, sorry, can Andy,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.480
 can you say these coins were found in Transylvania, please?

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.640
 - These coins were found in Transylvania.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.180
 - Yeah, that seems to add to it for me.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.760
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right, yeah.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.160
 They were found in Transylvania in the 1700s,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.240
 and they had a picture of this bloke,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.340
 and it said Sponsienus under it, and--

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.680
 - Sponsienus.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.480
 (laughing)

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.580
 - It just doesn't work when you do it down.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.160
 Anyway, it was decided that they were fakes,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.080
 and it was only in 2022 that analysis of them

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.760
 actually concluded they were probably real.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.280
 And so we've literally just found out

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.840
 that there was a Roman emperor

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.560
 at some time between 248 and 253 AD.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.480
 - Okay, wow.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.400
 - Very much a sort of Liz Truss style.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.360
 Lincoln, you'll miss him.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.240
 - Yeah, I think it was in and out, job.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.240
 - And just one coin so far, did you say?

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.320
 - I think there are a couple.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.920
 I believe there are two coins.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.440
 - Did you hear about the Eid Ma Aureus?

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.680
 So there's another Roman coin.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.240
 Is this the, like after Caesar was killed?

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.080
 - Yes.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.040
 - This is a coin that celebrates the assassination

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.760
 of Julius Caesar, minted by Brutus,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.280
 and it has the inscription, "Eid Ma,"

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.520
 which is, "Eids of Mars."

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.700
 And it has their daggers on.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.520
 Brutus and Cassius' daggers are depicted.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.360
 - It's crazy.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.360
 It's like immediately after, almost, right?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.400
 Like it's like merch.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.280
 - That's kind of what they did, though, wasn't it?

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.000
 It was like, "Get rid of the old emperor.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.920
 How do you do it?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.920
 Well, let's just mint a load of coins."

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.760
 - Yeah.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.600
 - It doesn't matter how you do it.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.680
 - Interestingly, Julius Caesar was the first known autopsy

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.320
 that we have ever done stuff.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.160
 - Yeah.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.040
 - Was that required?

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.120
 - Well, they found out that he was stabbed 23 times.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.960
 - Right.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.280
 I mean, that, yeah.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.040
 - But was that poison on the dagger,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.560
 which was the actual cause of death?

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.320
 - I can't deal with this many vaginas.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.200
 (both laughing)

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200
 - But they wanted to find out

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.000
 which of the stabbings was the one that killed him.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.600
 - No, how did they, no offense to the Romans.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.040
 How did they think they were gonna be able to do that?

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.560
 Surely it would have been some combination

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.640
 of the 23 that did it.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.600
 - I could tell you, because most of them were

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.280
 either in the face or the groin.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.120
 It was found.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.960
 - Oh, they were in the face.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.000
 - I didn't know that.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.840
 - Wow.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.760
 - And it was just one or two.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.520
 And I think one of them went through

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.840
 is the side of his arm and into his arm's room.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.680
 - Right, okay.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.280
 - So they decided that that was it.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.120
 - Wow.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:42.960
 - Anyway.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.800
 - Blimey.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.480
 - And the groin, was that deliberate?

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.320
 - Yeah.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.160
 - Doesn't seem inadvertent, does it?

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.000
 - Yeah.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.840
 - Going for a crotch.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.960
 - Coin villain, Henry VIII.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.800
 - Really?

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.080
 - Yeah, but the numismatists foe.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.000
 So he wasted lots of money on wars

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.920
 with foreigners, basically.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.120
 And he specifically, he debased the currency.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.960
 He issued new coins where he'd put copper

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.040
 in the silver coins just to make the silver

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.560
 go a bit further, basically.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.760
 And it caused mayhem.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.600
 People were hoarding their good coins

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.620
 from the before times, which were still worth

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.840
 every bit of silver in them.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.600
 And they left the bad ones in circulation.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.520
 Foreign bankers refused to accept English money.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.760
 They were asking for gold instead.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.960
 It just, it was a disaster.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.640
 And then a few years after he dies,

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.360
 Elizabeth I came to the throne 15 years later,

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.200
 she had to recall every single coin in the kingdom

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.880
 and melt them down and reissue proper coins.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.280
 - You have like a coin amnesty.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.880
 Everyone come and hand your coins in at the forum.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.720
 - Pretty much.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.280
 - They had those, you know, those machines

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.840
 where you pour all your coins in

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.920
 and it gives you a little slip, they had those.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.720
 - Not the ones with the tray going back and forward.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.040
 Is that what they're doing?

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.760
 They're collecting my coins.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.000
 - Well, they are collecting your coins effectively.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.160
 You know those things, by the way,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.000
 they were invented by, I can't remember who it was now,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.520
 but they were invented and the person who invented them

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.920
 thought that they would only last one year

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.440
 because it's been quite a few of these kind of amusements

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.240
 that had come and gone really quickly.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.280
 And so they invented them, they didn't patent them.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.360
 They made a load of them

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.800
 and then they became really successful.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.360
 And now you could just make them without any patents.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.480
 - I didn't realize that.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.200
 - Yeah. And the original one had the big hole in the middle

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.720
 which your coins would go in so they would make money.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.400
 Whereas now the holes are hidden.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.960
 So when the coins are being pushed,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.160
 there's holes on the side that you can't see

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.520
 and that's where the coins kind of fall into

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.080
 and that's the cut that the machines are.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.800
 - So I'm not aiming, I don't want to get into those holes.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.960
 - No, so think about it.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.160
 - I want to get into the big hole in the middle.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.520
 - Every coin you put in, in theory,

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.840
 is going to come out again, right?

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.080
 So how do they make money?

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.200
 Well, the way they make money is they have hidden holes

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.840
 where the coins fall down and go into the bank.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.880
 - Wait, why would every coin in theory be coming out again?

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.600
 I just thought they'd got more and more and more coins

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.760
 until the whole thing exploded.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.880
 - Until the whole thing was full of coins.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.160
 - Yeah, exactly, someone's going to go to those machines

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.000
 and they're just crowned.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.720
 - You've never seen one of them fall to top.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.680
 - I think it's like, you fill them with coins

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.480
 to start off with because you've never turned up

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.000
 to one of those and there's no coins in it.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.800
 - Just a little sign saying please.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.280
 - So they fill them with coins

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.680
 and then in theory, everyone you put in

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.760
 is going to push another one out.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.040
 - I did not know there were side things.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.760
 I just thought they built up and then at night

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.120
 people came by and siphoned out and stacked them artfully

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.080
 so they never stayed, none of them would fall in the hole.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.320
 - That might happen as well.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.360
 - Those machines are great.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.200
 I love them so much.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.520
 - I spend so much of my money on them.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.400
 - Yeah, they are amazing.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.400
 I love them as well.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.240
 You know those penny collection machines actually?

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.080
 - What do you mean?

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.800
 - The one where you get all of your money

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.280
 that you've been keeping in a jar for the last 10 years.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.640
 - Oh and you tip them in and you turn it into cash.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.520
 - Do you know what the most

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.480
 that anyone's ever got out of this?

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.320
 - Oh great.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.760
 - Oh God, how much?

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.040
 So I think I mentioned on the show once

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.240
 that I did it in Australia

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.280
 and I think I got three or $400 out of it.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.600
 - What, how much?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.080
 You were pouring in coppers into a machine.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:47.920
 You got $400.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.760
 - What's an all coppers?

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.600
 There's some 50 cents.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.440
 - Right.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.200
 - What Looney Tunes bank robbery had you just done

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.000
 to have $400 in spilled coins?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.160
 - It was all of Bean's money

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.400
 they'd been collected over the years.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.000
 - Well remember, he just spills change everywhere,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.800
 never picks it up and I was unemployed.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.160
 So I thought I'm gonna try and contribute

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.760
 to this little domestic economy.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.320
 Go on, who's beating my record then?

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.160
 - Yeah, what is it?

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.280
 2000, I'm gonna say.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.760
 - No, the record is $13,084.59.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.600
 - Wow.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.880
 - I don't mean behind that person.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.440
 (all laughing)

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.160
 - There was a man in Alabama

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.760
 and he had to have all of his coins delivered

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.920
 to the bank to do this

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.880
 because obviously there were so many of them

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880
 he couldn't carry them

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.440
 and it took seven hours to count them all.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.280
 - Wow.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.240
 - And his collection weighed more than 4.5 tons.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.600
 - Goodness.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.880
 Why did he stop?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.960
 - The fool.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.200
 (all laughing)

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.320
 - Yes, what a weird again.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.640
 That's an inside out logic.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.320
 I would have gone for, why did he stop?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.840
 - It does feel like perhaps

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.280
 there was someone else in his house

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.680
 who asked him to do it.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.520
 - Yeah, fair enough.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.360
 - I don't know.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.440
 - Have you guys heard of Christopher Ironside?

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.520
 He was the designer behind the first decimal coins

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.320
 that we had in 1969 in the UK, right?

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.080
 And so, he designed the 50p.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.880
 That was the first thing that he designed all of the coins.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.560
 - I'm so sorry, I think it was 71?

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.880
 But maybe he designed them early?

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.600
 - No, there was some that came out early.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.160
 71 was decimalization,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.240
 but there were a few earlier decimal coins.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.080
 - Right.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.920
 - That's confusing.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.760
 - That is confusing.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.000
 - I mean, the whole decimalization thing

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.440
 sounds confusing to be fair.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.760
 You would have loved the Daily Mail in 1971.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.320
 - Why are there 240 anymore?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.040
 - But so there was sort of an announcement

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.560
 that Britain was going to be heading this way,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.680
 but the Royal Mint didn't say who was designing the coins,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.080
 but they had picked this guy, Christopher Ironside,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.600
 and he had to do it in secrecy from 1962 all the way to 1968.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.880
 Now, you would think they gave him an office

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.800
 to go and do it in, that he could do it in secrecy

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.200
 if it was such a big deal, they didn't.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.560
 He had to do it in his house.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.560
 He had his mother living in the house.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.080
 He had a daughter living in the house.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.200
 He had two young kids on the way.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.400
 He had a small house, so he had nowhere to do it.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.360
 - And they're constantly at risk of discovering

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.360
 the big secret, which is that he's working

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.200
 best after this time.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.640
 - But he's designing.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.720
 All you need is a desk.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.560
 - Exactly.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.400
 - Yeah.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.040
 - There's the voice of Big Mint over here.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.200
 They could give him a room in the building, I would say.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.040
 - Exactly.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.880
 - I'm not saying they couldn't do that,

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.040
 but I'm just saying that the fact

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.760
 that he's working from home, like many of us does today.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.440
 - But if I was working from home

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.200
 and I couldn't let my wife find out

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.360
 that I was working on a podcast,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.480
 it might be tricky.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.320
 - Would it?

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.160
 - Yeah.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.000
 - Yeah.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.840
 - What's this microphone for?

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.480
 (all laughing)

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.480
 - Well, she's at home

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.760
 'cause she's got two kids on the way.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.160
 - And she's finding drawings of 50p coins around the place.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160
 She's saying, "What's this?"

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.000
 "Uh, nothing."

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.080
 - So I think she gets into it

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.200
 because she becomes the model for Britannica

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.600
 on the back of the 50p coin.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.440
 Her name was Jean.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.680
 And we were talking last week

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.240
 about Uma Thurman's grandmother.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.840
 Well, we now know who was basically the model

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.000
 for Britannica. - All right.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.520
 - But he had to hide it from all his friends

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.480
 who would come over and so on.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.040
 So he had a big cloth that he would put over his desk.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.880
 - What kind of claim he was doing?

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.040
 Did he say he was a spy?

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:48.880
 And actually--

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.720
 - It kind of felt like it, but--

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.000
 - It just doesn't feel hard

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.760
 to hide drawing a picture of Britannica.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.000
 - No, he was making the molds.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.280
 He was doing all the molds.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.120
 - Still?

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120
 - Do you know how big a coin is?

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:58.960
 - Yeah, totally.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.040
 But like, you know--

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.880
 - James, I think this guy had a rough time.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.280
 I do, I've got to say.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.760
 - I want to know why it took him six years to design.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.600
 - Yeah.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.520
 - What, like five coins?

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.680
 - Because he was constantly trying

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.320
 to hide his tiny molds everywhere.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.600
 - I think it was, as he reports into the office every quarter,

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.520
 "No, sorry, my mother-in-law came into the room."

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.360
 What they had to do--

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.840
 - Just as I was making the molds.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.280
 I had to throw it out of the window into the garden.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.800
 - And then someone walked past the garden

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.680
 and they had to go and bury it in the garden.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.200
 - Then a fox dug it up, you see, that was the problem.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.080
 So I will need another three years.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.280
 I'm afraid to complete the molds.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.760
 - They had to delay one of the coins

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.840
 because he found his daughter at the desk

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.800
 putting into the putty her knife or whatever

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.240
 and it completely ruined the coins.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.320
 They had to redesign the way.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.480
 - His whole family, I imagine,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.480
 was just going, "Darling, we don't care.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.840
 "It's something to do with the coin.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.160
 "We couldn't care less.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.640
 "It's dinner time."

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.880
 - Oh, that's so good.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.720
 That's hilarious.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.440
 - Just very quickly before we go,

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.680
 crypto coins that exist include the Yeti coin.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.520
 - Brilliant.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.560
 - The golf coin.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.320
 The Mossland coin.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.320
 The egregious fish token.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.040
 And the AP wine coin.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.360
 - Get out!

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.200
 - What?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.040
 - For me.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.320
 They've minted a coin for me.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.160
 - It's a crypto coin.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.120
 I'll explain later.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.960
 - All right, yes.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.680
 - Just send me your back details.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.260
 (upbeat music)

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.040
 and that is my fact.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.560
 My fact this week is that, in theory,

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.840
 you can get a peanut allergy transplant.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.680
 - Oh, good.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.960
 - Why would I want that?

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.000
 - You wouldn't be asking for it.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.280
 This would be an accidental transplant.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.640
 So there's numerous papers out there.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.280
 The one that I read was to do with a 31 year old woman.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.760
 She had liver failure.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.840
 So she had a liver transplant.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.560
 And then after the operation,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.240
 she was kissing her partner

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.880
 and he had just eaten a peanut butter chocolate.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.800
 And as a result, she rashed up and she said,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.640
 "That's weird, that's never happened before."

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.480
 They went to the doctors

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.840
 and they worked out that she now had hypersensitivity

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.840
 to peanut, hazelnut and pecan.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.040
 And they believe that that was new from post-transplant.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.760
 And then there are the multiple examples

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.440
 of people who have been claiming

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.480
 to have had a peanut allergy post-transplant.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.320
 - That's very cool.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.160
 - Yeah.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.520
 - Paying the arse for those people.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.320
 - Peanut allergies.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.280
 - Did you say peanuts?

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.840
 - It was definitely, it was either peanuts or peanuts.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.680
 - Oh, peanuts.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.120
 Sorry, no, no, no, I still want peanuts.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.320
 There is a day of the year where in Canada,

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.880
 peanut allergy cases, which trigger anaphylactic shock,

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.480
 rise by 85%.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.440
 Can you work out what that day of the year is?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.840
 - When they eat a lot of peanuts,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.520
 Super Bowl, no, Canada.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.840
 The World Series, baseball, the hockey.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.800
 - Hockey, it's not sport.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.440
 - When's a day when certainly everyone eats a lot more peanuts?

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.600
 - Christmas.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.240
 - Christmas, it's the Canadian peanut Christmas.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.960
 - When they all take flights and get them for free.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.800
 - That's right.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.640
 - When they go to the cinema,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.560
 do they all go to the cinema one day of the year?

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.080
 - Canadians only go to the cinema one day a year

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.040
 because it's quite sinful.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.080
 So they try and limit it.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.480
 - It's a national peanut day.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.560
 - What's Charles Schultz, was he Canadian?

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.200
 - Oh, these are such good guesses.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.040
 Okay.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.880
 - Is it really obvious?

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.840
 - It's not really obvious.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.360
 Peanut-based confectionery gets eaten a lot more

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.400
 on one day of the year.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.240
 - Halloween.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.080
 - When they do dribble treats.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.920
 - Halloween, thank you.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.480
 (laughing)

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.440
 - It's Halloween.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.200
 You get children going house to house,

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.600
 having a lot of confectionery.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.160
 Maybe they didn't know they've got a peanut allergy

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.520
 or maybe they are, you know, they're just excited

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.560
 and they have some unfamiliar confectionery

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.400
 and they already knew about it.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.200
 But yeah, that's 85%.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.120
 Easter is 60% rice.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.960
 - Really?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.040
 - I guess chocolate-containing peanuts.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:26.880
 - Yeah.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.680
 - It's amazing how much it's changed

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.480
 over the last 20 years or so, isn't it?

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.320
 - It's bizarre.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.720
 - The number of people who are allergic to peanuts

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.160
 just 20 years ago is so much lower than it is today.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.000
 - Really?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.080
 - So much and no one really knows why.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.520
 - No, 1995 to 2016, there's been a five-fold increase

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.160
 in the UK in peanut allergies and more in other places.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.440
 And yeah, as James says, we're not really sure why.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.720
 It's much more industrialized countries.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.120
 Could be to do with the fact that we are

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.560
 not getting as many parasites, they think.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.440
 And I think the immune system uses a similar mechanism

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.000
 to fight parasites as it does to flare up in allergies.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.680
 - Yeah, we just don't know, but it's rocketing.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.040
 - It is, and definitely like the more that you live

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.360
 in a city, the more likely you are to have it.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.200
 - Really?

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.760
 - So seems like it's something to do with not being exposed

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.080
 to natural environments, possibly vitamin D sunlight.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.360
 Apparently people with a vitamin D deficiency

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.560
 are 11 times more likely to have a peanut allergy.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.400
 - Really?

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.840
 - But that might not, but that might be just that

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.720
 the two things are related to a third thing.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.560
 We just don't know.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.400
 - Yeah.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.760
 - One way of stopping getting allergies

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.080
 is to desensitize yourself by having small amounts of it,

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:32.920
 right?

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.320
 This doesn't work in all cases,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.760
 but it's a very common way of treating them.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.400
 And for that reason, there's a new kind of toothpaste

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.880
 that's been invented, which has got little tiny, tiny,

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.480
 tiny bits of peanut in it.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.320
 - Ah, that's brilliant.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.480
 - And the idea is that you have this toothpaste

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.880
 and it desensitizes your immune system to the allergens.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.160
 - Nut paste.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.000
 - Nut paste?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.240
 - Give your kids nut paste today.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.480
 - I think we can go back to the branding drawing bar

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.240
 before we start printing the packets.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.400
 - Ironically, they all just get stuck in your teeth.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.600
 So then you need to use an actual normal toothpaste

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.840
 to get rid of it, presumably.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.680
 - Yeah.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.160
 You can be, of course, allergic to peanuts.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.000
 - Penis.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.840
 - Penis, yeah.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.680
 - Oh.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.600
 - Post-argasmic illness syndrome

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.320
 is where you get flu-like symptoms,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.880
 rashes, itching, after sex.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.040
 But it has been caused, in a few cases,

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.120
 by men being allergic to their own semen.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.080
 - Their own.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.200
 - Their own semen.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.040
 - Yeah.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.160
 - Oh, no.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.120
 - There is a cure.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.960
 Thank God.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.760
 - What is the...

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.280
 We'll be back to nut paste, basically.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.280
 (all laughing)

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.520
 - We are, I'm afraid.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.360
 - No.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.520
 - It's multiple subcutaneous injections

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.480
 of the semen in question.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.280
 - I think I'll just stay all for life,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.280
 thank you very much.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.200
 (all laughing)

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.640
 - Yeah, so you get very, very tiny bits of the semen

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.600
 and you would inject it under the skin

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.160
 and your body would learn to do well.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.240
 - Not on your toothbrush.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.080
 - No.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.520
 (all laughing)

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.120
 - Wow.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.520
 Scientists get allergic to the thing

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.920
 they're researching quite frequently

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.160
 'cause you're exposed to it, day after day.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.200
 There was a great piece, I think it was the Atlantic,

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.440
 about a scientist called Brian Fry.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.560
 He studies snake venom and has since become allergic,

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.280
 not to venom, but to snakes in general.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.120
 - Really?

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.440
 - Yeah.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.400
 And apparently there's a huge chance

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.360
 that if you work with something all the time

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.240
 you develop an allergy, 40% of vets,

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.360
 45% of people who work with lab rodents

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.120
 get an allergy to them.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.920
 There was a leech scientist called Danielle DeCurle

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.200
 who uses herself as bait

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.080
 when she's trying to catch leeches out in the field.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.960
 You know, she just walks through a swamp and gets them.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.360
 She now, after a year or two, couldn't do it anymore

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.400
 and her hands started swearing up massively

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.360
 if she was trying to feed a leech in the lab on her blood

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.000
 and she had to feed them pig blood instead.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.960
 - That's weird though, isn't it?

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.920
 Because obviously you're supposed to sensitize yourself

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.160
 up until a certain point.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.480
 But maybe you can be overexposed.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.680
 Like if I'm eating peanut butter on a daily basis

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.240
 and a lot, does that mean I eventually might then become

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.080
 a leech scientist?

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.000
 - I read the article and it said 25 to 60% of people

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.120
 who work with insects become allergic to them.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.640
 So people who work with bees might come out in hives.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.480
 - Right.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.800
 - Hey, lovely.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.480
 - Now I think about it, people keep telling me

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.200
 'cause I love milk and I drink milk a lot

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.440
 that I will become allergic to milk

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.840
 by the amount of milk that I drink.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.280
 - I don't listen to those people.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.160
 - You know who told me it was Ash Garner.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.240
 - Oh, did he?

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.000
 - Who did our theme tune for anybody who doesn't know

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.120
 who stopped drinking milk because he thinks

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.680
 he became allergic from drinking so much as a kid.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.760
 - I think I'm right in saying that.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.640
 - There's an interesting thing where people who think

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.640
 they are allergic to things in double blind tests,

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.880
 quite a high percentage of people turn out not to be

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.000
 allergic to them after all.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.840
 - Right.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.400
 Just on the quickly jumping back to allergy transplants

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.720
 and just the idea of things being transplanted

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.360
 when you take in a body part from a donor.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.000
 I read an article from a lady who said

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.680
 that her personality changed after a kidney transplant

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.040
 where instead of reading celebrity trash

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.520
 and watching celebrity trash,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.360
 she started reading Jane Austen.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.360
 And that was purely off the back from the kidney.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.000
 She said she got a brain-y kidney.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 - She said there's a pseudoscience theory,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.480
 which is the idea that you inherit traits of a person

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.120
 that you might take something off.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.680
 And there's so many exact,

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.040
 there's a guy called Dr. Hagen who's an ER doctor

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.120
 who claims that he inherited a love of avocados

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.680
 and barbecues after he got a transplant.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.800
 - I don't know maybe if your digestive system

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.200
 responds to certain food stuff seems more likely

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.360
 than liking trash magazines compared to Jane Austen.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.200
 - Yeah.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.040
 - To be fair to the ER doctor.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.880
 - Yeah, fair enough.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.080
 He got in contact with the family

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.640
 because it was like a murder trial that she'd been killed in.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.480
 He went to the trial and the family took him in

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.680
 and they did prayers together.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.480
 And then he went back to their house

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.640
 and the sentence reads,

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.520
 "He learned she loved avocados and barbecues."

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.560
 - Oh, and there's such unusual things that people like

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.520
 they could only possibly have come from this ridiculous idea.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.760
 - Well, he never used to cry during movies as well.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.440
 As a surgeon, you're trained not to cry.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.760
 And then after surgery, he kept crying and kept crying.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.280
 And as well as learning that this lady

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.200
 loved avocados and barbecues,

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.120
 she was also an emotionally passionate woman.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.520
 But there's a doctor who believes that

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.600
 as a patient's about to go into surgery

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.000
 to receive the transplant,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.880
 a few bit of details might come out

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.280
 about the person they're getting the transplant from.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.440
 And they embed that in a really emotional moment

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.680
 before they're about to go down.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.800
 And it goes into their psyche

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.720
 rather than it being a physical transplant.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.840
 - Imagine, by the way, the kidney that you're receiving

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.800
 comes from someone who loved avocado.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.920
 Okay, go on down.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.600
 (laughing)

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.800
 There is a lot that we obviously don't know at all.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.800
 Like we've talked about fecal transplants before.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.640
 - Oh yeah.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.160
 - And how you can actually transplant unexpected things

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.640
 in them, it is thought.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.960
 And then we're in very early days of fecal transplant.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.480
 - What changes with my personality

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.480
 if I get someone else's poo in me?

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.320
 - Depends who's poo you get.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.840
 Which one of our poo do you want?

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.520
 And then I'll tell you what you'll get.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.600
 (laughing)

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.120
 We'll save that for our therapy session after the show again.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.000
 - Now you kind of think Andy mentioned on the show

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.680
 before that a mother who received a fecal transplant

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.720
 from her daughter suddenly became obese.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.920
 And her daughter was obese.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.760
 And 'cause we really don't know--

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.880
 - Okay, well, that makes sense.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.040
 'Cause it could be the microbes causing that, right?

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:04.960
 - That's right.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.040
 There was someone else who received a fecal transplant

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.960
 who had had alopecia and not had any hair

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.520
 since there were six who suddenly grew hair again.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.440
 And I suppose this is all micro climate.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.200
 There's a lot still to learn about it

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.240
 and who knows what little things it's affecting.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.080
 - Yeah, I buy it.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.000
 I buy it a lot.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.960
 Okay, here's a way.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.760
 If you are a parent and you have a baby who has a dummy,

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.120
 you can protect them against allergies.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.200
 How do you do it?

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.960
 - Never let them take the dummy out

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.600
 so no food could get into their mouth.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.440
 - That's right.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.280
 That's right.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.000
 Can anyone think of a second method?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.200
 (laughing)

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.040
 - I know the answers to this

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.840
 'cause I've accidentally been doing it all my three kids.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.160
 - I've seen you doing it as well.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.200
 - Oh, well, that must be you sucking on the dummy as well?

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.040
 - Yeah.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.880
 - Is it really?

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.720
 - Yeah.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.320
 - I didn't like to admit it, but it's, no, it's.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.160
 (laughing)

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.000
 - Oh my God.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.840
 - Oh my God, Dan.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.080
 - For the lesson that Dan has just got a dummy

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.440
 out of his pocket and popped it in.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.080
 - We assume it came out of his pocket.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.440
 We can see where it came from.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.680
 - It certainly came from below the table.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.960
 That's incredibly, Dan, wow.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.960
 - That's really disturbing.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.560
 It's weird how disturbing that is to see.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.760
 - Well, I didn't know I had it in my pocket

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.920
 until I was coming in this morning

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.840
 and I felt it and I was like, oh, I've got kids dummy.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.960
 - What's he got of yours?

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.160
 (laughing)

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.560
 - Where's my research notes?

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.800
 (laughing)

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.480
 (laughing)

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.760
 - That one explains so much.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.120
 (laughing)

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.700
 (upbeat music)

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.520
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.060
 and that is Anna.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.560
 - My fact this week is that the largest parasite

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.280
 in the world is a Christmas tree.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.120
 - Feels a bit political.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.520
 Feels like you're saying Christmas is rubbish.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.360
 - Okay.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.280
 - It's like it's feeding on ordinary families,

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.600
 trying to make them spend the money on Christmas.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.040
 - Basically, it's capitalism and capitalism

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.680
 is a parasite on the working-

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.520
 - Good point.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.000
 Christianity actually organized religion of any form

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.040
 is a parasite on our society.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:53.880
 - Yeah, man.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.840
 - All right, put down your joints.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.080
 (laughing)

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.440
 - Put down that old wacky backie.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.200
 (laughing)

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.560
 - Welcome to the dad car.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.160
 (laughing)

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.520
 - This is a different kind of Christmas tree

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.480
 to what you might be thinking.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.520
 It's the Australian Christmas tree

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.080
 and the Australian Christmas tree is different

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.800
 to our British Christmas trees.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.880
 - Upside down.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.720
 (laughing)

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.640
 - It's not upside down.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.960
 It's actually very beautiful.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.040
 It's also known as the--

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.880
 - All the baubles are made of cork.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.720
 Sorry.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.240
 (laughing)

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.520
 - They're not used as Christmas trees.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.640
 We should add in Australia.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.160
 We use the classic Christmas tree in Australia.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.200
 - Yep, you do, you Australians are saying

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.560
 do use the classic Christmas tree.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.720
 These are known as mungi or mood jar trees as well

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.320
 but they get called the Australian Christmas tree

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.080
 because they flower in December

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.480
 and they're endemic to Noongar County

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.560
 in Western Australia

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.640
 and they're really beautiful actually

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.520
 and they grow in very barren landscape

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.600
 and they're bright yellow flowers when they flower

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.240
 so they're like fires all over the desert

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.920
 but they are also parasites and it's so amazing.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.120
 So their roots can steal from other plants

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.240
 that are up to 110 meters away

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.360
 by slithering under the ground to this other plant

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.640
 and then the plant root wraps around the other plant's root

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.360
 and then injects a spike into it

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.360
 and can just suck out all their nutrients.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.160
 - It's extraordinary. - It's amazing.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.000
 - It's so cool.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.280
 - It's zombie stuff. - It's actually,

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.920
 it's tipped me over into believing in plant sentience now

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.760
 because you're always so skeptical about that.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.120
 - I've been on a fence, I've been on the line

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.720
 but this is just extraordinary what it does.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.360
 The thing that tipped me over is that

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.000
 it's a beautiful looking tree.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.520
 So even when they are cutting down areas

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.440
 where this tree grows,

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.120
 they'll cut everything down but this hot tree

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.440
 that just looks so cool

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.080
 and then it feeds off the grass.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.320
 That's basically what it is.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.840
 It's like, that's a sexy tree.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.880
 We're keeping that up.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.080
 It's evolved to be, I assume,

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.160
 a good looking tree to the human eye.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.000
 - No.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.120
 (laughing)

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:55.960
 - You assume wrong.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.800
 - But it is amazing.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.480
 - It's striking what it does.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.240
 It's pretty spooky stuff if you don't mind me saying so.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.560
 (laughing)

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.520
 It's so aggressive, it's yet another bit of evidence

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.040
 of like the Australian version of everything

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.480
 is much more lethal than the non-Australian version.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.000
 So it'll attack power cables.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.960
 It can cut, slice through power cables

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.960
 because it's so powerful, this wraparound organ it has.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.440
 Sometimes I read it steals juice from its own roots.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.280
 - Yes.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.120
 - It's wild.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.960
 - That's embarrassing.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.800
 - That was a big one.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.360
 - What it's trying to do is get the juice

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.920
 from the power cable because it thinks that's a root.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.760
 - Yeah.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.600
 - But actually it's just--

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.920
 - It's not just trying to contact its friends

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.640
 on the phone on the other side of Australia.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.480
 - Well maybe it would be trying to contact aliens

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.200
 because there was one time there was a space tracking station

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.320
 in Western Australia, which was connected

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.040
 by underground cables and it got into those as well.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:41.880
 - Wow.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.720
 - Really?

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.880
 - Yeah.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.200
 - Getting it from its own roots is an accident as well.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.040
 - It is an accident.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.160
 - You just find something else.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.400
 - So I don't know if you guys had or the listener has

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.600
 but I'd never heard of parasitic plants before

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.240
 as in I didn't really recognize

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.560
 that this relies entirely on stealing other juices

00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.400
 from other places.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.560
 - I suppose the most famous one is mistletoe.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.240
 Of which this is a type of mistletoe, isn't it?

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.720
 - So yeah, mistletoe famously just grows on other trees.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.560
 - It grows on other trees.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.200
 Photosynthesis is not a thing for it.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.560
 So it just relies entirely on it.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.080
 But just the idea that this needs other living things

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.840
 to live is extraordinary.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.160
 - It kind of, it can expose your year nine biology

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.840
 when you learn about how plants survive.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.640
 When actually there are thousands of plants

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.960
 that aren't doing any of that shit.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.560
 They're not bothering with all this complicated

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.280
 chemical equation with their leaves.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.680
 They just jab into other plants.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.520
 - Yeah.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.360
 - I think there are 4,000 species.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.720
 - Have you guys heard of Hydenora Africana?

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.560
 - No.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.080
 - According to one website I read and I quote,

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:38.080
 "No plant looks more like a labia than the Hydenora Africana.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:43.080
 "This flower not only has teeth-like traps to lure insects

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.160
 "to leaving or picking up their pollen,

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.440
 "but emits a feces-like sense to attract dung beetles."

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.280
 - Gosh.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.520
 - I just love that sentence.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.080
 "Nothing looks more like a labia

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.920
 "and it has teeth that smells like feces."

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.680
 - That's quite, that is a good riddle to ask.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.520
 - But yeah, this one sort of likes to attract dung beetles

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.320
 with its smell and a lot of those ones

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.640
 that are like really, really smelly plants,

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.120
 they are also parasitic.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.920
 - The dodder is amazing as well.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.920
 Did you guys read about that one?

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.760
 - Yeah.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.600
 - That one's extraordinary.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.520
 - It's a bit unstable on its feet, isn't it?

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.240
 But it's pretty extraordinary.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.560
 - Yeah, so this is a plant which is,

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:25.400
 it's got no roots or leaves and it's sort of yellowy looking.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.920
 It sort of grows on other plants

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.880
 and it's only got a lifespan of five to 10 days

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.520
 without a host, right?

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.080
 So it needs to find a host in that time and it goes--

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.760
 - Which is when the seed gets dispersed.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.160
 - Yeah, sorry, when the seed gets dispersed

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.320
 and it can sense where the closest best host is

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.040
 through the air, which is mad.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.520
 And then goes that way.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.360
 - Yeah, that I can see when--

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.200
 - It's really sinister.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.040
 - Sentience!

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.040
 - So sinister, Sedona.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.480
 - No, it is 'cause we don't understand

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.880
 a lot of how they do this, so it is extraordinary.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.720
 - It is amazing.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.680
 - And it's weird how pretty so many of them are.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.760
 It's like if you came out--

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.200
 - Almost like they evolved just so that humans

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.040
 would like this.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.880
 - Thank you, James.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.640
 - I love them.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.640
 There's one which lives entirely inside the stems of plants

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.480
 and this is a genus, pylostyles.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.680
 Nicely described in 1948 by Australia's government

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.840
 botanist who was called Charles Gardner.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.360
 - Right, very nice.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.480
 - And it's so pretty, so it just lives entirely inside a stem.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.360
 You don't notice there, it's just little threads.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.480
 And then plops out for about a week of the year.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.160
 Again, like the one Dan described.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.320
 And it's so pretty and these white flowers come out

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.760
 all over the stem of a plant.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.080
 So you'd think, gosh, this plant's looking so pretty

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.480
 and actually it's diseased.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.600
 - It's another plant.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.800
 - It's another plant.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.040
 - It's so weird, I love it.

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.520
 Did you guys hear about the logical pine dwarf mistletoe?

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.640
 This is another, so this is a kind of mistletoe.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.360
 Most mistletoe seeds are dispersed,

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.400
 almost kinds of mistletoe, they're dispersed by birds.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.080
 Birds eat the berries and then they fly somewhere else

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.560
 and then they poo out the seeds

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.800
 and the seeds have a new environment to grow in.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.480
 Not the lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.400
 It spreads by explosions.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.920
 - Oh.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.160
 - Basically the seed, each fruit has a single seed inside it

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.120
 which is covered in this very, very sticky stuff.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.320
 And then as the fruit matures,

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.360
 the pressure builds and builds and builds inside it.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.000
 And then eventually it just goes, blah.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.240
 - I've seen these exploding cucumbers in Greece.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.160
 - Yeah.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.800
 - So it was growing almost like a weed and some steps,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.680
 but I noticed it and it looks like a tiny little gherkin.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.920
 And then if you prod it enough,

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.360
 it just explodes and the seeds go everywhere.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.280
 And they're really cool, but they don't go that far.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.000
 - But then it apologizes and says,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.800
 sorry, that's never happened before for me.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:46.560
 - Do you know why mistletoe seeds are sticky?

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.480
 Because they are when they're dispersed.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.320
 - No, what is it?

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.680
 - Partly it's because they have to grow from up a tree,

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.560
 which is kind of cool anyway, so to stick to the tree.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.080
 But as you say, they're dispersed by birds,

00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.000
 pooing them out and then wiping them on trees.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.200
 So what it requires is for the bird to poo,

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.080
 but this annoying sticky seed gets stuck to its anus.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.080
 And so this bird's going,

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.400
 I've got this seed on my bum,

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.200
 I just need to wipe it on something.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.040
 And they wipe their bums on the tree branches.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.240
 And that's what sticks into it.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.280
 - And also because they've wiped their bums on the trees

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.680
 and their bums had poo on them,

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.800
 then they have their own fertilizer.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.640
 - Lovely.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.880
 - So it's like the perf, if you're a seed,

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.440
 you know, you're being flown to the top of a tree

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.000
 and you're being put exactly where you want

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.760
 with a load of fertilizer, it's a dream.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.000
 - So I just said, when you said that, I went, clever.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.160
 But I realized that's obviously humanizing it.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.000
 Like, what is it?

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:34.840
 What is that?

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.660
 If it's not clever, what is it?

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.500
 - Just the evolution is amazing.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.340
 - It's just what it is.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.760
 It's just a random thing.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.920
 - It's just over millions and millions of years.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.640
 Maybe even before humans existed,

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.200
 different things have been tried out.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.040
 And this is a lot of work.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:48.920
 - I don't think we invented sentience.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.240
 I've not played with humans for a long time.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.000
 - Is Ivy parasitic?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.280
 - No, that just, that just grows on stuff.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.880
 - If it just grows on something,

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.960
 it's not technically a parasite.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.840
 It has to be stealing its resources like it's sad.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.680
 - So it doesn't steal resources.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.960
 - It might not be particularly good for the thing

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.800
 that's growing on, but it's not parasitic.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.160
 - Yeah, it could weaken a tree and make it fall and so on.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.080
 Yeah, but okay.

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:10.040
 - Do you know what is, which makes people really angry,

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.280
 is orchids.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.120
 - A parasitic.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.120
 - In fact, all orchids are parasitic.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:14.960
 - No.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.800
 - Another beauty.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.720
 - But another beaut.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.400
 But this is something that is vigorously denied

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.320
 by the American Orchid Society.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.520
 (laughing)

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.600
 Again, it's so weird.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.920
 - That's brilliant.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.480
 - They're a slightly different kind of parasite.

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.720
 They parasitize mycorrhizal fungi,

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.320
 which are those threads underground,

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.080
 those fungal threads underground.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.400
 So all orchid seeds start off by parasitizing the fungi

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.920
 'cause they're not born with the resources

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.800
 to grow properly, so they steal from this fungi at first.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.880
 Many of them do it for their whole lives.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.400
 So the parasites, and yet on the FAQs page

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.680
 of the American Orchid Society,

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.880
 there's a question, are orchids parasites?

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.120
 - No, no, they're not.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:53.960
 Go away.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.280
 Stop asking questions.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.440
 - It is absolutely not of the approximately

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.280
 20,000 species of orchid.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.440
 Not one is parasitic.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.840
 - So how are they, how are they claiming that?

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.320
 Are they claiming that because it's hosted by the fungus

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.160
 that it's different to being hosted by a--

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.080
 - I think that's the assumption.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.440
 They don't address much like hearing

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.080
 a politician interviewed on the Today program.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.160
 They're really very much just repeating this one point.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.800
 - I don't think anyone wants to talk about parasites.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.440
 No, people want to hear about the good work

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.160
 that I'm doing for the people of the underground.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.280
 - Exactly.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.680
 - I think I've been buried down on sentient plants

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.360
 throughout this, but I do think fungi are evil.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.240
 (laughing)

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.920
 - Oh yeah, that's a good point.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.920
 - So there is a mushroom called fusarium xyrophylum.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.880
 This is amazing.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.000
 So it will find a plant called the xyros plant,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.760
 and it will sterilize it so it can't make flowers.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.320
 But it will then make its own flowers

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.400
 that look exactly like the normal ones,

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.280
 but they're made out of mushroom.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.120
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.960
 - That's amazing.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.440
 - Oh my God, like a tofu alternative.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.280
 (laughing)

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.120
 - Exactly like that.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.360
 - Plant replacement food.

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.320
 - So you might think you're getting a nice bunch

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.880
 from Interflora, but actually all those roses

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.920
 and lilies and whatever, they're all actually mushrooms.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.280
 - That reminds me of the show, is it cake?

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.120
 - Yeah.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.440
 (laughing)

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.640
 - There should be a show called, is it mushroom?

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.800
 - It looks like a sofa.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.640
 (laughing)

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.480
 - It's a mushroom.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.320
 - And then the final episode,

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.800
 it turns out the host is a mushroom.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.640
 - Yeah.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.240
 (laughing)

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.160
 - It's a format.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.520
 - You might think I'm the host,

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.280
 but in fact, I'm a parasite.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.040
 (laughing)

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.880
 - That's so funny.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.960
 I read just related to that.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.320
 This 2024 Bolton, where I'm from in Greater Manchester,

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:44.080
 has been named the town of culture for Greater Manchester.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.960
 But also this week, it was named as the moldiest town

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.640
 in the whole of the UK.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.280
 And it just feels like they got the wrong meaning

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.440
 of the word culture.

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.680
 (laughing)

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.260
 (upbeat music)

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.880
 - Okay, that's it.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.880
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.280

 We've got all of our previous episodes up there.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.200
 We have the doors to the secret club known as Club Fish.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.000
 We put lots of bonus material up there.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.040
 It's a really fun place.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.640
 There's a discord where all the listeners

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.320
 get to chat to each other.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.200
 It's really worth checking out, do that now.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.880
 And as you will know, we are back on the road

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.360
 with our new tour, Thunder Nerds.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.440
 We are gonna be coming to a bunch of cities and towns

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.600
 around the UK, and then we're going down

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.400
 under to Australia and New Zealand,

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.520
 get tickets now before it sells out,

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.400
 or otherwise just come back here next week.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.640
 We'll be here with another episode,

00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.520
 and we'll see you then.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.360
 Goodbye.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.940
 (upbeat music)

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.520
 (upbeat music)

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.100
 (upbeat music)

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.680
