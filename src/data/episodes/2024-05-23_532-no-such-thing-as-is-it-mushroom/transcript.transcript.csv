00:00:03,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, just before we start this show,"
00:00:04,00:00:06,I wanted to let you know that James and I
00:00:06,00:00:09,"are going to be doing a talk chat,"
00:00:09,00:00:13,"a lecture at the Hay Festival in Hay on Y,"
00:00:13,00:00:15,"next Wednesday, the 29th of May,"
00:00:15,00:00:18,and we are gonna be chatting about our new release

00:00:21,00:00:24,which is all the most interesting facts
00:00:24,00:00:26,and things we learned about sports.
00:00:26,00:00:28,"It's for sports lovers, it's for sports haters,"
00:00:28,00:00:29,"it's for sports skeptics,"
00:00:29,00:00:32,"you've got Mary Queen of Scots football in there,"
00:00:32,00:00:34,"you've got Michael Palin's Concord Tournament,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"you've got lacrosse games involving over 100,000 players."
00:00:37,00:00:39,There's something for everyone.
00:00:39,00:00:40,Do come and listen to us.
00:00:40,00:00:42,"Hay is such a fun festival anyway,"
00:00:42,00:00:43,"so to get tickets for that,"
00:00:43,00:00:47,"go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,"
00:00:47,00:00:48,"and while you're there,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,"obviously buy tickets for our tour,"
00:00:50,00:00:52,"if you haven't already, which you should have."
00:00:52,00:00:53,On with the show.
00:00:53,00:00:56,(upbeat music)
00:00:57,00:01:01,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:01,00:01:13,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:13,00:01:15,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:15,00:01:16,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:01:16,00:01:19,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:19,00:01:20,"My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,"James Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski,"
00:01:24,00:01:26,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:26,00:01:29,"of our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:01:29,00:01:32,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:32,00:01:35,"Starting with fact number one, that is James."
00:01:35,00:01:37,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the coroner"
00:01:37,00:01:40,who did the autopsy of President McKinley
00:01:40,00:01:43,injected part of him into a dog.
00:01:43,00:01:47,"So, he was autopsied by two doctors"
00:01:47,00:01:51,"called Harvey Gaylord and Herman Matzinger,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,and Matzinger wanted to find out
00:01:53,00:01:56,whether the bullet that killed McKinley
00:01:56,00:01:59,"had been poisoned or had some bacteria on it,"
00:01:59,00:02:02,like a biological weapon.
00:02:02,00:02:05,"And so, the way he did it was he took samples"
00:02:05,00:02:07,from the wound and he injected parts of it
00:02:07,00:02:10,"into some rabbits and a dog,"
00:02:10,00:02:13,"and wanted to see how the rabbits and dogs reacted,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,"because if there was poison on the bullet,"
00:02:15,00:02:17,maybe they would die and that would be evidence
00:02:17,00:02:21,that he'd been poisoned as well as shot.
00:02:21,00:02:22,- And?
00:02:22,00:02:25,- And it turns out that the thing that killed him
00:02:25,00:02:27,was the bullet that went right through his body.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"- Yeah, the dog was fine, wasn't it?"
00:02:29,00:02:31,"In the notes that were given, sort of said,"
00:02:31,00:02:33,"he was acting fine, doesn't mention the rabbit."
00:02:33,00:02:34,"- No, it doesn't mention the rabbit."
00:02:34,00:02:36,"It said that he was acting well, the dog,"
00:02:36,00:02:40,but his body temperature was around 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
00:02:40,00:02:41,- Is that good or bad for a dog?
00:02:41,00:02:43,- It's bad for a dog.
00:02:43,00:02:44,It should be a bit lower than that.
00:02:44,00:02:46,"- You can react badly to an injection,"
00:02:46,00:02:47,I certainly do at any time.
00:02:47,00:02:48,I get a raised temperature.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"We should say this was 1901 as well,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,"just for anyone who's not up on their presidents,"
00:02:52,00:02:56,President McKinley around 20th-ish.
00:02:56,00:02:57,"- 25th, I think?"
00:02:57,00:02:59,"- He was 25th president, that's right."
00:02:59,00:03:01,- So why am I talking about this today
00:03:01,00:03:04,if it was something that happened around 1900?
00:03:04,00:03:06,"Well, we don't talk to us anymore."
00:03:06,00:03:08,(laughing)
00:03:08,00:03:09,- This is a new feature.
00:03:09,00:03:13,"- Well, in the news this year,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,there was an auction site called the Raab Collection
00:03:15,00:03:17,and they found the personal papers
00:03:17,00:03:19,of this Dr. Herman Matzinga
00:03:19,00:03:21,and that gave us all of this information
00:03:21,00:03:23,"about him injecting the president into the dog,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,which we didn't know until this year.
00:03:25,00:03:26,- That's very cool.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"- He was actually, no wonder he liked animals"
00:03:28,00:03:29,'cause he was a buffalo doctor.
00:03:29,00:03:31,"And when I say buffalo doctor,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,he was a doctor who lived in the city of Buffalo
00:03:33,00:03:35,in New York. - Who's that Matzinga?
00:03:35,00:03:37,"- That was Matzinga, yeah, right."
00:03:37,00:03:39,I just thought I'd try and trick you guys there.
00:03:39,00:03:39,- Good trick.
00:03:39,00:03:41,But he wasn't the first man
00:03:41,00:03:44,to even look after McKinley when he came in.
00:03:44,00:03:46,That was a different man called Dr. Mann
00:03:46,00:03:49,"and Dr. Mann, Dr. Matthew Mann,"
00:03:49,00:03:51,and he wasn't even a proper surgeon.
00:03:51,00:03:52,He was a gynecologist.
00:03:52,00:03:54,He was a gynecological surgeon.
00:03:54,00:03:55,- Oh no.
00:03:55,00:03:56,- This man has no vagina.
00:03:56,00:04:00,"- It's all going into openings, isn't it?"
00:04:00,00:04:01,When someone's been shot.
00:04:01,00:04:03,- That's true. - What a comforting thing to hear.
00:04:03,00:04:06,Dr. Anna says you lie on the operating table.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"Look, it's all just stuff going in places."
00:04:08,00:04:09,Don't worry.
00:04:09,00:04:10,- It's all holes in the body.
00:04:10,00:04:12,- Let's inspect your chest vagina now.
00:04:12,00:04:16,"- Oh, the exit vagina is a lot bigger."
00:04:16,00:04:19,- But the weird thing is
00:04:19,00:04:21,Thomas Edison gets involved at this point.
00:04:21,00:04:22,- Of course he does.
00:04:22,00:04:25,"- He sent to Buffalo a new X-ray machine,"
00:04:25,00:04:29,"which is exactly like first ever episode of the podcast,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,James Garfield's shot.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"In that case, it was Alexander Graham Bell"
00:04:32,00:04:34,sending a proto-metal detector.
00:04:34,00:04:36,Basically all new technologies were at some point
00:04:36,00:04:39,just being tried on presidents who have been assassinated.
00:04:39,00:04:42,- So basically if God forbid the American president
00:04:42,00:04:43,"gets shot in the next couple of years,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,they'll probably send a chat bot.
00:04:45,00:04:45,- Yeah.
00:04:45,00:04:48,(all laughing)
00:04:48,00:04:49,- That's amazing.
00:04:49,00:04:52,So autopsies have come a long way
00:04:52,00:04:55,since the days of injecting stuff into animals.
00:04:55,00:04:58,And I didn't know really about body farms.
00:04:58,00:05:00,- That sounds grim.
00:05:00,00:05:02,- And yet it is.
00:05:02,00:05:03,(all laughing)
00:05:03,00:05:06,So they were basically invented by this guy called Billy Bass.
00:05:06,00:05:09,I remember that singing fish.
00:05:09,00:05:09,"- No, not Billy."
00:05:09,00:05:11,- Bigmouth Billy Bass is singing fish.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"- Wait, so he did body farms"
00:05:13,00:05:16,and then he did novelty singing fish?
00:05:16,00:05:17,- Fairly so.
00:05:17,00:05:19,Or it could be that they are different.
00:05:19,00:05:19,- People.
00:05:19,00:05:21,- So this guy called Bill Bass
00:05:21,00:05:25,was a forensic anthropologist in the 60s and 70s.
00:05:25,00:05:27,And he realized that we didn't know much
00:05:27,00:05:30,about what happens to bodies when they decompose.
00:05:30,00:05:32,And so he kind of bought up some farmland
00:05:32,00:05:35,and decided to collect loads and loads of dead bodies.
00:05:35,00:05:36,And it's still going today.
00:05:36,00:05:38,And there are now a few body farms around the world
00:05:38,00:05:40,and they're extraordinary places.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"- It does sound like an excuse, doesn't it?"
00:05:42,00:05:44,"When the police come and they say,"
00:05:44,00:05:47,why have you got hundreds of dead bodies buried in your field?
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- Well, also 'cause they're buried in really odd scenarios"
00:05:49,00:05:52,"'cause they're stored in the boots of cars, for instance."
00:05:52,00:05:53,- Oh yeah.
00:05:53,00:05:57,"- In pools of water, buried under rubble and in concrete."
00:05:57,00:05:59,"- No, this is my body allotment."
00:05:59,00:06:00,"I want one day to have a whole farm,"
00:06:00,00:06:03,but I've only got one so far.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- Yeah, they're incredible."
00:06:04,00:06:07,And we've learned so much about forensics from them.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"And yeah, they do things like,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,you'll be walking through a field
00:06:10,00:06:11,"and you might not see any bodies,"
00:06:11,00:06:14,but you might see pipes sticking up out of the ground.
00:06:14,00:06:16,And that's 'cause there are bodies underground
00:06:16,00:06:19,"and they're connected to pipes, which are collecting gases"
00:06:19,00:06:22,and the gases will determine what bodies smell of
00:06:22,00:06:24,and that's so that we can develop machines in the future
00:06:24,00:06:26,that can detect them by smell.
00:06:26,00:06:27,- That is stunning. - That's classy.
00:06:27,00:06:29,Leaving your body to science like that
00:06:29,00:06:30,is a really good thing to do.
00:06:30,00:06:34,"As in, well, I hope I have the gumption to do that."
00:06:34,00:06:35,I felt that we established
00:06:35,00:06:36,you won't have any body remaining
00:06:36,00:06:38,after we got to it from last week's episode.
00:06:38,00:06:39,It's a fun little callback
00:06:39,00:06:41,if you haven't listened to last week's episode yet.
00:06:41,00:06:42,Find out what's gonna happen to me
00:06:42,00:06:44,when these three get their hands on me.
00:06:44,00:06:47,"- So the father of autopsy, what people call that"
00:06:47,00:06:49,is a guy called Karl Rokitansky.
00:06:49,00:06:52,And he came up with the idea of like looking
00:06:52,00:06:56,at the internal organs to diagnose disease on the outside.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"He personally performed 30,000 autopsies"
00:06:59,00:07:01,"and supervised another 70,000."
00:07:01,00:07:03,"- Sorry, 30,000? - Yeah."
00:07:03,00:07:06,- That's one a day for like ages.
00:07:06,00:07:07,(laughing)
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- It's one a day for a hundred years, isn't it?"
00:07:09,00:07:09,- Yeah. - Wasn't it?
00:07:09,00:07:11,"- Yeah, he did more than one a day."
00:07:11,00:07:12,It's the way he got through that.
00:07:12,00:07:13,- Clever.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"- It's weekends, that's evenings, that's your birthday."
00:07:16,00:07:17,Maybe you do more on your birthday.
00:07:17,00:07:19,I don't know if you're the father of it.
00:07:19,00:07:20,- So I got a question.
00:07:20,00:07:22,I think Andy's the best one to answer this.
00:07:22,00:07:23,- Okay.
00:07:23,00:07:24,- But Dan might be able to answer
00:07:24,00:07:25,and Anna definitely won't.
00:07:25,00:07:26,- Interesting.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- So it's guy's stuff.
00:07:27,00:07:31,- He's called Karl Rokitansky.
00:07:31,00:07:32,And where do you know that name from?
00:07:32,00:07:34,- Karl Rokitansky. - Rokitansky.
00:07:34,00:07:36,- Rokitansky.
00:07:36,00:07:38,- What are you guys both into?
00:07:38,00:07:39,"- Something that I associate with both of you,"
00:07:39,00:07:41,which is shit movies.
00:07:41,00:07:42,- Oh.
00:07:42,00:07:44,- Was he in?
00:07:44,00:07:45,- Adam Sandler's real name.
00:07:45,00:07:47,(all laughing)
00:07:47,00:07:49,"- Actually, it's unfair to call this a shit movie."
00:07:49,00:07:50,"It's actually a classic,"
00:07:50,00:07:52,but it's the kind of movie you two would like.
00:07:52,00:07:53,- Pacific Rim 2.
00:07:53,00:07:54,(all laughing)
00:07:54,00:07:58,"- He gave his name to Max Rokitansky,"
00:07:58,00:08:02,who is the main character in the film series Mad Max.
00:08:02,00:08:05,- Oh. - That's amazing.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"And that's 'cause George Miller, who directed it,"
00:08:07,00:08:11,he was working as a doctor when he was getting funds for it.
00:08:11,00:08:12,"- What, George Miller?"
00:08:12,00:08:13,- That's amazing. - That's very cool.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"- Yeah, George Miller's career has been amazing."
00:08:15,00:08:15,He's done Mad Max.
00:08:15,00:08:18,"He did Babe 2 Pig in the City, Happy Feet,"
00:08:18,00:08:19,and then more Mad Max.
00:08:19,00:08:22,"- Yeah, this weird fund."
00:08:22,00:08:23,"What was it called, the latest one?"
00:08:23,00:08:25,- The one's second to last.
00:08:25,00:08:26,- Fury Road. - Fury Road.
00:08:26,00:08:28,- He's like in his 70s radies
00:08:28,00:08:29,when he comes out to make that again.
00:08:29,00:08:31,Like he's-- - And the new ones out shortly?
00:08:31,00:08:32,- Yeah.
00:08:32,00:08:32,- Anyway.
00:08:32,00:08:33,- So why does he--
00:08:33,00:08:36,- This is why I thought these two liked this answer.
00:08:36,00:08:38,- I have actually seen Mad Max uncharacteristically.
00:08:38,00:08:40,I thought it was very dystopian.
00:08:40,00:08:42,I'd rather be locked on a body bath.
00:08:42,00:08:42,- Yeah.
00:08:42,00:08:43,- You know what?
00:08:43,00:08:44,The plot was not lost on you.
00:08:44,00:08:46,(all laughing)
00:08:46,00:08:48,"- Oh, dear."
00:08:48,00:08:50,"James, I have a different father of autopsy."
00:08:50,00:08:51,"- Oh, yeah, go on."
00:08:51,00:08:53,- Mondino De Liuzzi.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"- Oh, I can't hear this again."
00:08:55,00:08:55,- Is it?
00:08:55,00:08:56,Can we hear this again?
00:08:56,00:08:59,- Who is the father of autopsy and me?
00:08:59,00:09:00,"- Don't do that, look."
00:09:00,00:09:02,- Most episodes.
00:09:02,00:09:04,(all laughing)
00:09:04,00:09:08,- Mondino De Liuzzi was the Restorer of Anatomy.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"He was Italian, if you couldn't tell."
00:09:10,00:09:11,(all laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:13,At the University of Bologna.
00:09:13,00:09:14,"And Anatomy was a band,"
00:09:14,00:09:18,except for once every five years you could do a dissection.
00:09:18,00:09:19,- Wow.
00:09:19,00:09:19,- Dissection.
00:09:19,00:09:21,- Is this like what's that film where sort of every 10 years
00:09:21,00:09:22,"or something, you can all kill each other?"
00:09:22,00:09:23,- The Purge.
00:09:23,00:09:24,- Yeah.
00:09:24,00:09:25,This is basically the Purge.
00:09:25,00:09:26,"- Oh my God, Anna."
00:09:26,00:09:29,You are in your dystopian worlds today.
00:09:29,00:09:30,"- I am, yeah."
00:09:30,00:09:31,- Amazing.
00:09:31,00:09:33,"- So De Liuzzi, he became the first person"
00:09:33,00:09:36,"to do a dissection, document it and publish his findings."
00:09:36,00:09:39,And it was the first documented public dissection
00:09:39,00:09:41,in 1700 years.
00:09:41,00:09:42,- Right.
00:09:42,00:09:43,- Amazing.
00:09:43,00:09:44,"But weirdly, senior people like him,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,they would not do the actual dissection themselves.
00:09:47,00:09:48,So there's a picture of this happening.
00:09:48,00:09:50,And it was in the 14th century.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"Senior people like him, they wouldn't do the dissection."
00:09:53,00:09:56,He would sit on a big elevated chair above the action.
00:09:56,00:09:58,- Like a tennis umpire.
00:09:58,00:09:59,- Exactly like that.
00:09:59,00:10:01,And he was reading aloud from a book.
00:10:01,00:10:02,I'm bringing him a book of Anatomy.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"- No balls, please."
00:10:03,00:10:06,(all laughing)
00:10:06,00:10:08,"- And he was commenting on,"
00:10:08,00:10:10,"he was reading Galen's Anatomy to the audience and saying,"
00:10:10,00:10:11,"look, now you're gonna say,"
00:10:11,00:10:12,there was just a sort of barber surgeon
00:10:12,00:10:13,actually doing the procedure.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"And also, do we ever mention the ostensor?"
00:10:17,00:10:19,That was basically someone with one of those pointers
00:10:19,00:10:21,whose job was to just point out the bits
00:10:21,00:10:26,that were being autopsyed or examined or whatever.
00:10:26,00:10:27,- Separate to the guy on the chair.
00:10:27,00:10:29,- The guy on the chair is talking you through it.
00:10:29,00:10:29,"- 'Cause he can't reach,"
00:10:29,00:10:30,he'd need a very long ostensor.
00:10:30,00:10:33,"- Exactly, I mean, they can go very long, those."
00:10:33,00:10:34,That's true.
00:10:34,00:10:35,"The ostensor is just there going,"
00:10:35,00:10:39,"""Vada, there's the pancreas, uh-huh, front door."""
00:10:39,00:10:40,"- Yeah, they became really popular,"
00:10:40,00:10:44,"didn't they, dissections in Italy especially."
00:10:44,00:10:46,"Around the time of the 16th century,"
00:10:46,00:10:50,"they were so popular, you could buy flap anatomies."
00:10:50,00:10:53,"And a flap anatomy was like a book with flaps in it,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"you know, like a kid's book,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"where you could lift up the flaps and say,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,"""Oh, look, there's the gallbladder."""
00:10:59,00:11:01,"- Oh, yeah, so cool. - Isn't that cool?"
00:11:01,00:11:02,- Wow.
00:11:02,00:11:03,- I can't believe that technology is that old.
00:11:03,00:11:04,- I don't know.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"- Well, I mean, the technology is quite basic for a flap."
00:11:07,00:11:08,(laughing)
00:11:08,00:11:10,Literally just a piece of paper.
00:11:10,00:11:13,But I don't know if there were any kids books
00:11:13,00:11:15,"that did that before then, I can't imagine that would have."
00:11:15,00:11:19,So I think the original kids flap book was probably this.
00:11:19,00:11:20,- That's great. - Wow.
00:11:20,00:11:23,- Have you heard of vampire autopsies?
00:11:23,00:11:24,These are very weird.
00:11:24,00:11:25,These are a real thing that used to happen.
00:11:25,00:11:28,There was concern that if you were dug up
00:11:28,00:11:30,"and you were very well preserved,"
00:11:30,00:11:31,you might be a vampire.
00:11:31,00:11:33,And there was this big superstition
00:11:33,00:11:36,that tuberculosis was an inherited disease.
00:11:36,00:11:39,So the dead could drain the life of their descendants.
00:11:39,00:11:40,"Actually, those people had TB,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,but the idea was that they were kind of being drained
00:11:42,00:11:43,by the people who died.
00:11:43,00:11:45,And there was a theory that the body of the dead person
00:11:45,00:11:47,had to be destroyed to protect the health of the living.
00:11:47,00:11:50,The last one of these happened in 1949.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- What?
00:11:51,00:11:52,- I know.
00:11:52,00:11:53,"- Was it to kill them,"
00:11:53,00:11:56,to stop them vampirizing other people in 1949?
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Yeah. - Right.
00:11:57,00:11:58,- Very weird.
00:11:58,00:12:00,We should have done my spooky voice for that.
00:12:00,00:12:01,- Yeah. - Come on.
00:12:01,00:12:03,- I read about a very interesting autopsy
00:12:03,00:12:05,that happened in 1533.
00:12:05,00:12:08,And it was an autopsy that was done on two children
00:12:08,00:12:10,who were infant twins who were conjoined.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"And the question was, are these two children,"
00:12:13,00:12:16,two children with two souls or one soul?
00:12:16,00:12:18,"And the autopsy was to determine that to work out,"
00:12:18,00:12:21,is there one soul between two kids?
00:12:21,00:12:22,- How many souls did they find?
00:12:22,00:12:23,- They found two.
00:12:23,00:12:24,"- Oh, did they?"
00:12:24,00:12:26,"- Yeah, they found two because there's a Greek idea"
00:12:26,00:12:28,that the soul resided in the heart
00:12:28,00:12:31,and they found two hearts within the conjoined twins.
00:12:31,00:12:32,"Therefore, that was the answer that they were given."
00:12:32,00:12:36,But that was like a very theological specific autopsy.
00:12:36,00:12:37,- I think the important part of that was
00:12:37,00:12:40,"that these children hadn't been baptized,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,"but they would baptize people after their death,"
00:12:42,00:12:43,wouldn't they?
00:12:43,00:12:45,"And so, if they only had one soul,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,they'd only have to have one baptism.
00:12:47,00:12:48,"But if they had two souls,"
00:12:48,00:12:48,they'd have to have two baptisms.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"- Surely, less effort just to do the double baptism."
00:12:51,00:12:53,"You know, just let's do two, cover up."
00:12:53,00:12:54,"- Yeah, but if you baptize twice,"
00:12:54,00:12:56,then that undoes the effect of the first baptism.
00:12:56,00:12:57,- Absolutely.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"- Yeah, it's like being bonked on the head"
00:12:58,00:13:00,"by something, losing your memory."
00:13:00,00:13:02,"- Oh, right, the second bonk brings it back."
00:13:02,00:13:03,I see.
00:13:03,00:13:05,"Another autopsy, which was quite amazing,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,was a little bit later on in 2010.
00:13:07,00:13:10,And this is the amazing stuff they can reveal now.
00:13:10,00:13:12,So this was a robbery in Oregon
00:13:12,00:13:14,and it was two men in masks
00:13:14,00:13:18,who tried to rob a cafe or coffee kiosk at gunpoint.
00:13:18,00:13:20,And the guy who was managing the kiosk
00:13:20,00:13:22,also whipped out a gun 'cause it was America.
00:13:22,00:13:25,And he managed to shoot one of the people
00:13:25,00:13:26,"who was robbing him,"
00:13:26,00:13:28,but the other one got away.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"Now, they did an autopsy on the one robber that he'd shot"
00:13:31,00:13:33,and they looked in his belly
00:13:33,00:13:38,and there was a still intact French fry in his stomach.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"Now, we know about how much French fries degrade"
00:13:41,00:13:42,and how good I digest.
00:13:42,00:13:44,So they knew that he must have eaten a French fry
00:13:44,00:13:45,sort of in the last hour.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"Not only that, but someone doing the autopsy"
00:13:47,00:13:50,managed to identify it as a Wendy's French fry.
00:13:50,00:13:51,- Come on.
00:13:51,00:13:52,(laughing)
00:13:52,00:13:53,- Give me a break.
00:13:53,00:13:54,I think I could tell the difference
00:13:54,00:13:56,between a Burger King and the McDonald's one for sure.
00:13:56,00:13:57,- There you go.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Someone tasted it.
00:13:58,00:13:59,They drew straws.
00:13:59,00:14:00,- Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:01,- So it's a Wendy's fry.
00:14:01,00:14:02,- Wendy's fry.
00:14:02,00:14:04,So they just looked all the nearby Wendy's restaurants
00:14:04,00:14:05,'cause there couldn't have been more than an hour ago
00:14:05,00:14:06,he ate it.
00:14:06,00:14:08,And they looked at the security footage
00:14:08,00:14:09,and there was one within an hour.
00:14:09,00:14:12,And they did indeed find the pictures of the two people
00:14:12,00:14:14,on CCTV and found the other guy.
00:14:14,00:14:15,- Wow.
00:14:15,00:14:17,I'm gonna hear how they know it was a Wendy's fry.
00:14:17,00:14:19,"I'm sure, I mean, I believe it."
00:14:19,00:14:20,"I just, I'm just curious."
00:14:20,00:14:21,- Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:22,- We don't have Wendy's here.
00:14:22,00:14:24,"So we don't have, if you can let us know"
00:14:24,00:14:26,"if Wendy's fries are particularly,"
00:14:26,00:14:27,maybe they're S-shaped or something.
00:14:27,00:14:30,- Moral of the story is always chew your food.
00:14:30,00:14:31,- That's a really good point.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Why is the fry intact?
00:14:32,00:14:36,"- I mean, he's literally inhaled that fry, hasn't he?"
00:14:36,00:14:38,"- Oh my God, I'd be so easy to autopsy"
00:14:38,00:14:39,if I committed a crime.
00:14:39,00:14:41,All my food enters my body and completely intact.
00:14:41,00:14:44,(laughing)
00:14:44,00:14:46,(upbeat music)
00:14:46,00:14:51,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:14:51,00:14:53,And that is Andy.
00:14:53,00:14:56,My fact is that England's worst ever pennies
00:14:56,00:14:59,are worth 350 pounds each.
00:14:59,00:15:00,- Hmm.
00:15:00,00:15:01,"- Well, they may be some of the best."
00:15:01,00:15:04,"These are coins called the Tealby pennies, right?"
00:15:04,00:15:06,And this is a story of a man.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"Well, why am I telling you this fact today?"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Well, I'll tell you."
00:15:09,00:15:10,(laughing)
00:15:10,00:15:13,- Is this gonna be a new feature now?
00:15:13,00:15:15,"I'm gonna start finding it quite tedious, I think."
00:15:15,00:15:18,"- Basically, there's a man called Tony House,"
00:15:18,00:15:19,which I love.
00:15:19,00:15:21,He's a metal detectorist and he was out
00:15:21,00:15:25,"and detecting away and he found a stash of pennies,"
00:15:25,00:15:28,"ancient ones, they're from the 12th century."
00:15:28,00:15:31,He found one and then he found 600 more.
00:15:31,00:15:33,(laughing)
00:15:33,00:15:37,- That's like if you see one and two in your house.
00:15:37,00:15:38,- Exactly.
00:15:38,00:15:40,(laughing)
00:15:40,00:15:43,And they're worth about 350 quid each.
00:15:43,00:15:44,"And the thing about them is they're really,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,really low quality coins.
00:15:46,00:15:49,"They are badly made, they're hard to read."
00:15:49,00:15:51,The image is just hopelessly stamped.
00:15:51,00:15:52,They're from the reign of Henry II.
00:15:52,00:15:54,"They're named after Tealby in Lincolnshire,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,"which is where 5,000 of them were found"
00:15:56,00:15:58,in a huge cache in the 19th century.
00:15:58,00:15:59,"- Ah, cache."
00:15:59,00:16:03,- And they're just really ropey coins.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"- So why are they worth so much,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,just 'cause they're old now and rare?
00:16:06,00:16:07,"- Rare, maybe?"
00:16:07,00:16:07,"They're old, they're pretty rare."
00:16:07,00:16:08,- I thought they were quite a lot of them.
00:16:08,00:16:11,"- Well, I was on a numismatist website called Numsock,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,which was really good.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"It says this coinage is renowned for its ugly appearance,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,bad craftsmanship and careless execution.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"To collect Tealby pennies in the first place,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,it grounds you as a little strange.
00:16:22,00:16:22,(laughing)
00:16:22,00:16:23,- Yeah.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"- Right, to be strange in the numismatist world"
00:16:25,00:16:27,is truly strangeness.
00:16:27,00:16:31,"I kind of absolutely love numismatism, in fact,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,even though it's really hard to say.
00:16:33,00:16:37,"And I love coin research because, A, it's so reliable."
00:16:37,00:16:39,"It's such reliable history, there's no spurious,"
00:16:39,00:16:40,"oh, what was this used for?"
00:16:40,00:16:43,Because all the information that you need is on this coin.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"It's like, there's a date, there's a face,"
00:16:45,00:16:46,it's a physical thing.
00:16:46,00:16:47,And people--
00:16:47,00:16:48,- You're saying we have no mystery coins
00:16:48,00:16:49,that we don't know the stories behind?
00:16:49,00:16:50,"- Oh, yeah."
00:16:50,00:16:51,"I mean, we will have some mystery coins."
00:16:51,00:16:53,"Don't worry, Dan, there are the alien theories out there,"
00:16:53,00:16:54,I'm sure.
00:16:54,00:16:56,"- Good, 'cause all my research."
00:16:56,00:16:58,- But people are also so obsessed.
00:16:58,00:16:59,"I was on a Reddit thread,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"which was started by someone who said,"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"""I ranked all the Roman emperors for their coinage"
00:17:04,00:17:05,"""based on its artistic value, variety,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"""collectibility and historical value."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"""Feel free to ask me about the rankings."""
00:17:09,00:17:11,And everyone did.
00:17:11,00:17:12,(laughing)
00:17:12,00:17:15,- That is really tragic of no one else's life.
00:17:15,00:17:16,(laughing)
00:17:16,00:17:17,"- Oh, don't you worry."
00:17:17,00:17:18,- Anyone?
00:17:18,00:17:19,- Thousands.
00:17:19,00:17:22,I can tell you that Claudius wasn't high enough.
00:17:22,00:17:23,"And Claudius, of course,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,was responsible for the return to realism
00:17:25,00:17:27,instead of the vaguely Hellenistic idealism
00:17:27,00:17:28,on previous coins.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"So he should have had at least an A rank,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,according to one person.
00:17:32,00:17:33,(laughing)
00:17:33,00:17:34,"One person just said, ""I feel insulted"
00:17:34,00:17:37,"""you ranked Nero as high as Augustus."""
00:17:37,00:17:38,"And this is not as an emperor,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,this is his coinage.
00:17:40,00:17:41,(laughing)
00:17:41,00:17:42,- Right.
00:17:42,00:17:45,"- You were saying about there being no dubious coins,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Anna, which did backtrack on Inferness, but--"
00:17:47,00:17:48,"- I guess, yeah."
00:17:48,00:17:50,"- I have an interesting thing that I found,"
00:17:50,00:17:52,which is about rainbow cups.
00:17:52,00:17:53,Don't know if you guys found this.
00:17:53,00:17:55,- Was it related to the moon cup?
00:17:55,00:17:56,(laughing)
00:17:56,00:17:58,"- In the fact that they're cup shaped, both."
00:17:58,00:17:59,- Okay.
00:17:59,00:18:00,- Only.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"So these are coins that are cup shaped,"
00:18:02,00:18:04,"and you find them, especially in Germany,"
00:18:04,00:18:06,and you'll find them in fields.
00:18:06,00:18:09,"But these are often found after it had been raining,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,but then it was sunny straight afterwards.
00:18:11,00:18:14,Because not only are they kind of pushed forward
00:18:14,00:18:15,"by the muddiness,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,"but also water gets into the cup-ness,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,"and it shines, and they're really easy to find,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,because the reflection of the light comes off.
00:18:22,00:18:25,And people associated them with rainbows.
00:18:25,00:18:28,"And according to Discover Magazine,"
00:18:28,00:18:29,"which is usually a pretty good source,"
00:18:29,00:18:32,this is the reason that we have like a crock of gold
00:18:32,00:18:34,at the end of a rainbow.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"- Oh, no."
00:18:35,00:18:36,"- People, whenever there was a rainbow,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,they would find these cup shaped coins.
00:18:38,00:18:39,- Very good.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- That's awesome.
00:18:40,00:18:42,- And apparently there were tribes of Southern Germany
00:18:42,00:18:45,"that were Celtic tribes that moved up into Ireland,"
00:18:45,00:18:48,and that's why the Irish associated with leprechauns.
00:18:48,00:18:49,- I love that.
00:18:49,00:18:50,That's amazing.
00:18:50,00:18:51,- Isn't that cool?
00:18:51,00:18:52,"- Yeah, that's really cool."
00:18:52,00:18:52,- That's great.
00:18:52,00:18:54,I've got a favorite coin.
00:18:54,00:18:55,- Yeah.
00:18:55,00:18:56,- You've got a double eagle.
00:18:56,00:18:57,"This is an American coin,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,and it was a $10 coin issued in 1933.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"Half a million of them were struck,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,but they weren't issued as legal tender.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"'Cause in 1933, the Great Depression, blah, blah, blah,"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"banking crisis, gold coins are outlawed as legal tender."
00:19:09,00:19:12,It is now illegal to own a double eagle one.
00:19:12,00:19:13,- What?
00:19:13,00:19:16,"- Yeah, they're all technically U.S. government property."
00:19:16,00:19:17,- Because they never put them out.
00:19:17,00:19:20,You can't have accidentally got one in your change
00:19:20,00:19:20,and own it.
00:19:20,00:19:21,- I see.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"- If you have one, it must've been stolen."
00:19:22,00:19:24,"I think there is one, isn't there?"
00:19:24,00:19:26,"- There's one, so there are two in the Smithsonian,"
00:19:26,00:19:27,"which is kind of different,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,but then there's one which is not illegal to own.
00:19:29,00:19:31,I can't work out exactly why that's the only one
00:19:31,00:19:32,"that's not illegal to own,"
00:19:32,00:19:36,but it was sold in 2021 at auction for nearly 50 million
00:19:36,00:19:37,pounds.
00:19:37,00:19:38,- Wow.
00:19:38,00:19:40,- What happened was a few of them were stolen
00:19:40,00:19:43,and found their way into private hands via a jeweler
00:19:43,00:19:46,"called Israel Svit, who was from Philadelphia."
00:19:46,00:19:50,"And when they came to light, they would just get confiscated"
00:19:50,00:19:51,'cause you weren't allowed to have them.
00:19:51,00:19:56,But one of them got sold to King Farouk of Egypt.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"And he wrote to the Treasury Department said,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,"""I have this coin, is it okay if I keep it?"""
00:20:01,00:20:04,"And they hadn't discovered the theft at that stage,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,so they didn't realize that they'd been stolen.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"And so they replied to him saying,"
00:20:07,00:20:08,"""Yeah, you can keep it."""
00:20:08,00:20:09,"- Wow, that's good."
00:20:09,00:20:10,- And that's the one.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"That's the one that if it ever comes up,"
00:20:11,00:20:13,is the one that gets sold at auction.
00:20:13,00:20:13,- Amazing.
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Wow.
00:20:14,00:20:15,"- So that's, I think, unique."
00:20:15,00:20:16,- That is.
00:20:16,00:20:17,"- Yeah, that's really cool."
00:20:17,00:20:19,"- Just while we're on American coins,"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"in 2007, there was a coin that was minted"
00:20:21,00:20:24,which had an image of JFK on it.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"And if you pressed a button on the coin,"
00:20:27,00:20:32,it played a short excerpt of his Iqbin Einbilina.
00:20:32,00:20:35,So it had little technology in it to do that.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"- No, I don't believe that was legal tendancy."
00:20:37,00:20:38,(laughing)
00:20:38,00:20:39,- Do you know where that was minted?
00:20:39,00:20:40,What country that was for?
00:20:40,00:20:41,- Germany.
00:20:41,00:20:42,- Sounds it right.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Mongolia.
00:20:43,00:20:44,(laughing)
00:20:44,00:20:45,- Lovely.
00:20:45,00:20:49,- Do you guys know that the first book written
00:20:49,00:20:51,about the history of the coin
00:20:51,00:20:53,was called the Ass and Party Bus?
00:20:53,00:20:56,- The Ass and Party Bus?
00:20:56,00:20:57,- Is that right?
00:20:57,00:20:59,Is that a Latin book?
00:20:59,00:21:00,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:00,00:21:00,- I see.
00:21:00,00:21:02,- It's actually the ass at Party Bus.
00:21:02,00:21:04,So I have translated two of the words.
00:21:04,00:21:07,- Of ass and--
00:21:07,00:21:08,- Party Bus means like parts of.
00:21:08,00:21:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:09,00:21:12,- Ass was like an old Roman coin.
00:21:12,00:21:13,"- Oh, that's great."
00:21:13,00:21:16,"- Published in 1514 by Huiam Boudd,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,"and to be honest, is quite boring."
00:21:18,00:21:20,(laughing)
00:21:20,00:21:22,"- But you read the whole thing, presumably."
00:21:22,00:21:23,"- Yeah, the first 10 pages are about"
00:21:23,00:21:25,the etymology of the word ass.
00:21:25,00:21:26,Then it goes on about--
00:21:26,00:21:28,- I bet you read that so voraciously.
00:21:28,00:21:29,- Yeah.
00:21:29,00:21:30,- That's brilliant.
00:21:30,00:21:31,"- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
00:21:31,00:21:32,- They were big.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"- One actually amazing thing,"
00:21:33,00:21:35,"speaking of Romans and coins,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,is that coins are the reason
00:21:37,00:21:40,that we're still discovering Roman emperors.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"Which I, sorry, I just still, I didn't know."
00:21:42,00:21:43,- Wow.
00:21:43,00:21:45,- We discovered our latest Roman emperor in 2022.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"- No, no, no, it's true."
00:21:48,00:21:49,- Who were we missing?
00:21:49,00:21:50,- This is--
00:21:50,00:21:51,- It's not a biggie.
00:21:51,00:21:52,It's not like in between Nero.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, to Augustus actually."
00:21:54,00:21:56,It only came to light.
00:21:56,00:21:59,"No, this is the great Sponsienus."
00:21:59,00:22:01,(laughing)
00:22:01,00:22:03,"- Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a legit one."
00:22:03,00:22:04,"- Hi, I'm doing it."
00:22:04,00:22:05,"Oh, would you like to sponsor my anus?"
00:22:05,00:22:08,(laughing)
00:22:08,00:22:12,"- This is from, well, we think it's from the disaster century,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,"whatever it's called, the crisis century in the Roman period,"
00:22:14,00:22:15,"which was like the third century,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,when it was all falling to pieces
00:22:16,00:22:19,and there were sort of 1900 emperors.
00:22:19,00:22:21,But the reason he's only just come to light
00:22:21,00:22:23,is because there were these coins found
00:22:23,00:22:25,"in Transylvania in the 1700s,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"which were assumed to be fake,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,and people looked at them and said they were true.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"- Andy, sorry, can Andy,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"can you say these coins were found in Transylvania, please?"
00:22:32,00:22:36,- These coins were found in Transylvania.
00:22:36,00:22:38,"- Yeah, that seems to add to it for me."
00:22:38,00:22:40,"- Yeah, you're absolutely right, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:45,"They were found in Transylvania in the 1700s,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"and they had a picture of this bloke,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,"and it said Sponsienus under it, and--"
00:22:49,00:22:50,- Sponsienus.
00:22:50,00:22:52,(laughing)
00:22:52,00:22:55,- It just doesn't work when you do it down.
00:22:55,00:22:58,"Anyway, it was decided that they were fakes,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,and it was only in 2022 that analysis of them
00:23:01,00:23:03,actually concluded they were probably real.
00:23:03,00:23:05,And so we've literally just found out
00:23:05,00:23:06,that there was a Roman emperor
00:23:06,00:23:10,at some time between 248 and 253 AD.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"- Okay, wow."
00:23:12,00:23:15,- Very much a sort of Liz Truss style.
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Lincoln, you'll miss him."
00:23:16,00:23:18,"- Yeah, I think it was in and out, job."
00:23:18,00:23:20,"- And just one coin so far, did you say?"
00:23:20,00:23:21,- I think there are a couple.
00:23:21,00:23:22,I believe there are two coins.
00:23:22,00:23:25,- Did you hear about the Eid Ma Aureus?
00:23:25,00:23:26,So there's another Roman coin.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"Is this the, like after Caesar was killed?"
00:23:29,00:23:30,- Yes.
00:23:30,00:23:34,- This is a coin that celebrates the assassination
00:23:34,00:23:36,"of Julius Caesar, minted by Brutus,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,"and it has the inscription, ""Eid Ma,"""
00:23:38,00:23:39,"which is, ""Eids of Mars."""
00:23:39,00:23:40,And it has their daggers on.
00:23:40,00:23:42,Brutus and Cassius' daggers are depicted.
00:23:42,00:23:43,- It's crazy.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"It's like immediately after, almost, right?"
00:23:45,00:23:46,Like it's like merch.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"- That's kind of what they did, though, wasn't it?"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"It was like, ""Get rid of the old emperor."
00:23:50,00:23:50,How do you do it?
00:23:50,00:23:52,"Well, let's just mint a load of coins."""
00:23:52,00:23:53,- Yeah.
00:23:53,00:23:54,- It doesn't matter how you do it.
00:23:54,00:23:57,"- Interestingly, Julius Caesar was the first known autopsy"
00:23:57,00:23:59,that we have ever done stuff.
00:23:59,00:24:00,- Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:02,- Was that required?
00:24:02,00:24:05,"- Well, they found out that he was stabbed 23 times."
00:24:05,00:24:05,- Right.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"I mean, that, yeah."
00:24:07,00:24:09,"- But was that poison on the dagger,"
00:24:09,00:24:10,which was the actual cause of death?
00:24:10,00:24:12,- I can't deal with this many vaginas.
00:24:12,00:24:15,(both laughing)
00:24:15,00:24:17,- But they wanted to find out
00:24:17,00:24:20,which of the stabbings was the one that killed him.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"- No, how did they, no offense to the Romans."
00:24:22,00:24:24,How did they think they were gonna be able to do that?
00:24:24,00:24:25,Surely it would have been some combination
00:24:25,00:24:26,of the 23 that did it.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"- I could tell you, because most of them were"
00:24:28,00:24:30,either in the face or the groin.
00:24:30,00:24:31,It was found.
00:24:31,00:24:31,"- Oh, they were in the face."
00:24:31,00:24:33,- I didn't know that.
00:24:33,00:24:33,- Wow.
00:24:33,00:24:34,- And it was just one or two.
00:24:34,00:24:36,And I think one of them went through
00:24:36,00:24:38,is the side of his arm and into his arm's room.
00:24:38,00:24:39,"- Right, okay."
00:24:39,00:24:41,- So they decided that that was it.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- Wow.
00:24:42,00:24:42,- Anyway.
00:24:42,00:24:43,- Blimey.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"- And the groin, was that deliberate?"
00:24:45,00:24:46,- Yeah.
00:24:46,00:24:47,"- Doesn't seem inadvertent, does it?"
00:24:47,00:24:48,- Yeah.
00:24:48,00:24:48,- Going for a crotch.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"- Coin villain, Henry VIII."
00:24:50,00:24:51,- Really?
00:24:51,00:24:54,"- Yeah, but the numismatists foe."
00:24:54,00:24:57,So he wasted lots of money on wars
00:24:57,00:24:58,"with foreigners, basically."
00:24:58,00:25:03,"And he specifically, he debased the currency."
00:25:03,00:25:05,He issued new coins where he'd put copper
00:25:05,00:25:08,in the silver coins just to make the silver
00:25:08,00:25:09,"go a bit further, basically."
00:25:09,00:25:11,And it caused mayhem.
00:25:11,00:25:13,People were hoarding their good coins
00:25:13,00:25:15,"from the before times, which were still worth"
00:25:15,00:25:16,every bit of silver in them.
00:25:16,00:25:18,And they left the bad ones in circulation.
00:25:18,00:25:20,Foreign bankers refused to accept English money.
00:25:20,00:25:21,They were asking for gold instead.
00:25:21,00:25:22,"It just, it was a disaster."
00:25:22,00:25:24,"And then a few years after he dies,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,"Elizabeth I came to the throne 15 years later,"
00:25:27,00:25:30,she had to recall every single coin in the kingdom
00:25:30,00:25:32,and melt them down and reissue proper coins.
00:25:32,00:25:34,- You have like a coin amnesty.
00:25:34,00:25:36,Everyone come and hand your coins in at the forum.
00:25:36,00:25:37,- Pretty much.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"- They had those, you know, those machines"
00:25:39,00:25:40,where you pour all your coins in
00:25:40,00:25:42,"and it gives you a little slip, they had those."
00:25:42,00:25:44,- Not the ones with the tray going back and forward.
00:25:44,00:25:46,Is that what they're doing?
00:25:46,00:25:47,They're collecting my coins.
00:25:47,00:25:50,"- Well, they are collecting your coins effectively."
00:25:50,00:25:52,"You know those things, by the way,"
00:25:52,00:25:55,"they were invented by, I can't remember who it was now,"
00:25:55,00:25:57,but they were invented and the person who invented them
00:25:57,00:25:59,thought that they would only last one year
00:25:59,00:26:03,because it's been quite a few of these kind of amusements
00:26:03,00:26:05,that had come and gone really quickly.
00:26:05,00:26:07,"And so they invented them, they didn't patent them."
00:26:07,00:26:08,They made a load of them
00:26:08,00:26:09,and then they became really successful.
00:26:09,00:26:12,And now you could just make them without any patents.
00:26:12,00:26:13,- I didn't realize that.
00:26:13,00:26:16,- Yeah. And the original one had the big hole in the middle
00:26:16,00:26:19,which your coins would go in so they would make money.
00:26:19,00:26:21,Whereas now the holes are hidden.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"So when the coins are being pushed,"
00:26:23,00:26:26,there's holes on the side that you can't see
00:26:26,00:26:28,and that's where the coins kind of fall into
00:26:28,00:26:31,and that's the cut that the machines are.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"- So I'm not aiming, I don't want to get into those holes."
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- No, so think about it."
00:26:34,00:26:36,- I want to get into the big hole in the middle.
00:26:36,00:26:37,"- Every coin you put in, in theory,"
00:26:37,00:26:38,"is going to come out again, right?"
00:26:38,00:26:40,So how do they make money?
00:26:40,00:26:42,"Well, the way they make money is they have hidden holes"
00:26:42,00:26:44,where the coins fall down and go into the bank.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"- Wait, why would every coin in theory be coming out again?"
00:26:46,00:26:48,I just thought they'd got more and more and more coins
00:26:48,00:26:49,until the whole thing exploded.
00:26:49,00:26:50,- Until the whole thing was full of coins.
00:26:50,00:26:53,"- Yeah, exactly, someone's going to go to those machines"
00:26:53,00:26:54,and they're just crowned.
00:26:54,00:26:56,- You've never seen one of them fall to top.
00:26:56,00:26:58,"- I think it's like, you fill them with coins"
00:26:58,00:27:00,to start off with because you've never turned up
00:27:00,00:27:03,to one of those and there's no coins in it.
00:27:03,00:27:04,- Just a little sign saying please.
00:27:04,00:27:07,- So they fill them with coins
00:27:07,00:27:08,"and then in theory, everyone you put in"
00:27:08,00:27:09,is going to push another one out.
00:27:09,00:27:11,- I did not know there were side things.
00:27:11,00:27:12,I just thought they built up and then at night
00:27:12,00:27:15,people came by and siphoned out and stacked them artfully
00:27:15,00:27:17,"so they never stayed, none of them would fall in the hole."
00:27:17,00:27:18,- That might happen as well.
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Those machines are great.
00:27:19,00:27:20,I love them so much.
00:27:20,00:27:21,- I spend so much of my money on them.
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- Yeah, they are amazing."
00:27:22,00:27:23,I love them as well.
00:27:23,00:27:26,You know those penny collection machines actually?
00:27:26,00:27:27,- What do you mean?
00:27:27,00:27:28,- The one where you get all of your money
00:27:28,00:27:31,that you've been keeping in a jar for the last 10 years.
00:27:31,00:27:33,- Oh and you tip them in and you turn it into cash.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- Do you know what the most
00:27:34,00:27:36,that anyone's ever got out of this?
00:27:36,00:27:37,- Oh great.
00:27:37,00:27:38,"- Oh God, how much?"
00:27:38,00:27:40,So I think I mentioned on the show once
00:27:40,00:27:41,that I did it in Australia
00:27:41,00:27:44,and I think I got three or $400 out of it.
00:27:44,00:27:45,"- What, how much?"
00:27:45,00:27:47,You were pouring in coppers into a machine.
00:27:47,00:27:47,You got $400.
00:27:47,00:27:48,- What's an all coppers?
00:27:48,00:27:49,There's some 50 cents.
00:27:49,00:27:50,- Right.
00:27:50,00:27:53,- What Looney Tunes bank robbery had you just done
00:27:53,00:27:55,to have $400 in spilled coins?
00:27:55,00:27:56,- It was all of Bean's money
00:27:56,00:27:57,they'd been collected over the years.
00:27:57,00:28:00,"- Well remember, he just spills change everywhere,"
00:28:00,00:28:01,never picks it up and I was unemployed.
00:28:01,00:28:03,So I thought I'm gonna try and contribute
00:28:03,00:28:04,to this little domestic economy.
00:28:04,00:28:06,"Go on, who's beating my record then?"
00:28:06,00:28:07,"- Yeah, what is it?"
00:28:07,00:28:08,"2000, I'm gonna say."
00:28:08,00:28:11,"- No, the record is $13,084.59."
00:28:11,00:28:12,- Wow.
00:28:12,00:28:13,- I don't mean behind that person.
00:28:13,00:28:15,(all laughing)
00:28:15,00:28:17,- There was a man in Alabama
00:28:17,00:28:20,and he had to have all of his coins delivered
00:28:20,00:28:22,to the bank to do this
00:28:22,00:28:24,because obviously there were so many of them
00:28:24,00:28:25,he couldn't carry them
00:28:25,00:28:28,and it took seven hours to count them all.
00:28:28,00:28:29,- Wow.
00:28:29,00:28:32,- And his collection weighed more than 4.5 tons.
00:28:32,00:28:33,- Goodness.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Why did he stop?
00:28:34,00:28:36,- The fool.
00:28:36,00:28:38,(all laughing)
00:28:38,00:28:39,"- Yes, what a weird again."
00:28:39,00:28:40,That's an inside out logic.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"I would have gone for, why did he stop?"
00:28:42,00:28:43,- It does feel like perhaps
00:28:43,00:28:45,there was someone else in his house
00:28:45,00:28:46,who asked him to do it.
00:28:46,00:28:47,"- Yeah, fair enough."
00:28:47,00:28:48,- I don't know.
00:28:48,00:28:50,- Have you guys heard of Christopher Ironside?
00:28:50,00:28:53,He was the designer behind the first decimal coins
00:28:53,00:28:56,"that we had in 1969 in the UK, right?"
00:28:56,00:28:59,"And so, he designed the 50p."
00:28:59,00:29:01,That was the first thing that he designed all of the coins.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- I'm so sorry, I think it was 71?"
00:29:03,00:29:04,But maybe he designed them early?
00:29:04,00:29:06,"- No, there was some that came out early."
00:29:06,00:29:08,"71 was decimalization,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,but there were a few earlier decimal coins.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Right.
00:29:11,00:29:11,- That's confusing.
00:29:11,00:29:12,- That is confusing.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- I mean, the whole decimalization thing"
00:29:14,00:29:15,sounds confusing to be fair.
00:29:15,00:29:17,You would have loved the Daily Mail in 1971.
00:29:17,00:29:22,- Why are there 240 anymore?
00:29:22,00:29:24,- But so there was sort of an announcement
00:29:24,00:29:25,"that Britain was going to be heading this way,"
00:29:25,00:29:28,"but the Royal Mint didn't say who was designing the coins,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"but they had picked this guy, Christopher Ironside,"
00:29:31,00:29:35,and he had to do it in secrecy from 1962 all the way to 1968.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"Now, you would think they gave him an office"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"to go and do it in, that he could do it in secrecy"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"if it was such a big deal, they didn't."
00:29:41,00:29:42,He had to do it in his house.
00:29:42,00:29:44,He had his mother living in the house.
00:29:44,00:29:46,He had a daughter living in the house.
00:29:46,00:29:47,He had two young kids on the way.
00:29:47,00:29:49,"He had a small house, so he had nowhere to do it."
00:29:49,00:29:51,- And they're constantly at risk of discovering
00:29:51,00:29:53,"the big secret, which is that he's working"
00:29:53,00:29:54,best after this time.
00:29:54,00:29:55,- But he's designing.
00:29:55,00:29:56,All you need is a desk.
00:29:56,00:29:57,- Exactly.
00:29:57,00:29:58,- Yeah.
00:29:58,00:30:01,- There's the voice of Big Mint over here.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"They could give him a room in the building, I would say."
00:30:03,00:30:04,- Exactly.
00:30:04,00:30:04,"- I'm not saying they couldn't do that,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,but I'm just saying that the fact
00:30:06,00:30:08,"that he's working from home, like many of us does today."
00:30:08,00:30:09,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:09,00:30:10,- But if I was working from home
00:30:10,00:30:12,and I couldn't let my wife find out
00:30:12,00:30:13,"that I was working on a podcast,"
00:30:13,00:30:14,it might be tricky.
00:30:14,00:30:15,- Would it?
00:30:15,00:30:16,- Yeah.
00:30:16,00:30:17,- Yeah.
00:30:17,00:30:17,- What's this microphone for?
00:30:17,00:30:19,(all laughing)
00:30:19,00:30:20,"- Well, she's at home"
00:30:20,00:30:21,'cause she's got two kids on the way.
00:30:21,00:30:24,- And she's finding drawings of 50p coins around the place.
00:30:24,00:30:25,"She's saying, ""What's this?"""
00:30:25,00:30:27,"""Uh, nothing."""
00:30:27,00:30:29,- So I think she gets into it
00:30:29,00:30:32,because she becomes the model for Britannica
00:30:32,00:30:33,on the back of the 50p coin.
00:30:33,00:30:34,Her name was Jean.
00:30:34,00:30:35,And we were talking last week
00:30:35,00:30:37,about Uma Thurman's grandmother.
00:30:37,00:30:39,"Well, we now know who was basically the model"
00:30:39,00:30:41,for Britannica. - All right.
00:30:41,00:30:42,- But he had to hide it from all his friends
00:30:42,00:30:43,who would come over and so on.
00:30:43,00:30:46,So he had a big cloth that he would put over his desk.
00:30:46,00:30:46,- What kind of claim he was doing?
00:30:46,00:30:48,Did he say he was a spy?
00:30:48,00:30:48,And actually--
00:30:48,00:30:49,"- It kind of felt like it, but--"
00:30:49,00:30:51,- It just doesn't feel hard
00:30:51,00:30:53,to hide drawing a picture of Britannica.
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- No, he was making the molds."
00:30:55,00:30:56,He was doing all the molds.
00:30:56,00:30:57,- Still?
00:30:57,00:30:58,- Do you know how big a coin is?
00:30:58,00:30:58,"- Yeah, totally."
00:30:58,00:31:00,"But like, you know--"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"- James, I think this guy had a rough time."
00:31:01,00:31:03,"I do, I've got to say."
00:31:03,00:31:05,- I want to know why it took him six years to design.
00:31:05,00:31:06,- Yeah.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"- What, like five coins?"
00:31:07,00:31:08,- Because he was constantly trying
00:31:08,00:31:10,to hide his tiny molds everywhere.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"- I think it was, as he reports into the office every quarter,"
00:31:12,00:31:16,"""No, sorry, my mother-in-law came into the room."""
00:31:16,00:31:17,What they had to do--
00:31:17,00:31:18,- Just as I was making the molds.
00:31:18,00:31:21,I had to throw it out of the window into the garden.
00:31:21,00:31:22,- And then someone walked past the garden
00:31:22,00:31:24,and they had to go and bury it in the garden.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"- Then a fox dug it up, you see, that was the problem."
00:31:26,00:31:28,So I will need another three years.
00:31:28,00:31:29,I'm afraid to complete the molds.
00:31:29,00:31:30,- They had to delay one of the coins
00:31:30,00:31:32,because he found his daughter at the desk
00:31:32,00:31:35,putting into the putty her knife or whatever
00:31:35,00:31:37,and it completely ruined the coins.
00:31:37,00:31:38,They had to redesign the way.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"- His whole family, I imagine,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,"was just going, ""Darling, we don't care."
00:31:41,00:31:42,"""It's something to do with the coin."
00:31:42,00:31:44,"""We couldn't care less."
00:31:44,00:31:45,"""It's dinner time."""
00:31:45,00:31:46,"- Oh, that's so good."
00:31:46,00:31:47,That's hilarious.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"- Just very quickly before we go,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,crypto coins that exist include the Yeti coin.
00:31:53,00:31:54,- Brilliant.
00:31:54,00:31:55,- The golf coin.
00:31:55,00:31:57,The Mossland coin.
00:31:57,00:31:59,The egregious fish token.
00:31:59,00:32:02,And the AP wine coin.
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Get out!
00:32:03,00:32:04,- What?
00:32:04,00:32:05,- For me.
00:32:05,00:32:06,They've minted a coin for me.
00:32:06,00:32:07,- It's a crypto coin.
00:32:07,00:32:08,I'll explain later.
00:32:08,00:32:08,"- All right, yes."
00:32:08,00:32:10,- Just send me your back details.
00:32:10,00:32:13,(upbeat music)
00:32:13,00:32:17,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:32:17,00:32:19,and that is my fact.
00:32:19,00:32:21,"My fact this week is that, in theory,"
00:32:21,00:32:24,you can get a peanut allergy transplant.
00:32:24,00:32:25,"- Oh, good."
00:32:25,00:32:27,- Why would I want that?
00:32:27,00:32:29,- You wouldn't be asking for it.
00:32:29,00:32:31,This would be an accidental transplant.
00:32:31,00:32:32,So there's numerous papers out there.
00:32:32,00:32:35,The one that I read was to do with a 31 year old woman.
00:32:35,00:32:36,She had liver failure.
00:32:36,00:32:38,So she had a liver transplant.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"And then after the operation,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,she was kissing her partner
00:32:42,00:32:44,and he had just eaten a peanut butter chocolate.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"And as a result, she rashed up and she said,"
00:32:47,00:32:49,"""That's weird, that's never happened before."""
00:32:49,00:32:50,They went to the doctors
00:32:50,00:32:52,and they worked out that she now had hypersensitivity
00:32:52,00:32:54,"to peanut, hazelnut and pecan."
00:32:54,00:32:58,And they believe that that was new from post-transplant.
00:32:58,00:32:59,And then there are the multiple examples
00:32:59,00:33:01,of people who have been claiming
00:33:01,00:33:03,to have had a peanut allergy post-transplant.
00:33:03,00:33:04,- That's very cool.
00:33:04,00:33:05,- Yeah.
00:33:05,00:33:07,- Paying the arse for those people.
00:33:07,00:33:09,- Peanut allergies.
00:33:09,00:33:10,- Did you say peanuts?
00:33:10,00:33:12,"- It was definitely, it was either peanuts or peanuts."
00:33:12,00:33:13,"- Oh, peanuts."
00:33:13,00:33:15,"Sorry, no, no, no, I still want peanuts."
00:33:15,00:33:18,"There is a day of the year where in Canada,"
00:33:18,00:33:20,"peanut allergy cases, which trigger anaphylactic shock,"
00:33:20,00:33:22,rise by 85%.
00:33:22,00:33:25,Can you work out what that day of the year is?
00:33:25,00:33:26,"- When they eat a lot of peanuts,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,"Super Bowl, no, Canada."
00:33:28,00:33:31,"The World Series, baseball, the hockey."
00:33:31,00:33:33,"- Hockey, it's not sport."
00:33:33,00:33:38,- When's a day when certainly everyone eats a lot more peanuts?
00:33:38,00:33:39,- Christmas.
00:33:39,00:33:42,"- Christmas, it's the Canadian peanut Christmas."
00:33:42,00:33:44,- When they all take flights and get them for free.
00:33:44,00:33:45,- That's right.
00:33:45,00:33:46,"- When they go to the cinema,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,do they all go to the cinema one day of the year?
00:33:48,00:33:50,- Canadians only go to the cinema one day a year
00:33:50,00:33:51,because it's quite sinful.
00:33:51,00:33:52,So they try and limit it.
00:33:52,00:33:53,- It's a national peanut day.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"- What's Charles Schultz, was he Canadian?"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"- Oh, these are such good guesses."
00:33:58,00:33:59,Okay.
00:33:59,00:33:59,- Is it really obvious?
00:33:59,00:34:00,- It's not really obvious.
00:34:00,00:34:03,Peanut-based confectionery gets eaten a lot more
00:34:03,00:34:04,on one day of the year.
00:34:04,00:34:05,- Halloween.
00:34:05,00:34:06,- When they do dribble treats.
00:34:06,00:34:06,"- Halloween, thank you."
00:34:06,00:34:08,(laughing)
00:34:08,00:34:09,- It's Halloween.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"You get children going house to house,"
00:34:11,00:34:12,having a lot of confectionery.
00:34:12,00:34:14,Maybe they didn't know they've got a peanut allergy
00:34:14,00:34:16,"or maybe they are, you know, they're just excited"
00:34:16,00:34:18,and they have some unfamiliar confectionery
00:34:18,00:34:20,and they already knew about it.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"But yeah, that's 85%."
00:34:22,00:34:24,Easter is 60% rice.
00:34:24,00:34:24,- Really?
00:34:24,00:34:26,- I guess chocolate-containing peanuts.
00:34:26,00:34:26,- Yeah.
00:34:26,00:34:28,- It's amazing how much it's changed
00:34:28,00:34:30,"over the last 20 years or so, isn't it?"
00:34:30,00:34:31,- It's bizarre.
00:34:31,00:34:33,- The number of people who are allergic to peanuts
00:34:33,00:34:37,just 20 years ago is so much lower than it is today.
00:34:37,00:34:38,- Really?
00:34:38,00:34:39,- So much and no one really knows why.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"- No, 1995 to 2016, there's been a five-fold increase"
00:34:42,00:34:45,in the UK in peanut allergies and more in other places.
00:34:45,00:34:47,"And yeah, as James says, we're not really sure why."
00:34:47,00:34:49,It's much more industrialized countries.
00:34:49,00:34:52,Could be to do with the fact that we are
00:34:52,00:34:54,"not getting as many parasites, they think."
00:34:54,00:34:57,And I think the immune system uses a similar mechanism
00:34:57,00:35:01,to fight parasites as it does to flare up in allergies.
00:35:01,00:35:02,"- Yeah, we just don't know, but it's rocketing."
00:35:02,00:35:05,"- It is, and definitely like the more that you live"
00:35:05,00:35:07,"in a city, the more likely you are to have it."
00:35:07,00:35:08,- Really?
00:35:08,00:35:10,- So seems like it's something to do with not being exposed
00:35:10,00:35:14,"to natural environments, possibly vitamin D sunlight."
00:35:14,00:35:16,Apparently people with a vitamin D deficiency
00:35:16,00:35:19,are 11 times more likely to have a peanut allergy.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- Really?
00:35:20,00:35:21,"- But that might not, but that might be just that"
00:35:21,00:35:23,the two things are related to a third thing.
00:35:23,00:35:24,We just don't know.
00:35:24,00:35:25,- Yeah.
00:35:25,00:35:28,- One way of stopping getting allergies
00:35:28,00:35:32,"is to desensitize yourself by having small amounts of it,"
00:35:32,00:35:32,right?
00:35:32,00:35:34,"This doesn't work in all cases,"
00:35:34,00:35:36,but it's a very common way of treating them.
00:35:36,00:35:39,"And for that reason, there's a new kind of toothpaste"
00:35:39,00:35:41,"that's been invented, which has got little tiny, tiny,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,tiny bits of peanut in it.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"- Ah, that's brilliant."
00:35:44,00:35:46,- And the idea is that you have this toothpaste
00:35:46,00:35:49,and it desensitizes your immune system to the allergens.
00:35:49,00:35:51,- Nut paste.
00:35:51,00:35:52,- Nut paste?
00:35:52,00:35:54,- Give your kids nut paste today.
00:35:54,00:35:56,- I think we can go back to the branding drawing bar
00:35:56,00:35:59,before we start printing the packets.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"- Ironically, they all just get stuck in your teeth."
00:36:01,00:36:03,So then you need to use an actual normal toothpaste
00:36:03,00:36:04,"to get rid of it, presumably."
00:36:04,00:36:05,- Yeah.
00:36:05,00:36:10,"You can be, of course, allergic to peanuts."
00:36:10,00:36:11,- Penis.
00:36:11,00:36:11,"- Penis, yeah."
00:36:11,00:36:12,- Oh.
00:36:12,00:36:14,- Post-argasmic illness syndrome
00:36:14,00:36:17,"is where you get flu-like symptoms,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,"rashes, itching, after sex."
00:36:19,00:36:22,"But it has been caused, in a few cases,"
00:36:22,00:36:24,by men being allergic to their own semen.
00:36:24,00:36:25,- Their own.
00:36:25,00:36:26,- Their own semen.
00:36:26,00:36:27,- Yeah.
00:36:27,00:36:28,"- Oh, no."
00:36:28,00:36:29,- There is a cure.
00:36:29,00:36:29,Thank God.
00:36:29,00:36:32,- What is the...
00:36:32,00:36:34,"We'll be back to nut paste, basically."
00:36:34,00:36:36,(all laughing)
00:36:36,00:36:37,"- We are, I'm afraid."
00:36:37,00:36:38,- No.
00:36:38,00:36:40,- It's multiple subcutaneous injections
00:36:40,00:36:42,of the semen in question.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"- I think I'll just stay all for life,"
00:36:44,00:36:45,thank you very much.
00:36:45,00:36:46,(all laughing)
00:36:46,00:36:49,"- Yeah, so you get very, very tiny bits of the semen"
00:36:49,00:36:51,and you would inject it under the skin
00:36:51,00:36:53,and your body would learn to do well.
00:36:53,00:36:54,- Not on your toothbrush.
00:36:54,00:36:55,- No.
00:36:55,00:36:57,(all laughing)
00:36:57,00:36:59,- Wow.
00:36:59,00:37:00,Scientists get allergic to the thing
00:37:00,00:37:01,they're researching quite frequently
00:37:01,00:37:04,"'cause you're exposed to it, day after day."
00:37:04,00:37:06,"There was a great piece, I think it was the Atlantic,"
00:37:06,00:37:07,about a scientist called Brian Fry.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"He studies snake venom and has since become allergic,"
00:37:10,00:37:14,"not to venom, but to snakes in general."
00:37:14,00:37:15,- Really?
00:37:15,00:37:16,- Yeah.
00:37:16,00:37:18,And apparently there's a huge chance
00:37:18,00:37:19,that if you work with something all the time
00:37:19,00:37:21,"you develop an allergy, 40% of vets,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,45% of people who work with lab rodents
00:37:23,00:37:25,get an allergy to them.
00:37:25,00:37:27,There was a leech scientist called Danielle DeCurle
00:37:27,00:37:29,who uses herself as bait
00:37:29,00:37:31,when she's trying to catch leeches out in the field.
00:37:31,00:37:32,"You know, she just walks through a swamp and gets them."
00:37:32,00:37:36,"She now, after a year or two, couldn't do it anymore"
00:37:36,00:37:38,and her hands started swearing up massively
00:37:38,00:37:40,if she was trying to feed a leech in the lab on her blood
00:37:40,00:37:42,and she had to feed them pig blood instead.
00:37:42,00:37:42,"- That's weird though, isn't it?"
00:37:42,00:37:44,Because obviously you're supposed to sensitize yourself
00:37:44,00:37:46,up until a certain point.
00:37:46,00:37:47,But maybe you can be overexposed.
00:37:47,00:37:49,Like if I'm eating peanut butter on a daily basis
00:37:49,00:37:53,"and a lot, does that mean I eventually might then become"
00:37:53,00:37:54,a leech scientist?
00:37:54,00:37:57,- I read the article and it said 25 to 60% of people
00:37:57,00:38:00,who work with insects become allergic to them.
00:38:00,00:38:02,So people who work with bees might come out in hives.
00:38:02,00:38:03,- Right.
00:38:03,00:38:05,"- Hey, lovely."
00:38:05,00:38:07,"- Now I think about it, people keep telling me"
00:38:07,00:38:09,'cause I love milk and I drink milk a lot
00:38:09,00:38:10,that I will become allergic to milk
00:38:10,00:38:11,by the amount of milk that I drink.
00:38:11,00:38:13,- I don't listen to those people.
00:38:13,00:38:15,- You know who told me it was Ash Garner.
00:38:15,00:38:16,"- Oh, did he?"
00:38:16,00:38:18,- Who did our theme tune for anybody who doesn't know
00:38:18,00:38:20,who stopped drinking milk because he thinks
00:38:20,00:38:22,he became allergic from drinking so much as a kid.
00:38:22,00:38:23,- I think I'm right in saying that.
00:38:23,00:38:26,- There's an interesting thing where people who think
00:38:26,00:38:29,"they are allergic to things in double blind tests,"
00:38:29,00:38:31,quite a high percentage of people turn out not to be
00:38:31,00:38:33,allergic to them after all.
00:38:33,00:38:33,- Right.
00:38:33,00:38:38,Just on the quickly jumping back to allergy transplants
00:38:38,00:38:40,and just the idea of things being transplanted
00:38:40,00:38:43,when you take in a body part from a donor.
00:38:43,00:38:46,I read an article from a lady who said
00:38:46,00:38:49,that her personality changed after a kidney transplant
00:38:49,00:38:52,where instead of reading celebrity trash
00:38:52,00:38:53,"and watching celebrity trash,"
00:38:53,00:38:55,she started reading Jane Austen.
00:38:55,00:39:00,And that was purely off the back from the kidney.
00:39:00,00:39:03,She said she got a brain-y kidney.
00:39:03,00:39:07,"- She said there's a pseudoscience theory,"
00:39:07,00:39:11,which is the idea that you inherit traits of a person
00:39:11,00:39:13,that you might take something off.
00:39:13,00:39:15,"And there's so many exact,"
00:39:15,00:39:18,there's a guy called Dr. Hagen who's an ER doctor
00:39:18,00:39:21,who claims that he inherited a love of avocados
00:39:21,00:39:23,and barbecues after he got a transplant.
00:39:23,00:39:25,- I don't know maybe if your digestive system
00:39:25,00:39:28,responds to certain food stuff seems more likely
00:39:28,00:39:31,than liking trash magazines compared to Jane Austen.
00:39:31,00:39:32,- Yeah.
00:39:32,00:39:33,- To be fair to the ER doctor.
00:39:33,00:39:33,"- Yeah, fair enough."
00:39:33,00:39:36,He got in contact with the family
00:39:36,00:39:38,because it was like a murder trial that she'd been killed in.
00:39:38,00:39:40,He went to the trial and the family took him in
00:39:40,00:39:41,and they did prayers together.
00:39:41,00:39:43,And then he went back to their house
00:39:43,00:39:44,"and the sentence reads,"
00:39:44,00:39:47,"""He learned she loved avocados and barbecues."""
00:39:47,00:39:50,"- Oh, and there's such unusual things that people like"
00:39:50,00:39:53,they could only possibly have come from this ridiculous idea.
00:39:53,00:39:55,"- Well, he never used to cry during movies as well."
00:39:55,00:39:57,"As a surgeon, you're trained not to cry."
00:39:57,00:39:59,"And then after surgery, he kept crying and kept crying."
00:39:59,00:40:01,And as well as learning that this lady
00:40:01,00:40:03,"loved avocados and barbecues,"
00:40:03,00:40:06,she was also an emotionally passionate woman.
00:40:06,00:40:07,But there's a doctor who believes that
00:40:07,00:40:09,as a patient's about to go into surgery
00:40:09,00:40:11,"to receive the transplant,"
00:40:11,00:40:12,a few bit of details might come out
00:40:12,00:40:15,about the person they're getting the transplant from.
00:40:15,00:40:17,And they embed that in a really emotional moment
00:40:17,00:40:18,before they're about to go down.
00:40:18,00:40:20,And it goes into their psyche
00:40:20,00:40:22,rather than it being a physical transplant.
00:40:22,00:40:24,"- Imagine, by the way, the kidney that you're receiving"
00:40:24,00:40:26,comes from someone who loved avocado.
00:40:26,00:40:27,"Okay, go on down."
00:40:27,00:40:29,(laughing)
00:40:29,00:40:31,There is a lot that we obviously don't know at all.
00:40:31,00:40:33,Like we've talked about fecal transplants before.
00:40:33,00:40:34,- Oh yeah.
00:40:34,00:40:37,- And how you can actually transplant unexpected things
00:40:37,00:40:38,"in them, it is thought."
00:40:38,00:40:39,And then we're in very early days of fecal transplant.
00:40:39,00:40:41,- What changes with my personality
00:40:41,00:40:43,if I get someone else's poo in me?
00:40:43,00:40:44,- Depends who's poo you get.
00:40:44,00:40:45,Which one of our poo do you want?
00:40:45,00:40:47,And then I'll tell you what you'll get.
00:40:47,00:40:48,(laughing)
00:40:48,00:40:52,We'll save that for our therapy session after the show again.
00:40:52,00:40:54,- Now you kind of think Andy mentioned on the show
00:40:54,00:40:56,before that a mother who received a fecal transplant
00:40:56,00:40:58,from her daughter suddenly became obese.
00:40:58,00:40:59,And her daughter was obese.
00:40:59,00:41:00,And 'cause we really don't know--
00:41:00,00:41:01,"- Okay, well, that makes sense."
00:41:01,00:41:04,"'Cause it could be the microbes causing that, right?"
00:41:04,00:41:04,- That's right.
00:41:04,00:41:07,There was someone else who received a fecal transplant
00:41:07,00:41:08,who had had alopecia and not had any hair
00:41:08,00:41:11,since there were six who suddenly grew hair again.
00:41:11,00:41:16,And I suppose this is all micro climate.
00:41:16,00:41:18,There's a lot still to learn about it
00:41:18,00:41:20,and who knows what little things it's affecting.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"- Yeah, I buy it."
00:41:21,00:41:22,I buy it a lot.
00:41:22,00:41:22,"Okay, here's a way."
00:41:22,00:41:25,"If you are a parent and you have a baby who has a dummy,"
00:41:25,00:41:28,you can protect them against allergies.
00:41:28,00:41:29,How do you do it?
00:41:29,00:41:30,- Never let them take the dummy out
00:41:30,00:41:32,so no food could get into their mouth.
00:41:32,00:41:33,- That's right.
00:41:33,00:41:34,That's right.
00:41:34,00:41:36,Can anyone think of a second method?
00:41:36,00:41:37,(laughing)
00:41:37,00:41:38,- I know the answers to this
00:41:38,00:41:40,'cause I've accidentally been doing it all my three kids.
00:41:40,00:41:42,- I've seen you doing it as well.
00:41:42,00:41:45,"- Oh, well, that must be you sucking on the dummy as well?"
00:41:45,00:41:46,- Yeah.
00:41:46,00:41:46,- Is it really?
00:41:46,00:41:47,- Yeah.
00:41:47,00:41:50,"- I didn't like to admit it, but it's, no, it's."
00:41:50,00:41:51,(laughing)
00:41:51,00:41:52,- Oh my God.
00:41:52,00:41:52,"- Oh my God, Dan."
00:41:52,00:41:54,- For the lesson that Dan has just got a dummy
00:41:54,00:41:55,out of his pocket and popped it in.
00:41:55,00:41:57,- We assume it came out of his pocket.
00:41:57,00:41:58,We can see where it came from.
00:41:58,00:41:59,- It certainly came from below the table.
00:41:59,00:42:01,"That's incredibly, Dan, wow."
00:42:01,00:42:02,- That's really disturbing.
00:42:02,00:42:04,It's weird how disturbing that is to see.
00:42:04,00:42:05,"- Well, I didn't know I had it in my pocket"
00:42:05,00:42:06,until I was coming in this morning
00:42:06,00:42:08,"and I felt it and I was like, oh, I've got kids dummy."
00:42:08,00:42:09,- What's he got of yours?
00:42:09,00:42:12,(laughing)
00:42:12,00:42:13,- Where's my research notes?
00:42:13,00:42:15,(laughing)
00:42:15,00:42:18,(laughing)
00:42:18,00:42:19,- That one explains so much.
00:42:19,00:42:21,(laughing)
00:42:21,00:42:23,(upbeat music)
00:42:23,00:42:28,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:42:28,00:42:30,and that is Anna.
00:42:30,00:42:32,- My fact this week is that the largest parasite
00:42:32,00:42:35,in the world is a Christmas tree.
00:42:35,00:42:38,- Feels a bit political.
00:42:38,00:42:39,Feels like you're saying Christmas is rubbish.
00:42:39,00:42:40,- Okay.
00:42:40,00:42:42,"- It's like it's feeding on ordinary families,"
00:42:42,00:42:43,trying to make them spend the money on Christmas.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"- Basically, it's capitalism and capitalism"
00:42:46,00:42:47,is a parasite on the working-
00:42:47,00:42:48,- Good point.
00:42:48,00:42:51,Christianity actually organized religion of any form
00:42:51,00:42:53,is a parasite on our society.
00:42:53,00:42:53,"- Yeah, man."
00:42:53,00:42:55,"- All right, put down your joints."
00:42:55,00:42:58,(laughing)
00:42:58,00:43:01,- Put down that old wacky backie.
00:43:01,00:43:04,(laughing)
00:43:04,00:43:05,- Welcome to the dad car.
00:43:05,00:43:08,(laughing)
00:43:08,00:43:09,- This is a different kind of Christmas tree
00:43:09,00:43:10,to what you might be thinking.
00:43:10,00:43:12,It's the Australian Christmas tree
00:43:12,00:43:14,and the Australian Christmas tree is different
00:43:14,00:43:16,to our British Christmas trees.
00:43:16,00:43:17,- Upside down.
00:43:17,00:43:18,(laughing)
00:43:18,00:43:19,- It's not upside down.
00:43:19,00:43:20,It's actually very beautiful.
00:43:20,00:43:22,It's also known as the--
00:43:22,00:43:23,- All the baubles are made of cork.
00:43:23,00:43:24,Sorry.
00:43:24,00:43:27,(laughing)
00:43:27,00:43:28,- They're not used as Christmas trees.
00:43:28,00:43:29,We should add in Australia.
00:43:29,00:43:32,We use the classic Christmas tree in Australia.
00:43:32,00:43:34,"- Yep, you do, you Australians are saying"
00:43:34,00:43:35,do use the classic Christmas tree.
00:43:35,00:43:39,These are known as mungi or mood jar trees as well
00:43:39,00:43:41,but they get called the Australian Christmas tree
00:43:41,00:43:43,because they flower in December
00:43:43,00:43:46,and they're endemic to Noongar County
00:43:46,00:43:47,in Western Australia
00:43:47,00:43:49,and they're really beautiful actually
00:43:49,00:43:51,and they grow in very barren landscape
00:43:51,00:43:53,and they're bright yellow flowers when they flower
00:43:53,00:43:56,so they're like fires all over the desert
00:43:56,00:43:59,but they are also parasites and it's so amazing.
00:43:59,00:44:03,So their roots can steal from other plants
00:44:03,00:44:06,that are up to 110 meters away
00:44:06,00:44:09,by slithering under the ground to this other plant
00:44:09,00:44:12,and then the plant root wraps around the other plant's root
00:44:12,00:44:15,and then injects a spike into it
00:44:15,00:44:17,and can just suck out all their nutrients.
00:44:17,00:44:19,- It's extraordinary. - It's amazing.
00:44:19,00:44:20,- It's so cool.
00:44:20,00:44:21,"- It's zombie stuff. - It's actually,"
00:44:21,00:44:23,it's tipped me over into believing in plant sentience now
00:44:23,00:44:26,because you're always so skeptical about that.
00:44:26,00:44:29,"- I've been on a fence, I've been on the line"
00:44:29,00:44:31,but this is just extraordinary what it does.
00:44:31,00:44:33,The thing that tipped me over is that
00:44:33,00:44:35,it's a beautiful looking tree.
00:44:35,00:44:37,So even when they are cutting down areas
00:44:37,00:44:38,"where this tree grows,"
00:44:38,00:44:41,they'll cut everything down but this hot tree
00:44:41,00:44:42,that just looks so cool
00:44:42,00:44:44,and then it feeds off the grass.
00:44:44,00:44:45,That's basically what it is.
00:44:45,00:44:46,"It's like, that's a sexy tree."
00:44:46,00:44:47,We're keeping that up.
00:44:47,00:44:50,"It's evolved to be, I assume,"
00:44:50,00:44:52,a good looking tree to the human eye.
00:44:52,00:44:53,- No.
00:44:53,00:44:55,(laughing)
00:44:55,00:44:55,- You assume wrong.
00:44:55,00:44:56,- But it is amazing.
00:44:56,00:44:58,- It's striking what it does.
00:44:58,00:45:02,It's pretty spooky stuff if you don't mind me saying so.
00:45:02,00:45:03,(laughing)
00:45:03,00:45:06,"It's so aggressive, it's yet another bit of evidence"
00:45:06,00:45:08,of like the Australian version of everything
00:45:08,00:45:10,is much more lethal than the non-Australian version.
00:45:10,00:45:12,So it'll attack power cables.
00:45:12,00:45:13,"It can cut, slice through power cables"
00:45:13,00:45:16,"because it's so powerful, this wraparound organ it has."
00:45:16,00:45:19,Sometimes I read it steals juice from its own roots.
00:45:19,00:45:20,- Yes.
00:45:20,00:45:21,- It's wild.
00:45:21,00:45:21,- That's embarrassing.
00:45:21,00:45:22,- That was a big one.
00:45:22,00:45:24,- What it's trying to do is get the juice
00:45:24,00:45:26,from the power cable because it thinks that's a root.
00:45:26,00:45:27,- Yeah.
00:45:27,00:45:28,- But actually it's just--
00:45:28,00:45:29,- It's not just trying to contact its friends
00:45:29,00:45:31,on the phone on the other side of Australia.
00:45:31,00:45:33,- Well maybe it would be trying to contact aliens
00:45:33,00:45:36,because there was one time there was a space tracking station
00:45:36,00:45:38,"in Western Australia, which was connected"
00:45:38,00:45:41,by underground cables and it got into those as well.
00:45:41,00:45:41,- Wow.
00:45:41,00:45:42,- Really?
00:45:42,00:45:43,- Yeah.
00:45:43,00:45:46,- Getting it from its own roots is an accident as well.
00:45:46,00:45:47,- It is an accident.
00:45:47,00:45:48,- You just find something else.
00:45:48,00:45:51,- So I don't know if you guys had or the listener has
00:45:51,00:45:53,but I'd never heard of parasitic plants before
00:45:53,00:45:55,as in I didn't really recognize
00:45:55,00:45:58,that this relies entirely on stealing other juices
00:45:58,00:45:59,from other places.
00:45:59,00:46:00,- I suppose the most famous one is mistletoe.
00:46:00,00:46:02,"Of which this is a type of mistletoe, isn't it?"
00:46:02,00:46:03,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:46:03,00:46:05,"- So yeah, mistletoe famously just grows on other trees."
00:46:05,00:46:06,- It grows on other trees.
00:46:06,00:46:08,Photosynthesis is not a thing for it.
00:46:08,00:46:09,So it just relies entirely on it.
00:46:09,00:46:12,But just the idea that this needs other living things
00:46:12,00:46:13,to live is extraordinary.
00:46:13,00:46:16,"- It kind of, it can expose your year nine biology"
00:46:16,00:46:17,when you learn about how plants survive.
00:46:17,00:46:19,When actually there are thousands of plants
00:46:19,00:46:20,that aren't doing any of that shit.
00:46:20,00:46:22,They're not bothering with all this complicated
00:46:22,00:46:24,chemical equation with their leaves.
00:46:24,00:46:25,They just jab into other plants.
00:46:25,00:46:26,- Yeah.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"- I think there are 4,000 species."
00:46:27,00:46:29,- Have you guys heard of Hydenora Africana?
00:46:29,00:46:30,- No.
00:46:30,00:46:33,"- According to one website I read and I quote,"
00:46:33,00:46:38,"""No plant looks more like a labia than the Hydenora Africana."
00:46:38,00:46:43,"""This flower not only has teeth-like traps to lure insects"
00:46:43,00:46:45,"""to leaving or picking up their pollen,"
00:46:45,00:46:49,"""but emits a feces-like sense to attract dung beetles."""
00:46:49,00:46:50,- Gosh.
00:46:50,00:46:51,- I just love that sentence.
00:46:51,00:46:53,"""Nothing looks more like a labia"
00:46:53,00:46:55,"""and it has teeth that smells like feces."""
00:46:55,00:46:58,"- That's quite, that is a good riddle to ask."
00:47:00,00:47:03,"- But yeah, this one sort of likes to attract dung beetles"
00:47:03,00:47:06,with its smell and a lot of those ones
00:47:06,00:47:08,"that are like really, really smelly plants,"
00:47:08,00:47:10,they are also parasitic.
00:47:10,00:47:11,- The dodder is amazing as well.
00:47:11,00:47:12,Did you guys read about that one?
00:47:12,00:47:13,- Yeah.
00:47:13,00:47:14,- That one's extraordinary.
00:47:14,00:47:15,"- It's a bit unstable on its feet, isn't it?"
00:47:15,00:47:17,But it's pretty extraordinary.
00:47:17,00:47:20,"- Yeah, so this is a plant which is,"
00:47:20,00:47:25,it's got no roots or leaves and it's sort of yellowy looking.
00:47:25,00:47:26,It sort of grows on other plants
00:47:26,00:47:29,and it's only got a lifespan of five to 10 days
00:47:29,00:47:31,"without a host, right?"
00:47:31,00:47:34,So it needs to find a host in that time and it goes--
00:47:34,00:47:35,- Which is when the seed gets dispersed.
00:47:35,00:47:37,"- Yeah, sorry, when the seed gets dispersed"
00:47:37,00:47:41,and it can sense where the closest best host is
00:47:41,00:47:43,"through the air, which is mad."
00:47:43,00:47:44,And then goes that way.
00:47:44,00:47:45,"- Yeah, that I can see when--"
00:47:45,00:47:46,- It's really sinister.
00:47:46,00:47:47,- Sentience!
00:47:47,00:47:48,"- So sinister, Sedona."
00:47:48,00:47:51,"- No, it is 'cause we don't understand"
00:47:51,00:47:53,"a lot of how they do this, so it is extraordinary."
00:47:53,00:47:54,- It is amazing.
00:47:54,00:47:57,- And it's weird how pretty so many of them are.
00:47:57,00:47:58,It's like if you came out--
00:47:58,00:48:01,- Almost like they evolved just so that humans
00:48:01,00:48:02,would like this.
00:48:02,00:48:03,"- Thank you, James."
00:48:03,00:48:06,- I love them.
00:48:06,00:48:11,There's one which lives entirely inside the stems of plants
00:48:11,00:48:14,"and this is a genus, pylostyles."
00:48:14,00:48:17,Nicely described in 1948 by Australia's government
00:48:17,00:48:19,botanist who was called Charles Gardner.
00:48:19,00:48:22,"- Right, very nice."
00:48:22,00:48:26,"- And it's so pretty, so it just lives entirely inside a stem."
00:48:26,00:48:28,"You don't notice there, it's just little threads."
00:48:28,00:48:30,And then plops out for about a week of the year.
00:48:30,00:48:32,"Again, like the one Dan described."
00:48:32,00:48:34,And it's so pretty and these white flowers come out
00:48:34,00:48:35,all over the stem of a plant.
00:48:35,00:48:38,"So you'd think, gosh, this plant's looking so pretty"
00:48:38,00:48:39,and actually it's diseased.
00:48:39,00:48:40,- It's another plant.
00:48:40,00:48:41,- It's another plant.
00:48:41,00:48:43,"- It's so weird, I love it."
00:48:43,00:48:46,Did you guys hear about the logical pine dwarf mistletoe?
00:48:46,00:48:48,"This is another, so this is a kind of mistletoe."
00:48:48,00:48:50,"Most mistletoe seeds are dispersed,"
00:48:50,00:48:52,"almost kinds of mistletoe, they're dispersed by birds."
00:48:52,00:48:55,Birds eat the berries and then they fly somewhere else
00:48:55,00:48:56,and then they poo out the seeds
00:48:56,00:48:58,and the seeds have a new environment to grow in.
00:48:58,00:49:01,Not the lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe.
00:49:01,00:49:03,It spreads by explosions.
00:49:03,00:49:04,- Oh.
00:49:04,00:49:08,"- Basically the seed, each fruit has a single seed inside it"
00:49:08,00:49:10,"which is covered in this very, very sticky stuff."
00:49:10,00:49:11,"And then as the fruit matures,"
00:49:11,00:49:14,the pressure builds and builds and builds inside it.
00:49:14,00:49:17,"And then eventually it just goes, blah."
00:49:17,00:49:21,- I've seen these exploding cucumbers in Greece.
00:49:21,00:49:22,- Yeah.
00:49:22,00:49:25,"- So it was growing almost like a weed and some steps,"
00:49:25,00:49:29,but I noticed it and it looks like a tiny little gherkin.
00:49:29,00:49:30,"And then if you prod it enough,"
00:49:30,00:49:33,it just explodes and the seeds go everywhere.
00:49:33,00:49:35,"And they're really cool, but they don't go that far."
00:49:35,00:49:37,"- But then it apologizes and says,"
00:49:37,00:49:39,"sorry, that's never happened before for me."
00:49:39,00:49:46,- Do you know why mistletoe seeds are sticky?
00:49:46,00:49:48,Because they are when they're dispersed.
00:49:48,00:49:49,"- No, what is it?"
00:49:49,00:49:51,"- Partly it's because they have to grow from up a tree,"
00:49:51,00:49:53,"which is kind of cool anyway, so to stick to the tree."
00:49:53,00:49:56,"But as you say, they're dispersed by birds,"
00:49:56,00:50:00,pooing them out and then wiping them on trees.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"So what it requires is for the bird to poo,"
00:50:02,00:50:05,but this annoying sticky seed gets stuck to its anus.
00:50:05,00:50:06,"And so this bird's going,"
00:50:06,00:50:07,"I've got this seed on my bum,"
00:50:07,00:50:09,I just need to wipe it on something.
00:50:09,00:50:12,And they wipe their bums on the tree branches.
00:50:12,00:50:13,And that's what sticks into it.
00:50:13,00:50:16,- And also because they've wiped their bums on the trees
00:50:16,00:50:17,"and their bums had poo on them,"
00:50:17,00:50:19,then they have their own fertilizer.
00:50:19,00:50:20,- Lovely.
00:50:20,00:50:22,"- So it's like the perf, if you're a seed,"
00:50:22,00:50:25,"you know, you're being flown to the top of a tree"
00:50:25,00:50:27,and you're being put exactly where you want
00:50:27,00:50:28,"with a load of fertilizer, it's a dream."
00:50:28,00:50:31,"- So I just said, when you said that, I went, clever."
00:50:31,00:50:33,But I realized that's obviously humanizing it.
00:50:33,00:50:34,"Like, what is it?"
00:50:34,00:50:34,What is that?
00:50:34,00:50:35,"If it's not clever, what is it?"
00:50:35,00:50:36,- Just the evolution is amazing.
00:50:36,00:50:37,- It's just what it is.
00:50:37,00:50:38,It's just a random thing.
00:50:38,00:50:42,- It's just over millions and millions of years.
00:50:42,00:50:45,"Maybe even before humans existed,"
00:50:45,00:50:47,different things have been tried out.
00:50:47,00:50:48,And this is a lot of work.
00:50:48,00:50:48,- I don't think we invented sentience.
00:50:48,00:50:51,I've not played with humans for a long time.
00:50:51,00:50:53,- Is Ivy parasitic?
00:50:53,00:50:55,"- No, that just, that just grows on stuff."
00:50:55,00:50:56,"- If it just grows on something,"
00:50:56,00:50:57,it's not technically a parasite.
00:50:57,00:50:59,It has to be stealing its resources like it's sad.
00:50:59,00:51:00,- So it doesn't steal resources.
00:51:00,00:51:01,- It might not be particularly good for the thing
00:51:01,00:51:03,"that's growing on, but it's not parasitic."
00:51:03,00:51:06,"- Yeah, it could weaken a tree and make it fall and so on."
00:51:06,00:51:07,"Yeah, but okay."
00:51:07,00:51:10,"- Do you know what is, which makes people really angry,"
00:51:10,00:51:11,is orchids.
00:51:11,00:51:12,- A parasitic.
00:51:12,00:51:14,"- In fact, all orchids are parasitic."
00:51:14,00:51:14,- No.
00:51:14,00:51:15,- Another beauty.
00:51:15,00:51:17,- But another beaut.
00:51:17,00:51:20,But this is something that is vigorously denied
00:51:20,00:51:22,by the American Orchid Society.
00:51:22,00:51:24,(laughing)
00:51:24,00:51:26,"Again, it's so weird."
00:51:26,00:51:27,- That's brilliant.
00:51:27,00:51:29,- They're a slightly different kind of parasite.
00:51:29,00:51:31,"They parasitize mycorrhizal fungi,"
00:51:31,00:51:33,"which are those threads underground,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,those fungal threads underground.
00:51:35,00:51:38,So all orchid seeds start off by parasitizing the fungi
00:51:38,00:51:40,'cause they're not born with the resources
00:51:40,00:51:43,"to grow properly, so they steal from this fungi at first."
00:51:43,00:51:45,Many of them do it for their whole lives.
00:51:45,00:51:48,"So the parasites, and yet on the FAQs page"
00:51:48,00:51:49,"of the American Orchid Society,"
00:51:49,00:51:51,"there's a question, are orchids parasites?"
00:51:51,00:51:53,"- No, no, they're not."
00:51:53,00:51:53,Go away.
00:51:53,00:51:55,Stop asking questions.
00:51:55,00:51:58,- It is absolutely not of the approximately
00:51:58,00:52:00,"20,000 species of orchid."
00:52:00,00:52:02,Not one is parasitic.
00:52:02,00:52:04,"- So how are they, how are they claiming that?"
00:52:04,00:52:07,Are they claiming that because it's hosted by the fungus
00:52:07,00:52:09,that it's different to being hosted by a--
00:52:09,00:52:10,- I think that's the assumption.
00:52:10,00:52:11,They don't address much like hearing
00:52:11,00:52:13,a politician interviewed on the Today program.
00:52:13,00:52:16,They're really very much just repeating this one point.
00:52:16,00:52:18,- I don't think anyone wants to talk about parasites.
00:52:18,00:52:20,"No, people want to hear about the good work"
00:52:20,00:52:23,that I'm doing for the people of the underground.
00:52:23,00:52:25,- Exactly.
00:52:25,00:52:29,- I think I've been buried down on sentient plants
00:52:29,00:52:33,"throughout this, but I do think fungi are evil."
00:52:33,00:52:34,(laughing)
00:52:34,00:52:35,"- Oh yeah, that's a good point."
00:52:35,00:52:40,- So there is a mushroom called fusarium xyrophylum.
00:52:40,00:52:41,This is amazing.
00:52:41,00:52:45,"So it will find a plant called the xyros plant,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,and it will sterilize it so it can't make flowers.
00:52:48,00:52:51,But it will then make its own flowers
00:52:51,00:52:53,"that look exactly like the normal ones,"
00:52:53,00:52:55,but they're made out of mushroom.
00:52:55,00:52:57,- Wow. - Wow.
00:52:57,00:52:57,- That's amazing.
00:52:57,00:52:59,"- Oh my God, like a tofu alternative."
00:52:59,00:53:01,(laughing)
00:53:01,00:53:02,- Exactly like that.
00:53:02,00:53:03,- Plant replacement food.
00:53:03,00:53:05,- So you might think you're getting a nice bunch
00:53:05,00:53:07,"from Interflora, but actually all those roses"
00:53:07,00:53:10,"and lilies and whatever, they're all actually mushrooms."
00:53:10,00:53:13,"- That reminds me of the show, is it cake?"
00:53:13,00:53:14,- Yeah.
00:53:14,00:53:15,(laughing)
00:53:15,00:53:17,"- There should be a show called, is it mushroom?"
00:53:17,00:53:18,- It looks like a sofa.
00:53:18,00:53:19,(laughing)
00:53:19,00:53:20,- It's a mushroom.
00:53:20,00:53:21,"- And then the final episode,"
00:53:21,00:53:22,it turns out the host is a mushroom.
00:53:22,00:53:23,- Yeah.
00:53:23,00:53:25,(laughing)
00:53:25,00:53:26,- It's a format.
00:53:26,00:53:27,"- You might think I'm the host,"
00:53:27,00:53:29,"but in fact, I'm a parasite."
00:53:29,00:53:32,(laughing)
00:53:32,00:53:32,- That's so funny.
00:53:32,00:53:34,I read just related to that.
00:53:34,00:53:39,"This 2024 Bolton, where I'm from in Greater Manchester,"
00:53:39,00:53:44,has been named the town of culture for Greater Manchester.
00:53:44,00:53:47,"But also this week, it was named as the moldiest town"
00:53:47,00:53:49,in the whole of the UK.
00:53:49,00:53:51,And it just feels like they got the wrong meaning
00:53:51,00:53:52,of the word culture.
00:53:52,00:53:54,(laughing)
00:53:54,00:53:57,(upbeat music)
00:53:57,00:54:00,"- Okay, that's it."
