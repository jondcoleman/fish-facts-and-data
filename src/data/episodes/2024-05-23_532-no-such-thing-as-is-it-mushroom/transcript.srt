00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hi everyone, just before we start this show,

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,960
 I wanted to let you know that James and I

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,920
 are going to be doing a talk chat,

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,280
 a lecture at the Hay Festival in Hay on Y,

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,520
 next Wednesday, the 29th of May,

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,040
 and we are gonna be chatting about our new release

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,360
 of the paperback, A Load of Old Balls,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,040
 which is all the most interesting facts

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,080
 and things we learned about sports.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,180
 It's for sports lovers, it's for sports haters,

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,960
 it's for sports skeptics,

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,520
 you've got Mary Queen of Scots football in there,

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,440
 you've got Michael Palin's Concord Tournament,

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,800
 you've got lacrosse games involving over 100,000 players.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,120
 There's something for everyone.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,400
 Do come and listen to us.

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,240
 Hay is such a fun festival anyway,

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,600
 so to get tickets for that,

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,160
 go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,120
 and while you're there,

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,600
 obviously buy tickets for our tour,

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,840
 if you haven't already, which you should have.

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,960
 On with the show.

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,540
 (upbeat music)

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:13,860
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,340
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,980
 a weekly podcast coming to you

30
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,140
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,620
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

33
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,740
 James Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski,

34
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,860
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

35
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,560
 of our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,400
 and in no particular order, here we go.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,600
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,880
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the coroner

39
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,740
 who did the autopsy of President McKinley

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,340
 injected part of him into a dog.

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,700
 So, he was autopsied by two doctors

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,140
 called Harvey Gaylord and Herman Matzinger,

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,760
 and Matzinger wanted to find out

44
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,180
 whether the bullet that killed McKinley

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,940
 had been poisoned or had some bacteria on it,

46
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,140
 like a biological weapon.

47
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,220
 And so, the way he did it was he took samples

48
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,740
 from the wound and he injected parts of it

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,300
 into some rabbits and a dog,

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,580
 and wanted to see how the rabbits and dogs reacted,

51
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,460
 because if there was poison on the bullet,

52
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,940
 maybe they would die and that would be evidence

53
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,020
 that he'd been poisoned as well as shot.

54
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,860
 - And?

55
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,060
 - And it turns out that the thing that killed him

56
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,260
 was the bullet that went right through his body.

57
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,060
 - Yeah, the dog was fine, wasn't it?

58
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,500
 In the notes that were given, sort of said,

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 he was acting fine, doesn't mention the rabbit.

60
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
 - No, it doesn't mention the rabbit.

61
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,540
 It said that he was acting well, the dog,

62
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,180
 but his body temperature was around 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

63
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,500
 - Is that good or bad for a dog?

64
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,020
 - It's bad for a dog.

65
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,260
 It should be a bit lower than that.

66
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,220
 - You can react badly to an injection,

67
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,420
 I certainly do at any time.

68
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,860
 I get a raised temperature.

69
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,420
 We should say this was 1901 as well,

70
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,780
 just for anyone who's not up on their presidents,

71
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,100
 President McKinley around 20th-ish.

72
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,340
 - 25th, I think?

73
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,180
 - He was 25th president, that's right.

74
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,940
 - So why am I talking about this today

75
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,620
 if it was something that happened around 1900?

76
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,900
 Well, we don't talk to us anymore.

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,180
 (laughing)

78
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
 - This is a new feature.

79
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,100
 - Well, in the news this year,

80
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,380
 there was an auction site called the Raab Collection

81
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,900
 and they found the personal papers

82
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,980
 of this Dr. Herman Matzinga

83
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,940
 and that gave us all of this information

84
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,860
 about him injecting the president into the dog,

85
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,500
 which we didn't know until this year.

86
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,340
 - That's very cool.

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,220
 - He was actually, no wonder he liked animals

88
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,820
 'cause he was a buffalo doctor.

89
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,220
 And when I say buffalo doctor,

90
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,900
 he was a doctor who lived in the city of Buffalo

91
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,780
 in New York. - Who's that Matzinga?

92
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,580
 - That was Matzinga, yeah, right.

93
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,140
 I just thought I'd try and trick you guys there.

94
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,980
 - Good trick.

95
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,540
 But he wasn't the first man

96
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,740
 to even look after McKinley when he came in.

97
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,620
 That was a different man called Dr. Mann

98
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,300
 and Dr. Mann, Dr. Matthew Mann,

99
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,420
 and he wasn't even a proper surgeon.

100
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,740
 He was a gynecologist.

101
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,500
 He was a gynecological surgeon.

102
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,340
 - Oh no.

103
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,660
 - This man has no vagina.

104
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,460
 - It's all going into openings, isn't it?

105
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,900
 When someone's been shot.

106
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,580
 - That's true. - What a comforting thing to hear.

107
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,340
 Dr. Anna says you lie on the operating table.

108
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
 Look, it's all just stuff going in places.

109
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,380
 Don't worry.

110
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,540
 - It's all holes in the body.

111
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,820
 - Let's inspect your chest vagina now.

112
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,460
 - Oh, the exit vagina is a lot bigger.

113
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,180
 - But the weird thing is

114
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,340
 Thomas Edison gets involved at this point.

115
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,420
 - Of course he does.

116
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,900
 - He sent to Buffalo a new X-ray machine,

117
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,580
 which is exactly like first ever episode of the podcast,

118
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,140
 James Garfield's shot.

119
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,740
 In that case, it was Alexander Graham Bell

120
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,740
 sending a proto-metal detector.

121
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,620
 Basically all new technologies were at some point

122
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,460
 just being tried on presidents who have been assassinated.

123
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,060
 - So basically if God forbid the American president

124
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,620
 gets shot in the next couple of years,

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,020
 they'll probably send a chat bot.

126
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
 - Yeah.

127
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,420
 (all laughing)

128
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,260
 - That's amazing.

129
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,940
 So autopsies have come a long way

130
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,900
 since the days of injecting stuff into animals.

131
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,940
 And I didn't know really about body farms.

132
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,020
 - That sounds grim.

133
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,220
 - And yet it is.

134
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,540
 (all laughing)

135
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,980
 So they were basically invented by this guy called Billy Bass.

136
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,100
 I remember that singing fish.

137
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,980
 - No, not Billy.

138
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,620
 - Bigmouth Billy Bass is singing fish.

139
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,540
 - Wait, so he did body farms

140
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,260
 and then he did novelty singing fish?

141
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,100
 - Fairly so.

142
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,140
 Or it could be that they are different.

143
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,980
 - People.

144
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,380
 - So this guy called Bill Bass

145
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,260
 was a forensic anthropologist in the 60s and 70s.

146
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,460
 And he realized that we didn't know much

147
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,180
 about what happens to bodies when they decompose.

148
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,620
 And so he kind of bought up some farmland

149
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,300
 and decided to collect loads and loads of dead bodies.

150
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,420
 And it's still going today.

151
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,660
 And there are now a few body farms around the world

152
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,580
 and they're extraordinary places.

153
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,940
 - It does sound like an excuse, doesn't it?

154
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,260
 When the police come and they say,

155
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,420
 why have you got hundreds of dead bodies buried in your field?

156
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,980
 - Well, also 'cause they're buried in really odd scenarios

157
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,940
 'cause they're stored in the boots of cars, for instance.

158
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,780
 - Oh yeah.

159
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,060
 - In pools of water, buried under rubble and in concrete.

160
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,460
 - No, this is my body allotment.

161
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,540
 I want one day to have a whole farm,

162
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,300
 but I've only got one so far.

163
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,140
 - Yeah, they're incredible.

164
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,460
 And we've learned so much about forensics from them.

165
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,340
 And yeah, they do things like,

166
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,380
 you'll be walking through a field

167
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,460
 and you might not see any bodies,

168
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,100
 but you might see pipes sticking up out of the ground.

169
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,300
 And that's 'cause there are bodies underground

170
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,620
 and they're connected to pipes, which are collecting gases

171
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,820
 and the gases will determine what bodies smell of

172
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,780
 and that's so that we can develop machines in the future

173
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,500
 that can detect them by smell.

174
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,980
 - That is stunning. - That's classy.

175
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,300
 Leaving your body to science like that

176
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,740
 is a really good thing to do.

177
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,260
 As in, well, I hope I have the gumption to do that.

178
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,140
 I felt that we established

179
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,700
 you won't have any body remaining

180
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,740
 after we got to it from last week's episode.

181
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,700
 It's a fun little callback

182
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,620
 if you haven't listened to last week's episode yet.

183
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,740
 Find out what's gonna happen to me

184
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,780
 when these three get their hands on me.

185
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,580
 - So the father of autopsy, what people call that

186
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,860
 is a guy called Karl Rokitansky.

187
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,580
 And he came up with the idea of like looking

188
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,740
 at the internal organs to diagnose disease on the outside.

189
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,260
 He personally performed 30,000 autopsies

190
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,100
 and supervised another 70,000.

191
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,180
 - Sorry, 30,000? - Yeah.

192
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,060
 - That's one a day for like ages.

193
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,700
 (laughing)

194
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,060
 - It's one a day for a hundred years, isn't it?

195
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,900
 - Yeah. - Wasn't it?

196
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,380
 - Yeah, he did more than one a day.

197
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,540
 It's the way he got through that.

198
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,380
 - Clever.

199
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,180
 - It's weekends, that's evenings, that's your birthday.

200
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,340
 Maybe you do more on your birthday.

201
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,820
 I don't know if you're the father of it.

202
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,740
 - So I got a question.

203
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,780
 I think Andy's the best one to answer this.

204
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,620
 - Okay.

205
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,740
 - But Dan might be able to answer

206
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,740
 and Anna definitely won't.

207
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,580
 - Interesting.

208
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,420
 - So it's guy's stuff.

209
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,260
 - He's called Karl Rokitansky.

210
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,860
 And where do you know that name from?

211
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,820
 - Karl Rokitansky. - Rokitansky.

212
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,660
 - Rokitansky.

213
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,060
 - What are you guys both into?

214
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,900
 - Something that I associate with both of you,

215
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,580
 which is shit movies.

216
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,900
 - Oh.

217
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,100
 - Was he in?

218
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,460
 - Adam Sandler's real name.

219
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,660
 (all laughing)

220
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,580
 - Actually, it's unfair to call this a shit movie.

221
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,540
 It's actually a classic,

222
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,020
 but it's the kind of movie you two would like.

223
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,060
 - Pacific Rim 2.

224
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,980
 (all laughing)

225
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,700
 - He gave his name to Max Rokitansky,

226
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,780
 who is the main character in the film series Mad Max.

227
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,020
 - Oh. - That's amazing.

228
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,820
 And that's 'cause George Miller, who directed it,

229
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,260
 he was working as a doctor when he was getting funds for it.

230
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,100
 - What, George Miller?

231
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
 - That's amazing. - That's very cool.

232
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,060
 - Yeah, George Miller's career has been amazing.

233
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,900
 He's done Mad Max.

234
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,860
 He did Babe 2 Pig in the City, Happy Feet,

235
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,940
 and then more Mad Max.

236
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,780
 - Yeah, this weird fund.

237
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,900
 What was it called, the latest one?

238
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,580
 - The one's second to last.

239
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,500
 - Fury Road. - Fury Road.

240
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,020
 - He's like in his 70s radies

241
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,980
 when he comes out to make that again.

242
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,300
 Like he's-- - And the new ones out shortly?

243
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,140
 - Yeah.

244
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,980
 - Anyway.

245
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,820
 - So why does he--

246
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,460
 - This is why I thought these two liked this answer.

247
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,860
 - I have actually seen Mad Max uncharacteristically.

248
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,580
 I thought it was very dystopian.

249
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,100
 I'd rather be locked on a body bath.

250
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,940
 - Yeah.

251
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,780
 - You know what?

252
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,900
 The plot was not lost on you.

253
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,540
 (all laughing)

254
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,380
 - Oh, dear.

255
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,460
 James, I have a different father of autopsy.

256
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,580
 - Oh, yeah, go on.

257
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,340
 - Mondino De Liuzzi.

258
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,060
 - Oh, I can't hear this again.

259
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,900
 - Is it?

260
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,740
 Can we hear this again?

261
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,380
 - Who is the father of autopsy and me?

262
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,900
 - Don't do that, look.

263
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,420
 - Most episodes.

264
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,620
 (all laughing)

265
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,420
 - Mondino De Liuzzi was the Restorer of Anatomy.

266
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,380
 He was Italian, if you couldn't tell.

267
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,900
 (all laughing)

268
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,380
 At the University of Bologna.

269
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,700
 And Anatomy was a band,

270
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,220
 except for once every five years you could do a dissection.

271
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,060
 - Wow.

272
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,900
 - Dissection.

273
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,940
 - Is this like what's that film where sort of every 10 years

274
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,980
 or something, you can all kill each other?

275
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,820
 - The Purge.

276
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,660
 - Yeah.

277
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,740
 This is basically the Purge.

278
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,580
 - Oh my God, Anna.

279
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,340
 You are in your dystopian worlds today.

280
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,180
 - I am, yeah.

281
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
 - Amazing.

282
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,620
 - So De Liuzzi, he became the first person

283
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,820
 to do a dissection, document it and publish his findings.

284
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
 And it was the first documented public dissection

285
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,420
 in 1700 years.

286
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,260
 - Right.

287
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,100
 - Amazing.

288
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,780
 But weirdly, senior people like him,

289
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,380
 they would not do the actual dissection themselves.

290
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,980
 So there's a picture of this happening.

291
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,940
 And it was in the 14th century.

292
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,260
 Senior people like him, they wouldn't do the dissection.

293
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,620
 He would sit on a big elevated chair above the action.

294
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,460
 - Like a tennis umpire.

295
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,300
 - Exactly like that.

296
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,140
 And he was reading aloud from a book.

297
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,580
 I'm bringing him a book of Anatomy.

298
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,700
 - No balls, please.

299
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,860
 (all laughing)

300
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,100
 - And he was commenting on,

301
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,220
 he was reading Galen's Anatomy to the audience and saying,

302
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
 look, now you're gonna say,

303
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,340
 there was just a sort of barber surgeon

304
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,860
 actually doing the procedure.

305
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,140
 And also, do we ever mention the ostensor?

306
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,980
 That was basically someone with one of those pointers

307
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,740
 whose job was to just point out the bits

308
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,060
 that were being autopsyed or examined or whatever.

309
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,700
 - Separate to the guy on the chair.

310
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,020
 - The guy on the chair is talking you through it.

311
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,860
 - 'Cause he can't reach,

312
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
 he'd need a very long ostensor.

313
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,740
 - Exactly, I mean, they can go very long, those.

314
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,580
 That's true.

315
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,580
 The ostensor is just there going,

316
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,020
 "Vada, there's the pancreas, uh-huh, front door."

317
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,940
 - Yeah, they became really popular,

318
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,300
 didn't they, dissections in Italy especially.

319
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,900
 Around the time of the 16th century,

320
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,620
 they were so popular, you could buy flap anatomies.

321
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,740
 And a flap anatomy was like a book with flaps in it,

322
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,700
 you know, like a kid's book,

323
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,380
 where you could lift up the flaps and say,

324
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,300
 "Oh, look, there's the gallbladder."

325
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,340
 - Oh, yeah, so cool. - Isn't that cool?

326
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,180
 - Wow.

327
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,620
 - I can't believe that technology is that old.

328
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,460
 - I don't know.

329
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,460
 - Well, I mean, the technology is quite basic for a flap.

330
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,740
 (laughing)

331
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,500
 Literally just a piece of paper.

332
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,580
 But I don't know if there were any kids books

333
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,900
 that did that before then, I can't imagine that would have.

334
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,260
 So I think the original kids flap book was probably this.

335
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,740
 - That's great. - Wow.

336
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,300
 - Have you heard of vampire autopsies?

337
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,140
 These are very weird.

338
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,540
 These are a real thing that used to happen.

339
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,140
 There was concern that if you were dug up

340
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,300
 and you were very well preserved,

341
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,980
 you might be a vampire.

342
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,820
 And there was this big superstition

343
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,540
 that tuberculosis was an inherited disease.

344
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,060
 So the dead could drain the life of their descendants.

345
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,340
 Actually, those people had TB,

346
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,300
 but the idea was that they were kind of being drained

347
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,420
 by the people who died.

348
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,460
 And there was a theory that the body of the dead person

349
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,980
 had to be destroyed to protect the health of the living.

350
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,740
 The last one of these happened in 1949.

351
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,580
 - What?

352
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,420
 - I know.

353
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,260
 - Was it to kill them,

354
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,420
 to stop them vampirizing other people in 1949?

355
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
 - Yeah. - Right.

356
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,540
 - Very weird.

357
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,140
 We should have done my spooky voice for that.

358
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,740
 - Yeah. - Come on.

359
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,860
 - I read about a very interesting autopsy

360
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,540
 that happened in 1533.

361
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,380
 And it was an autopsy that was done on two children

362
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,820
 who were infant twins who were conjoined.

363
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
 And the question was, are these two children,

364
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,540
 two children with two souls or one soul?

365
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,900
 And the autopsy was to determine that to work out,

366
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,100
 is there one soul between two kids?

367
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,500
 - How many souls did they find?

368
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,340
 - They found two.

369
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,180
 - Oh, did they?

370
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,420
 - Yeah, they found two because there's a Greek idea

371
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,660
 that the soul resided in the heart

372
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,220
 and they found two hearts within the conjoined twins.

373
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,940
 Therefore, that was the answer that they were given.

374
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,060
 But that was like a very theological specific autopsy.

375
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,740
 - I think the important part of that was

376
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,900
 that these children hadn't been baptized,

377
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,940
 but they would baptize people after their death,

378
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,780
 wouldn't they?

379
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,700
 And so, if they only had one soul,

380
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,180
 they'd only have to have one baptism.

381
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,020
 But if they had two souls,

382
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,860
 they'd have to have two baptisms.

383
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,340
 - Surely, less effort just to do the double baptism.

384
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,340
 You know, just let's do two, cover up.

385
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,660
 - Yeah, but if you baptize twice,

386
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,380
 then that undoes the effect of the first baptism.

387
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,220
 - Absolutely.

388
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
 - Yeah, it's like being bonked on the head

389
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,220
 by something, losing your memory.

390
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,980
 - Oh, right, the second bonk brings it back.

391
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,820
 I see.

392
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,580
 Another autopsy, which was quite amazing,

393
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,500
 was a little bit later on in 2010.

394
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,380
 And this is the amazing stuff they can reveal now.

395
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,460
 So this was a robbery in Oregon

396
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,620
 and it was two men in masks

397
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,380
 who tried to rob a cafe or coffee kiosk at gunpoint.

398
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,020
 And the guy who was managing the kiosk

399
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,780
 also whipped out a gun 'cause it was America.

400
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,700
 And he managed to shoot one of the people

401
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,540
 who was robbing him,

402
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,220
 but the other one got away.

403
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,900
 Now, they did an autopsy on the one robber that he'd shot

404
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,580
 and they looked in his belly

405
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,500
 and there was a still intact French fry in his stomach.

406
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,620
 Now, we know about how much French fries degrade

407
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,540
 and how good I digest.

408
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,340
 So they knew that he must have eaten a French fry

409
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,700
 sort of in the last hour.

410
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,940
 Not only that, but someone doing the autopsy

411
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,740
 managed to identify it as a Wendy's French fry.

412
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,580
 - Come on.

413
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,420
 (laughing)

414
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,260
 - Give me a break.

415
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,340
 I think I could tell the difference

416
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,660
 between a Burger King and the McDonald's one for sure.

417
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,500
 - There you go.

418
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,340
 - Someone tasted it.

419
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,180
 They drew straws.

420
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,020
 - Yeah.

421
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,980
 - So it's a Wendy's fry.

422
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,820
 - Wendy's fry.

423
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,620
 So they just looked all the nearby Wendy's restaurants

424
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,820
 'cause there couldn't have been more than an hour ago

425
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,660
 he ate it.

426
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,060
 And they looked at the security footage

427
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,820
 and there was one within an hour.

428
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,580
 And they did indeed find the pictures of the two people

429
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,580
 on CCTV and found the other guy.

430
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,740
 - Wow.

431
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,620
 I'm gonna hear how they know it was a Wendy's fry.

432
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,020
 I'm sure, I mean, I believe it.

433
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,260
 I just, I'm just curious.

434
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,100
 - Yeah.

435
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,340
 - We don't have Wendy's here.

436
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,060
 So we don't have, if you can let us know

437
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,180
 if Wendy's fries are particularly,

438
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,500
 maybe they're S-shaped or something.

439
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,340
 - Moral of the story is always chew your food.

440
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,380
 - That's a really good point.

441
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,620
 Why is the fry intact?

442
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,020
 - I mean, he's literally inhaled that fry, hasn't he?

443
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,180
 - Oh my God, I'd be so easy to autopsy

444
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
 if I committed a crime.

445
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,820
 All my food enters my body and completely intact.

446
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,060
 (laughing)

447
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,640
 (upbeat music)

448
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,100
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

449
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,020
 And that is Andy.

450
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,420
 My fact is that England's worst ever pennies

451
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,260
 are worth 350 pounds each.

452
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,580
 - Hmm.

453
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,900
 - Well, they may be some of the best.

454
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,620
 These are coins called the Tealby pennies, right?

455
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,660
 And this is a story of a man.

456
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,420
 Well, why am I telling you this fact today?

457
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
 Well, I'll tell you.

458
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,380
 (laughing)

459
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,180
 - Is this gonna be a new feature now?

460
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,900
 I'm gonna start finding it quite tedious, I think.

461
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,180
 - Basically, there's a man called Tony House,

462
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,020
 which I love.

463
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,660
 He's a metal detectorist and he was out

464
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,060
 and detecting away and he found a stash of pennies,

465
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,340
 ancient ones, they're from the 12th century.

466
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,300
 He found one and then he found 600 more.

467
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,540
 (laughing)

468
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,420
 - That's like if you see one and two in your house.

469
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,260
 - Exactly.

470
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,940
 (laughing)

471
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,100
 And they're worth about 350 quid each.

472
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,780
 And the thing about them is they're really,

473
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,660
 really low quality coins.

474
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,020
 They are badly made, they're hard to read.

475
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,260
 The image is just hopelessly stamped.

476
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,980
 They're from the reign of Henry II.

477
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,700
 They're named after Tealby in Lincolnshire,

478
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,660
 which is where 5,000 of them were found

479
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,860
 in a huge cache in the 19th century.

480
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,700
 - Ah, cache.

481
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,140
 - And they're just really ropey coins.

482
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,300
 - So why are they worth so much,

483
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
 just 'cause they're old now and rare?

484
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,140
 - Rare, maybe?

485
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,980
 They're old, they're pretty rare.

486
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,820
 - I thought they were quite a lot of them.

487
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,380
 - Well, I was on a numismatist website called Numsock,

488
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,140
 which was really good.

489
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,940
 It says this coinage is renowned for its ugly appearance,

490
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,500
 bad craftsmanship and careless execution.

491
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,140
 To collect Tealby pennies in the first place,

492
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,020
 it grounds you as a little strange.

493
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,980
 (laughing)

494
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,820
 - Yeah.

495
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,700
 - Right, to be strange in the numismatist world

496
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,540
 is truly strangeness.

497
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,980
 I kind of absolutely love numismatism, in fact,

498
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,020
 even though it's really hard to say.

499
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,500
 And I love coin research because, A, it's so reliable.

500
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,380
 It's such reliable history, there's no spurious,

501
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,500
 oh, what was this used for?

502
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,180
 Because all the information that you need is on this coin.

503
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,380
 It's like, there's a date, there's a face,

504
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,660
 it's a physical thing.

505
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,500
 And people--

506
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,820
 - You're saying we have no mystery coins

507
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,980
 that we don't know the stories behind?

508
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,820
 - Oh, yeah.

509
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,940
 I mean, we will have some mystery coins.

510
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,660
 Don't worry, Dan, there are the alien theories out there,

511
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
 I'm sure.

512
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,380
 - Good, 'cause all my research.

513
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,460
 - But people are also so obsessed.

514
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,420
 I was on a Reddit thread,

515
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,460
 which was started by someone who said,

516
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,020
 "I ranked all the Roman emperors for their coinage

517
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,940
 "based on its artistic value, variety,

518
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,580
 "collectibility and historical value.

519
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,900
 "Feel free to ask me about the rankings."

520
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,180
 And everyone did.

521
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,540
 (laughing)

522
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,460
 - That is really tragic of no one else's life.

523
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,300
 (laughing)

524
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,500
 - Oh, don't you worry.

525
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,340
 - Anyone?

526
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,420
 - Thousands.

527
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,460
 I can tell you that Claudius wasn't high enough.

528
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,580
 And Claudius, of course,

529
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,340
 was responsible for the return to realism

530
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,420
 instead of the vaguely Hellenistic idealism

531
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,580
 on previous coins.

532
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,700
 So he should have had at least an A rank,

533
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,140
 according to one person.

534
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,260
 (laughing)

535
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,900
 One person just said, "I feel insulted

536
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,340
 "you ranked Nero as high as Augustus."

537
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,900
 And this is not as an emperor,

538
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,260
 this is his coinage.

539
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,100
 (laughing)

540
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,180
 - Right.

541
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,100
 - You were saying about there being no dubious coins,

542
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,060
 Anna, which did backtrack on Inferness, but--

543
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,300
 - I guess, yeah.

544
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,220
 - I have an interesting thing that I found,

545
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,340
 which is about rainbow cups.

546
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,580
 Don't know if you guys found this.

547
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,020
 - Was it related to the moon cup?

548
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,620
 (laughing)

549
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,620
 - In the fact that they're cup shaped, both.

550
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,460
 - Okay.

551
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,300
 - Only.

552
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,180
 So these are coins that are cup shaped,

553
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,500
 and you find them, especially in Germany,

554
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,660
 and you'll find them in fields.

555
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,580
 But these are often found after it had been raining,

556
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,820
 but then it was sunny straight afterwards.

557
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,300
 Because not only are they kind of pushed forward

558
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,420
 by the muddiness,

559
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,500
 but also water gets into the cup-ness,

560
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,340
 and it shines, and they're really easy to find,

561
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,780
 because the reflection of the light comes off.

562
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,940
 And people associated them with rainbows.

563
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,300
 And according to Discover Magazine,

564
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,980
 which is usually a pretty good source,

565
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,980
 this is the reason that we have like a crock of gold

566
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,260
 at the end of a rainbow.

567
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,100
 - Oh, no.

568
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,660
 - People, whenever there was a rainbow,

569
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,460
 they would find these cup shaped coins.

570
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,300
 - Very good.

571
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,140
 - That's awesome.

572
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,940
 - And apparently there were tribes of Southern Germany

573
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,820
 that were Celtic tribes that moved up into Ireland,

574
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,580
 and that's why the Irish associated with leprechauns.

575
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,540
 - I love that.

576
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,460
 That's amazing.

577
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,300
 - Isn't that cool?

578
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,140
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

579
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,980
 - That's great.

580
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,620
 I've got a favorite coin.

581
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,460
 - Yeah.

582
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,300
 - You've got a double eagle.

583
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,140
 This is an American coin,

584
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,620
 and it was a $10 coin issued in 1933.

585
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,540
 Half a million of them were struck,

586
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,420
 but they weren't issued as legal tender.

587
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,540
 'Cause in 1933, the Great Depression, blah, blah, blah,

588
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,620
 banking crisis, gold coins are outlawed as legal tender.

589
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,740
 It is now illegal to own a double eagle one.

590
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,580
 - What?

591
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,100
 - Yeah, they're all technically U.S. government property.

592
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,820
 - Because they never put them out.

593
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,020
 You can't have accidentally got one in your change

594
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,860
 and own it.

595
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,700
 - I see.

596
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,860
 - If you have one, it must've been stolen.

597
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,380
 I think there is one, isn't there?

598
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,780
 - There's one, so there are two in the Smithsonian,

599
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,620
 which is kind of different,

600
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,700
 but then there's one which is not illegal to own.

601
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,260
 I can't work out exactly why that's the only one

602
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,100
 that's not illegal to own,

603
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,340
 but it was sold in 2021 at auction for nearly 50 million

604
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,180
 pounds.

605
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,020
 - Wow.

606
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,900
 - What happened was a few of them were stolen

607
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,780
 and found their way into private hands via a jeweler

608
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,780
 called Israel Svit, who was from Philadelphia.

609
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,540
 And when they came to light, they would just get confiscated

610
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,980
 'cause you weren't allowed to have them.

611
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,420
 But one of them got sold to King Farouk of Egypt.

612
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,020
 And he wrote to the Treasury Department said,

613
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,980
 "I have this coin, is it okay if I keep it?"

614
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,500
 And they hadn't discovered the theft at that stage,

615
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,660
 so they didn't realize that they'd been stolen.

616
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,660
 And so they replied to him saying,

617
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,620
 "Yeah, you can keep it."

618
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,460
 - Wow, that's good.

619
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,300
 - And that's the one.

620
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,740
 That's the one that if it ever comes up,

621
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,060
 is the one that gets sold at auction.

622
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,900
 - Amazing.

623
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,740
 - Wow.

624
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,580
 - So that's, I think, unique.

625
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,420
 - That is.

626
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,240
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

627
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,060
 - Just while we're on American coins,

628
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,860
 in 2007, there was a coin that was minted

629
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,620
 which had an image of JFK on it.

630
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,580
 And if you pressed a button on the coin,

631
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,300
 it played a short excerpt of his Iqbin Einbilina.

632
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,020
 So it had little technology in it to do that.

633
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,020
 - No, I don't believe that was legal tendancy.

634
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,460
 (laughing)

635
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,860
 - Do you know where that was minted?

636
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,820
 What country that was for?

637
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,660
 - Germany.

638
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,780
 - Sounds it right.

639
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,620
 Mongolia.

640
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,540
 (laughing)

641
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,380
 - Lovely.

642
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,980
 - Do you guys know that the first book written

643
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,220
 about the history of the coin

644
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,540
 was called the Ass and Party Bus?

645
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,020
 - The Ass and Party Bus?

646
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,140
 - Is that right?

647
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,020
 Is that a Latin book?

648
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

649
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,940
 - I see.

650
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,860
 - It's actually the ass at Party Bus.

651
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,940
 So I have translated two of the words.

652
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,060
 - Of ass and--

653
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,740
 - Party Bus means like parts of.

654
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,140
 - Ass was like an old Roman coin.

656
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,660
 - Oh, that's great.

657
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,580
 - Published in 1514 by Huiam Boudd,

658
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,700
 and to be honest, is quite boring.

659
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,420
 (laughing)

660
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,220
 - But you read the whole thing, presumably.

661
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,660
 - Yeah, the first 10 pages are about

662
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,800
 the etymology of the word ass.

663
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,640
 Then it goes on about--

664
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,700
 - I bet you read that so voraciously.

665
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,540
 - Yeah.

666
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,380
 - That's brilliant.

667
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,220
 - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

668
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,340
 - They were big.

669
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,700
 - One actually amazing thing,

670
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,820
 speaking of Romans and coins,

671
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,380
 is that coins are the reason

672
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,100
 that we're still discovering Roman emperors.

673
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,380
 Which I, sorry, I just still, I didn't know.

674
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,220
 - Wow.

675
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,700
 - We discovered our latest Roman emperor in 2022.

676
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,460
 - No, no, no, it's true.

677
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
 - Who were we missing?

678
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,300
 - This is--

679
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,140
 - It's not a biggie.

680
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,860
 It's not like in between Nero.

681
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,820
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, to Augustus actually.

682
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,420
 It only came to light.

683
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,620
 No, this is the great Sponsienus.

684
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,460
 (laughing)

685
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,380
 - Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a legit one.

686
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,220
 - Hi, I'm doing it.

687
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,920
 Oh, would you like to sponsor my anus?

688
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,600
 (laughing)

689
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,280
 - This is from, well, we think it's from the disaster century,

690
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,700
 whatever it's called, the crisis century in the Roman period,

691
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,740
 which was like the third century,

692
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,960
 when it was all falling to pieces

693
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,020
 and there were sort of 1900 emperors.

694
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,300
 But the reason he's only just come to light

695
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,640
 is because there were these coins found

696
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,660
 in Transylvania in the 1700s,

697
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,580
 which were assumed to be fake,

698
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,420
 and people looked at them and said they were true.

699
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,400
 - Andy, sorry, can Andy,

700
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,480
 can you say these coins were found in Transylvania, please?

701
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,640
 - These coins were found in Transylvania.

702
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,180
 - Yeah, that seems to add to it for me.

703
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,760
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right, yeah.

704
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,160
 They were found in Transylvania in the 1700s,

705
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,240
 and they had a picture of this bloke,

706
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,340
 and it said Sponsienus under it, and--

707
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,680
 - Sponsienus.

708
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,480
 (laughing)

709
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,580
 - It just doesn't work when you do it down.

710
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,160
 Anyway, it was decided that they were fakes,

711
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,080
 and it was only in 2022 that analysis of them

712
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,760
 actually concluded they were probably real.

713
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
 And so we've literally just found out

714
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,840
 that there was a Roman emperor

715
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,560
 at some time between 248 and 253 AD.

716
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,480
 - Okay, wow.

717
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,400
 - Very much a sort of Liz Truss style.

718
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,360
 Lincoln, you'll miss him.

719
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,240
 - Yeah, I think it was in and out, job.

720
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
 - And just one coin so far, did you say?

721
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,320
 - I think there are a couple.

722
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,920
 I believe there are two coins.

723
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,440
 - Did you hear about the Eid Ma Aureus?

724
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,680
 So there's another Roman coin.

725
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,240
 Is this the, like after Caesar was killed?

726
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
 - Yes.

727
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,040
 - This is a coin that celebrates the assassination

728
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,760
 of Julius Caesar, minted by Brutus,

729
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,280
 and it has the inscription, "Eid Ma,"

730
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,520
 which is, "Eids of Mars."

731
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,700
 And it has their daggers on.

732
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,520
 Brutus and Cassius' daggers are depicted.

733
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,360
 - It's crazy.

734
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 It's like immediately after, almost, right?

735
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,400
 Like it's like merch.

736
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,280
 - That's kind of what they did, though, wasn't it?

737
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,000
 It was like, "Get rid of the old emperor.

738
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,920
 How do you do it?

739
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
 Well, let's just mint a load of coins."

740
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
 - Yeah.

741
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,600
 - It doesn't matter how you do it.

742
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,680
 - Interestingly, Julius Caesar was the first known autopsy

743
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,320
 that we have ever done stuff.

744
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,160
 - Yeah.

745
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,040
 - Was that required?

746
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,120
 - Well, they found out that he was stabbed 23 times.

747
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,960
 - Right.

748
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,280
 I mean, that, yeah.

749
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,040
 - But was that poison on the dagger,

750
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,560
 which was the actual cause of death?

751
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,320
 - I can't deal with this many vaginas.

752
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,200
 (both laughing)

753
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 - But they wanted to find out

754
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,000
 which of the stabbings was the one that killed him.

755
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
 - No, how did they, no offense to the Romans.

756
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,040
 How did they think they were gonna be able to do that?

757
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,560
 Surely it would have been some combination

758
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,640
 of the 23 that did it.

759
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,600
 - I could tell you, because most of them were

760
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,280
 either in the face or the groin.

761
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,120
 It was found.

762
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,960
 - Oh, they were in the face.

763
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,000
 - I didn't know that.

764
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,840
 - Wow.

765
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,760
 - And it was just one or two.

766
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,520
 And I think one of them went through

767
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,840
 is the side of his arm and into his arm's room.

768
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,680
 - Right, okay.

769
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,280
 - So they decided that that was it.

770
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
 - Wow.

771
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,960
 - Anyway.

772
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,800
 - Blimey.

773
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,480
 - And the groin, was that deliberate?

774
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,320
 - Yeah.

775
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,160
 - Doesn't seem inadvertent, does it?

776
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,000
 - Yeah.

777
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
 - Going for a crotch.

778
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,960
 - Coin villain, Henry VIII.

779
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,800
 - Really?

780
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,080
 - Yeah, but the numismatists foe.

781
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,000
 So he wasted lots of money on wars

782
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,920
 with foreigners, basically.

783
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,120
 And he specifically, he debased the currency.

784
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,960
 He issued new coins where he'd put copper

785
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,040
 in the silver coins just to make the silver

786
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,560
 go a bit further, basically.

787
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,760
 And it caused mayhem.

788
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
 People were hoarding their good coins

789
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,620
 from the before times, which were still worth

790
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,840
 every bit of silver in them.

791
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,600
 And they left the bad ones in circulation.

792
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,520
 Foreign bankers refused to accept English money.

793
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,760
 They were asking for gold instead.

794
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,960
 It just, it was a disaster.

795
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
 And then a few years after he dies,

796
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,360
 Elizabeth I came to the throne 15 years later,

797
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,200
 she had to recall every single coin in the kingdom

798
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,880
 and melt them down and reissue proper coins.

799
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,280
 - You have like a coin amnesty.

800
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,880
 Everyone come and hand your coins in at the forum.

801
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,720
 - Pretty much.

802
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,280
 - They had those, you know, those machines

803
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,840
 where you pour all your coins in

804
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,920
 and it gives you a little slip, they had those.

805
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,720
 - Not the ones with the tray going back and forward.

806
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,040
 Is that what they're doing?

807
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,760
 They're collecting my coins.

808
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
 - Well, they are collecting your coins effectively.

809
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,160
 You know those things, by the way,

810
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,000
 they were invented by, I can't remember who it was now,

811
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,520
 but they were invented and the person who invented them

812
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,920
 thought that they would only last one year

813
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,440
 because it's been quite a few of these kind of amusements

814
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,240
 that had come and gone really quickly.

815
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,280
 And so they invented them, they didn't patent them.

816
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,360
 They made a load of them

817
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,800
 and then they became really successful.

818
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,360
 And now you could just make them without any patents.

819
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,480
 - I didn't realize that.

820
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,200
 - Yeah. And the original one had the big hole in the middle

821
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,720
 which your coins would go in so they would make money.

822
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,400
 Whereas now the holes are hidden.

823
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,960
 So when the coins are being pushed,

824
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,160
 there's holes on the side that you can't see

825
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,520
 and that's where the coins kind of fall into

826
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,080
 and that's the cut that the machines are.

827
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,800
 - So I'm not aiming, I don't want to get into those holes.

828
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,960
 - No, so think about it.

829
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160
 - I want to get into the big hole in the middle.

830
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,520
 - Every coin you put in, in theory,

831
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,840
 is going to come out again, right?

832
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,080
 So how do they make money?

833
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,200
 Well, the way they make money is they have hidden holes

834
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,840
 where the coins fall down and go into the bank.

835
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,880
 - Wait, why would every coin in theory be coming out again?

836
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,600
 I just thought they'd got more and more and more coins

837
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,760
 until the whole thing exploded.

838
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,880
 - Until the whole thing was full of coins.

839
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,160
 - Yeah, exactly, someone's going to go to those machines

840
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,000
 and they're just crowned.

841
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
 - You've never seen one of them fall to top.

842
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,680
 - I think it's like, you fill them with coins

843
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,480
 to start off with because you've never turned up

844
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,000
 to one of those and there's no coins in it.

845
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
 - Just a little sign saying please.

846
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,280
 - So they fill them with coins

847
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,680
 and then in theory, everyone you put in

848
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,760
 is going to push another one out.

849
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,040
 - I did not know there were side things.

850
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,760
 I just thought they built up and then at night

851
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,120
 people came by and siphoned out and stacked them artfully

852
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,080
 so they never stayed, none of them would fall in the hole.

853
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,320
 - That might happen as well.

854
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,360
 - Those machines are great.

855
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,200
 I love them so much.

856
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
 - I spend so much of my money on them.

857
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,400
 - Yeah, they are amazing.

858
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 I love them as well.

859
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,240
 You know those penny collection machines actually?

860
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,080
 - What do you mean?

861
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,800
 - The one where you get all of your money

862
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,280
 that you've been keeping in a jar for the last 10 years.

863
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,640
 - Oh and you tip them in and you turn it into cash.

864
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,520
 - Do you know what the most

865
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,480
 that anyone's ever got out of this?

866
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,320
 - Oh great.

867
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,760
 - Oh God, how much?

868
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,040
 So I think I mentioned on the show once

869
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,240
 that I did it in Australia

870
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,280
 and I think I got three or $400 out of it.

871
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,600
 - What, how much?

872
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,080
 You were pouring in coppers into a machine.

873
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,920
 You got $400.

874
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,760
 - What's an all coppers?

875
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,600
 There's some 50 cents.

876
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,440
 - Right.

877
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,200
 - What Looney Tunes bank robbery had you just done

878
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,000
 to have $400 in spilled coins?

879
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
 - It was all of Bean's money

880
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,400
 they'd been collected over the years.

881
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,000
 - Well remember, he just spills change everywhere,

882
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,800
 never picks it up and I was unemployed.

883
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,160
 So I thought I'm gonna try and contribute

884
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,760
 to this little domestic economy.

885
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,320
 Go on, who's beating my record then?

886
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,160
 - Yeah, what is it?

887
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,280
 2000, I'm gonna say.

888
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,760
 - No, the record is $13,084.59.

889
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,600
 - Wow.

890
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,880
 - I don't mean behind that person.

891
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,440
 (all laughing)

892
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,160
 - There was a man in Alabama

893
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,760
 and he had to have all of his coins delivered

894
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,920
 to the bank to do this

895
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,880
 because obviously there were so many of them

896
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
 he couldn't carry them

897
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,440
 and it took seven hours to count them all.

898
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,280
 - Wow.

899
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,240
 - And his collection weighed more than 4.5 tons.

900
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
 - Goodness.

901
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,880
 Why did he stop?

902
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,960
 - The fool.

903
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,200
 (all laughing)

904
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,320
 - Yes, what a weird again.

905
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,640
 That's an inside out logic.

906
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,320
 I would have gone for, why did he stop?

907
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,840
 - It does feel like perhaps

908
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,280
 there was someone else in his house

909
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,680
 who asked him to do it.

910
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,520
 - Yeah, fair enough.

911
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,360
 - I don't know.

912
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,440
 - Have you guys heard of Christopher Ironside?

913
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,520
 He was the designer behind the first decimal coins

914
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,320
 that we had in 1969 in the UK, right?

915
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,080
 And so, he designed the 50p.

916
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,880
 That was the first thing that he designed all of the coins.

917
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,560
 - I'm so sorry, I think it was 71?

918
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,880
 But maybe he designed them early?

919
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,600
 - No, there was some that came out early.

920
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,160
 71 was decimalization,

921
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,240
 but there were a few earlier decimal coins.

922
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,080
 - Right.

923
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,920
 - That's confusing.

924
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,760
 - That is confusing.

925
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
 - I mean, the whole decimalization thing

926
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
 sounds confusing to be fair.

927
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,760
 You would have loved the Daily Mail in 1971.

928
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,320
 - Why are there 240 anymore?

929
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,040
 - But so there was sort of an announcement

930
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,560
 that Britain was going to be heading this way,

931
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,680
 but the Royal Mint didn't say who was designing the coins,

932
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,080
 but they had picked this guy, Christopher Ironside,

933
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,600
 and he had to do it in secrecy from 1962 all the way to 1968.

934
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,880
 Now, you would think they gave him an office

935
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,800
 to go and do it in, that he could do it in secrecy

936
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,200
 if it was such a big deal, they didn't.

937
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,560
 He had to do it in his house.

938
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
 He had his mother living in the house.

939
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
 He had a daughter living in the house.

940
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,200
 He had two young kids on the way.

941
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
 He had a small house, so he had nowhere to do it.

942
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,360
 - And they're constantly at risk of discovering

943
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
 the big secret, which is that he's working

944
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,200
 best after this time.

945
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,640
 - But he's designing.

946
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,720
 All you need is a desk.

947
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,560
 - Exactly.

948
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
 - Yeah.

949
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,040
 - There's the voice of Big Mint over here.

950
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,200
 They could give him a room in the building, I would say.

951
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,040
 - Exactly.

952
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
 - I'm not saying they couldn't do that,

953
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,040
 but I'm just saying that the fact

954
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,760
 that he's working from home, like many of us does today.

955
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

956
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,440
 - But if I was working from home

957
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,200
 and I couldn't let my wife find out

958
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,360
 that I was working on a podcast,

959
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,480
 it might be tricky.

960
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,320
 - Would it?

961
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,160
 - Yeah.

962
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,000
 - Yeah.

963
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,840
 - What's this microphone for?

964
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,480
 (all laughing)

965
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
 - Well, she's at home

966
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
 'cause she's got two kids on the way.

967
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,160
 - And she's finding drawings of 50p coins around the place.

968
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
 She's saying, "What's this?"

969
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,000
 "Uh, nothing."

970
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,080
 - So I think she gets into it

971
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,200
 because she becomes the model for Britannica

972
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,600
 on the back of the 50p coin.

973
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,440
 Her name was Jean.

974
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,680
 And we were talking last week

975
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,240
 about Uma Thurman's grandmother.

976
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,840
 Well, we now know who was basically the model

977
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,000
 for Britannica. - All right.

978
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,520
 - But he had to hide it from all his friends

979
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,480
 who would come over and so on.

980
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,040
 So he had a big cloth that he would put over his desk.

981
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,880
 - What kind of claim he was doing?

982
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,040
 Did he say he was a spy?

983
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,880
 And actually--

984
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,720
 - It kind of felt like it, but--

985
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,000
 - It just doesn't feel hard

986
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,760
 to hide drawing a picture of Britannica.

987
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,000
 - No, he was making the molds.

988
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,280
 He was doing all the molds.

989
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,120
 - Still?

990
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
 - Do you know how big a coin is?

991
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,960
 - Yeah, totally.

992
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,040
 But like, you know--

993
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,880
 - James, I think this guy had a rough time.

994
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,280
 I do, I've got to say.

995
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,760
 - I want to know why it took him six years to design.

996
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,600
 - Yeah.

997
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,520
 - What, like five coins?

998
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,680
 - Because he was constantly trying

999
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,320
 to hide his tiny molds everywhere.

1000
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,600
 - I think it was, as he reports into the office every quarter,

1001
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,520
 "No, sorry, my mother-in-law came into the room."

1002
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,360
 What they had to do--

1003
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,840
 - Just as I was making the molds.

1004
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,280
 I had to throw it out of the window into the garden.

1005
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,800
 - And then someone walked past the garden

1006
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,680
 and they had to go and bury it in the garden.

1007
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,200
 - Then a fox dug it up, you see, that was the problem.

1008
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,080
 So I will need another three years.

1009
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,280
 I'm afraid to complete the molds.

1010
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,760
 - They had to delay one of the coins

1011
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,840
 because he found his daughter at the desk

1012
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,800
 putting into the putty her knife or whatever

1013
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,240
 and it completely ruined the coins.

1014
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,320
 They had to redesign the way.

1015
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,480
 - His whole family, I imagine,

1016
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
 was just going, "Darling, we don't care.

1017
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,840
 "It's something to do with the coin.

1018
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,160
 "We couldn't care less.

1019
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,640
 "It's dinner time."

1020
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,880
 - Oh, that's so good.

1021
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
 That's hilarious.

1022
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,440
 - Just very quickly before we go,

1023
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,680
 crypto coins that exist include the Yeti coin.

1024
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,520
 - Brilliant.

1025
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,560
 - The golf coin.

1026
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,320
 The Mossland coin.

1027
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
 The egregious fish token.

1028
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,040
 And the AP wine coin.

1029
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,360
 - Get out!

1030
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,200
 - What?

1031
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,040
 - For me.

1032
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,320
 They've minted a coin for me.

1033
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,160
 - It's a crypto coin.

1034
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,120
 I'll explain later.

1035
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,960
 - All right, yes.

1036
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,680
 - Just send me your back details.

1037
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,260
 (upbeat music)

1038
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

1039
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,040
 and that is my fact.

1040
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,560
 My fact this week is that, in theory,

1041
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,840
 you can get a peanut allergy transplant.

1042
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,680
 - Oh, good.

1043
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,960
 - Why would I want that?

1044
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,000
 - You wouldn't be asking for it.

1045
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,280
 This would be an accidental transplant.

1046
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,640
 So there's numerous papers out there.

1047
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,280
 The one that I read was to do with a 31 year old woman.

1048
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,760
 She had liver failure.

1049
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,840
 So she had a liver transplant.

1050
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,560
 And then after the operation,

1051
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,240
 she was kissing her partner

1052
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,880
 and he had just eaten a peanut butter chocolate.

1053
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,800
 And as a result, she rashed up and she said,

1054
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,640
 "That's weird, that's never happened before."

1055
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
 They went to the doctors

1056
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,840
 and they worked out that she now had hypersensitivity

1057
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
 to peanut, hazelnut and pecan.

1058
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,040
 And they believe that that was new from post-transplant.

1059
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,760
 And then there are the multiple examples

1060
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,440
 of people who have been claiming

1061
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,480
 to have had a peanut allergy post-transplant.

1062
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,320
 - That's very cool.

1063
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,160
 - Yeah.

1064
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,520
 - Paying the arse for those people.

1065
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,320
 - Peanut allergies.

1066
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,280
 - Did you say peanuts?

1067
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,840
 - It was definitely, it was either peanuts or peanuts.

1068
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,680
 - Oh, peanuts.

1069
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,120
 Sorry, no, no, no, I still want peanuts.

1070
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,320
 There is a day of the year where in Canada,

1071
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,880
 peanut allergy cases, which trigger anaphylactic shock,

1072
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,480
 rise by 85%.

1073
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,440
 Can you work out what that day of the year is?

1074
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,840
 - When they eat a lot of peanuts,

1075
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,520
 Super Bowl, no, Canada.

1076
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,840
 The World Series, baseball, the hockey.

1077
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,800
 - Hockey, it's not sport.

1078
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,440
 - When's a day when certainly everyone eats a lot more peanuts?

1079
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,600
 - Christmas.

1080
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,240
 - Christmas, it's the Canadian peanut Christmas.

1081
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,960
 - When they all take flights and get them for free.

1082
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,800
 - That's right.

1083
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,640
 - When they go to the cinema,

1084
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,560
 do they all go to the cinema one day of the year?

1085
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,080
 - Canadians only go to the cinema one day a year

1086
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,040
 because it's quite sinful.

1087
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,080
 So they try and limit it.

1088
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,480
 - It's a national peanut day.

1089
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,560
 - What's Charles Schultz, was he Canadian?

1090
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,200
 - Oh, these are such good guesses.

1091
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,040
 Okay.

1092
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,880
 - Is it really obvious?

1093
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,840
 - It's not really obvious.

1094
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,360
 Peanut-based confectionery gets eaten a lot more

1095
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,400
 on one day of the year.

1096
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,240
 - Halloween.

1097
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,080
 - When they do dribble treats.

1098
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,920
 - Halloween, thank you.

1099
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,480
 (laughing)

1100
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,440
 - It's Halloween.

1101
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,200
 You get children going house to house,

1102
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,600
 having a lot of confectionery.

1103
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,160
 Maybe they didn't know they've got a peanut allergy

1104
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,520
 or maybe they are, you know, they're just excited

1105
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,560
 and they have some unfamiliar confectionery

1106
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,400
 and they already knew about it.

1107
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,200
 But yeah, that's 85%.

1108
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,120
 Easter is 60% rice.

1109
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,960
 - Really?

1110
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,040
 - I guess chocolate-containing peanuts.

1111
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,880
 - Yeah.

1112
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,680
 - It's amazing how much it's changed

1113
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,480
 over the last 20 years or so, isn't it?

1114
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,320
 - It's bizarre.

1115
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,720
 - The number of people who are allergic to peanuts

1116
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,160
 just 20 years ago is so much lower than it is today.

1117
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,000
 - Really?

1118
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080
 - So much and no one really knows why.

1119
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,520
 - No, 1995 to 2016, there's been a five-fold increase

1120
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,160
 in the UK in peanut allergies and more in other places.

1121
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,440
 And yeah, as James says, we're not really sure why.

1122
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,720
 It's much more industrialized countries.

1123
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,120
 Could be to do with the fact that we are

1124
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,560
 not getting as many parasites, they think.

1125
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,440
 And I think the immune system uses a similar mechanism

1126
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,000
 to fight parasites as it does to flare up in allergies.

1127
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,680
 - Yeah, we just don't know, but it's rocketing.

1128
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,040
 - It is, and definitely like the more that you live

1129
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,360
 in a city, the more likely you are to have it.

1130
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,200
 - Really?

1131
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,760
 - So seems like it's something to do with not being exposed

1132
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,080
 to natural environments, possibly vitamin D sunlight.

1133
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,360
 Apparently people with a vitamin D deficiency

1134
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,560
 are 11 times more likely to have a peanut allergy.

1135
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,400
 - Really?

1136
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,840
 - But that might not, but that might be just that

1137
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,720
 the two things are related to a third thing.

1138
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,560
 We just don't know.

1139
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,400
 - Yeah.

1140
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,760
 - One way of stopping getting allergies

1141
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,080
 is to desensitize yourself by having small amounts of it,

1142
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,920
 right?

1143
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,320
 This doesn't work in all cases,

1144
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,760
 but it's a very common way of treating them.

1145
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,400
 And for that reason, there's a new kind of toothpaste

1146
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,880
 that's been invented, which has got little tiny, tiny,

1147
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,480
 tiny bits of peanut in it.

1148
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,320
 - Ah, that's brilliant.

1149
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,480
 - And the idea is that you have this toothpaste

1150
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,880
 and it desensitizes your immune system to the allergens.

1151
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,160
 - Nut paste.

1152
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,000
 - Nut paste?

1153
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,240
 - Give your kids nut paste today.

1154
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,480
 - I think we can go back to the branding drawing bar

1155
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,240
 before we start printing the packets.

1156
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,400
 - Ironically, they all just get stuck in your teeth.

1157
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,600
 So then you need to use an actual normal toothpaste

1158
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,840
 to get rid of it, presumably.

1159
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,680
 - Yeah.

1160
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,160
 You can be, of course, allergic to peanuts.

1161
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,000
 - Penis.

1162
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,840
 - Penis, yeah.

1163
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,680
 - Oh.

1164
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,600
 - Post-argasmic illness syndrome

1165
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,320
 is where you get flu-like symptoms,

1166
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,880
 rashes, itching, after sex.

1167
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,040
 But it has been caused, in a few cases,

1168
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,120
 by men being allergic to their own semen.

1169
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,080
 - Their own.

1170
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,200
 - Their own semen.

1171
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,040
 - Yeah.

1172
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,160
 - Oh, no.

1173
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,120
 - There is a cure.

1174
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,960
 Thank God.

1175
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,760
 - What is the...

1176
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,280
 We'll be back to nut paste, basically.

1177
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
 (all laughing)

1178
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,520
 - We are, I'm afraid.

1179
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,360
 - No.

1180
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,520
 - It's multiple subcutaneous injections

1181
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,480
 of the semen in question.

1182
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,280
 - I think I'll just stay all for life,

1183
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
 thank you very much.

1184
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,200
 (all laughing)

1185
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,640
 - Yeah, so you get very, very tiny bits of the semen

1186
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,600
 and you would inject it under the skin

1187
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,160
 and your body would learn to do well.

1188
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,240
 - Not on your toothbrush.

1189
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,080
 - No.

1190
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,520
 (all laughing)

1191
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,120
 - Wow.

1192
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,520
 Scientists get allergic to the thing

1193
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
 they're researching quite frequently

1194
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
 'cause you're exposed to it, day after day.

1195
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,200
 There was a great piece, I think it was the Atlantic,

1196
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,440
 about a scientist called Brian Fry.

1197
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,560
 He studies snake venom and has since become allergic,

1198
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,280
 not to venom, but to snakes in general.

1199
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
 - Really?

1200
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,440
 - Yeah.

1201
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,400
 And apparently there's a huge chance

1202
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,360
 that if you work with something all the time

1203
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,240
 you develop an allergy, 40% of vets,

1204
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,360
 45% of people who work with lab rodents

1205
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,120
 get an allergy to them.

1206
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,920
 There was a leech scientist called Danielle DeCurle

1207
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
 who uses herself as bait

1208
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,080
 when she's trying to catch leeches out in the field.

1209
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,960
 You know, she just walks through a swamp and gets them.

1210
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,360
 She now, after a year or two, couldn't do it anymore

1211
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,400
 and her hands started swearing up massively

1212
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,360
 if she was trying to feed a leech in the lab on her blood

1213
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,000
 and she had to feed them pig blood instead.

1214
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,960
 - That's weird though, isn't it?

1215
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,920
 Because obviously you're supposed to sensitize yourself

1216
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,160
 up until a certain point.

1217
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,480
 But maybe you can be overexposed.

1218
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,680
 Like if I'm eating peanut butter on a daily basis

1219
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,240
 and a lot, does that mean I eventually might then become

1220
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,080
 a leech scientist?

1221
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,000
 - I read the article and it said 25 to 60% of people

1222
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,120
 who work with insects become allergic to them.

1223
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,640
 So people who work with bees might come out in hives.

1224
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,480
 - Right.

1225
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,800
 - Hey, lovely.

1226
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,480
 - Now I think about it, people keep telling me

1227
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,200
 'cause I love milk and I drink milk a lot

1228
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,440
 that I will become allergic to milk

1229
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,840
 by the amount of milk that I drink.

1230
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,280
 - I don't listen to those people.

1231
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,160
 - You know who told me it was Ash Garner.

1232
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,240
 - Oh, did he?

1233
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
 - Who did our theme tune for anybody who doesn't know

1234
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,120
 who stopped drinking milk because he thinks

1235
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,680
 he became allergic from drinking so much as a kid.

1236
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,760
 - I think I'm right in saying that.

1237
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,640
 - There's an interesting thing where people who think

1238
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,640
 they are allergic to things in double blind tests,

1239
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,880
 quite a high percentage of people turn out not to be

1240
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,000
 allergic to them after all.

1241
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
 - Right.

1242
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,400
 Just on the quickly jumping back to allergy transplants

1243
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,720
 and just the idea of things being transplanted

1244
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,360
 when you take in a body part from a donor.

1245
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,000
 I read an article from a lady who said

1246
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,680
 that her personality changed after a kidney transplant

1247
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,040
 where instead of reading celebrity trash

1248
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,520
 and watching celebrity trash,

1249
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,360
 she started reading Jane Austen.

1250
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,360
 And that was purely off the back from the kidney.

1251
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,000
 She said she got a brain-y kidney.

1252
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 - She said there's a pseudoscience theory,

1253
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,480
 which is the idea that you inherit traits of a person

1254
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,120
 that you might take something off.

1255
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,680
 And there's so many exact,

1256
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,040
 there's a guy called Dr. Hagen who's an ER doctor

1257
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,120
 who claims that he inherited a love of avocados

1258
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,680
 and barbecues after he got a transplant.

1259
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,800
 - I don't know maybe if your digestive system

1260
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,200
 responds to certain food stuff seems more likely

1261
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,360
 than liking trash magazines compared to Jane Austen.

1262
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,200
 - Yeah.

1263
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,040
 - To be fair to the ER doctor.

1264
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,880
 - Yeah, fair enough.

1265
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,080
 He got in contact with the family

1266
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,640
 because it was like a murder trial that she'd been killed in.

1267
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,480
 He went to the trial and the family took him in

1268
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,680
 and they did prayers together.

1269
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,480
 And then he went back to their house

1270
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,640
 and the sentence reads,

1271
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
 "He learned she loved avocados and barbecues."

1272
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,560
 - Oh, and there's such unusual things that people like

1273
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,520
 they could only possibly have come from this ridiculous idea.

1274
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,760
 - Well, he never used to cry during movies as well.

1275
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
 As a surgeon, you're trained not to cry.

1276
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,760
 And then after surgery, he kept crying and kept crying.

1277
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,280
 And as well as learning that this lady

1278
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,200
 loved avocados and barbecues,

1279
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,120
 she was also an emotionally passionate woman.

1280
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,520
 But there's a doctor who believes that

1281
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,600
 as a patient's about to go into surgery

1282
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,000
 to receive the transplant,

1283
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,880
 a few bit of details might come out

1284
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,280
 about the person they're getting the transplant from.

1285
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,440
 And they embed that in a really emotional moment

1286
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,680
 before they're about to go down.

1287
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,800
 And it goes into their psyche

1288
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,720
 rather than it being a physical transplant.

1289
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,840
 - Imagine, by the way, the kidney that you're receiving

1290
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,800
 comes from someone who loved avocado.

1291
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,920
 Okay, go on down.

1292
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,600
 (laughing)

1293
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,800
 There is a lot that we obviously don't know at all.

1294
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
 Like we've talked about fecal transplants before.

1295
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,640
 - Oh yeah.

1296
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,160
 - And how you can actually transplant unexpected things

1297
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,640
 in them, it is thought.

1298
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,960
 And then we're in very early days of fecal transplant.

1299
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,480
 - What changes with my personality

1300
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
 if I get someone else's poo in me?

1301
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,320
 - Depends who's poo you get.

1302
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,840
 Which one of our poo do you want?

1303
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,520
 And then I'll tell you what you'll get.

1304
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,600
 (laughing)

1305
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,120
 We'll save that for our therapy session after the show again.

1306
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,000
 - Now you kind of think Andy mentioned on the show

1307
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,680
 before that a mother who received a fecal transplant

1308
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,720
 from her daughter suddenly became obese.

1309
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,920
 And her daughter was obese.

1310
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,760
 And 'cause we really don't know--

1311
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,880
 - Okay, well, that makes sense.

1312
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,040
 'Cause it could be the microbes causing that, right?

1313
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,960
 - That's right.

1314
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,040
 There was someone else who received a fecal transplant

1315
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,960
 who had had alopecia and not had any hair

1316
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,520
 since there were six who suddenly grew hair again.

1317
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,440
 And I suppose this is all micro climate.

1318
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,200
 There's a lot still to learn about it

1319
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,240
 and who knows what little things it's affecting.

1320
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,080
 - Yeah, I buy it.

1321
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,000
 I buy it a lot.

1322
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,960
 Okay, here's a way.

1323
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
 If you are a parent and you have a baby who has a dummy,

1324
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,120
 you can protect them against allergies.

1325
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,200
 How do you do it?

1326
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,960
 - Never let them take the dummy out

1327
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,600
 so no food could get into their mouth.

1328
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,440
 - That's right.

1329
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,280
 That's right.

1330
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,000
 Can anyone think of a second method?

1331
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,200
 (laughing)

1332
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,040
 - I know the answers to this

1333
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,840
 'cause I've accidentally been doing it all my three kids.

1334
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,160
 - I've seen you doing it as well.

1335
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,200
 - Oh, well, that must be you sucking on the dummy as well?

1336
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,040
 - Yeah.

1337
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,880
 - Is it really?

1338
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,720
 - Yeah.

1339
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,320
 - I didn't like to admit it, but it's, no, it's.

1340
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,160
 (laughing)

1341
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,000
 - Oh my God.

1342
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,840
 - Oh my God, Dan.

1343
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,080
 - For the lesson that Dan has just got a dummy

1344
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,440
 out of his pocket and popped it in.

1345
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,080
 - We assume it came out of his pocket.

1346
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,440
 We can see where it came from.

1347
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,680
 - It certainly came from below the table.

1348
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,960
 That's incredibly, Dan, wow.

1349
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
 - That's really disturbing.

1350
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,560
 It's weird how disturbing that is to see.

1351
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,760
 - Well, I didn't know I had it in my pocket

1352
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,920
 until I was coming in this morning

1353
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,840
 and I felt it and I was like, oh, I've got kids dummy.

1354
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
 - What's he got of yours?

1355
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,160
 (laughing)

1356
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,560
 - Where's my research notes?

1357
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,800
 (laughing)

1358
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,480
 (laughing)

1359
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,760
 - That one explains so much.

1360
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,120
 (laughing)

1361
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,700
 (upbeat music)

1362
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,520
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1363
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,060
 and that is Anna.

1364
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,560
 - My fact this week is that the largest parasite

1365
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,280
 in the world is a Christmas tree.

1366
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,120
 - Feels a bit political.

1367
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,520
 Feels like you're saying Christmas is rubbish.

1368
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,360
 - Okay.

1369
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,280
 - It's like it's feeding on ordinary families,

1370
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,600
 trying to make them spend the money on Christmas.

1371
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,040
 - Basically, it's capitalism and capitalism

1372
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,680
 is a parasite on the working-

1373
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,520
 - Good point.

1374
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,000
 Christianity actually organized religion of any form

1375
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,040
 is a parasite on our society.

1376
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,880
 - Yeah, man.

1377
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,840
 - All right, put down your joints.

1378
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,080
 (laughing)

1379
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,440
 - Put down that old wacky backie.

1380
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,200
 (laughing)

1381
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,560
 - Welcome to the dad car.

1382
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,160
 (laughing)

1383
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,520
 - This is a different kind of Christmas tree

1384
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,480
 to what you might be thinking.

1385
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,520
 It's the Australian Christmas tree

1386
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,080
 and the Australian Christmas tree is different

1387
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,800
 to our British Christmas trees.

1388
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,880
 - Upside down.

1389
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,720
 (laughing)

1390
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,640
 - It's not upside down.

1391
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,960
 It's actually very beautiful.

1392
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,040
 It's also known as the--

1393
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,880
 - All the baubles are made of cork.

1394
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,720
 Sorry.

1395
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,240
 (laughing)

1396
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,520
 - They're not used as Christmas trees.

1397
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,640
 We should add in Australia.

1398
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,160
 We use the classic Christmas tree in Australia.

1399
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,200
 - Yep, you do, you Australians are saying

1400
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,560
 do use the classic Christmas tree.

1401
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,720
 These are known as mungi or mood jar trees as well

1402
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,320
 but they get called the Australian Christmas tree

1403
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,080
 because they flower in December

1404
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,480
 and they're endemic to Noongar County

1405
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,560
 in Western Australia

1406
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,640
 and they're really beautiful actually

1407
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,520
 and they grow in very barren landscape

1408
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,600
 and they're bright yellow flowers when they flower

1409
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,240
 so they're like fires all over the desert

1410
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,920
 but they are also parasites and it's so amazing.

1411
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,120
 So their roots can steal from other plants

1412
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,240
 that are up to 110 meters away

1413
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,360
 by slithering under the ground to this other plant

1414
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,640
 and then the plant root wraps around the other plant's root

1415
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,360
 and then injects a spike into it

1416
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
 and can just suck out all their nutrients.

1417
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,160
 - It's extraordinary. - It's amazing.

1418
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,000
 - It's so cool.

1419
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,280
 - It's zombie stuff. - It's actually,

1420
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,920
 it's tipped me over into believing in plant sentience now

1421
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,760
 because you're always so skeptical about that.

1422
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,120
 - I've been on a fence, I've been on the line

1423
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,720
 but this is just extraordinary what it does.

1424
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,360
 The thing that tipped me over is that

1425
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,000
 it's a beautiful looking tree.

1426
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,520
 So even when they are cutting down areas

1427
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,440
 where this tree grows,

1428
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,120
 they'll cut everything down but this hot tree

1429
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,440
 that just looks so cool

1430
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,080
 and then it feeds off the grass.

1431
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,320
 That's basically what it is.

1432
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,840
 It's like, that's a sexy tree.

1433
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,880
 We're keeping that up.

1434
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,080
 It's evolved to be, I assume,

1435
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,160
 a good looking tree to the human eye.

1436
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,000
 - No.

1437
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,120
 (laughing)

1438
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,960
 - You assume wrong.

1439
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,800
 - But it is amazing.

1440
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,480
 - It's striking what it does.

1441
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,240
 It's pretty spooky stuff if you don't mind me saying so.

1442
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,560
 (laughing)

1443
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,520
 It's so aggressive, it's yet another bit of evidence

1444
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,040
 of like the Australian version of everything

1445
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,480
 is much more lethal than the non-Australian version.

1446
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,000
 So it'll attack power cables.

1447
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,960
 It can cut, slice through power cables

1448
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,960
 because it's so powerful, this wraparound organ it has.

1449
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,440
 Sometimes I read it steals juice from its own roots.

1450
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,280
 - Yes.

1451
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,120
 - It's wild.

1452
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,960
 - That's embarrassing.

1453
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,800
 - That was a big one.

1454
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,360
 - What it's trying to do is get the juice

1455
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,920
 from the power cable because it thinks that's a root.

1456
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,760
 - Yeah.

1457
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,600
 - But actually it's just--

1458
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,920
 - It's not just trying to contact its friends

1459
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,640
 on the phone on the other side of Australia.

1460
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,480
 - Well maybe it would be trying to contact aliens

1461
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,200
 because there was one time there was a space tracking station

1462
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,320
 in Western Australia, which was connected

1463
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,040
 by underground cables and it got into those as well.

1464
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,880
 - Wow.

1465
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,720
 - Really?

1466
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,880
 - Yeah.

1467
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,200
 - Getting it from its own roots is an accident as well.

1468
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,040
 - It is an accident.

1469
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,160
 - You just find something else.

1470
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,400
 - So I don't know if you guys had or the listener has

1471
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,600
 but I'd never heard of parasitic plants before

1472
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,240
 as in I didn't really recognize

1473
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,560
 that this relies entirely on stealing other juices

1474
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,400
 from other places.

1475
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,560
 - I suppose the most famous one is mistletoe.

1476
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,240
 Of which this is a type of mistletoe, isn't it?

1477
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

1478
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,720
 - So yeah, mistletoe famously just grows on other trees.

1479
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,560
 - It grows on other trees.

1480
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,200
 Photosynthesis is not a thing for it.

1481
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,560
 So it just relies entirely on it.

1482
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,080
 But just the idea that this needs other living things

1483
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,840
 to live is extraordinary.

1484
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,160
 - It kind of, it can expose your year nine biology

1485
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,840
 when you learn about how plants survive.

1486
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,640
 When actually there are thousands of plants

1487
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,960
 that aren't doing any of that shit.

1488
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,560
 They're not bothering with all this complicated

1489
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,280
 chemical equation with their leaves.

1490
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,680
 They just jab into other plants.

1491
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,520
 - Yeah.

1492
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,360
 - I think there are 4,000 species.

1493
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,720
 - Have you guys heard of Hydenora Africana?

1494
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,560
 - No.

1495
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,080
 - According to one website I read and I quote,

1496
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,080
 "No plant looks more like a labia than the Hydenora Africana.

1497
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,080
 "This flower not only has teeth-like traps to lure insects

1498
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,160
 "to leaving or picking up their pollen,

1499
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,440
 "but emits a feces-like sense to attract dung beetles."

1500
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,280
 - Gosh.

1501
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,520
 - I just love that sentence.

1502
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,080
 "Nothing looks more like a labia

1503
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,920
 "and it has teeth that smells like feces."

1504
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,680
 - That's quite, that is a good riddle to ask.

1505
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,520
 - But yeah, this one sort of likes to attract dung beetles

1506
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,320
 with its smell and a lot of those ones

1507
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,640
 that are like really, really smelly plants,

1508
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,120
 they are also parasitic.

1509
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,920
 - The dodder is amazing as well.

1510
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,920
 Did you guys read about that one?

1511
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,760
 - Yeah.

1512
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,600
 - That one's extraordinary.

1513
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,520
 - It's a bit unstable on its feet, isn't it?

1514
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,240
 But it's pretty extraordinary.

1515
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,560
 - Yeah, so this is a plant which is,

1516
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,400
 it's got no roots or leaves and it's sort of yellowy looking.

1517
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,920
 It sort of grows on other plants

1518
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,880
 and it's only got a lifespan of five to 10 days

1519
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,520
 without a host, right?

1520
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,080
 So it needs to find a host in that time and it goes--

1521
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,760
 - Which is when the seed gets dispersed.

1522
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,160
 - Yeah, sorry, when the seed gets dispersed

1523
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,320
 and it can sense where the closest best host is

1524
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,040
 through the air, which is mad.

1525
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,520
 And then goes that way.

1526
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,360
 - Yeah, that I can see when--

1527
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,200
 - It's really sinister.

1528
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,040
 - Sentience!

1529
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
 - So sinister, Sedona.

1530
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,480
 - No, it is 'cause we don't understand

1531
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,880
 a lot of how they do this, so it is extraordinary.

1532
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,720
 - It is amazing.

1533
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,680
 - And it's weird how pretty so many of them are.

1534
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,760
 It's like if you came out--

1535
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,200
 - Almost like they evolved just so that humans

1536
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,040
 would like this.

1537
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,880
 - Thank you, James.

1538
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,640
 - I love them.

1539
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,640
 There's one which lives entirely inside the stems of plants

1540
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,480
 and this is a genus, pylostyles.

1541
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,680
 Nicely described in 1948 by Australia's government

1542
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,840
 botanist who was called Charles Gardner.

1543
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,360
 - Right, very nice.

1544
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,480
 - And it's so pretty, so it just lives entirely inside a stem.

1545
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,360
 You don't notice there, it's just little threads.

1546
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,480
 And then plops out for about a week of the year.

1547
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,160
 Again, like the one Dan described.

1548
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,320
 And it's so pretty and these white flowers come out

1549
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,760
 all over the stem of a plant.

1550
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,080
 So you'd think, gosh, this plant's looking so pretty

1551
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,480
 and actually it's diseased.

1552
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,600
 - It's another plant.

1553
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,800
 - It's another plant.

1554
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,040
 - It's so weird, I love it.

1555
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,520
 Did you guys hear about the logical pine dwarf mistletoe?

1556
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,640
 This is another, so this is a kind of mistletoe.

1557
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,360
 Most mistletoe seeds are dispersed,

1558
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,400
 almost kinds of mistletoe, they're dispersed by birds.

1559
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,080
 Birds eat the berries and then they fly somewhere else

1560
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,560
 and then they poo out the seeds

1561
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,800
 and the seeds have a new environment to grow in.

1562
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,480
 Not the lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe.

1563
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,400
 It spreads by explosions.

1564
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,920
 - Oh.

1565
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,160
 - Basically the seed, each fruit has a single seed inside it

1566
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,120
 which is covered in this very, very sticky stuff.

1567
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,320
 And then as the fruit matures,

1568
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,360
 the pressure builds and builds and builds inside it.

1569
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,000
 And then eventually it just goes, blah.

1570
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,240
 - I've seen these exploding cucumbers in Greece.

1571
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,160
 - Yeah.

1572
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,800
 - So it was growing almost like a weed and some steps,

1573
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,680
 but I noticed it and it looks like a tiny little gherkin.

1574
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,920
 And then if you prod it enough,

1575
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,360
 it just explodes and the seeds go everywhere.

1576
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,280
 And they're really cool, but they don't go that far.

1577
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,000
 - But then it apologizes and says,

1578
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,800
 sorry, that's never happened before for me.

1579
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:46,560
 - Do you know why mistletoe seeds are sticky?

1580
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,480
 Because they are when they're dispersed.

1581
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,320
 - No, what is it?

1582
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,680
 - Partly it's because they have to grow from up a tree,

1583
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,560
 which is kind of cool anyway, so to stick to the tree.

1584
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,080
 But as you say, they're dispersed by birds,

1585
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,000
 pooing them out and then wiping them on trees.

1586
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,200
 So what it requires is for the bird to poo,

1587
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,080
 but this annoying sticky seed gets stuck to its anus.

1588
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,080
 And so this bird's going,

1589
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,400
 I've got this seed on my bum,

1590
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,200
 I just need to wipe it on something.

1591
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,040
 And they wipe their bums on the tree branches.

1592
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,240
 And that's what sticks into it.

1593
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,280
 - And also because they've wiped their bums on the trees

1594
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,680
 and their bums had poo on them,

1595
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,800
 then they have their own fertilizer.

1596
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,640
 - Lovely.

1597
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,880
 - So it's like the perf, if you're a seed,

1598
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,440
 you know, you're being flown to the top of a tree

1599
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,000
 and you're being put exactly where you want

1600
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,760
 with a load of fertilizer, it's a dream.

1601
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,000
 - So I just said, when you said that, I went, clever.

1602
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,160
 But I realized that's obviously humanizing it.

1603
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,000
 Like, what is it?

1604
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,840
 What is that?

1605
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,660
 If it's not clever, what is it?

1606
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,500
 - Just the evolution is amazing.

1607
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,340
 - It's just what it is.

1608
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,760
 It's just a random thing.

1609
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,920
 - It's just over millions and millions of years.

1610
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,640
 Maybe even before humans existed,

1611
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,200
 different things have been tried out.

1612
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,040
 And this is a lot of work.

1613
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,920
 - I don't think we invented sentience.

1614
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,240
 I've not played with humans for a long time.

1615
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,000
 - Is Ivy parasitic?

1616
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,280
 - No, that just, that just grows on stuff.

1617
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,880
 - If it just grows on something,

1618
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,960
 it's not technically a parasite.

1619
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,840
 It has to be stealing its resources like it's sad.

1620
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,680
 - So it doesn't steal resources.

1621
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,960
 - It might not be particularly good for the thing

1622
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,800
 that's growing on, but it's not parasitic.

1623
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,160
 - Yeah, it could weaken a tree and make it fall and so on.

1624
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,080
 Yeah, but okay.

1625
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,040
 - Do you know what is, which makes people really angry,

1626
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,280
 is orchids.

1627
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,120
 - A parasitic.

1628
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,120
 - In fact, all orchids are parasitic.

1629
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,960
 - No.

1630
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,800
 - Another beauty.

1631
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,720
 - But another beaut.

1632
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,400
 But this is something that is vigorously denied

1633
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,320
 by the American Orchid Society.

1634
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,520
 (laughing)

1635
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,600
 Again, it's so weird.

1636
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,920
 - That's brilliant.

1637
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,480
 - They're a slightly different kind of parasite.

1638
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,720
 They parasitize mycorrhizal fungi,

1639
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,320
 which are those threads underground,

1640
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,080
 those fungal threads underground.

1641
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,400
 So all orchid seeds start off by parasitizing the fungi

1642
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,920
 'cause they're not born with the resources

1643
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,800
 to grow properly, so they steal from this fungi at first.

1644
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,880
 Many of them do it for their whole lives.

1645
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,400
 So the parasites, and yet on the FAQs page

1646
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,680
 of the American Orchid Society,

1647
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,880
 there's a question, are orchids parasites?

1648
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,120
 - No, no, they're not.

1649
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,960
 Go away.

1650
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,280
 Stop asking questions.

1651
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,440
 - It is absolutely not of the approximately

1652
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,280
 20,000 species of orchid.

1653
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,440
 Not one is parasitic.

1654
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,840
 - So how are they, how are they claiming that?

1655
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,320
 Are they claiming that because it's hosted by the fungus

1656
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,160
 that it's different to being hosted by a--

1657
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,080
 - I think that's the assumption.

1658
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,440
 They don't address much like hearing

1659
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,080
 a politician interviewed on the Today program.

1660
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,160
 They're really very much just repeating this one point.

1661
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,800
 - I don't think anyone wants to talk about parasites.

1662
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,440
 No, people want to hear about the good work

1663
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,160
 that I'm doing for the people of the underground.

1664
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,280
 - Exactly.

1665
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,680
 - I think I've been buried down on sentient plants

1666
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,360
 throughout this, but I do think fungi are evil.

1667
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,240
 (laughing)

1668
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,920
 - Oh yeah, that's a good point.

1669
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,920
 - So there is a mushroom called fusarium xyrophylum.

1670
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,880
 This is amazing.

1671
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,000
 So it will find a plant called the xyros plant,

1672
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,760
 and it will sterilize it so it can't make flowers.

1673
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,320
 But it will then make its own flowers

1674
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,400
 that look exactly like the normal ones,

1675
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,280
 but they're made out of mushroom.

1676
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,120
 - Wow. - Wow.

1677
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,960
 - That's amazing.

1678
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,440
 - Oh my God, like a tofu alternative.

1679
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,280
 (laughing)

1680
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,120
 - Exactly like that.

1681
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,360
 - Plant replacement food.

1682
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,320
 - So you might think you're getting a nice bunch

1683
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,880
 from Interflora, but actually all those roses

1684
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,920
 and lilies and whatever, they're all actually mushrooms.

1685
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,280
 - That reminds me of the show, is it cake?

1686
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,120
 - Yeah.

1687
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,440
 (laughing)

1688
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,640
 - There should be a show called, is it mushroom?

1689
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,800
 - It looks like a sofa.

1690
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,640
 (laughing)

1691
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,480
 - It's a mushroom.

1692
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,320
 - And then the final episode,

1693
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,800
 it turns out the host is a mushroom.

1694
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,640
 - Yeah.

1695
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,240
 (laughing)

1696
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,160
 - It's a format.

1697
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,520
 - You might think I'm the host,

1698
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,280
 but in fact, I'm a parasite.

1699
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,040
 (laughing)

1700
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,880
 - That's so funny.

1701
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,960
 I read just related to that.

1702
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,320
 This 2024 Bolton, where I'm from in Greater Manchester,

1703
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,080
 has been named the town of culture for Greater Manchester.

1704
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,960
 But also this week, it was named as the moldiest town

1705
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,640
 in the whole of the UK.

1706
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,280
 And it just feels like they got the wrong meaning

1707
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,440
 of the word culture.

1708
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,680
 (laughing)

1709
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,260
 (upbeat music)

1710
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,880
 - Okay, that's it.

1711
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,880
 That is all of our facts.

1712
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,280

1727
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,680
 We've got all of our previous episodes up there.

1728
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,200
 We have the doors to the secret club known as Club Fish.

1729
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,000
 We put lots of bonus material up there.

1730
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,040
 It's a really fun place.

1731
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,640
 There's a discord where all the listeners

1732
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,320
 get to chat to each other.

1733
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,200
 It's really worth checking out, do that now.

1734
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,880
 And as you will know, we are back on the road

1735
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,360
 with our new tour, Thunder Nerds.

1736
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,440
 We are gonna be coming to a bunch of cities and towns

1737
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,600
 around the UK, and then we're going down

1738
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,400
 under to Australia and New Zealand,

1739
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,520
 get tickets now before it sells out,

1740
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,400
 or otherwise just come back here next week.

1741
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,640
 We'll be here with another episode,

1742
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,520
 and we'll see you then.

1743
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,360
 Goodbye.

1744
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,940
 (upbeat music)

1745
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,520
 (upbeat music)

1746
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,100
 (upbeat music)

1747
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,680
 (upbeat music)

1748
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,260
 (upbeat music)
