1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
 "Hey everybody, Dan and Andy here and we have two very exciting big announcements before

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,060
 this week's show starts."

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,700
 "That's right, the first one is that we are joined by a very special guest this week and

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,900
 that is the incredible Neil Gaiman."

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,620
 "Yes, Neil Gaiman has done so much stuff, so he's written brilliant novels, he's written

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,860
 for the screen, Neverwhere, American Gods, Stardust, he covered Good Omens with Terry

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,380
 Pratchett, he's done it all."

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,380
 "That's right, and it's not even just the books, you know, the TV work as well, the

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,700
 Sandman was converted into a show, Doctor Who, his episodes are Doctor Who, some of the best

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,420
 episodes of the modern era and then of course Good Omens comes to Amazon Prime and then

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,660
 they do a second series.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,580
 Despite the fact that Terry Pratchett has passed away, I was quite nervous, it comes

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,500
 out it is brilliant."

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,120
 So the guy just continues to deliver extraordinary goods, I've binged it in one go by the way,

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,580
 I don't know if you've seen it, Andy, it's incredible.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,140
 And so yeah, we're very excited because what was he going to talk about, this mystical man,

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,780
 was it going to be ghosts, was it going to be graveyards, was it going to be the history

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,060
 of Norse gods, what was it going to be, Andy, what was it, bagels, bagels, the man loves

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,500
 bagels and he needed to tell us about it, so that's why it's so exciting because Neil

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,420
 is a thunder nerd just like us.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,980
 Anyway, that's announcement one, announcement number two, Andy.

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,460
 The other huge announcement we've got is that we are going to be doing a live show really

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,780
 soon, we're going to be at the London Podcast Festival on the 14th of September this year,

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,700
 now it's sold out in the room but there are still streaming tickets available and they're

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,660
 available for a few days after the show so if you buy a ticket you can watch it at your

26
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,700
 convenience and there is a really good reason to buy a streaming ticket.

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,220
 In fact, there are two reasons, the first reason is that it's going to be our 500th

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,020
 show, we've moved Roman numerals, but the last one we had was C, now we're doing D,

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
 this is amazing.

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,860
 So that's the first big reason, the second big reason is that we have a special guest.

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,140
 Now in all the months that we've been having special guests since Santa went on maternity

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,220
 leave, our guests have been great but there's one guest who we've been really excited to

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,740
 get and for this show, show 500, our special guest is Anna Tyshinski.

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,380
 Yes, she's back, we're so excited, Anna will be joining us live on stage so if you want

35
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,980
 to be part of that party as we're surrounded in giant D balloons, I'm so regretting letting

36
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:17,660
 Andy organise the balloons now, you can do that by simply heading to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,520
 you'll find a link to the live stream tickets for the London Podcast Festival, that's where

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,620
 we'll be, if you're a fish accordion, you can chat about it online with everyone else

39
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,260
 as it goes out streaming live and let's make this into a massive party and a proper return

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,460
 for Anna Tyshinski.

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
 Yeah.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,540
 No such thing as a fish.com/live, get your tickets now, that's it from us on with the

43
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
 show.

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,100
 On with Mr. Gaiman and his bagels.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:03:01,120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,880
 to you this week from four undisclosed locations around the globe.

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,380
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

48
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,000
 and Neil Gaiman and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,360
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,360
 Starting with fact number one and that is Neil.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,200
 My fact is that the bagel in the form that we know it only ever came to exist through

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,920
 Polish anti-Semitism, now I could have gone for something much more sort of easy to chat

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,540
 about with bagels like the fact that every year over 2,000 people are taken to hospital

54
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,580
 in America alone with bagel related injuries.

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,460
 Neil I'm going to pause you there, I want to know what a bagel really is and I cannot

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,380
 think of anything less likely to injure me than a bagel and I feel like I would have

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,420
 to be misusing a bagel in some terrible way in order that I would need to go to A&E with

58
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,420
 it.

59
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,100
 I can tell you Addy it's cutting them open, it's finger cuts and quite often people try

60
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,000
 and cut them while they're still frozen.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,320
 I do that sometimes, I do that, I try and crack them.

62
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,560
 There was a report 2008, bagel based injuries were the fifth most common injury by knife

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
 reported to hospitals.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,160
 I read that Dan but did you see one of the other four web?

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 What were they?

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,000
 Okay so number one was chicken, chicken based cutting would get you in, number two and I

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,060
 don't know if these are in the right order but the other three are potatoes, apples and

68
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,980
 onions and then you get the bagel.

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,300
 Cheese comes afterwards, cheese is very safe to cut.

70
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,540
 In America though they don't really, they just have to take it out of the plastic sheet

71
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
 don't they?

72
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,540
 Oh yeah, ouch.

73
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,060
 There we go, a bit of sledging for our American listeners about the quality of your cheese.

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
 Nice try.

75
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,660
 But apparently it's so prominent that you would have these bagel based cuts that someone

76
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,180
 went in and said the nurse looked at the cut and went were you cutting a bagel?

77
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,320
 Because the horizontal cut of the laying down of the bagel would be similar to the cut.

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,400
 These are all way more wholesome than my interpretation of what you would end up in hospital with a

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
 bagel for.

80
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
 So that's good.

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
 So good.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 So sorry.

83
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 Medieval Polish anti-semitism.

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 Let's get on to the real.

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,520
 So medieval Polish anti-semitism because the initial way that a bagel was made is it was

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:34,420
 boiled and there were laws enacted in Poland that forbade Jews from touching bread, baking

87
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,500
 bread in particular.

88
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,220
 So when forbidden to bake bread, they made their bread into essentially rings and started

89
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,220
 boiling them and that was where our bagel begins.

90
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,380
 I got heavily into bagel making during lockdown in the way that one does.

91
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:59,000
 I had my little pot of sourdough fermenting away in the sideboard and three times a week

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,520
 I would make my bagels and just started getting into why you boil them.

93
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
 Okay.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,760
 Drop them in boiling water and then they rise.

95
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,680
 They float to the top and then and only then do you slam them into the oven and I'm assuming

96
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,660
 those original bagels were not even ovened.

97
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,860
 I know that there were various sort of laws being enacted and lifted.

98
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:30,980
 At one point there was a very nice Polish princelain Boleslaw in 1264 who actually pronounced

99
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:37,460
 a law saying Jews may freely buy and sell and touch bread like Christians, which was

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,060
 incredibly kind of him.

101
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,260
 I think, I mean, when he says like Christians, I imagine there are still some restrictions

102
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,340
 on Christians just touching all the bread they like.

103
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,000
 I mean, if I was running a bakery, I would not, I would not want people, no matter what

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
 their creed or denomination to come in and just touch the stuff.

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 Touch the bread.

106
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 Yeah.

107
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,580
 I think their theories were like, well, the few various theories that are part of Cross,

108
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,760
 but like one of them is that obviously bread was used for communion by the Catholics.

109
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,120
 And so there was a worry that if the Jewish people were touching the bread, they might

110
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,460
 touch communion bread.

111
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,520
 There was also at one stage, the idea was that Jewish people were poisoning bread.

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,620
 It was basically the anti-semitism of, you know, the Jewish people are trying to kill

113
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,700
 us and they're going to do it through our bread.

114
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
 You know what I mean?

115
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,180
 So, and the boiling could have been to show that it wasn't poisoned.

116
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,860
 You know, if you boil something, then that shows that there's no poison in there.

117
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,860
 So there's one, that's one theory as to why they're boiled.

118
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
 Right.

119
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,860
 That's so interesting.

120
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,740
 Did you guys hear about the Begel Baker's local 338?

121
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
 No.

122
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,820
 It sounds like a chat line actually, but it's not.

123
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:47,800
 It's the, they were the group of bakers in New York in the early 20th century and they

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 were all Jewish.

125
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,520
 And if you wanted to get in, you had to be able to roll 832 bagels in an hour.

126
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,080
 That was the criteria on for entry.

127
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 That's a lot.

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
 I know.

129
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
 They all had this special bagel muscle on the outside of their elbows, like just pointing

130
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
 to it on the screen.

131
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,320
 You can see mine is not very well developed, but it's like here.

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
 So it's just above your elbow?

133
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,160
 Oh, maybe just below actually.

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
 Right.

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,760
 I think it's the one that's the same as if you opened a lot of bottles of wine.

136
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,220
 You get an incredibly strong muscle there.

137
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,220
 Don't you really?

138
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,220
 Mine is tiny.

139
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,780
 You have a person who does that for you, Andy, don't you?

140
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,780
 Yeah.

141
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,780
 I've got an incredibly strong shouting at the butler muscle, but not the, um, no.

142
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,340
 And so they're like, they were, they were like crazy unionized.

143
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,700
 You know, they had a really good careers, the great pay, great benefits.

144
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,140
 You could take home 24 free bagels every day, every individual baker.

145
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
 So you're laughing.

146
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,180
 And if they didn't get good contracts, they would go on strike and the city would have

147
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,140
 a terrible bagel drought.

148
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,800
 And then sadly, bagels started to be machine made and, um, they, they all bought the drops.

149
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,400
 So when did they actually come up with machine making bagels?

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,960
 I think it was the fifties.

151
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
 Yeah.

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
 It was the late fifties.

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
 Yeah.

154
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,080
 It was a guy called Daniel Thompson, wasn't it?

155
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:02,040
 And he came up with what he called an apparatus for making a tauroid, but he did say in his

156
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,920
 patent that it was specifically for bagels because people had tried to make bagels using

157
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,760
 donut machines, but the dough was too, too thick so it wouldn't work on the donut machine.

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,580
 So this was an improvement.

159
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,700
 And the one other thing that Daniel Thompson invented, this is so random, he invented the

160
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,940
 first wheeled folding ping pong table.

161
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,580
 So what two things to give the world, like automatic bagels and the folding ping pong

162
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
 table?

163
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,220
 What would you headline with on the headstone?

164
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
 I'm not sure.

165
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,380
 Probably, probably the automatic bagel.

166
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
 I think so.

167
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
 Yeah.

168
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,420
 I'd go with a bagel because it's changed more light.

169
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,040
 So am I right in saying that a common filling for bagels is something called cream cheese

170
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
 and lox?

171
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
 Most common.

172
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
 Has anyone heard that?

173
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
 Yeah.

174
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
 You are absolutely.

175
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
 What's lox?

176
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
 Smoke salmon.

177
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
 Yeah, it's smoke salmon.

178
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
 Yeah.

179
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
 Yeah.

180
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
 The really interesting thing about this is that the word lox hasn't changed in sound

181
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,840
 or meaning for 8,000 years.

182
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
 Wow.

183
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,200
 And in the English language, we think it's the oldest word that if you got in a time

184
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,680
 machine and you went back 8,000 years, they wouldn't understand anything that you said

185
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,380
 apart from if you asked for some lox on your bagels might not have existed then, but if

186
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,860
 you asked for some lox, they would know what you mean.

187
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
 Isn't that amazing?

188
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
 That is amazing.

189
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,640
 And it's a word that they use to kind of prove Proto Indo European, you know, this old language

190
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,040
 that kind of spread out and all the different European and West Asian languages come from.

191
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,580
 They worked that out by using this word lox because it comes in all Germanic, in all sorts

192
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
 of different languages.

193
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,580
 That's so cool.

194
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
 This is bizarre.

195
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,720
 I have a link to Proto Indo European and bagels that is not the lox thing here, because

196
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,120
 I was looking up where the word bagel comes from.

197
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,480
 And bagel comes from a Proto Indo European root, which is "bleeg", B-H-E-U-G, and it

198
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 means to bend.

199
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:59,320
 So a bagel is bent into a circle, so there, and "bleeg" also features in bow, you know,

200
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,080
 when you add the verb to bow, it features in bow, like bow and arrow, it features in

201
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,680
 bow, like the bow of a ship, also bent, elbow, same, yeah.

202
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,660
 And "buxom" also is the other word that derives gradually from "bleeg".

203
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,480
 So when you've got bagel's elbow, you're doubling up on the bow in the description.

204
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 Oh, that's lovely.

205
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:26,960
 I love the idea that it's 8,000 years ago, you're wandering around Proto Europe, and

206
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,480
 somehow you're able to persuade somebody to give you a round-ish piece of bread with smoked

207
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
 salmon on it.

208
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,080
 Cream cheese, by the way, the most famous type in Britain, at least, and I think probably

209
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,520
 in America, is made in which city?

210
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
 Philadelphia.

211
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,880
 I'm afraid not, it was invented in New York, but it was named Philadelphia because the

212
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,400
 Philadelphia area was so famous for making good dairy products that they wanted to name

213
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,840
 it after this area, but it was actually invented in New York.

214
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
 All right.

215
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
 So now you're saying American cheese is good, James.

216
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,480
 Interesting about face we've gone on this podcast.

217
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,080
 Just very quickly, just while we were talking about the words for bagel, what's quite surprising

218
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,560
 is that up until 1951, bagel wasn't really a known word outside of the Jewish communities

219
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,440
 in the major cities of America.

220
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,480
 So it was in 1951 that when The New York Times was writing an article about the strike that

221
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,520
 was happening, that they actually had to provide a pronunciation guide to show it.

222
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,040
 So B-A-Y-G-L-E, just that's how this word that you're now reading is pronounced.

223
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,640
 It's quite amazing.

224
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,960
 My mother, who is 89, whenever the subject of bagels comes up, as it doesn't as often

225
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,160
 as you'd expect, always gets a little bit aggrieved because she's like, "It's not bagel.

226
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
 It's bagel."

227
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
 I-I-G-L.

228
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,280
 And she says, "I know that because my mother's aunt and uncle, Rosie and Mick, owned the

229
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,800
 Johnny Isaacs Fish and Ship Shop in the East End.

230
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,320
 And outside the Fish and Ship Shop, there was the little old bagel lady.

231
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,400
 And my mother is still slightly put out about the fact that the pronunciation has gone bagel

232
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,960
 because all of her childhood, they were bagels."

233
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
 That's right.

234
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,720
 There's a book on the bagel that was written by a lady called Maria Walenska and she finds

235
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,200
 an old pretzel tin and it's got bagel on it as a name.

236
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,520
 And it turns out that there was a family in Poland called bagel, who were part of the

237
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,800
 Jewish baking community in pre-Nazi Krakow.

238
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,360
 And she thinks, "Ah, is that where bagel first originated from as a term?"

239
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,440
 There is another Krakow link, weirdly.

240
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,680
 And this is like the origin of the bagel because there's a story that it came from

241
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,080
 the Siege of Vienna in 1683 when the Ottomans besieged Vienna and, you know, there was to

242
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,200
 celebrate the victory and the breaking of that siege, blah, blah, blah.

243
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
 It's not true.

244
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,000
 I mean, no, it's not true because at least 70 years before that, in a Jewish Krakow, there

245
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 was a statute saying, "You are allowed to give bagels to a woman who's given birth."

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,320
 It was a kind of fertility thing.

247
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,400
 It was a kind of, if the woman's given birth, you give her a bagel, give the midwife a bagel.

248
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,000
 Any women or girls who were present at the birth, they get a bagel too.

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 You get a bagel.

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 You get a bagel.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I think it's because it's ring-shaped.

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
 It's sort of as a fertility thing.

253
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,040
 Is it like what you were thinking about how you would end up in the emergency room, Sandy?

254
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,280
 It's not far away from that case.

255
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,280
 It's pretty close.

256
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:30,120
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

257
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,600
 Okay, my fact this week is that it's actually not that bad to spend eternity pushing a boulder

258
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
 up a hill for it only to roll down again every time.

259
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
 Sure.

260
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,320
 That's how I perceive making this podcast.

261
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
 Yeah, it's not that bad after all.

262
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,240
 It's supposed to be this eternal punishment, and it's kind of fine.

263
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,760
 So this is Sisyphus, and it's the great Greek mythology story, right?

264
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,000
 Pushing a boulder up a hill but can never make it up to the top is the punishment.

265
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 That's right.

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 You never hear him complaining, do you?

267
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
 Or does he?

268
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,160
 It's definitely a punishment from the gods.

269
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,680
 It is a punishment.

270
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,200
 Look, this is something that I read, a study called Idleness aversion and a need for justifiable

271
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,960
 busyness, which was a study from 2010 from the University of Chicago, University of Shanghai

272
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,520
 and a few other places, which I read about in improbable.com, run by our friends, that

273
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 website.

274
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,840
 And the idea is that now that humans don't have to spend their day just trying to survive

275
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,600
 and run away from lions and collect food and all that kind of stuff, we need to be kept

276
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,880
 busy in order to be happy.

277
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,320
 And what they did was they did an experiment where people were in a room and they had to

278
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,360
 do a survey.

279
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,520
 And then at the end of the survey, they had to take their paper either to the front of

280
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,760
 the room or they had to walk 10 minutes to another place and put their paper there, right?

281
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,400
 And in both places, they'll get some candy as a thanks for doing the survey.

282
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,880
 Now when they did that study, most people just went for the box, which was right next

283
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,680
 to them because why not, it's right there.

284
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,880
 But when they told them that in one of the places it'll be plain chocolate and the other

285
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,600
 place it'll be dark chocolate, more than 50% of them would start going the 10 minute walk

286
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,080
 and the 10 minute walk back, rather than just doing the short one and then waiting for everyone

287
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,280
 to come back from wherever they've been.

288
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,560
 So people would rather go and get the candy than sit around the idly for 20 minutes waiting.

289
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,880
 And the weird thing is, no matter what you did, if you put the milk chocolate in one

290
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,160
 place and the dark chocolate in another, all you swapped it around, people still make that

291
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
 walk.

292
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,040
 And the idea is that people prefer to do something rather than sitting around doing nothing when

293
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,720
 they think they're going to get something for their efforts.

294
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,120
 And it doesn't matter what the thing is that you think you're going to get for your efforts,

295
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
 you're going to do something.

296
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
 Yeah, that's very clever experiment design because otherwise it would have turned into

297
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,760
 a referendum on which is better, plain chocolate or dark chocolate.

298
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,280
 That's an unintended consequence.

299
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,560
 And so what they thought was these people who did the study and they speculate about

300
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,560
 it in their paper is that people are just happier when they're given something to do

301
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,400
 and the Sisyphus, which they actually mentioned in the paper, Sisyphus would be happier rolling

302
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,200
 the rock up and down the hill every single day and then it goes to the bottom and he

303
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,640
 has to do it again and do it again and do it again.

304
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,160
 You'd be happier doing that than if he spent all of eternity just sitting around twiddling

305
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,960
 his thumbs doing nothing.

306
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
 And that's the idea.

307
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,000
 Yeah, I mean, they mentioned things in the paper that's written in the science paper

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,040
 where they say homeowners may increase the happiness of their ideal housekeepers by letting

309
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,280
 in some mice and prompting the housekeepers to clean up.

310
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,080
 Yeah, I did read that.

311
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,880
 Yeah, governments may increase the happiness of idle citizens by having them build bridges

312
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
 that are actually useless.

313
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,560
 And then they put in practical examples where people have done this, where they've shown

314
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,600
 that by stopping the idleness that happiness is hopefully increased and that's in airports

315
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,920
 and that is extending the distance between getting off the plane and the baggage carousel

316
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,160
 so that you don't just get straight there and then you're idly waiting for the bags

317
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
 to come out.

318
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,680
 That's the idea is that at least you're walking to something and you're using up the time.

319
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
 Yeah.

320
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
 I don't know if that's true.

321
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 I think that one is apocryphal, isn't it?

322
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,160
 Or it's not absolutely nailed on because I think the claim is that Houston Airport

323
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,520
 did that because they were getting loads of people complaining because the plane landed

324
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,760
 a minute from the baggage carousel and then they had to hang around waiting.

325
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,240
 And then when they just switched the arrival gate and sent the bags so that people had

326
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,280
 to walk for the eight minutes basically before the bags got to the thing, then complaints

327
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,440
 dropped.

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,320
 So yeah, Sisyphus founded Corinth.

329
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,640
 I've been to the hill which he pushed the rock up supposedly.

330
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
 Oh, really?

331
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
 He was on the outskirts of Corinth.

332
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,880
 What, so did he complete the gig?

333
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,040
 No, but it's like a story, isn't it?

334
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
 Yeah, it's like a story.

335
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,640
 So the people of Corinth say, oh, this is the hill or the tall guide says this is the hill

336
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 which he did it.

337
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
 Very cool.

338
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,480
 I disgraced myself as a mythologist and as somebody who's written books on mythology

339
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,000
 and written stories set in mythological times and even had Sisyphus as a character.

340
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,120
 The one place in literature he gets to stop rolling his rock is when Orpheus goes to the

341
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,520
 underworld and sings and I've written that.

342
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,600
 And I just realized I'd completely forgotten what he did to be punished to do that.

343
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,680
 Is he one of the ones who accidentally, did he feed the gods his son accidentally?

344
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,120
 Was he one of those?

345
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
 No, it wasn't.

346
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
 It was Zeus, wasn't it?

347
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
 Yeah.

348
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
 He tricked Zeus.

349
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
 He did it twice.

350
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,600
 Basically, it was a second offence.

351
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,800
 I think that was something where the gods get really annoyed with you.

352
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,960
 So the first thing was that Zeus had run off with a woman and Sisyphus had seen it happening

353
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,120
 and he snitched on Zeus.

354
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,680
 And so Zeus decided, well, I'm going to strike you down with a thunderbolt.

355
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,080
 And then he tried to cheat death by chaining death up so that he couldn't take him to

356
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,800
 the underworld.

357
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,720
 And then a second time he tried to cheat death by saying that he needed to go up to see his

358
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,280
 wife because his wife hadn't done a proper funeral or something.

359
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
 Yeah, yeah.

360
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,680
 He'd already instructed his wife.

361
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,320
 He said to his wife, don't bury me.

362
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
 Right.

363
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
 This is going to be great.

364
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,600
 And then when he got to Hades, he said, oh, I haven't had a proper funeral.

365
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,480
 So I need to go and punish my wife and arrange the proper funeral.

366
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,320
 And then when he got back, he just reunited with his wife.

367
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,840
 And they said, well, if you're going to try and stop, you know, dying and try and stop

368
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
 death in general, because he tried to stop death for the whole of the world.

369
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,640
 They said, well, we're going to make death really, really shitty for you.

370
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,720
 I got to say, it's one of the, it's, I think the punishments are really good in Greek myths.

371
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,840
 I'd never heard of this one.

372
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
 This is Ockness.

373
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
 Have you heard of Ockness?

374
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 I mean, maybe Neil, you've written about Ockness.

375
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
 I don't know.

376
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
 Tell me about Ockness.

377
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
 So Ockness is punishment.

378
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,680
 I actually don't know what the crime was, but he had to perpetually weave a rope out of

379
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
 straw.

380
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,240
 But no matter how fast he wove the rope, the rope that he's already woven gets eaten

381
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
 by a donkey.

382
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,560
 And I have to say that sounds like a sort of holiday activity to me.

383
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
 Yeah.

384
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
 You just have to weave some rope.

385
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
 Do you think?

386
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
 And you get to be friends with a donkey.

387
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,000
 Well, it's not having your liver eaten every day.

388
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,160
 Is it pecked at by a bird while you're trained to a rock?

389
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
 Yeah.

390
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,520
 It's very much like parking a fence level of punishment.

391
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,840
 That's how much you like weaving, isn't it?

392
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
 Well, that's true.

393
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,880
 And there's always a thing of, oh, in life, he hated weaving.

394
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,280
 So actually, yeah, that was his least favorite activity and yeah.

395
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,600
 There was Ixion who was a murderer, killed his father-in-law.

396
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,560
 The first man guilty of kinslaying in Greek mythology.

397
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:24,840
 And he got bound to a burning wheel and his wheels spun across the heavens.

398
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
 Oh my goodness.

399
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,040
 I would say definitely take the weaving ahead of that.

400
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
 Exactly.

401
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
 Yeah.

402
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 That's amazing.

403
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,000
 I was trying to find out whether or not there are any modern examples of someone trying

404
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,040
 to push something up a hill and finding it quite hard.

405
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,480
 Last year, 2022, a Colorado man attempted to ascend to the top of a 14,115-foot mountain

406
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,120
 called Pike's Peak on his hands and knees while trying to push a peanut to the top of

407
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,680
 the hill using his nose.

408
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,920
 So you can see footage of this.

409
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,880
 He has a mask on his face where there's a sort of black spoon that's attached to the

410
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,840
 front of his nose.

411
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
 He starts at the bottom.

412
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 He's got the peanut there.

413
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,320
 He brought multiple peanuts because it turns out he's not the first person to do this.

414
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,040
 He's the fourth in Colorado history.

415
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:18,160
 The first person to do it was in 1929 and it took three weeks for that person to do.

416
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,980
 But squirrels were stealing the peanuts and so the efforts were quite messed up.

417
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,440
 So he has multiple peanuts that he took with him on this trip and it took him seven days

418
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
 but he got there.

419
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,240
 But is he going on hands and knees?

420
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
 Yeah, hands and knees.

421
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
 Yeah.

422
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,800
 It feels so painful.

423
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 Does he take the peanut back down afterwards?

424
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,300
 That feels easier, doesn't it?

425
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,800
 Yeah, kicking it in the air.

426
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,840
 Or is there a miniature can of three previous peanuts that have been there and he's just

427
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 adding to it.

428
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 Oh yeah, yeah, like a Hall of Fame.

429
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,320
 It sounds like a weirdly sound.

430
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,000
 There must be more going on in Colorado.

431
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,040
 If you're in Colorado and you're listening to this, please write it and tell us what

432
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,320
 else there is to do.

433
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,600
 I have a couple more boredom things.

434
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,400
 So there was a study in 2021 about what people are willing to do when they are bored and

435
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,980
 whether it changes people's perceptions of morality or what they're prepared to do.

436
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,680
 This study found that if you ask people to watch a boring 20 minute long video, people

437
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,120
 are more willing to shred maggots in a grinder.

438
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,920
 The scientists gave people a few maggots and they even named them.

439
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,560
 They called them Toto Tee-Fee in Kiki.

440
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
 They left people.

441
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,040
 They said, "Look, I'm just going to pop out of the room while you watch this video for

442
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 20 minutes.

443
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,120
 Here, Toto Tee-Fee in Kiki, here's your grinder and just have a great time."

444
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
 No.

445
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
 Way more people.

446
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
 So it wasn't everyone.

447
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
 Sorry, Andy.

448
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,200
 They must have put the idea into their heads that the maggots can go into the grinder,

449
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
 surely.

450
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,120
 If you leave someone with a maggot and a grinder, you can only combine those things in one way.

451
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,040
 So it wasn't everyone by a long way, but 67 people who watched the very, very dull video.

452
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
 Out of how many?

453
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,960
 Sorry, that was the total.

454
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,200
 So 67 people watched this dull video.

455
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,480
 Of them, 12 dropped a maggot in and obviously there was a control group.

456
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,880
 When they got to watch an interesting documentary, I don't know, maybe an Attenborough, maybe

457
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,760
 a Thiru, doesn't matter, it was just one person out of 62.

458
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,480
 Well it makes a difference, actually, Andy.

459
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,880
 If they're watching like a nature documentary, then they might feel more empathetic towards

460
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
 the maggots.

461
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 True.

462
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
 But all they might feel empathetic towards the lions.

463
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,120
 You know, nature's grinder.

464
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
 That's true.

465
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,960
 Anyway, you will be relieved to hear that no maggots were actually ground up.

466
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
 It was a fake machine.

467
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
 Oh, was it?

468
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
 They had a fake grinder.

469
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
 Wow, yeah.

470
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
 That's funny.

471
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
 I've seen one of those before.

472
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
 Really?

473
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,800
 And I did an escape room where I had to put my hand in a food processor to get the key,

474
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,520
 but obviously it was a fake one, but they didn't tell you it was a fake one.

475
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,760
 Oh, so you were willing to grind up your hand for the sake of getting a clue?

476
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,840
 I was quite aware that we were in a controlled environment that they wouldn't let me do that.

477
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,440
 They wouldn't let me mutilate myself, so I was fairly certain that if there was a real

478
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,840
 food processor there, someone would come over the tannoy saying, "Don't do that."

479
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,840
 You know, you meet an awful lot of one-handed men around here who were equally as certain.

480
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,080
 I've done an escape room with you, James.

481
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,400
 It doesn't surprise me in the least that you'd be willing to risk serious physical

482
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,280
 injury to get a personal best.

483
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
 It's true.

484
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,360
 Here's an interesting thing that I've been reading about, and I don't know.

485
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
 It's quite complicated, so let's see where it goes.

486
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,840
 I was reading about neuroscience, and there is a theory in neuroscience at the moment

487
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,360
 that the human brain is only built to solve one problem.

488
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,760
 What is the best way to cut into this bagel?

489
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,320
 What am I going to eat?

490
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
 What am I going to eat?

491
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
 Next.

492
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
 Yeah, I see what you mean.

493
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,720
 Yeah, I think all of these could be subcategories of what these neuroscientists are saying.

494
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,960
 They reckon that your brain is created to make sure you don't have any surprises in

495
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
 your life.

496
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
 Oh, yeah.

497
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,600
 And basically everything you do, everything that your brain does is trying to stop that

498
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,240
 from happening, and that's the reason why people like routine because they know that

499
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,200
 there's not going to be any surprises, and it'll be the same all the time.

500
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,240
 But it also, in theory, explains people being curious and people inventing new things because

501
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,160
 what you're doing is you're slightly pushing the boundaries so you can test it and so that

502
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,440
 your brain doesn't get surprised if anything beyond those boundaries happens.

503
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,440
 And I just find that a really interesting idea that this incredibly complicated thing

504
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,200
 in your head is only really trying to do one thing, but it just, everything else feeds

505
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 from that.

506
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,120
 I feel like, what about, I mean, I feel like I like to be surprised by works of art, like

507
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,840
 a book or a film.

508
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,600
 I will like a surprise, but to be fair, I only like a surprise within certain parameters.

509
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,720
 So if I'm going to see Mission Impossible 7, there is a set number of things which I'm

510
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,760
 prepared to adore, but if they introduce like a time travel thing, I will be unpleasantly

511
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 surprised by that.

512
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:57,400
 It's like the idea that what you want when you're seeing a film is for it all to end

513
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,440
 in the way that you wanted it to, but not in the way you were expecting.

514
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
 That's nice.

515
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
 Yeah.

516
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,360
 You need surprise parameters because at the moment where you can literally call off every

517
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,240
 beat in a film by the numbers, you start looking around for maggots to grind.

518
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,280
 Whenever I watch an episode of the Big Bang Theory, the maggot toll is absolutely astronomical

519
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,840
 by the end of the 20 minutes.

520
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
 Wow.

521
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,240
 It's been a while since you had to go the Big Bang Theory, Andy.

522
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
 That's a callback.

523
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
 We're a geek show.

524
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,920
 I'm trying to surprise our listeners, but within, like, people know my limited range

525
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
 of references.

526
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
 That's one.

527
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,080
 That's half our listeners you've just offended.

528
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,120
 I was on the Big Bang Theory.

529
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
 I was a guest star.

530
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
 I played Neil Gaiman.

531
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
 Oh, wow.

532
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
 I didn't mean that episode.

533
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
 Obviously.

534
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,560
 That's the one where no maggots went were hard in watching this episode.

535
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,920
 What were you doing on it?

536
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,840
 It was an episode about a comet, and it begins with the gang up on the roof looking at the

537
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,000
 stars, and one of them gets a note saying, "Oh, my God, Neil Gaiman was in my shop and

538
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,360
 he tweeted about it," and they're all sort of vaguely baffled because obviously they

539
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,000
 would have known, and then you cut to me in the shop trying to join their conversation

540
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,400
 and being rudely rebuffed and insulted.

541
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 Nice.

542
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,920
 It's kind of fun.

543
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:24,480
 I now have this peculiar tiny career of playing versions of Neil Gaiman in shows of which

544
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,960
 the best one of all is still The Simpsons, because I got to be an evil, murdering book

545
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,160
 thief who turns out couldn't even read and who poisons somebody in the final moment,

546
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,360
 so it was kind of, I like him best.

547
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:50,680
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

548
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,480
 My fact is that beekeeping was only legalized in Minneapolis in 2009.

549
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
 I knew this.

550
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,640
 I knew this because I was a beekeeper, a little way out of Minneapolis.

551
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,080
 I lived at the time in Little Town, an hour's drive from Minneapolis, and I would have sad,

552
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:19,800
 nervous, mini-apoletans come over to my house and gaze longingly at my bees and exclaim

553
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 that...

554
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 Right.

555
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,760
 You weren't in the band zone.

556
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,000
 You were far enough out of the city there.

557
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,880
 I was far enough out, I was far enough away that my bees were entirely legal bees.

558
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,520
 What would happen, Neil, what would happen if your bees flew over the state lines as

559
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,160
 it were into anti-bee territory?

560
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
 Great point.

561
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:46,000
 I think nobody would actually have put little trackers on them to find out, but actually

562
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,400
 I believe bees have a maximum five mile radius, so I think my bees would have been okay unless

563
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,220
 I decided to drive them to Minneapolis just for a day out.

564
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,500
 Come on bees, we're going to see the world.

565
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,560
 I will show you the sights of Minneapolis.

566
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,120
 I'll show you Minneapolis and Paul Airport.

567
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,720
 I will show you all these exciting things.

568
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,760
 Yeah, it was really strict.

569
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,920
 I think it was because it was an urban environment, basically.

570
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,680
 It was saying, look, this is a built-up area.

571
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,400
 You can't have just hundreds of thousands of bees around the place.

572
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,280
 Even when they legalized it, you had to get permission from 80% of property owners within

573
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
 250 feet of your home.

574
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
 That's a lot.

575
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,280
 If you live somewhere with apartments, you might have to ask a hundred different people's

576
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,240
 permission and get 80 of them to sign off on it, I think they've slightly loosened up

577
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
 a bit since then.

578
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,040
 I suppose if you live in an apartment in a tower block, you probably don't have much

579
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,360
 room for bees anyway.

580
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,160
 No, I think that's true.

581
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,360
 Also, it might be a bit cruel if you don't have the flower space, because you can't just

582
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,360
 keep bees in a box.

583
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
 You can keep them in a box.

584
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,040
 Well, I mean, you do keep them in a box.

585
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
 Sorry.

586
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
 You have to, in fact.

587
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
 Right.

588
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
 That's kind of the rule.

589
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:03,240
 I was reading about Utah, the Beehive State, and in Utah, it is illegal to keep bees unless

590
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,920
 you have government permission.

591
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,880
 You need a license, basically, so just not any old person can have bees in Utah, either.

592
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,840
 But the state emblem is the Beehive.

593
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,320
 You might have seen it on the Utah flags and stuff.

594
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
 It's like that sort of --

595
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
 The skip.

596
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
 It's that one.

597
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
 It's called a skip.

598
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
 It's called a skip.

599
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,040
 They were made of woven straw.

600
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,220
 They'd weave straw together and circle it, and that was what bees were in until Mr. Langstruth

601
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,080
 came along and invented the modern hive.

602
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,840
 Yeah, and these modern hives, they have things that you can pull out.

603
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
 Is that right?

604
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
 They do.

605
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,920
 The biggest problem with the initial bee skeptes was that you had to destroy the skip to get

606
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,840
 to the honey.

607
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:54,280
 So they didn't have openings, and what Langstruth came up with was hives with removable slats

608
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,440
 exploiting the concept of bee space.

609
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,640
 Okay, so bee space.

610
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,120
 Can I just be boring for a moment?

611
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
 Yeah, go for it.

612
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
 I love bee space.

613
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,520
 They put those maggots away.

614
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,000
 So the way that bees work is bees are kind of like people in rooms.

615
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,920
 If a bee sees something that is room size for a bee, which is to say more than twice

616
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,120
 the size of a bee, or twice the size of one bee climbing over another bee, it will try

617
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
 and fill it with comb.

618
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,120
 If it sees something much smaller, it will seal it off.

619
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:39,000
 However, if you get your bee space right, a bee will regard your bee space as a corridor

620
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,280
 and not build comb and so on and so forth.

621
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:50,200
 So Langstruth's genius was to figure out bee space, figure out the exact size and shape

622
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:57,920
 of one of these hives that you put the slats in, but it was basically unpatentable.

623
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:04,840
 The moment he had discovered it and figured it out, every farmer with nails and a tape

624
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,880
 measure could build their own hives.

625
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,880
 So his discovery caught on immediately and hugely, but he was not a happy man.

626
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,280
 Yeah, he seems an interesting guy.

627
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 So he was a pastor and he was going over to one of his parish members and he noticed that

628
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,080
 they had a bowl of comb honey and he thought, wow, this is pretty tasty.

629
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
 This is pretty amazing.

630
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,440
 And he said, where did you get it from?

631
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,640
 And he was led to the attic where he was shown near an open window.

632
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,040
 There was a hive there and he just immediately went, this is what I want to be doing.

633
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,240
 This makes me happy because he was suffering from bouts to depression.

634
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,720
 There's quotes from him saying that he would ask for his books to be hidden away from him

635
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,880
 because even the letter B, seeing the letter B would just make him miss his own bees and

636
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,200
 go into a sadness while he couldn't leave the house.

637
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
 Yeah.

638
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,500
 So he was deeply troubled, happy, I mean, happy Earth Day to you, but quite an extraordinary

639
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,180
 character when you read into a story.

640
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,240
 And those hives now, a lot of states, you have to use those, don't you?

641
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,040
 You can't use the old skeptics, you have to use these ones.

642
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,240
 So I'm thinking of the like the filing cabinet where you like the filing, hanging cabinet

643
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
 where you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

644
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
 Exactly like that.

645
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,840
 Which was a bit of first, that beehive or the filing cabinet, because I feel like they've

646
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,960
 nicked from each other.

647
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,040
 One is based on the other surely.

648
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
 Interesting.

649
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
 I don't know that actually.

650
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,760
 Filing cabinet early 20th century.

651
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
 I know.

652
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,200
 I mean, these beehives sound like they were early 20th century.

653
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 Yeah.

654
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 Unless this guy was...

655
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
 1851 is when he...

656
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
 Oh, okay.

657
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 I think beehives first.

658
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
 Yeah, yeah.

659
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
 Wow.

660
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,200
 So maybe the filing cabinet has borrowed from nature's filing cabinet, the beehive.

661
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,400
 Which is not nature's, because it was invented by a human.

662
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
 Yes, yes.

663
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,280
 Well, that in itself is thought provoking, I think.

664
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,160
 Invented by a human, but exploiting this 60 million year old insect who is astoundingly,

665
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:55,440
 you know, I mean, things like the use of the hexagon, because it's the most efficient use

666
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,280
 of wax and stuff in the...

667
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
 Yeah.

668
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,760
 I get all excited about bees.

669
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,840
 Did you get stung much?

670
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,200
 Obviously, I'm sure you had all the beekeeping kit when you were doing it.

671
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:13,160
 I got stung about four or five times during the course of the six or seven years that

672
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,660
 I was actively beekeeping.

673
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,660
 Oh, wow.

674
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
 I just kind of liked that.

675
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,600
 I felt like everybody should have a hobby that could kill them.

676
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,760
 Mostly it would be my own fault, and it got a little more stressful.

677
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:35,080
 One day I got stung, and all of a sudden my hand blew up like an inflated rubber glove,

678
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,780
 and my breathing went a wonky, and I went, "Oh, this is that anaphylactic shock thing.

679
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,580
 This is actually, it's now happening, it's been primed."

680
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,180
 So I had to go and buy EpiPens for future beekeeping, just in case, but did not get

681
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,400
 stung after that.

682
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:59,000
 Very recently a beekeeper who had a very distinguished job of looking after the queen's bees was

683
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,180
 given the task of having to tell the bees that the queen had died, and this is an old tradition

684
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,920
 of when there's a notable death within a family that owns hives that the bees need to be informed,

685
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,640
 and you need to put black ribbon on the outside of the hive and so on in order to show that

686
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
 there's mourning.

687
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,820
 And so the queen has had for the last 15 years of her life, John Chappell, who was the official

688
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:29,800
 palace beekeeper, and that was his job to do, except for some reason he had no idea

689
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
 that that was a tradition.

690
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,000
 So on the day that the queen passes away, an email pings up in his email box saying from

691
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,320
 the head gardener, "Have you told the bees?"

692
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,120
 He must have thought that was a very par-taste, that joke.

693
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
 Yeah, exactly.

694
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,520
 So he had to go around and he had to tell the bees, he had to say the line, "The mistress

695
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,040
 is dead, but don't you go, your master will be a good master to you."

696
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,680
 And that was how he broke the news to the queen's bees, that she was gone.

697
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
 It was a tradition.

698
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,240
 You tell the bees not just of deaths, but important family news.

699
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,440
 There's even a Kipling poem about it.

700
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
 Right.

701
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
 Did you tell the bees stuff, Neil?

702
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,160
 Did you just pop down and was there a benchmark of the kind of news that you would impart

703
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
 and then stuff, he's like, "Oh, they won't be interested."

704
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,000
 There's two smaller deals.

705
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,960
 You know, I would never tell them to sort of casual internet gossip, because I figure

706
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,520
 bees are above that kind of thing.

707
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

708
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,520
 But I would tell, you know, I love the idea of being part of the beekeeper tradition.

709
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,400
 So there were definitely a couple of times when I would tell bees things and I'd just

710
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,920
 go down to the hives and say, "Right, my son is engaged."

711
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,920
 But I just quickly say one or two things that are illegal in Minneapolis.

712
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,600
 So I've checked this for sure.

713
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,200
 I've checked in the code.

714
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,880
 This definitely exists in Minnesota law.

715
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,960
 So this is the whole of the state of Minnesota.

716
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,120
 No person shall operate, run or participate in a contest game or other like activity in

717
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:07,160
 which a pig greased, oiled or otherwise is released and wherein the object is the capture

718
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:13,480
 of the pig, or in which a chicken or turkey is released or thrown into the air and wherein

719
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,680
 the object is to capture the chicken or the turkey.

720
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,040
 Some laws, it feels like some laws are made out of basic principles, right, like stealing

721
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,520
 or murdering or whatever.

722
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,680
 And it feels like some laws are created in response to specific incidents which have

723
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
 gone badly wrong.

724
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,840
 And you're saying this might be the latter?

725
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,080
 I think it might be, yeah.

726
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:38,720
 Yeah, so pig greased, pig chasing is explicitly illegal in Minnesota.

727
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,120
 And if you go on the internet, you'll see a lot of people saying that it's illegal to

728
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,800
 cross the Minnesota, Wisconsin border with a duck on your head.

729
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,240
 Apparently, this isn't true and it's because there was a thing called cotton duck.

730
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,480
 And cotton duck was the type of woven cotton fabric which comes from the Dutch for linen,

731
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,000
 which is duck.

732
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,760
 And cotton duck is a specific thing and you weren't allowed to cross the border with that

733
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,920
 because they were trying to help the cotton makers.

734
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,440
 And so they said you couldn't do that, but people mistook it to think that you couldn't

735
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,560
 cross the border with a duck on your head.

736
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,520
 I love those sort of industry-specific things.

737
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,520
 I remember talking to old people in Wisconsin while I was out there.

738
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,760
 And they were saying that when they were young, margarine could not be yellow.

739
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:34,200
 There were local laws that only butter was allowed to be yellow, but that they would

740
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,280
 sell margarine, and I don't know if this is true or not, they would sell margarine with

741
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,480
 little yellow coloring things so you could mix it together and have a yellowish thing

742
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,600
 to put on your bread.

743
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
 That's so funny.

744
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,920
 Yeah, because they wanted to protect the butter makers in Wisconsin, right?

745
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
 Exactly.

746
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,400
 I think margarine comes from the Greek for pearl, like the name Margaret does because

747
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,960
 it had to be pearl colored in the olden days.

748
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
 That is very cool.

749
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
 I didn't know that.

750
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
 Me neither.

751
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,520
 I can also tell you that it's no longer illegal to have a dirty threshing machine or to impersonate

752
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,760
 a straw inspector in Minnesota, but they have been true in the last hundred years.

753
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,120
 To impersonate a straw inspector?

754
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
 Finally.

755
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:28,960
 The comedy clubs around Minnesota are back in with the classic straw inspector impersonations.

756
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,080
 Thank God.

757
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:39,200
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

758
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,600
 My fact this week is that the author Douglas Adams once put his back out while buttering

759
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,960
 a slice of bread.

760
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:56,640
 This is a fact that comes directly from the creator of QI and is a friend of Neil Gaiman's,

761
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
 Mr. John Lloyd.

762
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,600
 A long time ago, he wrote the forward to a biography of Douglas Adams by a guy called

763
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,280
 MJ Simpson, and in the forward, he just talks about his sort of day-to-day life, and famously

764
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,560
 within the circle of friends, he was always mocked for the fact of once putting his back

765
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
 out.

766
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,280
 So do we know, was he really buttering the bread in an extremely ostentatious way or

767
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,520
 something, or heavy knife, thick cold butter?

768
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,160
 No, it was just literally, he was just standing there, probably whistling.

769
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,480
 I don't know, Neil, have you got any insight?

770
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,760
 Douglas was gloriously accident-prone, and I remember him once telling me about breaking

771
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,840
 his nose with his own knees playing rugby, I think as a small boy, about the time that

772
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,480
 he first bought a fancy car with hitchhiker money, he bought a Porsche, and on the way

773
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,800
 home from the showroom, going round Marble Arch, he managed to total his Porsche.

774
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:59,120
 And I remember once turning up at some incredibly fancy event for hitchhikers, it had sold a

775
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,440
 million copies or something like that, and his publisher Pan presented Douglas very proudly

776
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,160
 with a book on mushrooms, and I said, "Douglas, why are you now holding a huge book on mushrooms?"

777
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,820
 And it turned out that he'd gone to France for a gastronomic thing the week before, and

778
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:25,440
 on day one had eaten the kind of mushroom that you were not meant to eat, and had not

779
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,120
 eaten anything else for the following five days.

780
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,080
 I once read there, if you go to France and you go to any pharmacist, they can tell you

781
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,800
 if a mushroom is poisonous or not, as in they're all trained for it, that's what I read once,

782
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,040
 I've never tried it.

783
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,760
 We must try it, we must all try it, we must gather mushrooms and march into French pharmacies.

784
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,700
 In American pharmacies, I'm not completely convinced they will be able to identify it

785
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,200
 as a mushroom.

786
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,840
 What is that thing?

787
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,140
 So you, I mean, we should just quickly say that Neil, you wrote a biography on Douglas

788
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,120
 Adams, you knew him, right?

789
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,240
 It was your, I think, second book that you'd written, non-fiction book called Don't Panic?

790
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,720
 I did, it was called Don't Panic, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion, and it also

791
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,040
 contained a lot of biographical stuff about Douglas, because there's only so much you

792
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,320
 can say about hitchhikers.

793
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,760
 And I got to know Douglas relatively well, but always from a sort of position of you

794
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,080
 are a fancy author and I am a small journalist who first interviewed you when he was 22.

795
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,720
 So he was definitely the grown-up, he was so impressive to me.

796
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,280
 He had all of these amazing careers, like being a bodyguard for the Saudi royal family.

797
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,120
 I said, "What did that job entail?"

798
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,960
 He said, "Well, basically, it entailed standing around in a hotel corridor, going out occasionally

799
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,760
 to bring back enormous quantities of McDonald's and planning to run away if anybody with a

800
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
 gun shot."

801
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,280
 Oh, I found a kind of relative fact on that, which is, The Hitchhiker's Guide was turned

802
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,800
 into a TV series, wasn't it?

803
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,520
 Quite soon after it was already a series and then a book, it was a telly series.

804
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,360
 And one of the guys who plays a bodyguard in the TV series of hitchhikers is Dave Prouse,

805
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
 aka Darth Vader.

806
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
 No.

807
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
 Really?

808
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
 He's in it.

809
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
 Yeah.

810
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
 Wow.

811
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,360
 I have no idea if it's a speaking role or not.

812
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,600
 It's been a long time since I saw the series, but I imagine it's not.

813
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,240
 So was Douglas Adams very tall, Neil?

814
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,600
 That's why I read about him.

815
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
 He was.

816
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
 He was very tall.

817
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,160
 He was about six foot five, six foot six-ish.

818
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,440
 I remember him saying that when he discovered how tall John Cleese and Graham Chapman were,

819
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,400
 he decided that he had all the qualifications necessary for comedy.

820
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,200
 The reason I ask is because tall people are very susceptible to back injuries.

821
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,160
 That's why I was reading that about.

822
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,640
 There's a few mechanical reasons for that, but one of the reasons is basically the world

823
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,240
 is just made for averagely-heighted people, and so they always have to squeeze themselves

824
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,240
 into various places.

825
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,920
 But I read that he was six feet tall by the time he was 12 years old, Douglas Adams.

826
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
 Right.

827
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,120
 And that would be only three inches shorter than the record tallest 12-year-old in the

828
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
 UK.

829
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
 That's so cool.

830
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,640
 Oh, did you find the trousers shorts thing, James?

831
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
 No, what's that?

832
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
 This is great.

833
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
 So he was at school.

834
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,680
 He was in shorts, like all the rest of the boys in his year, and I think there was a point

835
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,800
 where he was going to go after being able to wear trousers with the rest of his year,

836
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,920
 but unfortunately, at exactly the year that everyone went to trousers, he discovered his

837
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,680
 school tailor had no trousers in his size because he was so much taller than everyone

838
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,360
 else that they just couldn't fit him.

839
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,840
 So for this key four weeks of his life, he was the only boy in his year wearing shorts,

840
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,960
 and that obviously is psychologically scarring, especially if you're so much taller than

841
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
 everyone else.

842
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
 I can't believe he had a school tailor.

843
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,480
 In my school, they used to just set fire to the bottom of your trousers.

844
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
 I know.

845
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,480
 It does say something about that.

846
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,840
 Do you remember there's a bit of QI, isn't there, where Stephen talks about his school,

847
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,560
 prep school tailor being called Gorrige?

848
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
 Yes.

849
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,400
 And it's with Orange.

850
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
 Yeah.

851
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,120
 I was looking in today, I thought I knew quite a lot about sort of the cultural impact that

852
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,920
 hitchhikers had on the world, and there were so many elements of hitchhikers that you'll

853
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,840
 find in pop culture.

854
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,960
 So Radiohead had a song which was called Paranoid Android, which was named after Marvin the

855
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,040
 Paranoid at Android.

856
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,800
 You had the fact that 42 is just the answer to the meaning of life question.

857
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,400
 People know that sort of generally, but I didn't realize that things like in the X-Files,

858
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,440
 Foxmolder lived in apartment 42, which Chris Carter said was a direct nod to hitchhikers.

859
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,760
 You've got Coldplay, whose very first song on their debut album was called Don't Panic,

860
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,240
 and they also have a song called 42, which again is a direct link.

861
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,920
 The Allen Telescope Array, which is a telescope which is looking for extraterrestrial intelligence,

862
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,680
 the antenna has 42 antennas paying tribute.

863
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
 Really?

864
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,000
 Like it just is seeded everywhere.

865
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,080
 They must have been going for around 40.

866
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,480
 They weren't going to have two and thought, well, let's add another 40 just to make it

867
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
 the right number.

868
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
 That's true.

869
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,480
 Absolutely.

870
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
 Yeah.

871
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,960
 I love the way that hitchhikers has kind of weirdly penetrated the culture, but I also

872
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,880
 love that those little bits of hitchhikers that have changed with time.

873
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:24,640
 Like there's that line in the opening of hitchhikers about how human beings were so primitive that

874
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,520
 they thought that digital watches were a pretty neat thing.

875
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,040
 And in 1978, oh, we thought that digital watches were a neat thing.

876
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,960
 We thought that digital watches were miracles.

877
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,320
 We had the power of science suddenly appearing on our wrist and it had numbers.

878
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,960
 He still thinks this, I think.

879
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:48,000
 I just want to say that a watch that functions on a wafer of silicon is amazing, that it

880
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,040
 counts the, you know, however many thousands of...

881
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
 Yeah.

882
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
 The peace of electric effect, Andy.

883
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,280
 That's what I'm saying.

884
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,000
 I mean, yeah, sure, the Swiss guys can make the cogs very small, but that's not the same

885
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,480
 as vibrating silicon.

886
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,480
 I mean, I think actually, I think it was a red misfire for Adams and I think we should

887
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,440
 be calling it out.

888
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,120
 Can I tell you guys about the...

889
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,360
 So obviously, Hitchhikers was his first book and he'd amazingly become friends with all

890
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,200
 five members of Monty Python and, you know, he'd even appeared in the latest series of

891
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,200
 Python a couple of times.

892
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,200
 And wrote for it.

893
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
 He was one of the credits designers.

894
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
 And wrote for it.

895
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,000
 And he was only a few years out of school and university.

896
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,560
 It was amazingly fast to be meeting comedy giants like that.

897
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,840
 Anyway, on his first book, he got quotes from all five of the main members of Monty Python.

898
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,520
 John Cleese said, "Really entertaining and fun."

899
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,080
 Terry Jones then said, "Much funnier than anything John Cleese has ever written."

900
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,920
 Graham Chapman then said, "I know for a fact that John Cleese hasn't read it."

901
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,120
 Eric Idle wrote, "Who is John Cleese?"

902
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,520
 And then Michael Palin wrote, "Really entertaining and fun."

903
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,520
 So good.

904
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,520
 Yeah, that's really good.

905
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,120
 I was reading through the Oxford English Dictionary to see if Douglas Adams has been the first

906
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,960
 citation of any words.

907
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,480
 And as far as I can see, there is only one word that he was the first person to ever

908
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
 say.

909
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,760
 According to the OED, of course, which is just what they found, do you want to have

910
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
 a guess?

911
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

912
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,880
 First of all, I can tell you you won't guess, but you can have a go anyway.

913
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,040
 Is it Slotty Bart first?

914
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,040
 That's not in the dictionary.

915
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
 No, that's a proper name.

916
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
 Yeah.

917
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,540
 Golger Frinschen isn't going to be in there anyway.

918
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,720
 A frude is a word from Hitchhiker's Deadline.

919
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,720
 Hoopy.

920
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
 Hoopy.

921
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
 Hoopy, yeah.

922
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,720
 Oh, yeah.

923
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,080
 No, it's actually not from Hitchhikers.

924
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,520
 It's from a comic relief Christmas book that he wrote in 1986.

925
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
 Oh, yeah.

926
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,760
 And the word is Todger.

927
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
 Oh.

928
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
 No.

929
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,640
 Yeah, he's the first person in print to use the word Todger according to the OED.

930
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,640
 Wow.

931
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
 That's mega.

932
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,440
 And before that, the word was Tadger.

933
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,160
 People used to refer to their penises as Tadgers, possibly a Northern dialect for like a tad

934
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,560
 pole or something, but he was the one who turned it from Tadger to Todger.

935
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,280
 Wouldn't it be amazing if one day all of his legacy is forgotten, all his books and just

936
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,020
 the one citation sitting in the dictionary is all we know him for?

937
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,240
 But the Todger guy, that will one day happen.

938
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
 There's one thing.

939
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,520
 One of the big mysteries of Douglas's career for a lot of people is what is behind the

940
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,720
 number 42?

941
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,360
 How did he come to the number?

942
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,760
 I remember John Lloyd sort of saying that they were in a garage together and they were

943
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,680
 just going, "Oh, what number should we use?"

944
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,880
 But supposedly, Stephen Fry says that he's the only person that Douglas ever told what

945
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,240
 the meaning was to, and he's going to take it to his grave.

946
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,880
 He's never going to say what it is.

947
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,360
 So there was a kind of meaning behind it.

948
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,960
 But 42 would always pop up in interesting places.

949
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,440
 And before Douglas passed away, the Hubble telescope was trying to find the defining parameter

950
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,440
 of the expanding universe, and it got identified as 42.

951
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,720
 And for Douglas, that was just like, "Ah, look at it.

952
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,920
 Look at this synchronicity that I've managed to come up with this number, which is the

953
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,000
 speed of the expanding universe."

954
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,440
 So that's the only time that we've got a sort of hint of Douglas's interest in it having

955
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,440
 meaning.

956
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
 But otherwise, no one knows.

957
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,000
 But I wonder if a drunken evening between you and Stephen Neal has led to the reveal.

958
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,760
 I've never heard anything from Stephen.

959
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,560
 I remember asking Douglas my theory.

960
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,000
 When I was a 22-year-old, asking him for the first time, I suggested that it might have

961
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,280
 been from Alice in Wonderland's Rule 42, all persons more than two miles high must leave

962
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,880
 the court.

963
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:35,320
 And Douglas talked about how traumatized he was by Alice in Wonderland and how terrifying

964
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,760
 he found it when he read it.

965
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,920
 But what Douglas said to me was that he was trying to find a number that didn't sound

966
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
 funny.

967
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
 Proce it.

968
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,120
 Not terribly interesting.

969
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:54,480
 47 sounds like it's the kind of number that has interesting things going on.

970
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,040
 42, it's not prime, it's not even an odd number.

971
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,440
 It wasn't interesting.

972
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,640
 It didn't have anything about it that was interesting, you know, because I think he

973
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:10,160
 tried a few in the 40s and settled on 42 as a punchline.

974
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,240
 It's a punchline to the answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything

975
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,240
 is, and a computer has been cogitating on this for millennia, and now it gives the answer,

976
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,080
 and the answer is 42.

977
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:30,640
 And it needed to be a letdown in every way, to be funny, 121 sounds like there's something

978
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,640
 going on with it.

979
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
 42 sounds like, "What?"

980
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,880
 That's not the answer, but then the universe is a wonderful place and it accommodates us.

981
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,280
 And once 42 was let loose in the universe, I'm sure the universe has been running with

982
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,680
 it ever since.

983
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:52,560
 Okay, that is it.

984
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,560
 That is all of our facts.

985
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,160
 Thank you so much for listening.

986
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,420
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over

987
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,560
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found on our Twitter accounts.

988
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:07,360
 I'm on @Sriberland, @Andy, @AndrewHunterM, @James, @JamesHarken, and @Neil.

989
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,480
 I'm @Neil himself, but I'm on Twitter less and less and less.

990
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:18,640
 So I'm probably much more likely to be Neil himself at Threads, or Neil-Gaman at Tumblr,

991
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,800
 or over at Blue Sky as soon as the rest of the world gets their invitations and it becomes

992
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,800
 a giant party.

993
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800
 Nice.

994
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,800
 Okay.

995
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
 Yeah.

996
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,800
 All right.

997
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,800
 Well, let's all head over to that party with Neil.

998
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,960
 And you can get us otherwise on @NoSuchThing, or you can go to our Instagram account, which

999
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,840
 is @NoSuchThing as a Fish, or you can go to our website, nosuchthingasafish.com.

1000
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,120
 All of our previous episodes are up there, but most importantly, make sure you head over

1001
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,320
 to Amazon Prime because the return of Good Omens is here.

1002
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,660
 Good Omens 2, written by Neil Gaiman himself.

1003
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,560
 Make sure to check out that entire series.

1004
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,840
 I've heard previews response.

1005
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,200
 It sounds absolutely incredible.

1006
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,280
 So really exciting.

1007
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
 Do watch that.

1008
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,720
 And otherwise, come back next week for another episode with us.

1009
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,720
 We'll see you then.

1010
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:03,720
 Goodbye.

1011
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,120
 Bye.

1012
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:11,120
 Bye.

1013
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,700
 (upbeat music)

1014
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:22,760
