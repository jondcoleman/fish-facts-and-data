00:00:00,00:00:06,"""Hey everybody, Dan and Andy here and we have two very exciting big announcements before"
00:00:06,00:00:07,"this week's show starts."""
00:00:07,00:00:10,"""That's right, the first one is that we are joined by a very special guest this week and"
00:00:10,00:00:12,"that is the incredible Neil Gaiman."""
00:00:12,00:00:17,"""Yes, Neil Gaiman has done so much stuff, so he's written brilliant novels, he's written"
00:00:17,00:00:22,"for the screen, Neverwhere, American Gods, Stardust, he covered Good Omens with Terry"
00:00:22,00:00:24,"Pratchett, he's done it all."""
00:00:24,00:00:27,"""That's right, and it's not even just the books, you know, the TV work as well, the"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"Sandman was converted into a show, Doctor Who, his episodes are Doctor Who, some of the best"
00:00:31,00:00:36,episodes of the modern era and then of course Good Omens comes to Amazon Prime and then
00:00:36,00:00:37,they do a second series.
00:00:37,00:00:41,"Despite the fact that Terry Pratchett has passed away, I was quite nervous, it comes"
00:00:41,00:00:43,"out it is brilliant."""
00:00:43,00:00:48,"So the guy just continues to deliver extraordinary goods, I've binged it in one go by the way,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,"I don't know if you've seen it, Andy, it's incredible."
00:00:50,00:00:55,"And so yeah, we're very excited because what was he going to talk about, this mystical man,"
00:00:55,00:00:58,"was it going to be ghosts, was it going to be graveyards, was it going to be the history"
00:00:58,00:01:05,"of Norse gods, what was it going to be, Andy, what was it, bagels, bagels, the man loves"
00:01:05,00:01:09,"bagels and he needed to tell us about it, so that's why it's so exciting because Neil"
00:01:09,00:01:11,is a thunder nerd just like us.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"Anyway, that's announcement one, announcement number two, Andy."
00:01:13,00:01:17,The other huge announcement we've got is that we are going to be doing a live show really
00:01:17,00:01:22,"soon, we're going to be at the London Podcast Festival on the 14th of September this year,"
00:01:22,00:01:26,now it's sold out in the room but there are still streaming tickets available and they're
00:01:26,00:01:29,available for a few days after the show so if you buy a ticket you can watch it at your
00:01:29,00:01:32,convenience and there is a really good reason to buy a streaming ticket.
00:01:32,00:01:37,"In fact, there are two reasons, the first reason is that it's going to be our 500th"
00:01:37,00:01:43,"show, we've moved Roman numerals, but the last one we had was C, now we're doing D,"
00:01:43,00:01:44,this is amazing.
00:01:44,00:01:48,"So that's the first big reason, the second big reason is that we have a special guest."
00:01:48,00:01:52,Now in all the months that we've been having special guests since Santa went on maternity
00:01:52,00:01:55,"leave, our guests have been great but there's one guest who we've been really excited to"
00:01:55,00:01:59,"get and for this show, show 500, our special guest is Anna Tyshinski."
00:01:59,00:02:05,"Yes, she's back, we're so excited, Anna will be joining us live on stage so if you want"
00:02:05,00:02:10,"to be part of that party as we're surrounded in giant D balloons, I'm so regretting letting"
00:02:10,00:02:17,"Andy organise the balloons now, you can do that by simply heading to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,"
00:02:17,00:02:21,"you'll find a link to the live stream tickets for the London Podcast Festival, that's where"
00:02:21,00:02:25,"we'll be, if you're a fish accordion, you can chat about it online with everyone else"
00:02:25,00:02:31,as it goes out streaming live and let's make this into a massive party and a proper return
00:02:31,00:02:32,for Anna Tyshinski.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Yeah.
00:02:33,00:02:37,"No such thing as a fish.com/live, get your tickets now, that's it from us on with the"
00:02:37,00:02:38,show.
00:02:38,00:02:41,On with Mr. Gaiman and his bagels.
00:02:41,00:03:01,"Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:03:01,00:03:05,to you this week from four undisclosed locations around the globe.
00:03:05,00:03:10,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:03:10,00:03:15,and Neil Gaiman and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite
00:03:15,00:03:20,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:03:20,00:03:23,Starting with fact number one and that is Neil.
00:03:23,00:03:31,My fact is that the bagel in the form that we know it only ever came to exist through
00:03:31,00:03:38,"Polish anti-Semitism, now I could have gone for something much more sort of easy to chat"
00:03:38,00:03:44,"about with bagels like the fact that every year over 2,000 people are taken to hospital"
00:03:44,00:03:47,in America alone with bagel related injuries.
00:03:47,00:03:51,"Neil I'm going to pause you there, I want to know what a bagel really is and I cannot"
00:03:51,00:03:55,think of anything less likely to injure me than a bagel and I feel like I would have
00:03:55,00:03:59,to be misusing a bagel in some terrible way in order that I would need to go to A&E with
00:03:59,00:04:00,it.
00:04:00,00:04:06,"I can tell you Addy it's cutting them open, it's finger cuts and quite often people try"
00:04:06,00:04:09,and cut them while they're still frozen.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"I do that sometimes, I do that, I try and crack them."
00:04:12,00:04:19,"There was a report 2008, bagel based injuries were the fifth most common injury by knife"
00:04:19,00:04:21,reported to hospitals.
00:04:21,00:04:26,I read that Dan but did you see one of the other four web?
00:04:26,00:04:27,What were they?
00:04:27,00:04:33,"Okay so number one was chicken, chicken based cutting would get you in, number two and I"
00:04:33,00:04:38,"don't know if these are in the right order but the other three are potatoes, apples and"
00:04:38,00:04:40,onions and then you get the bagel.
00:04:40,00:04:44,"Cheese comes afterwards, cheese is very safe to cut."
00:04:44,00:04:47,"In America though they don't really, they just have to take it out of the plastic sheet"
00:04:47,00:04:48,don't they?
00:04:48,00:04:49,"Oh yeah, ouch."
00:04:49,00:04:54,"There we go, a bit of sledging for our American listeners about the quality of your cheese."
00:04:54,00:04:55,Nice try.
00:04:55,00:04:58,But apparently it's so prominent that you would have these bagel based cuts that someone
00:04:58,00:05:02,went in and said the nurse looked at the cut and went were you cutting a bagel?
00:05:02,00:05:07,Because the horizontal cut of the laying down of the bagel would be similar to the cut.
00:05:07,00:05:10,These are all way more wholesome than my interpretation of what you would end up in hospital with a
00:05:10,00:05:11,bagel for.
00:05:11,00:05:12,So that's good.
00:05:12,00:05:13,So good.
00:05:13,00:05:14,So sorry.
00:05:14,00:05:15,Medieval Polish anti-semitism.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Let's get on to the real.
00:05:16,00:05:22,So medieval Polish anti-semitism because the initial way that a bagel was made is it was
00:05:22,00:05:34,"boiled and there were laws enacted in Poland that forbade Jews from touching bread, baking"
00:05:34,00:05:36,bread in particular.
00:05:36,00:05:42,"So when forbidden to bake bread, they made their bread into essentially rings and started"
00:05:42,00:05:46,boiling them and that was where our bagel begins.
00:05:46,00:05:52,I got heavily into bagel making during lockdown in the way that one does.
00:05:52,00:05:59,I had my little pot of sourdough fermenting away in the sideboard and three times a week
00:05:59,00:06:04,I would make my bagels and just started getting into why you boil them.
00:06:04,00:06:05,Okay.
00:06:05,00:06:07,Drop them in boiling water and then they rise.
00:06:07,00:06:14,They float to the top and then and only then do you slam them into the oven and I'm assuming
00:06:14,00:06:18,those original bagels were not even ovened.
00:06:18,00:06:23,I know that there were various sort of laws being enacted and lifted.
00:06:23,00:06:30,At one point there was a very nice Polish princelain Boleslaw in 1264 who actually pronounced
00:06:30,00:06:37,"a law saying Jews may freely buy and sell and touch bread like Christians, which was"
00:06:37,00:06:39,incredibly kind of him.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"I think, I mean, when he says like Christians, I imagine there are still some restrictions"
00:06:42,00:06:44,on Christians just touching all the bread they like.
00:06:44,00:06:48,"I mean, if I was running a bakery, I would not, I would not want people, no matter what"
00:06:48,00:06:50,their creed or denomination to come in and just touch the stuff.
00:06:50,00:06:51,Touch the bread.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Yeah.
00:06:52,00:06:56,"I think their theories were like, well, the few various theories that are part of Cross,"
00:06:56,00:07:00,but like one of them is that obviously bread was used for communion by the Catholics.
00:07:00,00:07:05,"And so there was a worry that if the Jewish people were touching the bread, they might"
00:07:05,00:07:07,touch communion bread.
00:07:07,00:07:12,"There was also at one stage, the idea was that Jewish people were poisoning bread."
00:07:12,00:07:18,"It was basically the anti-semitism of, you know, the Jewish people are trying to kill"
00:07:18,00:07:20,us and they're going to do it through our bread.
00:07:20,00:07:21,You know what I mean?
00:07:21,00:07:26,"So, and the boiling could have been to show that it wasn't poisoned."
00:07:26,00:07:29,"You know, if you boil something, then that shows that there's no poison in there."
00:07:29,00:07:32,"So there's one, that's one theory as to why they're boiled."
00:07:32,00:07:33,Right.
00:07:33,00:07:34,That's so interesting.
00:07:34,00:07:37,Did you guys hear about the Begel Baker's local 338?
00:07:37,00:07:38,No.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"It sounds like a chat line actually, but it's not."
00:07:40,00:07:47,"It's the, they were the group of bakers in New York in the early 20th century and they"
00:07:47,00:07:48,were all Jewish.
00:07:48,00:07:53,"And if you wanted to get in, you had to be able to roll 832 bagels in an hour."
00:07:53,00:07:56,That was the criteria on for entry.
00:07:56,00:07:57,That's a lot.
00:07:57,00:07:58,I know.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"They all had this special bagel muscle on the outside of their elbows, like just pointing"
00:08:01,00:08:02,to it on the screen.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"You can see mine is not very well developed, but it's like here."
00:08:05,00:08:06,So it's just above your elbow?
00:08:06,00:08:08,"Oh, maybe just below actually."
00:08:08,00:08:09,Right.
00:08:09,00:08:10,I think it's the one that's the same as if you opened a lot of bottles of wine.
00:08:10,00:08:12,You get an incredibly strong muscle there.
00:08:12,00:08:13,Don't you really?
00:08:13,00:08:14,Mine is tiny.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"You have a person who does that for you, Andy, don't you?"
00:08:17,00:08:18,Yeah.
00:08:18,00:08:23,"I've got an incredibly strong shouting at the butler muscle, but not the, um, no."
00:08:23,00:08:26,"And so they're like, they were, they were like crazy unionized."
00:08:26,00:08:29,"You know, they had a really good careers, the great pay, great benefits."
00:08:29,00:08:34,"You could take home 24 free bagels every day, every individual baker."
00:08:34,00:08:35,So you're laughing.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"And if they didn't get good contracts, they would go on strike and the city would have"
00:08:38,00:08:40,a terrible bagel drought.
00:08:40,00:08:45,"And then sadly, bagels started to be machine made and, um, they, they all bought the drops."
00:08:45,00:08:48,So when did they actually come up with machine making bagels?
00:08:48,00:08:49,I think it was the fifties.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Yeah.
00:08:50,00:08:51,It was the late fifties.
00:08:51,00:08:52,Yeah.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"It was a guy called Daniel Thompson, wasn't it?"
00:08:55,00:09:02,"And he came up with what he called an apparatus for making a tauroid, but he did say in his"
00:09:02,00:09:06,patent that it was specifically for bagels because people had tried to make bagels using
00:09:06,00:09:11,"donut machines, but the dough was too, too thick so it wouldn't work on the donut machine."
00:09:11,00:09:13,So this was an improvement.
00:09:13,00:09:17,"And the one other thing that Daniel Thompson invented, this is so random, he invented the"
00:09:17,00:09:21,first wheeled folding ping pong table.
00:09:21,00:09:26,"So what two things to give the world, like automatic bagels and the folding ping pong"
00:09:26,00:09:27,table?
00:09:27,00:09:29,What would you headline with on the headstone?
00:09:29,00:09:30,I'm not sure.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"Probably, probably the automatic bagel."
00:09:32,00:09:33,I think so.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Yeah.
00:09:34,00:09:36,I'd go with a bagel because it's changed more light.
00:09:36,00:09:41,So am I right in saying that a common filling for bagels is something called cream cheese
00:09:41,00:09:42,and lox?
00:09:42,00:09:43,Most common.
00:09:43,00:09:44,Has anyone heard that?
00:09:44,00:09:45,Yeah.
00:09:45,00:09:46,You are absolutely.
00:09:46,00:09:47,What's lox?
00:09:47,00:09:48,Smoke salmon.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"Yeah, it's smoke salmon."
00:09:49,00:09:50,Yeah.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Yeah.
00:09:51,00:09:53,The really interesting thing about this is that the word lox hasn't changed in sound
00:09:53,00:09:55,"or meaning for 8,000 years."
00:09:55,00:09:56,Wow.
00:09:56,00:10:01,"And in the English language, we think it's the oldest word that if you got in a time"
00:10:01,00:10:06,"machine and you went back 8,000 years, they wouldn't understand anything that you said"
00:10:06,00:10:11,"apart from if you asked for some lox on your bagels might not have existed then, but if"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"you asked for some lox, they would know what you mean."
00:10:13,00:10:14,Isn't that amazing?
00:10:14,00:10:15,That is amazing.
00:10:15,00:10:21,"And it's a word that they use to kind of prove Proto Indo European, you know, this old language"
00:10:21,00:10:27,that kind of spread out and all the different European and West Asian languages come from.
00:10:27,00:10:33,"They worked that out by using this word lox because it comes in all Germanic, in all sorts"
00:10:33,00:10:34,of different languages.
00:10:34,00:10:35,That's so cool.
00:10:35,00:10:36,This is bizarre.
00:10:36,00:10:41,"I have a link to Proto Indo European and bagels that is not the lox thing here, because"
00:10:41,00:10:44,I was looking up where the word bagel comes from.
00:10:44,00:10:50,"And bagel comes from a Proto Indo European root, which is ""bleeg"", B-H-E-U-G, and it"
00:10:50,00:10:51,means to bend.
00:10:51,00:10:59,"So a bagel is bent into a circle, so there, and ""bleeg"" also features in bow, you know,"
00:10:59,00:11:03,"when you add the verb to bow, it features in bow, like bow and arrow, it features in"
00:11:03,00:11:09,"bow, like the bow of a ship, also bent, elbow, same, yeah."
00:11:09,00:11:14,"And ""buxom"" also is the other word that derives gradually from ""bleeg""."
00:11:14,00:11:18,"So when you've got bagel's elbow, you're doubling up on the bow in the description."
00:11:18,00:11:19,"Oh, that's lovely."
00:11:19,00:11:26,"I love the idea that it's 8,000 years ago, you're wandering around Proto Europe, and"
00:11:26,00:11:33,somehow you're able to persuade somebody to give you a round-ish piece of bread with smoked
00:11:33,00:11:34,salmon on it.
00:11:34,00:11:39,"Cream cheese, by the way, the most famous type in Britain, at least, and I think probably"
00:11:39,00:11:41,"in America, is made in which city?"
00:11:41,00:11:42,Philadelphia.
00:11:42,00:11:47,"I'm afraid not, it was invented in New York, but it was named Philadelphia because the"
00:11:47,00:11:52,Philadelphia area was so famous for making good dairy products that they wanted to name
00:11:52,00:11:55,"it after this area, but it was actually invented in New York."
00:11:55,00:11:56,All right.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"So now you're saying American cheese is good, James."
00:11:58,00:12:02,Interesting about face we've gone on this podcast.
00:12:02,00:12:06,"Just very quickly, just while we were talking about the words for bagel, what's quite surprising"
00:12:06,00:12:11,"is that up until 1951, bagel wasn't really a known word outside of the Jewish communities"
00:12:11,00:12:13,in the major cities of America.
00:12:13,00:12:17,So it was in 1951 that when The New York Times was writing an article about the strike that
00:12:17,00:12:21,"was happening, that they actually had to provide a pronunciation guide to show it."
00:12:21,00:12:26,"So B-A-Y-G-L-E, just that's how this word that you're now reading is pronounced."
00:12:26,00:12:27,It's quite amazing.
00:12:27,00:12:32,"My mother, who is 89, whenever the subject of bagels comes up, as it doesn't as often"
00:12:32,00:12:39,"as you'd expect, always gets a little bit aggrieved because she's like, ""It's not bagel."
00:12:39,00:12:40,"It's bagel."""
00:12:40,00:12:41,I-I-G-L.
00:12:41,00:12:48,"And she says, ""I know that because my mother's aunt and uncle, Rosie and Mick, owned the"
00:12:48,00:12:52,Johnny Isaacs Fish and Ship Shop in the East End.
00:12:52,00:12:58,"And outside the Fish and Ship Shop, there was the little old bagel lady."
00:12:58,00:13:04,And my mother is still slightly put out about the fact that the pronunciation has gone bagel
00:13:04,00:13:07,"because all of her childhood, they were bagels."""
00:13:07,00:13:08,That's right.
00:13:08,00:13:14,There's a book on the bagel that was written by a lady called Maria Walenska and she finds
00:13:14,00:13:18,an old pretzel tin and it's got bagel on it as a name.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"And it turns out that there was a family in Poland called bagel, who were part of the"
00:13:22,00:13:25,Jewish baking community in pre-Nazi Krakow.
00:13:25,00:13:30,"And she thinks, ""Ah, is that where bagel first originated from as a term?"""
00:13:30,00:13:32,"There is another Krakow link, weirdly."
00:13:32,00:13:37,And this is like the origin of the bagel because there's a story that it came from
00:13:37,00:13:44,"the Siege of Vienna in 1683 when the Ottomans besieged Vienna and, you know, there was to"
00:13:44,00:13:47,"celebrate the victory and the breaking of that siege, blah, blah, blah."
00:13:47,00:13:48,It's not true.
00:13:48,00:13:53,"I mean, no, it's not true because at least 70 years before that, in a Jewish Krakow, there"
00:13:53,00:13:59,"was a statute saying, ""You are allowed to give bagels to a woman who's given birth."""
00:13:59,00:14:00,It was a kind of fertility thing.
00:14:00,00:14:04,"It was a kind of, if the woman's given birth, you give her a bagel, give the midwife a bagel."
00:14:04,00:14:07,"Any women or girls who were present at the birth, they get a bagel too."
00:14:07,00:14:08,You get a bagel.
00:14:08,00:14:09,You get a bagel.
00:14:09,00:14:10,I think it's because it's ring-shaped.
00:14:10,00:14:12,It's sort of as a fertility thing.
00:14:12,00:14:17,"Is it like what you were thinking about how you would end up in the emergency room, Sandy?"
00:14:17,00:14:19,It's not far away from that case.
00:14:19,00:14:22,It's pretty close.
00:14:22,00:14:30,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:30,00:14:35,"Okay, my fact this week is that it's actually not that bad to spend eternity pushing a boulder"
00:14:35,00:14:39,up a hill for it only to roll down again every time.
00:14:39,00:14:40,Sure.
00:14:40,00:14:44,That's how I perceive making this podcast.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"Yeah, it's not that bad after all."
00:14:47,00:14:52,"It's supposed to be this eternal punishment, and it's kind of fine."
00:14:52,00:14:56,"So this is Sisyphus, and it's the great Greek mythology story, right?"
00:14:56,00:15:00,Pushing a boulder up a hill but can never make it up to the top is the punishment.
00:15:00,00:15:01,That's right.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"You never hear him complaining, do you?"
00:15:03,00:15:04,Or does he?
00:15:04,00:15:07,It's definitely a punishment from the gods.
00:15:07,00:15:08,It is a punishment.
00:15:08,00:15:14,"Look, this is something that I read, a study called Idleness aversion and a need for justifiable"
00:15:14,00:15:19,"busyness, which was a study from 2010 from the University of Chicago, University of Shanghai"
00:15:19,00:15:24,"and a few other places, which I read about in improbable.com, run by our friends, that"
00:15:24,00:15:25,website.
00:15:25,00:15:31,And the idea is that now that humans don't have to spend their day just trying to survive
00:15:31,00:15:36,"and run away from lions and collect food and all that kind of stuff, we need to be kept"
00:15:36,00:15:38,busy in order to be happy.
00:15:38,00:15:42,And what they did was they did an experiment where people were in a room and they had to
00:15:42,00:15:44,do a survey.
00:15:44,00:15:47,"And then at the end of the survey, they had to take their paper either to the front of"
00:15:47,00:15:53,"the room or they had to walk 10 minutes to another place and put their paper there, right?"
00:15:53,00:15:58,"And in both places, they'll get some candy as a thanks for doing the survey."
00:15:58,00:16:01,"Now when they did that study, most people just went for the box, which was right next"
00:16:01,00:16:04,"to them because why not, it's right there."
00:16:04,00:16:08,But when they told them that in one of the places it'll be plain chocolate and the other
00:16:08,00:16:14,"place it'll be dark chocolate, more than 50% of them would start going the 10 minute walk"
00:16:14,00:16:20,"and the 10 minute walk back, rather than just doing the short one and then waiting for everyone"
00:16:20,00:16:22,to come back from wherever they've been.
00:16:22,00:16:27,So people would rather go and get the candy than sit around the idly for 20 minutes waiting.
00:16:27,00:16:31,"And the weird thing is, no matter what you did, if you put the milk chocolate in one"
00:16:31,00:16:36,"place and the dark chocolate in another, all you swapped it around, people still make that"
00:16:36,00:16:37,walk.
00:16:37,00:16:42,And the idea is that people prefer to do something rather than sitting around doing nothing when
00:16:42,00:16:44,they think they're going to get something for their efforts.
00:16:44,00:16:48,"And it doesn't matter what the thing is that you think you're going to get for your efforts,"
00:16:48,00:16:49,you're going to do something.
00:16:49,00:16:52,"Yeah, that's very clever experiment design because otherwise it would have turned into"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"a referendum on which is better, plain chocolate or dark chocolate."
00:16:54,00:16:56,That's an unintended consequence.
00:16:56,00:17:00,And so what they thought was these people who did the study and they speculate about
00:17:00,00:17:05,it in their paper is that people are just happier when they're given something to do
00:17:05,00:17:10,"and the Sisyphus, which they actually mentioned in the paper, Sisyphus would be happier rolling"
00:17:10,00:17:15,the rock up and down the hill every single day and then it goes to the bottom and he
00:17:15,00:17:17,has to do it again and do it again and do it again.
00:17:17,00:17:22,You'd be happier doing that than if he spent all of eternity just sitting around twiddling
00:17:22,00:17:23,his thumbs doing nothing.
00:17:23,00:17:24,And that's the idea.
00:17:24,00:17:29,"Yeah, I mean, they mentioned things in the paper that's written in the science paper"
00:17:29,00:17:34,where they say homeowners may increase the happiness of their ideal housekeepers by letting
00:17:34,00:17:37,in some mice and prompting the housekeepers to clean up.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"Yeah, I did read that."
00:17:39,00:17:42,"Yeah, governments may increase the happiness of idle citizens by having them build bridges"
00:17:42,00:17:44,that are actually useless.
00:17:44,00:17:48,"And then they put in practical examples where people have done this, where they've shown"
00:17:48,00:17:53,that by stopping the idleness that happiness is hopefully increased and that's in airports
00:17:53,00:17:58,and that is extending the distance between getting off the plane and the baggage carousel
00:17:58,00:18:02,so that you don't just get straight there and then you're idly waiting for the bags
00:18:02,00:18:03,to come out.
00:18:03,00:18:06,That's the idea is that at least you're walking to something and you're using up the time.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:08,I don't know if that's true.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"I think that one is apocryphal, isn't it?"
00:18:09,00:18:13,Or it's not absolutely nailed on because I think the claim is that Houston Airport
00:18:13,00:18:16,did that because they were getting loads of people complaining because the plane landed
00:18:16,00:18:19,a minute from the baggage carousel and then they had to hang around waiting.
00:18:19,00:18:23,And then when they just switched the arrival gate and sent the bags so that people had
00:18:23,00:18:27,"to walk for the eight minutes basically before the bags got to the thing, then complaints"
00:18:27,00:18:28,dropped.
00:18:28,00:18:31,"So yeah, Sisyphus founded Corinth."
00:18:31,00:18:35,I've been to the hill which he pushed the rock up supposedly.
00:18:35,00:18:36,"Oh, really?"
00:18:36,00:18:38,He was on the outskirts of Corinth.
00:18:38,00:18:39,"What, so did he complete the gig?"
00:18:39,00:18:42,"No, but it's like a story, isn't it?"
00:18:42,00:18:43,"Yeah, it's like a story."
00:18:43,00:18:47,"So the people of Corinth say, oh, this is the hill or the tall guide says this is the hill"
00:18:47,00:18:48,which he did it.
00:18:48,00:18:49,Very cool.
00:18:49,00:18:56,I disgraced myself as a mythologist and as somebody who's written books on mythology
00:18:56,00:19:02,and written stories set in mythological times and even had Sisyphus as a character.
00:19:02,00:19:08,The one place in literature he gets to stop rolling his rock is when Orpheus goes to the
00:19:08,00:19:10,underworld and sings and I've written that.
00:19:10,00:19:14,And I just realized I'd completely forgotten what he did to be punished to do that.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"Is he one of the ones who accidentally, did he feed the gods his son accidentally?"
00:19:18,00:19:20,Was he one of those?
00:19:20,00:19:21,"No, it wasn't."
00:19:21,00:19:22,"It was Zeus, wasn't it?"
00:19:22,00:19:23,Yeah.
00:19:23,00:19:24,He tricked Zeus.
00:19:24,00:19:25,He did it twice.
00:19:25,00:19:26,"Basically, it was a second offence."
00:19:26,00:19:28,I think that was something where the gods get really annoyed with you.
00:19:28,00:19:34,So the first thing was that Zeus had run off with a woman and Sisyphus had seen it happening
00:19:34,00:19:37,and he snitched on Zeus.
00:19:37,00:19:41,"And so Zeus decided, well, I'm going to strike you down with a thunderbolt."
00:19:41,00:19:46,And then he tried to cheat death by chaining death up so that he couldn't take him to
00:19:46,00:19:47,the underworld.
00:19:47,00:19:54,And then a second time he tried to cheat death by saying that he needed to go up to see his
00:19:54,00:19:57,wife because his wife hadn't done a proper funeral or something.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:58,00:19:59,He'd already instructed his wife.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"He said to his wife, don't bury me."
00:20:01,00:20:02,Right.
00:20:02,00:20:03,This is going to be great.
00:20:03,00:20:05,"And then when he got to Hades, he said, oh, I haven't had a proper funeral."
00:20:05,00:20:08,So I need to go and punish my wife and arrange the proper funeral.
00:20:08,00:20:11,"And then when he got back, he just reunited with his wife."
00:20:11,00:20:15,"And they said, well, if you're going to try and stop, you know, dying and try and stop"
00:20:15,00:20:18,"death in general, because he tried to stop death for the whole of the world."
00:20:18,00:20:21,"They said, well, we're going to make death really, really shitty for you."
00:20:21,00:20:25,"I got to say, it's one of the, it's, I think the punishments are really good in Greek myths."
00:20:25,00:20:26,I'd never heard of this one.
00:20:26,00:20:27,This is Ockness.
00:20:27,00:20:28,Have you heard of Ockness?
00:20:28,00:20:30,"I mean, maybe Neil, you've written about Ockness."
00:20:30,00:20:31,I don't know.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Tell me about Ockness.
00:20:32,00:20:33,So Ockness is punishment.
00:20:33,00:20:37,"I actually don't know what the crime was, but he had to perpetually weave a rope out of"
00:20:37,00:20:38,straw.
00:20:38,00:20:43,"But no matter how fast he wove the rope, the rope that he's already woven gets eaten"
00:20:43,00:20:44,by a donkey.
00:20:44,00:20:49,And I have to say that sounds like a sort of holiday activity to me.
00:20:49,00:20:50,Yeah.
00:20:50,00:20:51,You just have to weave some rope.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Do you think?
00:20:52,00:20:53,And you get to be friends with a donkey.
00:20:53,00:20:55,"Well, it's not having your liver eaten every day."
00:20:55,00:20:57,Is it pecked at by a bird while you're trained to a rock?
00:20:57,00:20:58,Yeah.
00:20:58,00:20:59,It's very much like parking a fence level of punishment.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"That's how much you like weaving, isn't it?"
00:21:01,00:21:02,"Well, that's true."
00:21:02,00:21:04,"And there's always a thing of, oh, in life, he hated weaving."
00:21:04,00:21:08,"So actually, yeah, that was his least favorite activity and yeah."
00:21:08,00:21:13,"There was Ixion who was a murderer, killed his father-in-law."
00:21:13,00:21:17,The first man guilty of kinslaying in Greek mythology.
00:21:17,00:21:24,And he got bound to a burning wheel and his wheels spun across the heavens.
00:21:24,00:21:25,Oh my goodness.
00:21:25,00:21:29,I would say definitely take the weaving ahead of that.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Exactly.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Yeah.
00:21:31,00:21:32,That's amazing.
00:21:32,00:21:35,I was trying to find out whether or not there are any modern examples of someone trying
00:21:35,00:21:39,to push something up a hill and finding it quite hard.
00:21:39,00:21:46,"Last year, 2022, a Colorado man attempted to ascend to the top of a 14,115-foot mountain"
00:21:46,00:21:52,called Pike's Peak on his hands and knees while trying to push a peanut to the top of
00:21:52,00:21:55,the hill using his nose.
00:21:55,00:21:56,So you can see footage of this.
00:21:56,00:22:00,He has a mask on his face where there's a sort of black spoon that's attached to the
00:22:00,00:22:02,front of his nose.
00:22:02,00:22:03,He starts at the bottom.
00:22:03,00:22:04,He's got the peanut there.
00:22:04,00:22:09,He brought multiple peanuts because it turns out he's not the first person to do this.
00:22:09,00:22:12,He's the fourth in Colorado history.
00:22:12,00:22:18,The first person to do it was in 1929 and it took three weeks for that person to do.
00:22:18,00:22:21,But squirrels were stealing the peanuts and so the efforts were quite messed up.
00:22:21,00:22:26,So he has multiple peanuts that he took with him on this trip and it took him seven days
00:22:26,00:22:27,but he got there.
00:22:27,00:22:29,But is he going on hands and knees?
00:22:29,00:22:30,"Yeah, hands and knees."
00:22:30,00:22:31,Yeah.
00:22:31,00:22:35,It feels so painful.
00:22:35,00:22:37,Does he take the peanut back down afterwards?
00:22:37,00:22:39,"That feels easier, doesn't it?"
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Yeah, kicking it in the air."
00:22:40,00:22:44,Or is there a miniature can of three previous peanuts that have been there and he's just
00:22:44,00:22:45,adding to it.
00:22:45,00:22:46,"Oh yeah, yeah, like a Hall of Fame."
00:22:46,00:22:48,It sounds like a weirdly sound.
00:22:48,00:22:50,There must be more going on in Colorado.
00:22:50,00:22:53,"If you're in Colorado and you're listening to this, please write it and tell us what"
00:22:53,00:22:55,else there is to do.
00:22:55,00:22:56,I have a couple more boredom things.
00:22:56,00:23:01,So there was a study in 2021 about what people are willing to do when they are bored and
00:23:01,00:23:05,whether it changes people's perceptions of morality or what they're prepared to do.
00:23:05,00:23:09,"This study found that if you ask people to watch a boring 20 minute long video, people"
00:23:09,00:23:13,are more willing to shred maggots in a grinder.
00:23:13,00:23:16,The scientists gave people a few maggots and they even named them.
00:23:16,00:23:19,They called them Toto Tee-Fee in Kiki.
00:23:19,00:23:20,They left people.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"They said, ""Look, I'm just going to pop out of the room while you watch this video for"
00:23:24,00:23:25,20 minutes.
00:23:25,00:23:31,"Here, Toto Tee-Fee in Kiki, here's your grinder and just have a great time."""
00:23:31,00:23:32,No.
00:23:32,00:23:33,Way more people.
00:23:33,00:23:34,So it wasn't everyone.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"Sorry, Andy."
00:23:35,00:23:39,"They must have put the idea into their heads that the maggots can go into the grinder,"
00:23:39,00:23:40,surely.
00:23:40,00:23:46,"If you leave someone with a maggot and a grinder, you can only combine those things in one way."
00:23:46,00:23:50,"So it wasn't everyone by a long way, but 67 people who watched the very, very dull video."
00:23:50,00:23:51,Out of how many?
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Sorry, that was the total."
00:23:52,00:23:55,So 67 people watched this dull video.
00:23:55,00:24:00,"Of them, 12 dropped a maggot in and obviously there was a control group."
00:24:00,00:24:04,"When they got to watch an interesting documentary, I don't know, maybe an Attenborough, maybe"
00:24:04,00:24:08,"a Thiru, doesn't matter, it was just one person out of 62."
00:24:08,00:24:10,"Well it makes a difference, actually, Andy."
00:24:10,00:24:15,"If they're watching like a nature documentary, then they might feel more empathetic towards"
00:24:15,00:24:16,the maggots.
00:24:16,00:24:17,True.
00:24:17,00:24:19,But all they might feel empathetic towards the lions.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"You know, nature's grinder."
00:24:20,00:24:21,That's true.
00:24:21,00:24:26,"Anyway, you will be relieved to hear that no maggots were actually ground up."
00:24:26,00:24:27,It was a fake machine.
00:24:27,00:24:28,"Oh, was it?"
00:24:28,00:24:29,They had a fake grinder.
00:24:29,00:24:30,"Wow, yeah."
00:24:30,00:24:31,That's funny.
00:24:31,00:24:32,I've seen one of those before.
00:24:32,00:24:33,Really?
00:24:33,00:24:36,"And I did an escape room where I had to put my hand in a food processor to get the key,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,"but obviously it was a fake one, but they didn't tell you it was a fake one."
00:24:39,00:24:44,"Oh, so you were willing to grind up your hand for the sake of getting a clue?"
00:24:44,00:24:49,I was quite aware that we were in a controlled environment that they wouldn't let me do that.
00:24:49,00:24:54,"They wouldn't let me mutilate myself, so I was fairly certain that if there was a real"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"food processor there, someone would come over the tannoy saying, ""Don't do that."""
00:24:57,00:25:04,"You know, you meet an awful lot of one-handed men around here who were equally as certain."
00:25:04,00:25:06,"I've done an escape room with you, James."
00:25:06,00:25:09,It doesn't surprise me in the least that you'd be willing to risk serious physical
00:25:09,00:25:12,injury to get a personal best.
00:25:12,00:25:13,It's true.
00:25:13,00:25:17,"Here's an interesting thing that I've been reading about, and I don't know."
00:25:17,00:25:20,"It's quite complicated, so let's see where it goes."
00:25:20,00:25:25,"I was reading about neuroscience, and there is a theory in neuroscience at the moment"
00:25:25,00:25:30,that the human brain is only built to solve one problem.
00:25:30,00:25:33,What is the best way to cut into this bagel?
00:25:33,00:25:36,What am I going to eat?
00:25:36,00:25:37,What am I going to eat?
00:25:37,00:25:38,Next.
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Yeah, I see what you mean."
00:25:39,00:25:43,"Yeah, I think all of these could be subcategories of what these neuroscientists are saying."
00:25:43,00:25:47,They reckon that your brain is created to make sure you don't have any surprises in
00:25:47,00:25:48,your life.
00:25:48,00:25:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:49,00:25:53,"And basically everything you do, everything that your brain does is trying to stop that"
00:25:53,00:25:59,"from happening, and that's the reason why people like routine because they know that"
00:25:59,00:26:02,"there's not going to be any surprises, and it'll be the same all the time."
00:26:02,00:26:07,"But it also, in theory, explains people being curious and people inventing new things because"
00:26:07,00:26:12,what you're doing is you're slightly pushing the boundaries so you can test it and so that
00:26:12,00:26:16,your brain doesn't get surprised if anything beyond those boundaries happens.
00:26:16,00:26:20,And I just find that a really interesting idea that this incredibly complicated thing
00:26:20,00:26:25,"in your head is only really trying to do one thing, but it just, everything else feeds"
00:26:25,00:26:26,from that.
00:26:26,00:26:33,"I feel like, what about, I mean, I feel like I like to be surprised by works of art, like"
00:26:33,00:26:34,a book or a film.
00:26:34,00:26:39,"I will like a surprise, but to be fair, I only like a surprise within certain parameters."
00:26:39,00:26:42,"So if I'm going to see Mission Impossible 7, there is a set number of things which I'm"
00:26:42,00:26:48,"prepared to adore, but if they introduce like a time travel thing, I will be unpleasantly"
00:26:48,00:26:49,surprised by that.
00:26:49,00:26:57,It's like the idea that what you want when you're seeing a film is for it all to end
00:26:57,00:27:02,"in the way that you wanted it to, but not in the way you were expecting."
00:27:02,00:27:03,That's nice.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Yeah.
00:27:04,00:27:08,You need surprise parameters because at the moment where you can literally call off every
00:27:08,00:27:15,"beat in a film by the numbers, you start looking around for maggots to grind."
00:27:15,00:27:20,"Whenever I watch an episode of the Big Bang Theory, the maggot toll is absolutely astronomical"
00:27:20,00:27:21,by the end of the 20 minutes.
00:27:21,00:27:22,Wow.
00:27:22,00:27:25,"It's been a while since you had to go the Big Bang Theory, Andy."
00:27:25,00:27:26,That's a callback.
00:27:26,00:27:27,We're a geek show.
00:27:27,00:27:31,"I'm trying to surprise our listeners, but within, like, people know my limited range"
00:27:31,00:27:32,of references.
00:27:32,00:27:33,That's one.
00:27:33,00:27:36,That's half our listeners you've just offended.
00:27:36,00:27:38,I was on the Big Bang Theory.
00:27:38,00:27:39,I was a guest star.
00:27:39,00:27:40,I played Neil Gaiman.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"Oh, wow."
00:27:41,00:27:42,I didn't mean that episode.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Obviously.
00:27:43,00:27:47,That's the one where no maggots went were hard in watching this episode.
00:27:47,00:27:49,What were you doing on it?
00:27:49,00:27:56,"It was an episode about a comet, and it begins with the gang up on the roof looking at the"
00:27:56,00:28:02,"stars, and one of them gets a note saying, ""Oh, my God, Neil Gaiman was in my shop and"
00:28:02,00:28:07,"he tweeted about it,"" and they're all sort of vaguely baffled because obviously they"
00:28:07,00:28:12,"would have known, and then you cut to me in the shop trying to join their conversation"
00:28:12,00:28:14,and being rudely rebuffed and insulted.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Nice.
00:28:15,00:28:17,It's kind of fun.
00:28:17,00:28:24,I now have this peculiar tiny career of playing versions of Neil Gaiman in shows of which
00:28:24,00:28:30,"the best one of all is still The Simpsons, because I got to be an evil, murdering book"
00:28:30,00:28:38,"thief who turns out couldn't even read and who poisons somebody in the final moment,"
00:28:38,00:28:42,"so it was kind of, I like him best."
00:28:42,00:28:50,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:28:50,00:28:56,My fact is that beekeeping was only legalized in Minneapolis in 2009.
00:28:56,00:28:57,I knew this.
00:28:57,00:29:04,"I knew this because I was a beekeeper, a little way out of Minneapolis."
00:29:04,00:29:11,"I lived at the time in Little Town, an hour's drive from Minneapolis, and I would have sad,"
00:29:11,00:29:19,"nervous, mini-apoletans come over to my house and gaze longingly at my bees and exclaim"
00:29:19,00:29:20,that...
00:29:20,00:29:21,Right.
00:29:21,00:29:23,You weren't in the band zone.
00:29:23,00:29:25,You were far enough out of the city there.
00:29:25,00:29:30,"I was far enough out, I was far enough away that my bees were entirely legal bees."
00:29:30,00:29:35,"What would happen, Neil, what would happen if your bees flew over the state lines as"
00:29:35,00:29:38,it were into anti-bee territory?
00:29:38,00:29:39,Great point.
00:29:39,00:29:46,"I think nobody would actually have put little trackers on them to find out, but actually"
00:29:46,00:29:52,"I believe bees have a maximum five mile radius, so I think my bees would have been okay unless"
00:29:52,00:29:56,I decided to drive them to Minneapolis just for a day out.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"Come on bees, we're going to see the world."
00:29:58,00:30:00,I will show you the sights of Minneapolis.
00:30:00,00:30:03,I'll show you Minneapolis and Paul Airport.
00:30:03,00:30:05,I will show you all these exciting things.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"Yeah, it was really strict."
00:30:07,00:30:09,"I think it was because it was an urban environment, basically."
00:30:09,00:30:12,"It was saying, look, this is a built-up area."
00:30:12,00:30:16,You can't have just hundreds of thousands of bees around the place.
00:30:16,00:30:21,"Even when they legalized it, you had to get permission from 80% of property owners within"
00:30:21,00:30:23,250 feet of your home.
00:30:23,00:30:24,That's a lot.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"If you live somewhere with apartments, you might have to ask a hundred different people's"
00:30:27,00:30:32,"permission and get 80 of them to sign off on it, I think they've slightly loosened up"
00:30:32,00:30:33,a bit since then.
00:30:33,00:30:37,"I suppose if you live in an apartment in a tower block, you probably don't have much"
00:30:37,00:30:38,room for bees anyway.
00:30:38,00:30:40,"No, I think that's true."
00:30:40,00:30:46,"Also, it might be a bit cruel if you don't have the flower space, because you can't just"
00:30:46,00:30:49,keep bees in a box.
00:30:49,00:30:50,You can keep them in a box.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"Well, I mean, you do keep them in a box."
00:30:52,00:30:53,Sorry.
00:30:53,00:30:54,"You have to, in fact."
00:30:54,00:30:55,Right.
00:30:55,00:30:56,That's kind of the rule.
00:30:56,00:31:03,"I was reading about Utah, the Beehive State, and in Utah, it is illegal to keep bees unless"
00:31:03,00:31:04,you have government permission.
00:31:04,00:31:10,"You need a license, basically, so just not any old person can have bees in Utah, either."
00:31:10,00:31:12,But the state emblem is the Beehive.
00:31:12,00:31:15,You might have seen it on the Utah flags and stuff.
00:31:15,00:31:16,It's like that sort of --
00:31:16,00:31:17,The skip.
00:31:17,00:31:18,It's that one.
00:31:18,00:31:19,It's called a skip.
00:31:19,00:31:20,It's called a skip.
00:31:20,00:31:24,They were made of woven straw.
00:31:24,00:31:29,"They'd weave straw together and circle it, and that was what bees were in until Mr. Langstruth"
00:31:29,00:31:33,came along and invented the modern hive.
00:31:33,00:31:37,"Yeah, and these modern hives, they have things that you can pull out."
00:31:37,00:31:38,Is that right?
00:31:38,00:31:39,They do.
00:31:39,00:31:43,The biggest problem with the initial bee skeptes was that you had to destroy the skip to get
00:31:43,00:31:45,to the honey.
00:31:45,00:31:54,"So they didn't have openings, and what Langstruth came up with was hives with removable slats"
00:31:54,00:31:58,exploiting the concept of bee space.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"Okay, so bee space."
00:32:00,00:32:02,Can I just be boring for a moment?
00:32:02,00:32:03,"Yeah, go for it."
00:32:03,00:32:04,I love bee space.
00:32:04,00:32:07,They put those maggots away.
00:32:07,00:32:14,So the way that bees work is bees are kind of like people in rooms.
00:32:14,00:32:19,"If a bee sees something that is room size for a bee, which is to say more than twice"
00:32:19,00:32:25,"the size of a bee, or twice the size of one bee climbing over another bee, it will try"
00:32:25,00:32:26,and fill it with comb.
00:32:26,00:32:31,"If it sees something much smaller, it will seal it off."
00:32:31,00:32:39,"However, if you get your bee space right, a bee will regard your bee space as a corridor"
00:32:39,00:32:43,and not build comb and so on and so forth.
00:32:43,00:32:50,"So Langstruth's genius was to figure out bee space, figure out the exact size and shape"
00:32:50,00:32:57,"of one of these hives that you put the slats in, but it was basically unpatentable."
00:32:57,00:33:04,"The moment he had discovered it and figured it out, every farmer with nails and a tape"
00:33:04,00:33:08,measure could build their own hives.
00:33:08,00:33:14,"So his discovery caught on immediately and hugely, but he was not a happy man."
00:33:14,00:33:16,"Yeah, he seems an interesting guy."
00:33:16,00:33:21,So he was a pastor and he was going over to one of his parish members and he noticed that
00:33:21,00:33:25,"they had a bowl of comb honey and he thought, wow, this is pretty tasty."
00:33:25,00:33:26,This is pretty amazing.
00:33:26,00:33:27,"And he said, where did you get it from?"
00:33:27,00:33:30,And he was led to the attic where he was shown near an open window.
00:33:30,00:33:35,"There was a hive there and he just immediately went, this is what I want to be doing."
00:33:35,00:33:38,This makes me happy because he was suffering from bouts to depression.
00:33:38,00:33:41,There's quotes from him saying that he would ask for his books to be hidden away from him
00:33:41,00:33:46,"because even the letter B, seeing the letter B would just make him miss his own bees and"
00:33:46,00:33:50,go into a sadness while he couldn't leave the house.
00:33:50,00:33:51,Yeah.
00:33:51,00:33:57,"So he was deeply troubled, happy, I mean, happy Earth Day to you, but quite an extraordinary"
00:33:57,00:33:59,character when you read into a story.
00:33:59,00:34:04,"And those hives now, a lot of states, you have to use those, don't you?"
00:34:04,00:34:07,"You can't use the old skeptics, you have to use these ones."
00:34:07,00:34:10,"So I'm thinking of the like the filing cabinet where you like the filing, hanging cabinet"
00:34:10,00:34:11,"where you, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:11,00:34:12,Exactly like that.
00:34:12,00:34:14,"Which was a bit of first, that beehive or the filing cabinet, because I feel like they've"
00:34:14,00:34:15,nicked from each other.
00:34:15,00:34:17,One is based on the other surely.
00:34:17,00:34:18,Interesting.
00:34:18,00:34:20,I don't know that actually.
00:34:20,00:34:21,Filing cabinet early 20th century.
00:34:21,00:34:22,I know.
00:34:22,00:34:24,"I mean, these beehives sound like they were early 20th century."
00:34:24,00:34:25,Yeah.
00:34:25,00:34:26,Unless this guy was...
00:34:26,00:34:27,1851 is when he...
00:34:27,00:34:28,"Oh, okay."
00:34:28,00:34:29,I think beehives first.
00:34:29,00:34:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:34:30,00:34:31,Wow.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"So maybe the filing cabinet has borrowed from nature's filing cabinet, the beehive."
00:34:34,00:34:37,"Which is not nature's, because it was invented by a human."
00:34:37,00:34:38,"Yes, yes."
00:34:38,00:34:41,"Well, that in itself is thought provoking, I think."
00:34:41,00:34:49,"Invented by a human, but exploiting this 60 million year old insect who is astoundingly,"
00:34:49,00:34:55,"you know, I mean, things like the use of the hexagon, because it's the most efficient use"
00:34:55,00:34:57,of wax and stuff in the...
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:35:00,I get all excited about bees.
00:35:00,00:35:02,Did you get stung much?
00:35:02,00:35:06,"Obviously, I'm sure you had all the beekeeping kit when you were doing it."
00:35:06,00:35:13,I got stung about four or five times during the course of the six or seven years that
00:35:13,00:35:14,I was actively beekeeping.
00:35:14,00:35:15,"Oh, wow."
00:35:15,00:35:16,I just kind of liked that.
00:35:16,00:35:22,I felt like everybody should have a hobby that could kill them.
00:35:22,00:35:27,"Mostly it would be my own fault, and it got a little more stressful."
00:35:27,00:35:35,"One day I got stung, and all of a sudden my hand blew up like an inflated rubber glove,"
00:35:35,00:35:40,"and my breathing went a wonky, and I went, ""Oh, this is that anaphylactic shock thing."
00:35:40,00:35:44,"This is actually, it's now happening, it's been primed."""
00:35:44,00:35:49,"So I had to go and buy EpiPens for future beekeeping, just in case, but did not get"
00:35:49,00:35:51,stung after that.
00:35:51,00:35:59,Very recently a beekeeper who had a very distinguished job of looking after the queen's bees was
00:35:59,00:36:05,"given the task of having to tell the bees that the queen had died, and this is an old tradition"
00:36:05,00:36:11,"of when there's a notable death within a family that owns hives that the bees need to be informed,"
00:36:11,00:36:16,and you need to put black ribbon on the outside of the hive and so on in order to show that
00:36:16,00:36:17,there's mourning.
00:36:17,00:36:23,"And so the queen has had for the last 15 years of her life, John Chappell, who was the official"
00:36:23,00:36:29,"palace beekeeper, and that was his job to do, except for some reason he had no idea"
00:36:29,00:36:31,that that was a tradition.
00:36:31,00:36:37,"So on the day that the queen passes away, an email pings up in his email box saying from"
00:36:37,00:36:40,"the head gardener, ""Have you told the bees?"""
00:36:40,00:36:45,"He must have thought that was a very par-taste, that joke."
00:36:45,00:36:46,"Yeah, exactly."
00:36:46,00:36:50,"So he had to go around and he had to tell the bees, he had to say the line, ""The mistress"
00:36:50,00:36:55,"is dead, but don't you go, your master will be a good master to you."""
00:36:55,00:36:59,"And that was how he broke the news to the queen's bees, that she was gone."
00:36:59,00:37:00,It was a tradition.
00:37:00,00:37:05,"You tell the bees not just of deaths, but important family news."
00:37:05,00:37:08,There's even a Kipling poem about it.
00:37:08,00:37:09,Right.
00:37:09,00:37:10,"Did you tell the bees stuff, Neil?"
00:37:10,00:37:14,Did you just pop down and was there a benchmark of the kind of news that you would impart
00:37:14,00:37:16,"and then stuff, he's like, ""Oh, they won't be interested."""
00:37:16,00:37:18,There's two smaller deals.
00:37:18,00:37:21,"You know, I would never tell them to sort of casual internet gossip, because I figure"
00:37:21,00:37:23,bees are above that kind of thing.
00:37:23,00:37:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:24,00:37:28,"But I would tell, you know, I love the idea of being part of the beekeeper tradition."
00:37:28,00:37:33,So there were definitely a couple of times when I would tell bees things and I'd just
00:37:33,00:37:39,"go down to the hives and say, ""Right, my son is engaged."""
00:37:39,00:37:45,But I just quickly say one or two things that are illegal in Minneapolis.
00:37:45,00:37:47,So I've checked this for sure.
00:37:47,00:37:49,I've checked in the code.
00:37:49,00:37:51,This definitely exists in Minnesota law.
00:37:51,00:37:54,So this is the whole of the state of Minnesota.
00:37:54,00:38:01,"No person shall operate, run or participate in a contest game or other like activity in"
00:38:01,00:38:07,"which a pig greased, oiled or otherwise is released and wherein the object is the capture"
00:38:07,00:38:13,"of the pig, or in which a chicken or turkey is released or thrown into the air and wherein"
00:38:13,00:38:16,the object is to capture the chicken or the turkey.
00:38:16,00:38:21,"Some laws, it feels like some laws are made out of basic principles, right, like stealing"
00:38:21,00:38:22,or murdering or whatever.
00:38:22,00:38:25,And it feels like some laws are created in response to specific incidents which have
00:38:25,00:38:26,gone badly wrong.
00:38:26,00:38:29,And you're saying this might be the latter?
00:38:29,00:38:32,"I think it might be, yeah."
00:38:32,00:38:38,"Yeah, so pig greased, pig chasing is explicitly illegal in Minnesota."
00:38:38,00:38:42,"And if you go on the internet, you'll see a lot of people saying that it's illegal to"
00:38:42,00:38:46,"cross the Minnesota, Wisconsin border with a duck on your head."
00:38:46,00:38:52,"Apparently, this isn't true and it's because there was a thing called cotton duck."
00:38:52,00:38:56,"And cotton duck was the type of woven cotton fabric which comes from the Dutch for linen,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,which is duck.
00:38:58,00:39:01,And cotton duck is a specific thing and you weren't allowed to cross the border with that
00:39:01,00:39:06,because they were trying to help the cotton makers.
00:39:06,00:39:10,"And so they said you couldn't do that, but people mistook it to think that you couldn't"
00:39:10,00:39:12,cross the border with a duck on your head.
00:39:12,00:39:16,I love those sort of industry-specific things.
00:39:16,00:39:21,I remember talking to old people in Wisconsin while I was out there.
00:39:21,00:39:26,"And they were saying that when they were young, margarine could not be yellow."
00:39:26,00:39:34,"There were local laws that only butter was allowed to be yellow, but that they would"
00:39:34,00:39:39,"sell margarine, and I don't know if this is true or not, they would sell margarine with"
00:39:39,00:39:46,little yellow coloring things so you could mix it together and have a yellowish thing
00:39:46,00:39:48,to put on your bread.
00:39:48,00:39:49,That's so funny.
00:39:49,00:39:52,"Yeah, because they wanted to protect the butter makers in Wisconsin, right?"
00:39:52,00:39:53,Exactly.
00:39:53,00:40:00,"I think margarine comes from the Greek for pearl, like the name Margaret does because"
00:40:00,00:40:02,it had to be pearl colored in the olden days.
00:40:02,00:40:03,That is very cool.
00:40:03,00:40:04,I didn't know that.
00:40:04,00:40:05,Me neither.
00:40:05,00:40:11,I can also tell you that it's no longer illegal to have a dirty threshing machine or to impersonate
00:40:11,00:40:17,"a straw inspector in Minnesota, but they have been true in the last hundred years."
00:40:17,00:40:20,To impersonate a straw inspector?
00:40:20,00:40:21,Finally.
00:40:21,00:40:28,The comedy clubs around Minnesota are back in with the classic straw inspector impersonations.
00:40:28,00:40:32,Thank God.
00:40:32,00:40:39,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:40:39,00:40:44,My fact this week is that the author Douglas Adams once put his back out while buttering
00:40:44,00:40:48,a slice of bread.
00:40:48,00:40:56,"This is a fact that comes directly from the creator of QI and is a friend of Neil Gaiman's,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,Mr. John Lloyd.
00:40:58,00:41:02,"A long time ago, he wrote the forward to a biography of Douglas Adams by a guy called"
00:41:02,00:41:07,"MJ Simpson, and in the forward, he just talks about his sort of day-to-day life, and famously"
00:41:07,00:41:11,"within the circle of friends, he was always mocked for the fact of once putting his back"
00:41:11,00:41:12,out.
00:41:12,00:41:17,"So do we know, was he really buttering the bread in an extremely ostentatious way or"
00:41:17,00:41:20,"something, or heavy knife, thick cold butter?"
00:41:20,00:41:24,"No, it was just literally, he was just standing there, probably whistling."
00:41:24,00:41:26,"I don't know, Neil, have you got any insight?"
00:41:26,00:41:32,"Douglas was gloriously accident-prone, and I remember him once telling me about breaking"
00:41:32,00:41:38,"his nose with his own knees playing rugby, I think as a small boy, about the time that"
00:41:38,00:41:44,"he first bought a fancy car with hitchhiker money, he bought a Porsche, and on the way"
00:41:44,00:41:51,"home from the showroom, going round Marble Arch, he managed to total his Porsche."
00:41:51,00:41:59,"And I remember once turning up at some incredibly fancy event for hitchhikers, it had sold a"
00:41:59,00:42:05,"million copies or something like that, and his publisher Pan presented Douglas very proudly"
00:42:05,00:42:12,"with a book on mushrooms, and I said, ""Douglas, why are you now holding a huge book on mushrooms?"""
00:42:12,00:42:19,"And it turned out that he'd gone to France for a gastronomic thing the week before, and"
00:42:19,00:42:25,"on day one had eaten the kind of mushroom that you were not meant to eat, and had not"
00:42:25,00:42:29,eaten anything else for the following five days.
00:42:29,00:42:33,"I once read there, if you go to France and you go to any pharmacist, they can tell you"
00:42:33,00:42:38,"if a mushroom is poisonous or not, as in they're all trained for it, that's what I read once,"
00:42:38,00:42:41,I've never tried it.
00:42:41,00:42:47,"We must try it, we must all try it, we must gather mushrooms and march into French pharmacies."
00:42:47,00:42:51,"In American pharmacies, I'm not completely convinced they will be able to identify it"
00:42:51,00:42:53,as a mushroom.
00:42:53,00:42:54,What is that thing?
00:42:54,00:42:59,"So you, I mean, we should just quickly say that Neil, you wrote a biography on Douglas"
00:42:59,00:43:01,"Adams, you knew him, right?"
00:43:01,00:43:05,"It was your, I think, second book that you'd written, non-fiction book called Don't Panic?"
00:43:05,00:43:11,"I did, it was called Don't Panic, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion, and it also"
00:43:11,00:43:15,"contained a lot of biographical stuff about Douglas, because there's only so much you"
00:43:15,00:43:18,can say about hitchhikers.
00:43:18,00:43:24,"And I got to know Douglas relatively well, but always from a sort of position of you"
00:43:24,00:43:31,are a fancy author and I am a small journalist who first interviewed you when he was 22.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"So he was definitely the grown-up, he was so impressive to me."
00:43:34,00:43:41,"He had all of these amazing careers, like being a bodyguard for the Saudi royal family."
00:43:41,00:43:44,"I said, ""What did that job entail?"""
00:43:44,00:43:50,"He said, ""Well, basically, it entailed standing around in a hotel corridor, going out occasionally"
00:43:50,00:43:56,to bring back enormous quantities of McDonald's and planning to run away if anybody with a
00:43:56,00:43:57,"gun shot."""
00:43:57,00:44:04,"Oh, I found a kind of relative fact on that, which is, The Hitchhiker's Guide was turned"
00:44:04,00:44:05,"into a TV series, wasn't it?"
00:44:05,00:44:09,"Quite soon after it was already a series and then a book, it was a telly series."
00:44:09,00:44:15,"And one of the guys who plays a bodyguard in the TV series of hitchhikers is Dave Prouse,"
00:44:15,00:44:16,aka Darth Vader.
00:44:16,00:44:17,No.
00:44:17,00:44:18,Really?
00:44:18,00:44:19,He's in it.
00:44:19,00:44:20,Yeah.
00:44:20,00:44:21,Wow.
00:44:21,00:44:22,I have no idea if it's a speaking role or not.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"It's been a long time since I saw the series, but I imagine it's not."
00:44:25,00:44:28,"So was Douglas Adams very tall, Neil?"
00:44:28,00:44:29,That's why I read about him.
00:44:29,00:44:30,He was.
00:44:30,00:44:31,He was very tall.
00:44:31,00:44:34,"He was about six foot five, six foot six-ish."
00:44:34,00:44:40,"I remember him saying that when he discovered how tall John Cleese and Graham Chapman were,"
00:44:40,00:44:44,he decided that he had all the qualifications necessary for comedy.
00:44:44,00:44:49,The reason I ask is because tall people are very susceptible to back injuries.
00:44:49,00:44:51,That's why I was reading that about.
00:44:51,00:44:55,"There's a few mechanical reasons for that, but one of the reasons is basically the world"
00:44:55,00:45:00,"is just made for averagely-heighted people, and so they always have to squeeze themselves"
00:45:00,00:45:01,into various places.
00:45:01,00:45:05,"But I read that he was six feet tall by the time he was 12 years old, Douglas Adams."
00:45:05,00:45:06,Right.
00:45:06,00:45:12,And that would be only three inches shorter than the record tallest 12-year-old in the
00:45:12,00:45:13,UK.
00:45:13,00:45:14,That's so cool.
00:45:14,00:45:16,"Oh, did you find the trousers shorts thing, James?"
00:45:16,00:45:17,"No, what's that?"
00:45:17,00:45:18,This is great.
00:45:18,00:45:19,So he was at school.
00:45:19,00:45:23,"He was in shorts, like all the rest of the boys in his year, and I think there was a point"
00:45:23,00:45:26,"where he was going to go after being able to wear trousers with the rest of his year,"
00:45:26,00:45:30,"but unfortunately, at exactly the year that everyone went to trousers, he discovered his"
00:45:30,00:45:34,school tailor had no trousers in his size because he was so much taller than everyone
00:45:34,00:45:37,else that they just couldn't fit him.
00:45:37,00:45:42,"So for this key four weeks of his life, he was the only boy in his year wearing shorts,"
00:45:42,00:45:46,"and that obviously is psychologically scarring, especially if you're so much taller than"
00:45:46,00:45:47,everyone else.
00:45:47,00:45:48,I can't believe he had a school tailor.
00:45:48,00:45:52,"In my school, they used to just set fire to the bottom of your trousers."
00:45:52,00:45:53,I know.
00:45:53,00:45:54,It does say something about that.
00:45:54,00:45:57,"Do you remember there's a bit of QI, isn't there, where Stephen talks about his school,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,prep school tailor being called Gorrige?
00:45:59,00:46:00,Yes.
00:46:00,00:46:03,And it's with Orange.
00:46:03,00:46:04,Yeah.
00:46:04,00:46:10,"I was looking in today, I thought I knew quite a lot about sort of the cultural impact that"
00:46:10,00:46:14,"hitchhikers had on the world, and there were so many elements of hitchhikers that you'll"
00:46:14,00:46:16,find in pop culture.
00:46:16,00:46:20,"So Radiohead had a song which was called Paranoid Android, which was named after Marvin the"
00:46:20,00:46:23,Paranoid at Android.
00:46:23,00:46:28,You had the fact that 42 is just the answer to the meaning of life question.
00:46:28,00:46:33,"People know that sort of generally, but I didn't realize that things like in the X-Files,"
00:46:33,00:46:38,"Foxmolder lived in apartment 42, which Chris Carter said was a direct nod to hitchhikers."
00:46:38,00:46:43,"You've got Coldplay, whose very first song on their debut album was called Don't Panic,"
00:46:43,00:46:47,"and they also have a song called 42, which again is a direct link."
00:46:47,00:46:52,"The Allen Telescope Array, which is a telescope which is looking for extraterrestrial intelligence,"
00:46:52,00:46:56,the antenna has 42 antennas paying tribute.
00:46:56,00:46:57,Really?
00:46:57,00:46:59,Like it just is seeded everywhere.
00:46:59,00:47:01,They must have been going for around 40.
00:47:01,00:47:04,"They weren't going to have two and thought, well, let's add another 40 just to make it"
00:47:04,00:47:05,the right number.
00:47:05,00:47:06,That's true.
00:47:06,00:47:07,Absolutely.
00:47:07,00:47:08,Yeah.
00:47:08,00:47:12,"I love the way that hitchhikers has kind of weirdly penetrated the culture, but I also"
00:47:12,00:47:17,love that those little bits of hitchhikers that have changed with time.
00:47:17,00:47:24,Like there's that line in the opening of hitchhikers about how human beings were so primitive that
00:47:24,00:47:28,they thought that digital watches were a pretty neat thing.
00:47:28,00:47:33,"And in 1978, oh, we thought that digital watches were a neat thing."
00:47:33,00:47:35,We thought that digital watches were miracles.
00:47:35,00:47:40,We had the power of science suddenly appearing on our wrist and it had numbers.
00:47:40,00:47:41,"He still thinks this, I think."
00:47:41,00:47:48,"I just want to say that a watch that functions on a wafer of silicon is amazing, that it"
00:47:48,00:47:50,"counts the, you know, however many thousands of..."
00:47:50,00:47:51,Yeah.
00:47:51,00:47:52,"The peace of electric effect, Andy."
00:47:52,00:47:53,That's what I'm saying.
00:47:53,00:48:00,"I mean, yeah, sure, the Swiss guys can make the cogs very small, but that's not the same"
00:48:00,00:48:01,as vibrating silicon.
00:48:01,00:48:06,"I mean, I think actually, I think it was a red misfire for Adams and I think we should"
00:48:06,00:48:08,be calling it out.
00:48:08,00:48:10,Can I tell you guys about the...
00:48:10,00:48:13,"So obviously, Hitchhikers was his first book and he'd amazingly become friends with all"
00:48:13,00:48:17,"five members of Monty Python and, you know, he'd even appeared in the latest series of"
00:48:17,00:48:18,Python a couple of times.
00:48:18,00:48:19,And wrote for it.
00:48:19,00:48:20,He was one of the credits designers.
00:48:20,00:48:21,And wrote for it.
00:48:21,00:48:24,And he was only a few years out of school and university.
00:48:24,00:48:27,It was amazingly fast to be meeting comedy giants like that.
00:48:27,00:48:33,"Anyway, on his first book, he got quotes from all five of the main members of Monty Python."
00:48:33,00:48:36,"John Cleese said, ""Really entertaining and fun."""
00:48:36,00:48:41,"Terry Jones then said, ""Much funnier than anything John Cleese has ever written."""
00:48:41,00:48:44,"Graham Chapman then said, ""I know for a fact that John Cleese hasn't read it."""
00:48:44,00:48:48,"Eric Idle wrote, ""Who is John Cleese?"""
00:48:48,00:48:50,"And then Michael Palin wrote, ""Really entertaining and fun."""
00:48:50,00:48:51,So good.
00:48:51,00:48:54,"Yeah, that's really good."
00:48:54,00:48:59,I was reading through the Oxford English Dictionary to see if Douglas Adams has been the first
00:48:59,00:49:00,citation of any words.
00:49:00,00:49:06,"And as far as I can see, there is only one word that he was the first person to ever"
00:49:06,00:49:07,say.
00:49:07,00:49:12,"According to the OED, of course, which is just what they found, do you want to have"
00:49:12,00:49:13,a guess?
00:49:13,00:49:15,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:49:15,00:49:18,"First of all, I can tell you you won't guess, but you can have a go anyway."
00:49:18,00:49:21,Is it Slotty Bart first?
00:49:21,00:49:22,That's not in the dictionary.
00:49:22,00:49:23,"No, that's a proper name."
00:49:23,00:49:24,Yeah.
00:49:24,00:49:25,Golger Frinschen isn't going to be in there anyway.
00:49:25,00:49:28,A frude is a word from Hitchhiker's Deadline.
00:49:28,00:49:29,Hoopy.
00:49:29,00:49:30,Hoopy.
00:49:30,00:49:31,"Hoopy, yeah."
00:49:31,00:49:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:32,00:49:34,"No, it's actually not from Hitchhikers."
00:49:34,00:49:38,It's from a comic relief Christmas book that he wrote in 1986.
00:49:38,00:49:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:39,00:49:40,And the word is Todger.
00:49:40,00:49:41,Oh.
00:49:41,00:49:42,No.
00:49:42,00:49:47,"Yeah, he's the first person in print to use the word Todger according to the OED."
00:49:47,00:49:48,Wow.
00:49:48,00:49:49,That's mega.
00:49:49,00:49:51,"And before that, the word was Tadger."
00:49:51,00:49:57,"People used to refer to their penises as Tadgers, possibly a Northern dialect for like a tad"
00:49:57,00:50:00,"pole or something, but he was the one who turned it from Tadger to Todger."
00:50:00,00:50:05,"Wouldn't it be amazing if one day all of his legacy is forgotten, all his books and just"
00:50:05,00:50:09,the one citation sitting in the dictionary is all we know him for?
00:50:09,00:50:12,"But the Todger guy, that will one day happen."
00:50:12,00:50:13,There's one thing.
00:50:13,00:50:18,One of the big mysteries of Douglas's career for a lot of people is what is behind the
00:50:18,00:50:19,number 42?
00:50:19,00:50:21,How did he come to the number?
00:50:21,00:50:24,I remember John Lloyd sort of saying that they were in a garage together and they were
00:50:24,00:50:26,"just going, ""Oh, what number should we use?"""
00:50:26,00:50:31,"But supposedly, Stephen Fry says that he's the only person that Douglas ever told what"
00:50:31,00:50:34,"the meaning was to, and he's going to take it to his grave."
00:50:34,00:50:35,He's never going to say what it is.
00:50:35,00:50:38,So there was a kind of meaning behind it.
00:50:38,00:50:40,But 42 would always pop up in interesting places.
00:50:40,00:50:46,"And before Douglas passed away, the Hubble telescope was trying to find the defining parameter"
00:50:46,00:50:51,"of the expanding universe, and it got identified as 42."
00:50:51,00:50:53,"And for Douglas, that was just like, ""Ah, look at it."
00:50:53,00:50:56,"Look at this synchronicity that I've managed to come up with this number, which is the"
00:50:56,00:50:59,"speed of the expanding universe."""
00:50:59,00:51:03,So that's the only time that we've got a sort of hint of Douglas's interest in it having
00:51:03,00:51:04,meaning.
00:51:04,00:51:05,"But otherwise, no one knows."
00:51:05,00:51:11,But I wonder if a drunken evening between you and Stephen Neal has led to the reveal.
00:51:11,00:51:13,I've never heard anything from Stephen.
00:51:13,00:51:17,I remember asking Douglas my theory.
00:51:17,00:51:22,"When I was a 22-year-old, asking him for the first time, I suggested that it might have"
00:51:22,00:51:26,"been from Alice in Wonderland's Rule 42, all persons more than two miles high must leave"
00:51:26,00:51:27,the court.
00:51:27,00:51:35,And Douglas talked about how traumatized he was by Alice in Wonderland and how terrifying
00:51:35,00:51:37,he found it when he read it.
00:51:37,00:51:43,But what Douglas said to me was that he was trying to find a number that didn't sound
00:51:43,00:51:44,funny.
00:51:44,00:51:45,Proce it.
00:51:45,00:51:47,Not terribly interesting.
00:51:47,00:51:54,47 sounds like it's the kind of number that has interesting things going on.
00:51:54,00:52:00,"42, it's not prime, it's not even an odd number."
00:52:00,00:52:01,It wasn't interesting.
00:52:01,00:52:04,"It didn't have anything about it that was interesting, you know, because I think he"
00:52:04,00:52:10,tried a few in the 40s and settled on 42 as a punchline.
00:52:10,00:52:14,"It's a punchline to the answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything"
00:52:14,00:52:20,"is, and a computer has been cogitating on this for millennia, and now it gives the answer,"
00:52:20,00:52:23,and the answer is 42.
00:52:23,00:52:30,"And it needed to be a letdown in every way, to be funny, 121 sounds like there's something"
00:52:30,00:52:31,going on with it.
00:52:31,00:52:32,"42 sounds like, ""What?"""
00:52:32,00:52:37,"That's not the answer, but then the universe is a wonderful place and it accommodates us."
00:52:37,00:52:43,"And once 42 was let loose in the universe, I'm sure the universe has been running with"
00:52:43,00:52:44,it ever since.
00:52:44,00:52:52,"Okay, that is it."
00:52:52,00:52:53,That is all of our facts.
00:52:53,00:52:55,Thank you so much for listening.
00:52:55,00:52:58,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over
00:52:58,00:53:01,"the course of this podcast, we can all be found on our Twitter accounts."
00:53:01,00:53:07,"I'm on @Sriberland, @Andy, @AndrewHunterM, @James, @JamesHarken, and @Neil."
00:53:07,00:53:11,"I'm @Neil himself, but I'm on Twitter less and less and less."
00:53:11,00:53:18,"So I'm probably much more likely to be Neil himself at Threads, or Neil-Gaman at Tumblr,"
00:53:18,00:53:22,or over at Blue Sky as soon as the rest of the world gets their invitations and it becomes
00:53:22,00:53:23,a giant party.
00:53:23,00:53:24,Nice.
00:53:24,00:53:25,Okay.
00:53:25,00:53:26,Yeah.
00:53:26,00:53:27,All right.
00:53:27,00:53:28,"Well, let's all head over to that party with Neil."
00:53:28,00:53:33,"And you can get us otherwise on @NoSuchThing, or you can go to our Instagram account, which"
00:53:33,00:53:38,"is @NoSuchThing as a Fish, or you can go to our website, nosuchthingasafish.com."
00:53:38,00:53:43,"All of our previous episodes are up there, but most importantly, make sure you head over"
00:53:43,00:53:47,to Amazon Prime because the return of Good Omens is here.
00:53:47,00:53:51,"Good Omens 2, written by Neil Gaiman himself."
00:53:51,00:53:53,Make sure to check out that entire series.
00:53:53,00:53:55,I've heard previews response.
00:53:55,00:53:58,It sounds absolutely incredible.
00:53:58,00:53:59,So really exciting.
00:53:59,00:54:00,Do watch that.
00:54:00,00:54:02,"And otherwise, come back next week for another episode with us."
00:54:02,00:54:03,We'll see you then.
00:54:03,00:54:03,Goodbye.
00:54:03,00:54:04,Bye.
00:54:04,00:54:11,Bye.
00:54:11,00:54:13,(upbeat music)
