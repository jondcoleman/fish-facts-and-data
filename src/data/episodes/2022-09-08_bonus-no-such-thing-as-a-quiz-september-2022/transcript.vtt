00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.280
 Hi everyone, welcome to a brand new piece of bonus material

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.400
 that we are, well, that I am calling

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.080
 and no such thing as a quiz

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.720
 'cause I don't have any other name for it so far.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.480
 What this is going to be is I have a story from history.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.720
 It's the kind of thing we might use on the podcast

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.120
 but all the way through I'm gonna have some questions

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.120
 that I'll be testing these guys on

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.560
 to see if they can help me along as I tell the story.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.760
 There is one rule and that is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.240
 that there is a big question at the very start

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.100
 and if you get that right, you get 100 points.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.240
 And if you get it right at any stage like Quidditch,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.880
 you know, if you catch the golden snitch,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.680
 you just get 100 points automatically

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 and you probably automatically win.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.520
 But apart from that,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.140
 there'll be smaller points awarded throughout the show.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.680
 - Well, they add up to more than a hundred.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.400
 - I shouldn't think so.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.240
 - Okay.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.080
 - We might work on the scoring system

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.600
 as the series progresses.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 - Yeah, the incentive structure is pretty messed up

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 right now.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 - Yeah, well, you might realize that this is quite apt

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.840
 when I tell you the main question.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.080
 And the main question for today's harking quiz

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.680
 is what was the terrible slogan

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 that was used by the man who coined socialism

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.940
 for his utopian community?

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.320
 Now, you can guess at any time the answer to that question.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.160
 - You're gonna get one guess.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.640
 - No, no, you can keep guessing.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.480
 - Okay.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.840
 - So if you can think of some bad slogans now, in fact,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.800
 you might just stumble upon the answer.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.200
 - Less stuff for everybody, socialism.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440
 (laughing)

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.000
 - It would be more stuff for some people

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.400
 with knit socialism.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.120
 Like the bottom of society would get more stuff.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.560
 - Well, that's why it's such a bad slogan.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.880
 - I thought that was why it's such a...

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.800
 I think that might have been the point.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.000
 - Okay, well, if you think of any answers

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.160
 to that big question all the way through,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
 then just stop me and you might get some points.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.000
 - Okay.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.960
 - So anyway, this is about a French philosopher

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.160
 called Pierre Leroux.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.320
 He was born in the same year as Mary Shelley

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.360
 and Franz Schubert.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.240
 Who can guess what year that was closest gets five points?

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.080
 - Oh, okay.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.480
 - I don't want you thinking.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.320
 I want fast.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.160
 - 18, 21.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.280
 - 1792. - 1792. Andy, what did you say?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.720
 - 1796. - Holy moly, 1797.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.480
 (laughing)

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480
 That was so good.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.320
 - Here it goes.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.160
 - Nice.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.560
 - Oh my God, you were once on Osman's birthday game.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.520
 Annoyingly, they asked about Nick Knowles

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.600
 rather than Mary Shelley.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.840
 (laughing)

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.720
 - Well, Pierre Leroux was born in Paris,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.120
 which was a very exciting place to be alive at that time.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.520
 In fact, when he was a baby,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.520
 he might have seen the first use of an invention

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.840
 by AndrÃ© Jacques Gannarin,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.480
 which was made out of silk.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.440
 What might that be?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.520
 - Parachute.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.360
 - A handkerchief.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.200
 Oh, and parachutes.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.040
 - Dan's got it.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.860
 Parachutes.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.200
 - Was he the guy who jumped off the Eiffel Tower?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.040
 - No, he wasn't.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.880
 You just lost some points.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.720
 - Damn it.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.520
 I moved tower in 1790, whatever.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.720
 - I was a quick-looking thing.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.400
 You got some points,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.960
 but they were wrestled away from you

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.240
 by saying something not true.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.080
 - That's harsh.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.920
 We weren't warned about this.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.560
 All points can be reflected straight away.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.040
 - I'm making up the rules as I go along.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.640
 It might not be clear.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 Gannarin was a friend of the MacGolfiers,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.200
 and he went up in their balloons quite a lot.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.120
 And in fact, the next time he went up in the balloon

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.880
 after the parachute jump, which he did,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.080
 he did something even more shocking.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.160
 And it was so shocking that he had to appear

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.560
 in front of officials at the Central Bureau of Police

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.880
 to justify his project.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.300
 So what did Gannarin do in balloons

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.400
 that was incredibly shocking?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.560
 - He's gotta be having a wank.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.000
 (both laughing)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.080
 That's his experiment.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.000
 - Having a wank was not the right answer.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.400
 - So it's something he did in the balloon?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.240
 - It's something that he plans to do in a balloon, yeah.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.440
 - Plans to do in a balloon, okay.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.720
 - And they stopped him from doing it

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.760
 because they heard about his plans.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.600
 - Shagging?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.200
 Oh, someone went up with lots of animals in a balloon.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.400
 Was it shagging the animals?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.240
 (both laughing)

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.680
 - I think roll it back slightly 'cause you're close.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.680
 - Having a lady read a novel.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.080
 - Roll it back even more.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.480
 - Just putting a woman in the balloon.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.000
 - Putting a woman in a balloon.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.040
 - I feel like I should get some points of that.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.680
 - I'm gonna work out the points at the end.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.560
 I'm gonna re-listen to the whole show

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.080
 and then work out how many points you did

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.720
 and then do a retake of the number of points.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.440
 So you lot will never know who wins.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.040
 You'll have to listen back.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.520
 - This is as corrupt as the QI's face.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.360
 - Anyway, anyway.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.840
 So LaRue was born on the South Bank of the River.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.680
 - Send?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.600
 - Points.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360
 In a bar run by his parents

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.200
 and he went to Charlemagne College,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.760
 which was one of the biggest old schools in Paris.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.560
 It was founded by Napoleon

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.880
 and loads of famous French people went there.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.480
 So first person you could name any French person

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.320
 who went to this school.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.440
 - Victor Hugo.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.920
 - Victor Hugo, no.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.960
 - Napoleon III?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.160
 - No.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.280
 - Jacques Lacocque, the famous clown.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.760
 Jacques Cousteau.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.240
 - Hang on, have you got all the people who went there?

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.080
 - All the famous ones.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.900
 - Charle Gaule.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.720
 - Jacques Chirac.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.560
 - No.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.080
 - Inspector Clouseau of the Sainte.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.520
 - Go for Victor Hugo.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.360
 - Oh, okay.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.180
 - But then.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.020
 - Oh, it's Jules Verne.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.160
 - Someone else in his family.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.000
 - Victor Hugo, senior.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.840
 - So close.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.680
 - Victor Hugo, junior.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.220
 - Correct.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.960
 - Victor Hugo's son, Francois, went there.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.200
 Bolzac, Carnot and GÃ©rard de Neval

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.800
 were the other famous people.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.280
 Anyway, so he went to further education,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.720
 but his father died.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.360
 This is La Rue we're talking about.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.360
 And so he worked in his cousin's printers,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.400
 eventually founding Le Globe,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.680
 which was a publication which became the voice

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.880
 for Saint Simeonism,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.240
 which was a philosophy that came out of the French Revolution

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.360
 and was started by a guy called Henri Saint Simon.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.240
 And they thought that instead of relying on religion,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.520
 society should be shaped by something else.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.560
 What could it be instead of religion?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.000
 - Oh, a big blob from Mars.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.720
 - A blob from Mars.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.040
 - Close, actually.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.200
 - Okay.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.240
 - Oh, astrology.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.560
 Astronomy.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.720
 - Closer, but be both vague.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.400
 - Ouija, spiritualism.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.360
 Seeing ghosts and listening to what they say.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.180
 - Paranormal.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.000
 - Sorry, astronomy.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.840
 Did you say astronomy?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.160
 - No, we said it weirdly.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.200
 What did you say?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.320
 Because I'd said astrological.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.160
 - There are no rules.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.120
 There are no points lost for saying things weirdly.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.160
 - Yeah, and also saying things weirdly.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.760
 Fuck off, Dan.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.600
 Eight years in.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.600
 So what's vaguer than astronomy?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.840
 Looking at the sky, just...

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.080
 - Even more vague.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.920
 - Just looking around.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.960
 - Looking around?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.800
 - Less vague.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.000
 The answer is science or technology.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.240
 So they thought that society should be shaped

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.600
 by science and technology and not religion,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.200
 because they got most of their ideas during the terror

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.520
 when there was a huge anti-religious upheaval in Paris.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.240
 He was arrested, actually,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.000
 the Saint-Simeon during that time

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.280
 for his plan to profit from the terror.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.960
 So it's very anti-religious.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.280
 How do you think he wanted to profit from the terror?

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.240
 - Well, sell all the heads that have been chopped off.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240
 - So close.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.160
 But think about how anti-religious was and he was in Paris.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.600
 - Selling off the church properties.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.440
 I'm gonna give it you.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.560
 He wanted to buy Notre Dame Cathedral on a knock-off price

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.320
 and sell all the lead on its roof.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.160
 - Oh.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.240
 - Anyway, LaRue, he became a big name

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.120
 in this Saint-Simeonism.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.040
 And there was him and a guy called Bartelamy,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.440
 Prosper and Fantin.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.520
 And they ran something that was pretty much like a cult.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.920
 One thing they did was they always wore cloaks

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.440
 that were buttoned down the back.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.520
 Why would their cult do this?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.040
 What did it signify?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.040
 - Is it because you're all acting as a unit?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.040
 So only someone else can undo your cloak,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.120
 so it goes second night. - 100%.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.320
 - She's right, she's right.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.160
 She's on the gun, I've got it.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.000
 - I'm a big sharer.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.840
 - Lovely, that's lovely.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.080
 - Yes, so if you needed to dress or undress,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.000
 you needed help.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.960
 I suppose there's a woman.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.920
 - I was about to say, as a lot of women's clothing,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.960
 less so male, has a zip on the back for dresses and so on.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.760
 - Yeah, you can usually do the zip up the back.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760
 The buttons all the way up the back

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.600
 would be more difficult.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.720
 You'd have to be a serious gymnast.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.840
 - But if you're bursting for the toilet

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.120
 and one of your friends isn't around,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.520
 that's presumably a bit stressful.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520
 - Yeah, they're cloaks.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.400
 So maybe you can just lift up the cloak.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.200
 - Anyway, so the group split in 1832

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.560
 and LaRue gave up on philosophy after Enfantin did what?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.040
 So they were in a cult together.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.200
 They're kind of quite a brotherhood of cults.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.000
 - No, it started sleeping with all the partners.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.440
 - I'm gonna say he did a sort of cloak prank

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.720
 where he buttoned it up all the way around

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.120
 and LaRue couldn't get out of the cloak for days.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.960
 - He went himself.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.200
 - Let's see who was closest.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.400
 My answer is he advocated free love,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.600
 called himself a messiah,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.800
 and sent his acolytes out around France

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.600
 to find a female saviour with whom he could have sex

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.320
 and give birth to a new god.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.160
 - Bo, bo, bo.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.000
 - Yeah, Dan went down.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.160
 - Dan was definitely a classic cult.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.680
 So LaRue was also friends with Georges Sond,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.160
 the novelist who at the time was bigger than Bolzac

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.600
 and Victor Hugo put together.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.560
 Today she's probably most well known by people like us

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.920
 for the fact that she wore trousers in Paris

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.400
 without a permit, which wasn't allowed at the time.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.040
 And what two official reasons did she give

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.760
 that she was wearing trousers?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.600
 - Bad legs.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.940
 (laughing)

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.840
 - Those are the two reasons.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.700
 - Left, right, right, right, right, right, right.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.600
 - A health thing, maybe?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.360
 - She's got the bottom of her skirt, it's wet.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
 - No.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.040
 - And the rain.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040
 - This is quite an easy one, I think.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.880
 - They're on the laundry.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.720
 - Pockets.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.040
 - Pockets.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.880
 - I'm gonna give it to you.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.160
 Practical was one of them.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.000
 - Oh, okay.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.840
 - Okay, and more affordable.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.560
 - And cheaper, yeah, perfect, very good.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.680
 You guys are pretty good at this quiz.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.760
 What other thing did Georges Sond do in public,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.520
 which was very bad form for a woman at the time?

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.280
 - I'm gonna go back to my earlier answer

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.720
 having a wanker to the loop.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720
 - It's gonna be right one of these days.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.920
 This is not that day.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.240
 - She did quite a lot of dodgy stuff, you know?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.880
 She was, she didn't like religion.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.120
 I think she spoke out against that.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120
 - She did.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.880
 - She shagged Chopin, but I don't think she did that

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.720
 in public.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.560
 - Drinking alcohol in public.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.040
 - Getting nude, I would say.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.200
 - Getting nude, I'm not sure she did that.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.320
 She was wearing trousers, we've already ascertained.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.520
 Smoking cigars.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.160
 - Oh, yeah, she loves cigars.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.480
 - She did.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.400
 So Sond was the great, great granddaughter

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.520
 of Augustus the Strong of Poland.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.040
 Well, she was the illegitimate offspring of him.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.720
 And he was famous for two things.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.440
 So famous for fox tossing

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.400
 and for having lots of illegitimate offspring.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.120
 And there are two points available here.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.440
 How many illegitimate offspring did he reportedly have?

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.600
 And how many foxes did he toss on one day in Dresden?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.440
 And to give you a clue,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.200
 you can have to the nearest 100 for each.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.280
 - Okay, whoa.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.840
 All right, 700 kids, 900 foxes.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.680
 - Okay.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.560
 - 200 and 350.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.760
 Whichever way round is correct.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.640
 - I think 100 kids, 200 foxes.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.600
 - It was 647 foxes that he tossed.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.720
 And either 365 or 382 children.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.880
 I'm not sure any of you got any points there.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.200
 - 365 is neater, isn't it, for the children?

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.720
 - Yeah, I think that might be why they said it.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.760
 - One for every day of the year.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.200
 - It's a lot of birthday parties, isn't it?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.040
 - Yeah.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.760
 (all laughing)

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.640
 - You would only need like 50 children to,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.840
 on average, two of them would have the same birthday.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.320
 - Yeah, I think it's less even, isn't it?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.680
 I think it's 23. - It's 1823, man, like that.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.840
 - No points for that, because I got it wrong.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.080
 - So, Georgetown came from money, actually,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.440
 because she was a great granddaughter

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.560
 of this Augustus Estrung, the fox tosser.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.360
 So, she financed LaRue's ideas and he started a new magazine

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.840
 and a commune for his staff to live in.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.400
 The idea is they would farm the land for their food

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.360
 and they would print the magazine.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.420
 And he wanted like a money-free society,

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.760
 but he had to collect tax in some way

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.480
 so that everyone paid into a collective pot.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.600
 And what did they pay instead of money?

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.240
 - Compliments.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.480
 (all laughing)

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.320
 - Pogs.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.160
 - What's that?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.000
 - Pogs.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.840
 - Pogs in 1800s.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.680
 - Is it salts?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.040
 People always love collecting salts, actually.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.960
 - To say, they're growing crops.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.080
 - Yeah.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.920
 - Okay, I'm gonna go on a limb and say urine,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.480
 because everyone produces it

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.200
 and it can be used in industrial processes,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.240
 so maybe-- - Yeah, very good.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.800
 - Okay, well, we'll see if that's right.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.880
 'Cause around the same time,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.960
 there was a scientist called Busingo,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.400
 who had some ideas about fertilizer

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.360
 and there was a big boom in the fertilizer industry

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.960
 around that time due to--

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.800
 - Gonna be poo.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.640
 - Guano.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.800
 - Guano, points.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.560
 And he wondered whether a single animal

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.780
 could create enough poo to grow enough food

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.400
 for that animal to live.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.360
 Sort of a perfect system.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.600
 And so he got a cow

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.480
 and he worked out exactly what it ate,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.520
 weighed all of its poo

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.280
 and did a load of calculations.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.560
 But this experiment didn't go very well,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.800
 so what was the problem with the experiment

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.920
 and what did he do to improve it?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.700
 - It was a, it wasn't a cow.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.540
 (laughing)

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.960
 - It was two people in a cow situation.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.320
 - It was a pantomime act.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.760
 It was too embarrassed to reveal what's really going on.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.920
 - Collected the poo from the back

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.320
 and also halfway down.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.760
 - Yes, it was handed to the cat guy,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.320
 but then had to pretend it was then coming out of his anus.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.800
 - No, the problem he had is just that cows are too big

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.760
 to do this experiment.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.720
 You could do it with any animal,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.080
 so he started doing it with turtle doves instead.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.000
 - Did it work?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.600
 - Well, it didn't, in that there was a theory at the time

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.120
 that perhaps you would be able to create enough poo

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.720
 to create enough fertilizer for your crops.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.360
 Turns out not quite to be true,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.040
 but LaRue thought that it did.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.240
 And so he had a community in France

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.640
 which where everyone paid their tax in poo.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.480
 - Oh.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.480
 - Close enough of your, and I reckon.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.400
 And the motto for this utopian community was.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.160
 - Spread the shit.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.200
 - That's the shit.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.360
 - Shit, you're so fridge.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.920
 (all laughing)

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.480
 - The answer which I'm afraid none of you thought.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.320
 - Poo topia.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.320
 (all laughing)

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.360
 - Okay, I'm going to give points for the best answer,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.360
 but the actual answer that his community had the slogan,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.720
 make bread with excrement.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.040
 (all laughing)

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.640
 - Okay, so that's the end of the quiz.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.960
 I will tot up all the scores when I get home.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.800
 You guys will never know who wins.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.040
 People at home, stay tuned because you're about here.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.880
 Who's the winner?

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.760
 (upbeat music)

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.920
 - Okay, I'm home.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.200
 I have totted up the points.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.360
 And for the people who are really bothered,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360
 because let's be honest,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.960
 the points are not really that important in this game.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.920
 The winner was Andrew Hunter Murray

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.440
 with 16 points followed by Dan Schreiber with 14

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.720
 and Anna Tyshinski with nine.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.760
 Hope you enjoyed this little quiz.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.400
 We probably will do it again sometime,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.240
 but this little club fish extra bonus material,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.040
 it's really a sand pit for us

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.800
 to try all sorts of different things.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.760
