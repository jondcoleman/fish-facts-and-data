1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,280
 Hi everyone, welcome to a brand new piece of bonus material

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,400
 that we are, well, that I am calling

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,080
 and no such thing as a quiz

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,720
 'cause I don't have any other name for it so far.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,480
 What this is going to be is I have a story from history.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
 It's the kind of thing we might use on the podcast

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,120
 but all the way through I'm gonna have some questions

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
 that I'll be testing these guys on

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,560
 to see if they can help me along as I tell the story.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,760
 There is one rule and that is

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,240
 that there is a big question at the very start

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,100
 and if you get that right, you get 100 points.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,240
 And if you get it right at any stage like Quidditch,

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,880
 you know, if you catch the golden snitch,

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,680
 you just get 100 points automatically

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
 and you probably automatically win.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,520
 But apart from that,

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,140
 there'll be smaller points awarded throughout the show.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,680
 - Well, they add up to more than a hundred.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,400
 - I shouldn't think so.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,240
 - Okay.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,080
 - We might work on the scoring system

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,600
 as the series progresses.

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,480
 - Yeah, the incentive structure is pretty messed up

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
 right now.

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,320
 - Yeah, well, you might realize that this is quite apt

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,840
 when I tell you the main question.

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,080
 And the main question for today's harking quiz

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,680
 is what was the terrible slogan

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,680
 that was used by the man who coined socialism

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,940
 for his utopian community?

33
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,320
 Now, you can guess at any time the answer to that question.

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,160
 - You're gonna get one guess.

35
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,640
 - No, no, you can keep guessing.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,480
 - Okay.

37
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,840
 - So if you can think of some bad slogans now, in fact,

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,800
 you might just stumble upon the answer.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
 - Less stuff for everybody, socialism.

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,440
 (laughing)

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,000
 - It would be more stuff for some people

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
 with knit socialism.

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,120
 Like the bottom of society would get more stuff.

44
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
 - Well, that's why it's such a bad slogan.

45
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,880
 - I thought that was why it's such a...

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,800
 I think that might have been the point.

47
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
 - Okay, well, if you think of any answers

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,160
 to that big question all the way through,

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,160
 then just stop me and you might get some points.

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
 - Okay.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
 - So anyway, this is about a French philosopher

52
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,160
 called Pierre Leroux.

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,320
 He was born in the same year as Mary Shelley

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,360
 and Franz Schubert.

55
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,240
 Who can guess what year that was closest gets five points?

56
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,080
 - Oh, okay.

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,480
 - I don't want you thinking.

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,320
 I want fast.

59
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
 - 18, 21.

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,280
 - 1792. - 1792. Andy, what did you say?

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,720
 - 1796. - Holy moly, 1797.

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
 (laughing)

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
 That was so good.

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
 - Here it goes.

65
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
 - Nice.

66
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,560
 - Oh my God, you were once on Osman's birthday game.

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,520
 Annoyingly, they asked about Nick Knowles

69
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
 rather than Mary Shelley.

70
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,840
 (laughing)

71
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,720
 - Well, Pierre Leroux was born in Paris,

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,120
 which was a very exciting place to be alive at that time.

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
 In fact, when he was a baby,

74
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
 he might have seen the first use of an invention

75
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,840
 by AndrÃ© Jacques Gannarin,

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,480
 which was made out of silk.

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,440
 What might that be?

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,520
 - Parachute.

79
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
 - A handkerchief.

80
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
 Oh, and parachutes.

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
 - Dan's got it.

82
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,860
 Parachutes.

83
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,200
 - Was he the guy who jumped off the Eiffel Tower?

84
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
 - No, he wasn't.

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,880
 You just lost some points.

86
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
 - Damn it.

87
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,520
 I moved tower in 1790, whatever.

88
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,720
 - I was a quick-looking thing.

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
 You got some points,

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
 but they were wrestled away from you

92
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
 by saying something not true.

93
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
 - That's harsh.

94
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,920
 We weren't warned about this.

95
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,560
 All points can be reflected straight away.

96
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,040
 - I'm making up the rules as I go along.

97
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,640
 It might not be clear.

98
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,760
 Gannarin was a friend of the MacGolfiers,

99
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,200
 and he went up in their balloons quite a lot.

100
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,120
 And in fact, the next time he went up in the balloon

101
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,880
 after the parachute jump, which he did,

102
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,080
 he did something even more shocking.

103
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,160
 And it was so shocking that he had to appear

104
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,560
 in front of officials at the Central Bureau of Police

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,880
 to justify his project.

106
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,300
 So what did Gannarin do in balloons

107
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,400
 that was incredibly shocking?

108
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,560
 - He's gotta be having a wank.

109
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,000
 (both laughing)

110
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
 That's his experiment.

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,000
 - Having a wank was not the right answer.

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
 - So it's something he did in the balloon?

113
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,240
 - It's something that he plans to do in a balloon, yeah.

114
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
 - Plans to do in a balloon, okay.

115
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
 - And they stopped him from doing it

116
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,760
 because they heard about his plans.

117
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,600
 - Shagging?

118
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,200
 Oh, someone went up with lots of animals in a balloon.

119
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
 Was it shagging the animals?

120
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,240
 (both laughing)

121
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,680
 - I think roll it back slightly 'cause you're close.

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
 - Having a lady read a novel.

123
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
 - Roll it back even more.

124
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
 - Just putting a woman in the balloon.

125
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,000
 - Putting a woman in a balloon.

126
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,040
 - I feel like I should get some points of that.

127
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,680
 - I'm gonna work out the points at the end.

128
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,560
 I'm gonna re-listen to the whole show

129
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,080
 and then work out how many points you did

130
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,720
 and then do a retake of the number of points.

131
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,440
 So you lot will never know who wins.

132
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
 You'll have to listen back.

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,520
 - This is as corrupt as the QI's face.

134
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,360
 - Anyway, anyway.

135
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,840
 So LaRue was born on the South Bank of the River.

136
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
 - Send?

137
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,600
 - Points.

138
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
 In a bar run by his parents

139
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,200
 and he went to Charlemagne College,

140
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,760
 which was one of the biggest old schools in Paris.

141
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,560
 It was founded by Napoleon

142
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,880
 and loads of famous French people went there.

143
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,480
 So first person you could name any French person

144
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
 who went to this school.

145
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,440
 - Victor Hugo.

146
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,920
 - Victor Hugo, no.

147
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,960
 - Napoleon III?

148
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
 - No.

149
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,280
 - Jacques Lacocque, the famous clown.

150
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,760
 Jacques Cousteau.

151
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,240
 - Hang on, have you got all the people who went there?

152
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,080
 - All the famous ones.

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,900
 - Charle Gaule.

154
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,720
 - Jacques Chirac.

155
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
 - No.

156
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,080
 - Inspector Clouseau of the Sainte.

157
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,520
 - Go for Victor Hugo.

158
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,360
 - Oh, okay.

159
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,180
 - But then.

160
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,020
 - Oh, it's Jules Verne.

161
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,160
 - Someone else in his family.

162
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,000
 - Victor Hugo, senior.

163
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,840
 - So close.

164
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,680
 - Victor Hugo, junior.

165
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,220
 - Correct.

166
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,960
 - Victor Hugo's son, Francois, went there.

167
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,200
 Bolzac, Carnot and GÃ©rard de Neval

168
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
 were the other famous people.

169
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
 Anyway, so he went to further education,

170
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,720
 but his father died.

171
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
 This is La Rue we're talking about.

172
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
 And so he worked in his cousin's printers,

173
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,400
 eventually founding Le Globe,

174
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
 which was a publication which became the voice

175
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,880
 for Saint Simeonism,

176
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,240
 which was a philosophy that came out of the French Revolution

177
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
 and was started by a guy called Henri Saint Simon.

178
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,240
 And they thought that instead of relying on religion,

179
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,520
 society should be shaped by something else.

180
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,560
 What could it be instead of religion?

181
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,000
 - Oh, a big blob from Mars.

182
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,720
 - A blob from Mars.

183
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,040
 - Close, actually.

184
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,200
 - Okay.

185
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,240
 - Oh, astrology.

186
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,560
 Astronomy.

187
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,720
 - Closer, but be both vague.

188
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,400
 - Ouija, spiritualism.

189
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,360
 Seeing ghosts and listening to what they say.

190
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,180
 - Paranormal.

191
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,000
 - Sorry, astronomy.

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
 Did you say astronomy?

193
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,160
 - No, we said it weirdly.

194
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
 What did you say?

195
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,320
 Because I'd said astrological.

196
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,160
 - There are no rules.

197
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,120
 There are no points lost for saying things weirdly.

198
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
 - Yeah, and also saying things weirdly.

199
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
 Fuck off, Dan.

200
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,600
 Eight years in.

201
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,600
 So what's vaguer than astronomy?

202
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
 Looking at the sky, just...

203
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,080
 - Even more vague.

204
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,920
 - Just looking around.

205
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,960
 - Looking around?

206
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
 - Less vague.

207
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,000
 The answer is science or technology.

208
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,240
 So they thought that society should be shaped

209
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,600
 by science and technology and not religion,

210
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,200
 because they got most of their ideas during the terror

211
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,520
 when there was a huge anti-religious upheaval in Paris.

212
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,240
 He was arrested, actually,

213
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,000
 the Saint-Simeon during that time

214
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,280
 for his plan to profit from the terror.

215
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,960
 So it's very anti-religious.

216
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,280
 How do you think he wanted to profit from the terror?

217
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,240
 - Well, sell all the heads that have been chopped off.

218
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
 - So close.

219
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,160
 But think about how anti-religious was and he was in Paris.

220
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,600
 - Selling off the church properties.

221
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
 I'm gonna give it you.

222
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,560
 He wanted to buy Notre Dame Cathedral on a knock-off price

223
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,320
 and sell all the lead on its roof.

224
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,160
 - Oh.

225
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,240
 - Anyway, LaRue, he became a big name

226
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,120
 in this Saint-Simeonism.

227
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,040
 And there was him and a guy called Bartelamy,

228
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,440
 Prosper and Fantin.

229
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,520
 And they ran something that was pretty much like a cult.

230
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,920
 One thing they did was they always wore cloaks

231
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,440
 that were buttoned down the back.

232
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
 Why would their cult do this?

233
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,040
 What did it signify?

234
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
 - Is it because you're all acting as a unit?

235
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 So only someone else can undo your cloak,

236
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,120
 so it goes second night. - 100%.

237
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,320
 - She's right, she's right.

238
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,160
 She's on the gun, I've got it.

239
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,000
 - I'm a big sharer.

240
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
 - Lovely, that's lovely.

241
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,080
 - Yes, so if you needed to dress or undress,

242
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,000
 you needed help.

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,960
 I suppose there's a woman.

244
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,920
 - I was about to say, as a lot of women's clothing,

245
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,960
 less so male, has a zip on the back for dresses and so on.

246
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,760
 - Yeah, you can usually do the zip up the back.

247
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
 The buttons all the way up the back

248
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,600
 would be more difficult.

249
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,720
 You'd have to be a serious gymnast.

250
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,840
 - But if you're bursting for the toilet

251
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,120
 and one of your friends isn't around,

252
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,520
 that's presumably a bit stressful.

253
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
 - Yeah, they're cloaks.

254
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,400
 So maybe you can just lift up the cloak.

255
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,200
 - Anyway, so the group split in 1832

257
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,560
 and LaRue gave up on philosophy after Enfantin did what?

258
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,040
 So they were in a cult together.

259
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,200
 They're kind of quite a brotherhood of cults.

260
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,000
 - No, it started sleeping with all the partners.

261
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,440
 - I'm gonna say he did a sort of cloak prank

262
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
 where he buttoned it up all the way around

263
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
 and LaRue couldn't get out of the cloak for days.

264
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
 - He went himself.

265
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,200
 - Let's see who was closest.

266
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
 My answer is he advocated free love,

267
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,600
 called himself a messiah,

268
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
 and sent his acolytes out around France

269
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,600
 to find a female saviour with whom he could have sex

270
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,320
 and give birth to a new god.

271
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
 - Bo, bo, bo.

272
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,000
 - Yeah, Dan went down.

273
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,160
 - Dan was definitely a classic cult.

274
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,680
 So LaRue was also friends with Georges Sond,

275
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,160
 the novelist who at the time was bigger than Bolzac

276
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,600
 and Victor Hugo put together.

277
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,560
 Today she's probably most well known by people like us

278
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,920
 for the fact that she wore trousers in Paris

279
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,400
 without a permit, which wasn't allowed at the time.

280
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,040
 And what two official reasons did she give

281
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,760
 that she was wearing trousers?

282
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,600
 - Bad legs.

283
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,940
 (laughing)

284
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,840
 - Those are the two reasons.

285
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,700
 - Left, right, right, right, right, right, right.

286
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,600
 - A health thing, maybe?

287
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
 - She's got the bottom of her skirt, it's wet.

288
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
 - No.

289
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
 - And the rain.

290
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
 - This is quite an easy one, I think.

291
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
 - They're on the laundry.

292
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
 - Pockets.

293
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,040
 - Pockets.

294
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
 - I'm gonna give it to you.

295
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,160
 Practical was one of them.

296
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,000
 - Oh, okay.

297
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,840
 - Okay, and more affordable.

298
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,560
 - And cheaper, yeah, perfect, very good.

299
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,680
 You guys are pretty good at this quiz.

300
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
 What other thing did Georges Sond do in public,

301
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,520
 which was very bad form for a woman at the time?

302
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,280
 - I'm gonna go back to my earlier answer

303
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,720
 having a wanker to the loop.

304
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
 - It's gonna be right one of these days.

305
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,920
 This is not that day.

306
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,240
 - She did quite a lot of dodgy stuff, you know?

307
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,880
 She was, she didn't like religion.

308
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,120
 I think she spoke out against that.

309
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
 - She did.

310
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,880
 - She shagged Chopin, but I don't think she did that

311
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,720
 in public.

312
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
 - Drinking alcohol in public.

313
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,040
 - Getting nude, I would say.

314
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
 - Getting nude, I'm not sure she did that.

315
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
 She was wearing trousers, we've already ascertained.

316
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
 Smoking cigars.

317
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,160
 - Oh, yeah, she loves cigars.

318
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,480
 - She did.

319
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,400
 So Sond was the great, great granddaughter

320
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,520
 of Augustus the Strong of Poland.

321
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,040
 Well, she was the illegitimate offspring of him.

322
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
 And he was famous for two things.

323
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,440
 So famous for fox tossing

324
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,400
 and for having lots of illegitimate offspring.

325
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,120
 And there are two points available here.

326
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,440
 How many illegitimate offspring did he reportedly have?

327
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,600
 And how many foxes did he toss on one day in Dresden?

328
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
 And to give you a clue,

329
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,200
 you can have to the nearest 100 for each.

330
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,280
 - Okay, whoa.

331
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,840
 All right, 700 kids, 900 foxes.

332
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,680
 - Okay.

333
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,560
 - 200 and 350.

334
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,760
 Whichever way round is correct.

335
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,640
 - I think 100 kids, 200 foxes.

336
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,600
 - It was 647 foxes that he tossed.

337
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,720
 And either 365 or 382 children.

338
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,880
 I'm not sure any of you got any points there.

339
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,200
 - 365 is neater, isn't it, for the children?

340
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,720
 - Yeah, I think that might be why they said it.

341
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,760
 - One for every day of the year.

342
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

343
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,200
 - It's a lot of birthday parties, isn't it?

344
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,040
 - Yeah.

345
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
 (all laughing)

346
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,640
 - You would only need like 50 children to,

347
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,840
 on average, two of them would have the same birthday.

348
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
 - Yeah, I think it's less even, isn't it?

349
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
 I think it's 23. - It's 1823, man, like that.

350
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,840
 - No points for that, because I got it wrong.

351
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,080
 - So, Georgetown came from money, actually,

352
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,440
 because she was a great granddaughter

353
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
 of this Augustus Estrung, the fox tosser.

354
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,360
 So, she financed LaRue's ideas and he started a new magazine

355
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,840
 and a commune for his staff to live in.

356
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,400
 The idea is they would farm the land for their food

357
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,360
 and they would print the magazine.

358
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,420
 And he wanted like a money-free society,

359
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,760
 but he had to collect tax in some way

360
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
 so that everyone paid into a collective pot.

361
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,600
 And what did they pay instead of money?

362
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,240
 - Compliments.

363
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,480
 (all laughing)

364
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,320
 - Pogs.

365
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,160
 - What's that?

366
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,000
 - Pogs.

367
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
 - Pogs in 1800s.

368
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
 - Is it salts?

369
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,040
 People always love collecting salts, actually.

370
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,960
 - To say, they're growing crops.

371
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,080
 - Yeah.

372
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,920
 - Okay, I'm gonna go on a limb and say urine,

373
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,480
 because everyone produces it

374
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,200
 and it can be used in industrial processes,

375
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
 so maybe-- - Yeah, very good.

376
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,800
 - Okay, well, we'll see if that's right.

377
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
 'Cause around the same time,

378
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,960
 there was a scientist called Busingo,

379
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,400
 who had some ideas about fertilizer

380
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,360
 and there was a big boom in the fertilizer industry

381
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
 around that time due to--

382
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
 - Gonna be poo.

383
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
 - Guano.

384
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,800
 - Guano, points.

385
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,560
 And he wondered whether a single animal

386
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,780
 could create enough poo to grow enough food

387
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,400
 for that animal to live.

388
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,360
 Sort of a perfect system.

389
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,600
 And so he got a cow

390
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,480
 and he worked out exactly what it ate,

391
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
 weighed all of its poo

392
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,280
 and did a load of calculations.

393
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,560
 But this experiment didn't go very well,

394
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
 so what was the problem with the experiment

395
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,920
 and what did he do to improve it?

396
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,700
 - It was a, it wasn't a cow.

397
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,540
 (laughing)

398
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,960
 - It was two people in a cow situation.

399
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,320
 - It was a pantomime act.

400
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,760
 It was too embarrassed to reveal what's really going on.

401
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,920
 - Collected the poo from the back

402
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,320
 and also halfway down.

403
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,760
 - Yes, it was handed to the cat guy,

404
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,320
 but then had to pretend it was then coming out of his anus.

405
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,800
 - No, the problem he had is just that cows are too big

406
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
 to do this experiment.

407
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,720
 You could do it with any animal,

408
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,080
 so he started doing it with turtle doves instead.

409
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
 - Did it work?

410
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,600
 - Well, it didn't, in that there was a theory at the time

411
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,120
 that perhaps you would be able to create enough poo

412
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,720
 to create enough fertilizer for your crops.

413
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,360
 Turns out not quite to be true,

414
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,040
 but LaRue thought that it did.

415
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,240
 And so he had a community in France

416
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,640
 which where everyone paid their tax in poo.

417
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
 - Oh.

418
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
 - Close enough of your, and I reckon.

419
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,400
 And the motto for this utopian community was.

420
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,160
 - Spread the shit.

421
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,200
 - That's the shit.

422
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,360
 - Shit, you're so fridge.

423
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,920
 (all laughing)

424
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,480
 - The answer which I'm afraid none of you thought.

425
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
 - Poo topia.

426
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
 (all laughing)

427
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,360
 - Okay, I'm going to give points for the best answer,

428
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,360
 but the actual answer that his community had the slogan,

429
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,720
 make bread with excrement.

430
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,040
 (all laughing)

431
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,640
 - Okay, so that's the end of the quiz.

432
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,960
 I will tot up all the scores when I get home.

433
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,800
 You guys will never know who wins.

434
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,040
 People at home, stay tuned because you're about here.

435
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,880
 Who's the winner?

436
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,760
 (upbeat music)

437
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,920
 - Okay, I'm home.

438
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,200
 I have totted up the points.

439
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,360
 And for the people who are really bothered,

440
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
 because let's be honest,

441
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,960
 the points are not really that important in this game.

442
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,920
 The winner was Andrew Hunter Murray

443
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,440
 with 16 points followed by Dan Schreiber with 14

444
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,720
 and Anna Tyshinski with nine.

445
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,760
 Hope you enjoyed this little quiz.

446
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,400
 We probably will do it again sometime,

447
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,240
 but this little club fish extra bonus material,

448
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,040
 it's really a sand pit for us

449
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
 to try all sorts of different things.

450
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,760
 If you enjoyed the show or you have any questions

451
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,720
