00:00:13,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:22,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:25,00:00:27,"James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:27,00:00:31,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts
00:00:31,00:00:35,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:38,Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.
00:00:38,00:00:41,"My fact this week is that for at least 80 years,"
00:00:41,00:00:46,the same thundercloud has been raining off the north coast of Australia.
00:00:46,00:00:49,It's called Hector the Convector.
00:00:49,00:00:50,Brilliant.
00:00:50,00:00:52,Or he's called Hector the Convector.
00:00:52,00:00:54,Is it actually he?
00:00:54,00:00:55,He's called Hector.
00:00:55,00:00:57,"Yeah. Oh, clouds don't have."
00:00:57,00:00:59,A lot of the press does give him a...
00:00:59,00:01:03,"Please, let's not get into pronouns for clouds."
00:01:03,00:01:04,"She's called Hector, it's fine."
00:01:04,00:01:07,"He's called Hector, like it must be a he, right?"
00:01:07,00:01:08,"Fair enough, it's a joke actually."
00:01:08,00:01:11,He should be called Cumulo Nimbus the Cumulo Nimbus.
00:01:11,00:01:12,"Is it really a convector, a cloud?"
00:01:12,00:01:13,I don't really know what convector means.
00:01:13,00:01:18,"It does work by convection, yeah, as sort of, I mean all clouds do, but there's all..."
00:01:18,00:01:21,"Culeo Nimbus, Culeo Nimbus."
00:01:21,00:01:23,"Yeah, you said Culeo Nimbus the Cumulo Nimbus."
00:01:23,00:01:25,"No, he didn't. You made that joke up into your own head."
00:01:25,00:01:26,That's good.
00:01:26,00:01:29,"Yeah, better than what Andy said, which is just the name of the type of cloud."
00:01:29,00:01:32,"I set him up, you tougher man."
00:01:32,00:01:35,"Andy's correct, he is a Cumulo Nimbus,"
00:01:35,00:01:38,"but he does also form through the power of convection,"
00:01:38,00:01:41,"which, you know, is as hot air currents go up."
00:01:41,00:01:42,"We know how clouds form, right?"
00:01:42,00:01:43,Yeah.
00:01:43,00:01:44,He...
00:01:44,00:01:46,Bagley.
00:01:46,00:01:50,"If you don't know, ask your 12-year-old niece, nephew, daughter, son."
00:01:50,00:01:52,We'll probably go into it in more depth.
00:01:52,00:01:53,"So, get excited about that."
00:01:53,00:01:58,"But yeah, he builds up over the Tiwi Islands, Tiwi, which are..."
00:01:58,00:02:00,It's a really cute word.
00:02:00,00:02:01,It is a cute word.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"It's north of Darwin, right?"
00:02:03,00:02:04,It's a little island off Australia.
00:02:04,00:02:09,"Yes, and it's at three in the afternoon every single day from September to April,"
00:02:09,00:02:14,"which is before the rainy season, and then during the rainy season, he appears."
00:02:14,00:02:16,You can set your watch by it.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"So, here's my question, right?"
00:02:18,00:02:21,"You know the, like, the never-ending super, whatever it's called,"
00:02:21,00:02:24,"the immortal soup, where it's just always been the same soup, and they just keep it."
00:02:24,00:02:27,"So, you eat the soup, and then there's a little bit left,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,and then they add more water and more vegetables and stuff.
00:02:29,00:02:30,"So, the sum of it is..."
00:02:30,00:02:32,There's some of it always in.
00:02:32,00:02:33,This cloud does disappear.
00:02:33,00:02:34,Hector does go away.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"He's only there for the months that you just said, right?"
00:02:36,00:02:37,September 3rd to April.
00:02:37,00:02:40,"So, how can you say that it's the same Hector?"
00:02:40,00:02:43,"Well, Dan, not a single cell in your body, of course,"
00:02:43,00:02:46,is the same as the cells in your body you were born with.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"So, how can we say it's the same Dan?"
00:02:49,00:02:50,That's true.
00:02:50,00:02:52,But it is the same.
00:02:52,00:02:55,"And also, Dan disappears for six months every year, doesn't he?"
00:02:55,00:02:58,It's incredibly annoying for our recording channel.
00:02:58,00:03:02,I guess it's formed by the same forces every day.
00:03:02,00:03:05,"Yeah, I was looking for named clouds, and there are so few."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"Oh, yeah, that is surprising, isn't it?"
00:03:07,00:03:12,I think considering the things that just transiently appear
00:03:12,00:03:14,and then disappear in a matter of minutes.
00:03:14,00:03:16,I just thought there must be a shortlist on Wikipedia
00:03:16,00:03:17,of celebrity clouds.
00:03:17,00:03:21,The one I can think of is the Tablecloth or the Table Mountain.
00:03:21,00:03:22,"Oh, that's good."
00:03:22,00:03:23,I didn't know about that.
00:03:23,00:03:24,I didn't find that one.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"What did you get, Dan?"
00:03:25,00:03:26,Nothing.
00:03:26,00:03:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:28,00:03:31,"Well, it's good you brought up."
00:03:31,00:03:33,The only one I found was the Lake Maracaibo one
00:03:33,00:03:36,"in western Venezuela, and that's an everlasting storm,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,which is there about 260 nights a year.
00:03:38,00:03:40,"So, again, we mentioned it about eight years ago."
00:03:40,00:03:42,"It was a long, long time ago."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"And it's at a point where a river empties into the lake,"
00:03:44,00:03:47,"Lake Maracaibo, and sailors have used it"
00:03:47,00:03:49,"for centuries to navigate, because you can see it"
00:03:49,00:03:50,from 200 miles away.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"And that's what Hector had a role in World War II,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,"was part of the war effort, because Hector was helping"
00:03:56,00:03:59,navigate Australian pilots or any pilots
00:03:59,00:04:02,that were coming in via Australia and Papua New Guinea.
00:04:02,00:04:05,"So any pilot, meaning he was kind of a Swiss cloud, basically."
00:04:05,00:04:06,The neutral.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"Yeah, he didn't disappear, practically,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,when the Nazis turned up.
00:04:10,00:04:13,"You know how, when you see a cloud from above,"
00:04:13,00:04:14,it looks a bit flat.
00:04:14,00:04:16,"So there's satellite, they've been talking really high up,"
00:04:16,00:04:18,shots from down up.
00:04:18,00:04:20,"Even when you're flying over in an aeroplane,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"it kind of looks bumpy-ish, but quite flat."
00:04:22,00:04:23,"Absolutely right, it does, doesn't it?"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"And if you look from above, they're sort of these big disks"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"of cloud, which you can kind of see they're lumpy beneath,"
00:04:28,00:04:30,"and then they just top out, and it's really weird."
00:04:30,00:04:32,"So the reason for that, I've been on this fantastic blog"
00:04:32,00:04:34,called cloudsandclimate.com.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Can't recommend it enough.
00:04:35,00:04:38,It's by a cloud scientist from Imperial College.
00:04:38,00:04:40,"They form in rising air, right, which is warmer."
00:04:40,00:04:43,"And as the air rises, it stays a bit warmer"
00:04:43,00:04:43,than the surrounding air.
00:04:43,00:04:45,So you get this cloud forming.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"And then, at about 15 kilometers high,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"it hits the tropopause, okay?"
00:04:51,00:04:54,And that is a bit of the atmosphere
00:04:54,00:04:55,"where the temperature starts to increase again,"
00:04:55,00:04:57,so the cloud stops rising.
00:04:57,00:04:59,So that's why these clouds are shaped like anvils.
00:04:59,00:05:02,The tropopause is the bit where the height is limited.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"And it's why you get higher clouds over the equator,"
00:05:04,00:05:07,'cause the tropopause is higher over the equator.
00:05:07,00:05:08,So that's why the very biggest thunder clouds
00:05:08,00:05:10,"happen near the equator,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,'cause they've just got more room to grow
00:05:12,00:05:14,before the temperature naturally limits them again.
00:05:14,00:05:15,- That's really interesting.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- That makes a lot of sense,"
00:05:16,00:05:17,"'cause it gets a bit warmer, doesn't it?"
00:05:17,00:05:20,So it's like a knife slicing the top off
00:05:20,00:05:21,when you hit the tropopause.
00:05:21,00:05:22,"- Exactly, exactly like that."
00:05:22,00:05:24,- Nice.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"- I discovered, by the way, I'm very lucky to be alive"
00:05:26,00:05:29,because I do a thing that should have killed me long ago.
00:05:29,00:05:31,"And when I started researching this,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,I thought lightning was connected to Hector.
00:05:34,00:05:36,But if I'm at home and if it's raining
00:05:36,00:05:38,"and it's a big storm outside,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,"I often would like to have like a hot bath,"
00:05:40,00:05:41,"like, you know, you're stuck inside."
00:05:41,00:05:43,I do that a lot.
00:05:43,00:05:45,- It turns out that's really dangerous over there.
00:05:45,00:05:46,- I think it's not really dangerous.
00:05:46,00:05:47,- It's not really dangerous?
00:05:47,00:05:50,"- I should have died, it is a stretch, isn't it?"
00:05:50,00:05:51,One of the things in your life
00:05:51,00:05:52,should have killed you.
00:05:52,00:05:55,"- What a daredevil, Dan Trover."
00:05:55,00:05:58,Another bath despite it being rainy outside.
00:05:58,00:06:00,I just didn't know this was a possibility
00:06:00,00:06:02,"that basically the ground near your home,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,"if it's hit by a lightning bolt,"
00:06:04,00:06:06,it can be a conductor to bring it through the pipes
00:06:06,00:06:08,"into your, yeah."
00:06:08,00:06:08,- What?
00:06:08,00:06:10,"- I know, right, so there's examples."
00:06:10,00:06:13,"Okay, in November 2007, a bolt struck a teenager"
00:06:13,00:06:16,"who was washing her hair at home in Blandford, England."
00:06:16,00:06:19,It hit her wrist and it knocked the shower head
00:06:19,00:06:20,out of her hand.
00:06:20,00:06:23,"2001, Josephine Martine of Deal, England"
00:06:23,00:06:27,was blown out of her bathtub by a lightning bolt.
00:06:27,00:06:28,- No.
00:06:28,00:06:29,"- Yeah, the mother of three had been soaking"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"in her bathtub during a thunderstorm,"
00:06:31,00:06:34,was catapulted naked through the air by a force of a bolt
00:06:34,00:06:36,landing on the other side of the bathroom.
00:06:36,00:06:36,- Good Lord.
00:06:36,00:06:38,- Yeah.
00:06:38,00:06:40,- Were they fine or did they?
00:06:40,00:06:41,"- Well, yeah, she survived 'cause there's a quote from her,"
00:06:41,00:06:42,so I think she's too.
00:06:42,00:06:43,"- Okay, yeah."
00:06:43,00:06:44,"Shout out to the quote, isn't it?"
00:06:44,00:06:47,(laughing)
00:06:47,00:06:47,- Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:48,"- Sorry, what, how does it hit?"
00:06:48,00:06:49,Sorry.
00:06:49,00:06:50,- What pipes?
00:06:50,00:06:52,"- It hits your, what, the pipes that take water"
00:06:52,00:06:52,into your house?
00:06:52,00:06:53,- Mine are all plastic.
00:06:53,00:06:54,"- Oh, well, you're okay then."
00:06:54,00:06:56,But if you live in an old house.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"- Oh, you're sort of copper and white."
00:06:59,00:07:01,"- Weirdly, even though being in the bath"
00:07:01,00:07:03,"in a lightning storm is a marginally,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,not one percent more dangerous
00:07:05,00:07:08,"than not being in the bath, do you know where the most?"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"- I just stand outside with the golf club,"
00:07:10,00:07:11,"holding it in the air and going,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,"""Well, at least I'm not in the bath."""
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Like, ""Dangerous Dan."""
00:07:15,00:07:18,(laughing)
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Do you know where the safest place to be
00:07:19,00:07:21,is during a lightning storm?
00:07:21,00:07:22,- Oh.
00:07:22,00:07:23,- There are sort of lots of answers to this question.
00:07:23,00:07:25,"- Well, I'll say like, one thing you're often told"
00:07:25,00:07:27,is in your car because it has other wheels.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"- Yes, that's good."
00:07:28,00:07:30,- Faraday cage sort of filament.
00:07:30,00:07:34,"- I'm gonna say under the earth, deep in earth."
00:07:34,00:07:36,- You're thinking more along the right sort of scope
00:07:36,00:07:38,that I was looking for rather than James's.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"- Right, practical."
00:07:40,00:07:41,"- Yeah, practical, this isn't practical."
00:07:41,00:07:44,"- Fort Knox or something like this, like a place,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,is it a particular place?
00:07:45,00:07:48,"- No, I'm gonna tell you, it's the sea."
00:07:48,00:07:50,Lightning does not strike at the sea.
00:07:50,00:07:54,"- Well, I've seen lightning striking in the city."
00:07:54,00:07:55,"- It strikes, I think I've got a photo of it."
00:07:55,00:07:57,- It strikes a 10th as often.
00:07:57,00:07:58,I will backtrack slightly.
00:07:58,00:07:59,(laughing)
00:07:59,00:08:03,It strikes a 10th as often at sea as it does on land.
00:08:03,00:08:06,It is very rare and which I think is really interesting.
00:08:06,00:08:07,- What is a bath but a tiny sea?
00:08:07,00:08:08,- Yeah.
00:08:08,00:08:09,(laughing)
00:08:09,00:08:10,"- Here's the thing,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"if you're a bit scared of lightning like a lot of people are,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"but you think, well, if I can't see it, I'll be okay."
00:08:16,00:08:19,You're not okay 'cause there's a thing called dark lightning.
00:08:19,00:08:21,And this is a shock of energy
00:08:21,00:08:25,that can carry a million times more energy
00:08:25,00:08:26,than visible lightning.
00:08:26,00:08:30,"But if you get shocked, you might not even notice."
00:08:30,00:08:31,- What?
00:08:31,00:08:33,"- It's so weird 'cause it's radiation,"
00:08:33,00:08:36,"it's not electricity, it's radiation hitting you."
00:08:36,00:08:40,It can give you a maximum safe lifetime dose
00:08:40,00:08:43,of ionizing radiation in a single instant.
00:08:43,00:08:45,So it might make you sick.
00:08:45,00:08:46,- So it's gonna give you the amount
00:08:46,00:08:48,that you'd need to have accumulated over your life.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"- Once, really."
00:08:50,00:08:51,So you'll need to avoid all radiation for evermore.
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- Which is impossible, I'm afraid."
00:08:52,00:08:53,- Don't go outside.
00:08:53,00:08:54,- Don't eat bananas.
00:08:54,00:08:55,- Don't go to Cornwall?
00:08:55,00:08:57,"- Don't go to Cornwall's a bit more radioactive, isn't it?"
00:08:57,00:08:58,- It is.
00:08:58,00:09:01,"- Yeah, but there's radiation everywhere."
00:09:01,00:09:04,So you're more likely to get cancers and stuff like that.
00:09:04,00:09:04,"- Okay, right."
00:09:04,00:09:07,"The thing is, there's one dark lightning occurrence"
00:09:07,00:09:08,for every thousand flashes.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"We know 'cause of science,"
00:09:10,00:09:13,but we don't know whether people have been hit by it
00:09:13,00:09:17,"because there's no physical, you know, you can't feel it."
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Can we counter it?
00:09:18,00:09:19,"Like if there's a lightning storm on the way,"
00:09:19,00:09:22,can I get my kids in some sort of anti-dark lightning suit
00:09:22,00:09:23,that we all wear?
00:09:23,00:09:24,Like a--
00:09:24,00:09:26,- You can wear one of those hats with a little windmill on it
00:09:26,00:09:27,and reindeer.
00:09:27,00:09:28,- Dance kids already wear those.
00:09:28,00:09:28,(all laughing)
00:09:28,00:09:31,To protect against the heat and it's the whole thing.
00:09:31,00:09:33,- You can all climb into a microwave.
00:09:33,00:09:34,(all laughing)
00:09:34,00:09:37,"- 'Cause that doesn't let any radiation out, does it?"
00:09:37,00:09:37,"- Oh, there we go."
00:09:37,00:09:40,(all laughing)
00:09:40,00:09:42,"- That way, quick, into the microwave."
00:09:42,00:09:44,- I already don't trust microwaves.
00:09:44,00:09:45,I don't understand that.
00:09:45,00:09:47,The whole thing where you can see the little holes
00:09:47,00:09:49,"and they're like, oh, the radioactive bits"
00:09:49,00:09:51,are just a bit bigger than the hole
00:09:51,00:09:52,"and can't get out, fuck off."
00:09:52,00:09:53,What if they make a hole?
00:09:53,00:09:54,- What are you talking about?
00:09:54,00:09:56,"So there's a mesh in a microwave,"
00:09:56,00:09:59,"which is big enough that microwaves,"
00:09:59,00:10:00,"because of the wavelength, can't get out."
00:10:00,00:10:02,"Often that's why no radiation leaks,"
00:10:02,00:10:04,even though there was a massive conspiracy theory.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"And I think the seventies, which dad still believes."
00:10:07,00:10:08,- Was that a conspiracy theory?
00:10:08,00:10:09,"- Oh, yeah."
00:10:09,00:10:10,"- Oh, wow."
00:10:10,00:10:11,- But you came up with it independently.
00:10:11,00:10:15,This is like convergent evolution or whatever.
00:10:15,00:10:17,(all laughing)
00:10:17,00:10:21,"- You know, we've never talked about Colonel William Rankin,"
00:10:21,00:10:22,who do you guys know?
00:10:22,00:10:23,- Chief Oliver.
00:10:23,00:10:24,- We've never mentioned him.
00:10:24,00:10:25,- What?
00:10:25,00:10:26,"- I don't know who that is, sorry."
00:10:26,00:10:28,"- So basically, no pilot has ever flown through"
00:10:28,00:10:30,"cumulonimbus and succeeded,"
00:10:30,00:10:31,which I think is really interesting
00:10:31,00:10:32,"because they're a common cloud,"
00:10:32,00:10:33,"but if you see one in a plane,"
00:10:33,00:10:34,you cannot get through it
00:10:34,00:10:37,because they're so huge and so dangerous.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"And only one person until 2007, actually,"
00:10:40,00:10:42,is known to have fallen all the way through one and survived.
00:10:42,00:10:45,And it is Lieutenant Colonel William Rankin.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- But he didn't have a great time of it.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"- No, he wouldn't do it again."
00:10:48,00:10:50,(all laughing)
00:10:50,00:10:52,- One star review.
00:10:52,00:10:54,The engine of his fighter jet failed in 1959.
00:10:54,00:10:57,And so he jumped out of the plane
00:10:57,00:10:58,and went through the cloud.
00:10:58,00:10:59,And it's an insane situation to be in.
00:10:59,00:11:01,He got frostbite immediately.
00:11:01,00:11:02,I'll just split a second.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"Decompression meant that his eyes, ears,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"nose, and mouth started bleeding profusely."
00:11:07,00:11:08,"His abdomen swelled, he vomited."
00:11:08,00:11:09,He's in the middle of a cloud
00:11:09,00:11:11,getting buffeted around by the cloud.
00:11:11,00:11:13,"- Yeah, didn't he physically swell up?"
00:11:13,00:11:15,Like he's just like a balloon sort of getting blown up?
00:11:15,00:11:16,- I think he did.
00:11:16,00:11:17,It was amazing for those things
00:11:17,00:11:19,that just looked so fluffy.
00:11:19,00:11:19,- I know.
00:11:19,00:11:21,"- I mean, they look quite benign."
00:11:21,00:11:22,"- But also you can't,"
00:11:22,00:11:23,you don't just fall through that cloud.
00:11:23,00:11:24,"- Oh, okay."
00:11:24,00:11:25,- It keeps you in it.
00:11:25,00:11:26,It's like a washing machine.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"- Oh, 'cause of the correction."
00:11:27,00:11:28,"- Your injection, yeah."
00:11:28,00:11:28,- Yeah.
00:11:28,00:11:31,- Especially because the buffeting of the cloud
00:11:31,00:11:32,flicked a switch on his parachute somehow
00:11:32,00:11:33,and opened it prematurely.
00:11:33,00:11:34,- No!
00:11:34,00:11:37,- So he's stuck in his cloud.
00:11:37,00:11:38,"- Oh, wow."
00:11:38,00:11:40,- He had to hold his breath to avoid drowning
00:11:40,00:11:41,at repeated moments.
00:11:41,00:11:42,"Anyway, he was in there for 40 minutes."
00:11:42,00:11:44,- Oh my God.
00:11:44,00:11:47,- It's gone up and down and up and down.
00:11:47,00:11:47,Awful.
00:11:47,00:11:49,- And then he got out and he wrote a book about it.
00:11:49,00:11:50,- And he survived.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Yeah.
00:11:51,00:11:52,"- James, do you remember?"
00:11:52,00:11:53,I think there was one other story of someone
00:11:53,00:11:54,who might have got it.
00:11:54,00:11:57,She was a paraglider and she got sucked up into it.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"- Yeah, cloud sucked."
00:11:58,00:11:59,- Eva Visnierska.
00:11:59,00:12:00,- Right.
00:12:00,00:12:01,- She did get sucked up.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"And in fact, she was up there for three and a half hours."
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Oh my God.
00:12:04,00:12:06,(all laughing)
00:12:06,00:12:07,Did we ever talk?
00:12:07,00:12:11,I don't think we did about the Hunger Tonga explosion
00:12:11,00:12:12,in the Pacific.
00:12:12,00:12:13,No.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"This was big news,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,but not as big as it should have been.
00:12:16,00:12:16,- Basically.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Very recently.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"- Very recently, 2021."
00:12:19,00:12:20,End of 2021.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"It's an underwater volcano, basically."
00:12:23,00:12:26,And it went off and it blasted through
00:12:26,00:12:28,"150 meters of sea water, right?"
00:12:28,00:12:30,That's how far below the surface it is.
00:12:30,00:12:33,It then sent a plume of ash 36 miles into the air.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"- Yeah, it's mental."
00:12:34,00:12:35,- Wow.
00:12:35,00:12:38,Five billion kilos of matter every second.
00:12:38,00:12:40,Five billion kilos every second.
00:12:40,00:12:41,"- It's amazing, really."
00:12:41,00:12:43,"- I remember it happening and thinking,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"okay, that's, do you remember when that happened"
00:12:45,00:12:46,with Krakatoa?
00:12:46,00:12:47,"- Krakatoa, yeah."
00:12:47,00:12:50,"When Krakatoa went off, basically there was no summer"
00:12:50,00:12:51,"for like three years, right?"
00:12:51,00:12:53,"And I thought that was gonna happen with this one,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,but it just seems to have petered out a bit.
00:12:55,00:12:56,- I know.
00:12:56,00:12:56,- It was so bizarre.
00:12:56,00:12:59,And then it produced the most intense lightning storm
00:12:59,00:13:01,ever on the planet and higher than any lightning
00:13:01,00:13:02,it had ever been.
00:13:02,00:13:03,- Did it cause by the ash?
00:13:03,00:13:04,That big ash cloud?
00:13:04,00:13:05,"- Yeah, this was 19 miles in the air."
00:13:05,00:13:06,- Wow.
00:13:06,00:13:07,- There was lightning going off.
00:13:07,00:13:08,- What?
00:13:08,00:13:09,"- And over 11 hours of this particular storm,"
00:13:09,00:13:12,"there were 192,000 flashes of lightning."
00:13:12,00:13:13,Observe.
00:13:13,00:13:14,- Crazy.
00:13:14,00:13:14,- It's insane.
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- And you say this was over the sea, was it?"
00:13:16,00:13:18,(all laughing)
00:13:18,00:13:19,- I'm afraid.
00:13:19,00:13:20,I'm afraid it was.
00:13:20,00:13:21,- Don't think so.
00:13:21,00:13:23,(all laughing)
00:13:23,00:13:24,I must have been a trigger for the light.
00:13:24,00:13:26,(all laughing)
00:13:26,00:13:29,(upbeat music)
00:13:29,00:13:34,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:13:34,00:13:35,And that is Andy.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- My fact is that during the Second World War,"
00:13:37,00:13:40,a Polish pilot was shot down over Southern England
00:13:40,00:13:42,and he and his parachute landed in the grounds
00:13:42,00:13:43,of a very respectable tennis club.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"He was immediately then signed in as a guest,"
00:13:46,00:13:48,"offered a racket, lent some white flannels"
00:13:48,00:13:51,and thrashed his opponents until the RAF came to collect him.
00:13:51,00:13:52,(all laughing)
00:13:52,00:13:54,- Rankin would have been so jealous of his.
00:13:54,00:13:56,(all laughing)
00:13:56,00:13:57,This is possibly the best parachute landing
00:13:57,00:13:58,anyone's ever made.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"Supposedly, I think it was a longstanding match"
00:14:00,00:14:01,and someone hadn't turned up.
00:14:01,00:14:02,It was a doubles match.
00:14:02,00:14:03,"- Oh, I see."
00:14:03,00:14:04,"- Oh, perfect."
00:14:04,00:14:06,(all laughing)
00:14:06,00:14:07,That's amazing.
00:14:07,00:14:08,"Oh, no, there's only three of us."
00:14:08,00:14:09,We can't play.
00:14:09,00:14:10,Wait a minute.
00:14:10,00:14:13,(all laughing)
00:14:13,00:14:14,- This is so weird.
00:14:14,00:14:15,I should say what this is from.
00:14:15,00:14:18,"This is from Anthony Beaver's book ""The Second World War"","
00:14:18,00:14:22,which is so long and so good.
00:14:22,00:14:23,It's amazing.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"- Oh, it's good though."
00:14:24,00:14:25,There's only a couple of hundred pages in.
00:14:25,00:14:26,I'm in the foothill.
00:14:26,00:14:27,You're gonna be hearing a lot more facts.
00:14:27,00:14:30,"- I'm gonna say, when you're writing your review,"
00:14:30,00:14:31,start with so good.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"Robin, so long, so good."
00:14:33,00:14:34,- I've been looking at it on my shelf
00:14:34,00:14:37,for about nearly a year thinking I can never.
00:14:37,00:14:37,And then I've just started.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"Anyway, it's great."
00:14:39,00:14:40,It's really good.
00:14:40,00:14:42,This is what I would say is the lighter facts in the book.
00:14:42,00:14:44,It's pretty harrowing.
00:14:44,00:14:46,"- He goes heavy, Beaver."
00:14:46,00:14:47,Well done.
00:14:47,00:14:47,- I know.
00:14:47,00:14:50,But this is a light bit of beef and it's great.
00:14:50,00:14:52,"Anyway, and this is all about the Polish pilots"
00:14:52,00:14:54,who fought with the RAF during the Second World War.
00:14:54,00:14:56,Poland was invaded by Germany and the Soviet Union
00:14:56,00:14:59,simultaneously right at the start.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"And yes, of course, you think it started 1930s"
00:15:01,00:15:03,with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
00:15:03,00:15:06,- I kind of think it started with the Treaty of Versailles.
00:15:06,00:15:09,- I'm so glad we're having this chat.
00:15:09,00:15:12,But the Polish armed forces were defeated
00:15:12,00:15:13,pretty rapidly a few weeks
00:15:13,00:15:16,and tens of thousands of soldiers of the pilot went
00:15:16,00:15:18,"to France, big mistake,"
00:15:18,00:15:19,"because several months later,"
00:15:19,00:15:20,France was also overrun.
00:15:20,00:15:22,And then so the Polish pilots hadn't been deployed enough.
00:15:22,00:15:24,So they went to England.
00:15:24,00:15:25,They were quite annoyed at this point.
00:15:25,00:15:28,"Quite, quite keen to get back in the fray."
00:15:28,00:15:29,"- Like annoyed with the Nazis,"
00:15:29,00:15:30,"not just generally annoyed, weren't they?"
00:15:30,00:15:32,- I think they're a bit annoyed with the Soviets as well.
00:15:32,00:15:33,- Yeah.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"- And the Soviets, yep."
00:15:34,00:15:36,- It was a time of justifiable annoyance
00:15:36,00:15:38,"was the hallmark of the, yeah."
00:15:38,00:15:41,And just a large chunk of the RAF actually was Polish
00:15:41,00:15:43,during the Battle of Britain.
00:15:43,00:15:44,When they finally arrived in the UK
00:15:44,00:15:46,"and they were put up with the RAF,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,the RAF people thought these guys are going to be terrible.
00:15:48,00:15:50,Why are we bringing them in?
00:15:50,00:15:51,They've been defeated twice.
00:15:51,00:15:53,They're not going to be any good.
00:15:53,00:15:54,The language barrier didn't help
00:15:54,00:15:56,because they obviously couldn't communicate
00:15:56,00:15:58,if they're good by chatting to them.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"So they said about training them,"
00:16:00,00:16:02,but they did it almost in a slightly mocking sense.
00:16:02,00:16:06,"So in order to teach them their kind of patterns in the sky,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,they put them on tricycles and got them riding around.
00:16:08,00:16:11,"Meanwhile, the Polish guys are thinking, what is this?"
00:16:11,00:16:12,"- Well, little tricycles, like little plastic."
00:16:12,00:16:15,"- Actual tricycles, they were heavily kitted out."
00:16:15,00:16:18,"So the tricycles had things like speedometers,"
00:16:18,00:16:19,"compasses, radios."
00:16:19,00:16:21,"So they were very, very tooled up tricycles, but..."
00:16:21,00:16:24,- I think this was a standard way of training pilots.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"It wasn't just that they thought,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,"oh, we'll just put the Polish people on here."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"- That was a good way. - Well, I think so."
00:16:29,00:16:31,"But the Polish pilots, though, it was ridiculous"
00:16:31,00:16:33,because they were already trained up in this way.
00:16:33,00:16:34,"- Yeah, right."
00:16:34,00:16:36,"- And they fought in a slightly different way,"
00:16:36,00:16:38,which is that they would get up much closer
00:16:38,00:16:40,"to enemy planes in dogfights,"
00:16:40,00:16:43,"which made you more accurate, but was more dangerous."
00:16:43,00:16:47,"So my grandad was in the Squadron 307, I think it was."
00:16:47,00:16:48,It was called the Eagle Owls
00:16:48,00:16:50,'cause they were the only night fighter squadron
00:16:50,00:16:54,"of the Polish squadrons, but he flew Mosquitoes,"
00:16:54,00:16:57,which were the only wooden planes.
00:16:57,00:16:59,And people thought they were mad as well at first.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"It was Haveland, was the guy who made them,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,and it was called the Wooden Wonder.
00:17:04,00:17:05,"At first, they thought, we can't do this."
00:17:05,00:17:07,It'll just be so fragile.
00:17:07,00:17:08,And it turned out to be brilliant.
00:17:08,00:17:11,And the thing about them was they were completely unarmed.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"It's just carrying a bomb, but it's incredibly light"
00:17:14,00:17:16,because it's got no arms on it.
00:17:16,00:17:17,"And it just relies on the fact that 'cause it's very light,"
00:17:17,00:17:21,"it can get away quickly, so they're very, very zippy."
00:17:21,00:17:22,"- Like a Mosquito, I suppose."
00:17:22,00:17:24,- Like a Mosquito.
00:17:24,00:17:26,They were painted blue to match the sky
00:17:26,00:17:28,"'cause they were quite quiet as well, so you could--"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"- Were they the ones, there was a plane,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"and they needed a lot of furniture joiners, basically,"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"to make them, because they were made of wood."
00:17:34,00:17:37,"And oh, wow, it was something like that."
00:17:37,00:17:41,- I was at the Aerospace Museum in Bristol last weekend.
00:17:41,00:17:43,And if you look at these old planes
00:17:43,00:17:45,"made out of canvas and wood and stuff,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,do you think how on earth does that stay out?
00:17:47,00:17:49,"- Yeah, it's extraordinary cool."
00:17:49,00:17:50,"- It looks nicer as well, though, than Mosquito,"
00:17:50,00:17:51,"'cause it is made of wood,"
00:17:51,00:17:54,so I think everyone would have stopped to admire it.
00:17:54,00:17:56,I got really confused reading an article
00:17:56,00:17:58,"which showed, actually, from his squadron,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,which showed a picture of one of the other people in it
00:18:00,00:18:03,standing next to his plane and had four swastikas on it.
00:18:03,00:18:05,"And I couldn't, it took me ages to work out"
00:18:05,00:18:07,"why there were four swastikas on it, do you know?"
00:18:07,00:18:08,"- I do, actually."
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- Yeah, go on, yeah, I didn't know this."
00:18:09,00:18:11,"- Basically, it was an intimidation tactic,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,so you would put your kill list on the side of your plane.
00:18:14,00:18:15,"So as people were flying up beside you,"
00:18:15,00:18:18,"they'd go, ""Oh my God, he's killed six Nazis."""
00:18:18,00:18:20,"- Oh, you put a swastika on every time you killed a Nazi?"
00:18:20,00:18:21,"- Yeah, you'd paint on the outside body."
00:18:21,00:18:22,"- Those people who were doing riots,"
00:18:22,00:18:25,"it's the UK last week, with swastikas on their body,"
00:18:25,00:18:28,had they all been attacking Nazis as well.
00:18:28,00:18:29,- That's absolutely correct.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"- It wouldn't necessarily be just swastikas,"
00:18:31,00:18:33,"it'd be skulls and so on, and there were different weights,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,so you would have a skull that was colored
00:18:35,00:18:37,"in a certain way that said, ""That's a death."""
00:18:37,00:18:39,"The next one might be, ""I damaged the plane."""
00:18:39,00:18:40,"It was like a whole sort of like,"
00:18:40,00:18:43,a bit of reading time for the enemy to catch up on.
00:18:43,00:18:45,- They were very rarely flying alongside each other
00:18:45,00:18:47,"for that long, to be honest."
00:18:47,00:18:49,- But it is a bit of a Wikipedia entry
00:18:49,00:18:51,"that you can see like, ""Oh!"""
00:18:51,00:18:54,- And then they became famous as being really sort of brave
00:18:54,00:18:57,"and full of daring do, and that kind of stuff, didn't they?"
00:18:57,00:18:59,- I think they were the most important in the battle of Britain.
00:18:59,00:19:02,A Polish squadron was the most important squadron
00:19:02,00:19:02,down the West Coast.
00:19:02,00:19:04,- And that's why if you drive out of London
00:19:04,00:19:06,"to the West these days on the A-40,"
00:19:06,00:19:08,"you always see the Polish War Memorial,"
00:19:08,00:19:09,"which is one of the roundabouts,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,which I've always seen and never really knew
00:19:11,00:19:14,why Polish War Memorial and not all the other countries.
00:19:14,00:19:15,- Who is that?
00:19:15,00:19:16,I can't see that.
00:19:16,00:19:18,"- Haven't you, you'd know if you grew up in my family,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"'cause every time we passed it on the way out of London,"
00:19:20,00:19:22,"my dad would go, ""Oh, I forgot again."""
00:19:22,00:19:25,- Probably Polish the War Memorial.
00:19:25,00:19:26,"- Oh, Polish, I see."
00:19:26,00:19:27,"- Yeah, Polish War Memorial."
00:19:27,00:19:28,- That was good.
00:19:28,00:19:30,"- Yeah, and it's all in capitals and stuff."
00:19:30,00:19:34,"Oh, that's a good joke if you're ever on the M-40."
00:19:34,00:19:36,- That's a great M-40 joke.
00:19:36,00:19:38,There's quite a few stories of these pilots
00:19:38,00:19:41,who had to bail and landed in various places.
00:19:41,00:19:43,So the tennis match is a great one.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"There was another pilot who,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,he landed in a South London back garden
00:19:46,00:19:49,and there was a girl waiting out there as she landed.
00:19:49,00:19:50,They got married two months later.
00:19:50,00:19:51,So that was really good.
00:19:51,00:19:53,"- So she's like, ""Oh, you know what?"
00:19:53,00:19:55,"""It's a shame that I don't have someone to get my--"""
00:19:55,00:19:57,- Who's that?
00:19:57,00:20:00,"- Good men don't just fall out of the sky, honey."
00:20:00,00:20:01,You'll be waiting there ages.
00:20:01,00:20:03,There was a third guy who he landed
00:20:03,00:20:05,and the people around him and the town
00:20:05,00:20:06,"thought that he was enemy,"
00:20:06,00:20:07,so they were going in to lynch him
00:20:07,00:20:08,"and as they were getting close to him,"
00:20:08,00:20:10,"he just went, ""Fuck off."""
00:20:10,00:20:12,"And they went, ""Oh, he's one of ours."""
00:20:12,00:20:15,"- Like no German would know how to say, ""Fuck off."""
00:20:15,00:20:17,(all laugh)
00:20:17,00:20:18,- Tennis in war?
00:20:18,00:20:19,"- Yeah, okay."
00:20:19,00:20:20,"- Oh, wow. - Was this a tennis court?"
00:20:20,00:20:21,"- Sure, yeah."
00:20:21,00:20:24,"- Well, you know Roland Garros?"
00:20:24,00:20:25,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:26,- So what's that?
00:20:26,00:20:27,- It's where the French opens hell.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"- Yeah, right."
00:20:28,00:20:30,Did you know Roland Garros was a man?
00:20:30,00:20:33,He developed the first single seat fighter plane
00:20:33,00:20:35,which was fitted with a machine gun.
00:20:35,00:20:36,That was his thing.
00:20:36,00:20:38,That's why they named the stadium after him
00:20:38,00:20:38,'cause he was a war hero
00:20:38,00:20:40,and they built the stadium in the '20s.
00:20:40,00:20:41,- It's quite a weird leap
00:20:41,00:20:42,as in to decide to name a tennis stadium
00:20:42,00:20:44,"after some months of that, but yeah."
00:20:44,00:20:44,- It was a weird leap.
00:20:44,00:20:47,"And he was, but he was a sort of pioneering pilot."
00:20:47,00:20:49,He was the first person to fly across the Mediterranean
00:20:49,00:20:53,"in about 1913, so very, very early stuff."
00:20:53,00:20:55,The problem was guns were always behind the propeller.
00:20:55,00:20:56,- Oh yeah. - And that was a big
00:20:56,00:20:58,"problem in the end. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:58,00:21:00,"- You shoot your propeller off, oh no."
00:21:00,00:21:01,- So annoying. - So did he invent
00:21:01,00:21:03,"the rotation? - No, he did not invent"
00:21:03,00:21:05,the clever system which allows you to fire
00:21:05,00:21:06,in between the propellers passing.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"- What a, imagine the genius"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"who thought of that. - Well no, he just,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,"he and his mechanic developed a similar system,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,but it was like a wedge which deflected
00:21:14,00:21:16,the occasional rounds which did hit the propeller.
00:21:16,00:21:17,"- Oh, I see. - So it was very much"
00:21:17,00:21:19,"a forge job, and then I think it was a German engineer"
00:21:19,00:21:21,"who actually thought, no, you developed"
00:21:21,00:21:23,the system to fire between.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"- And can we just say before Dan says,"
00:21:24,00:21:25,what a genius who thought of that.
00:21:25,00:21:29,I think a lot of people had thought of that before.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"That was like, first thing you think is,"
00:21:31,00:21:32,"well, we should just get it to fire between them."
00:21:32,00:21:34,I think it's actually putting that into action
00:21:34,00:21:36,that proved difficult.
00:21:36,00:21:40,- I clearly met the person who pulled it off.
00:21:40,00:21:42,(all laughing)
00:21:42,00:21:48,"- Only thing, light bulb moment, guys."
00:21:48,00:21:50,We should just fly to the moon.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"- Yeah, anyway, that was his,"
00:21:53,00:21:54,his innovation was sort of not quite
00:21:54,00:21:55,"working that out, basically."
00:21:55,00:21:58,- But do you know he has a tennis connection?
00:21:58,00:21:58,- Who? - Who?
00:21:58,00:22:00,"- Roland Garros, there's this amazing story"
00:22:00,00:22:04,"which happened on April the 1st, but was real."
00:22:04,00:22:06,So he was this incredibly famous fly.
00:22:06,00:22:08,"He went down over France, 1915,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"and he was flying this plane he designed,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,so he tried to burn it so the Germans
00:22:12,00:22:13,"didn't get hold of the technology,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"but failed, and they did."
00:22:15,00:22:18,"And he was in a German prison of war camp,"
00:22:18,00:22:21,and he sent these coded message back to France
00:22:21,00:22:24,to arrange for the delivery of two tennis rackets.
00:22:24,00:22:27,"And within the tennis racket handles hollowed out,"
00:22:27,00:22:29,"were in one handle a map of Germany,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,and in the other handle a felt hat
00:22:31,00:22:33,to use as a disguise for escaping.
00:22:33,00:22:35,(all laughing)
00:22:35,00:22:36,- You're gonna look like a Frenchman
00:22:36,00:22:37,if you're wearing a felt hat.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- Yeah, that's where they went wrong."
00:22:39,00:22:43,- You've got two tennis rackets handles worth of stuff.
00:22:43,00:22:45,I guess a map is a good thing to pick.
00:22:45,00:22:46,- A map is a good one.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"- Yeah, I think a felt hat feels like"
00:22:48,00:22:51,a needless waste of a racket.
00:22:51,00:22:51,(all laughing)
00:22:51,00:22:53,"- What would you put in it, Andy?"
00:22:53,00:22:54,A sausage?
00:22:54,00:22:56,(all laughing)
00:22:56,00:22:57,Everyone's gonna believe you're a German
00:22:57,00:22:58,if you're waving a sausage around.
00:22:58,00:22:59,- That's it.
00:22:59,00:23:00,- And it's just the right shape.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"- Yeah, just a giant pepper army."
00:23:02,00:23:04,"- Yeah, not thin sausage, but yeah."
00:23:04,00:23:05,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:23:05,00:23:07,"- Well, no, it didn't, went with a felt hat."
00:23:07,00:23:08,"And actually, I don't think he used it."
00:23:08,00:23:10,He ended up making his own costume
00:23:10,00:23:12,to mimic the guard's costumes
00:23:12,00:23:14,and then walked out dressed as a guard.
00:23:14,00:23:14,- What a legend.
00:23:14,00:23:16,- Yeah. - That's great.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"- Speaking of clothing and tennis,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"this is not about war,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,but it's a story that I really like.
00:23:21,00:23:24,"Pat Stewart, who was a tennis player in the '60s,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,she was single and she was playing at Wimbledon
00:23:27,00:23:29,and she wanted a boyfriend.
00:23:29,00:23:32,And so she embroidered her phone number on her knickers.
00:23:33,00:23:37,And the hope was that the paparazzi
00:23:37,00:23:38,would take photos of it
00:23:38,00:23:40,and then someone would give her a call.
00:23:40,00:23:41,- And?
00:23:41,00:23:43,- It seems like no one did.
00:23:43,00:23:45,- Oh.
00:23:45,00:23:47,- Although she did a few months later meet
00:23:47,00:23:50,"and marry a cricketer called John Edric,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,but they did divorce a few months later.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"But it's quite a nice way to advertise yourself, isn't it?"
00:23:54,00:23:56,It's quite forward.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"- Yeah, it's not everyone's type."
00:23:57,00:23:58,- I would almost be a bit intimidated
00:23:58,00:24:01,by someone that confident in themselves.
00:24:01,00:24:02,- And I think a lot of the Wimbledon audience
00:24:02,00:24:04,might feel the same way.
00:24:04,00:24:06,I think maybe she hasn't chosen her audience.
00:24:06,00:24:07,"- I just do, right?"
00:24:07,00:24:08,"Actually, I've got to put on a telegram."
00:24:08,00:24:10,- Have you heard of Hans Reddle?
00:24:10,00:24:11,"I'm looking at you especially,"
00:24:11,00:24:12,"James and Anna, sports people."
00:24:12,00:24:13,"- No, I don't think so."
00:24:13,00:24:16,"- Well, of course he got to the fourth round"
00:24:16,00:24:18,of the men's singles in Wimbledon in 1947.
00:24:18,00:24:19,So I'm surprised you haven't heard that.
00:24:19,00:24:21,"- Oh, Hans Reddle."
00:24:21,00:24:22,(laughing)
00:24:22,00:24:23,"- No, Reddle."
00:24:23,00:24:24,(laughing)
00:24:24,00:24:27,"Sorry, different name."
00:24:27,00:24:29,"But it's quite impressive for a particular reason,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,which is that he had one arm.
00:24:31,00:24:34,And he had lost his other arm in the Battle of Stalingrad.
00:24:34,00:24:35,- Really?
00:24:35,00:24:36,"- He seemed to be fighting, I presume,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,"in the German army, he was Austrian."
00:24:38,00:24:40,And he was given special dispensation
00:24:40,00:24:42,to touch the ball twice every time.
00:24:42,00:24:43,- Come on.
00:24:43,00:24:44,"- Oh, sorry."
00:24:44,00:24:45,- I'm watching you touch the ball.
00:24:45,00:24:46,- Every time he served.
00:24:46,00:24:49,So he would toss the ball into the air with his racket.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"- Oh, then serve."
00:24:50,00:24:53,"- 'Cause otherwise, it does make it quite a lot easier."
00:24:53,00:24:54,(laughing)
00:24:54,00:24:57,(upbeat music)
00:24:59,00:25:01,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,and that is James.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"- Okay, my fact this week is that things named"
00:25:05,00:25:09,"after May West include a soda bottle,"
00:25:09,00:25:12,"a gas pump, a parachute malfunction,"
00:25:12,00:25:15,and a graph that explains the nuclear fission of uranium.
00:25:15,00:25:17,(laughing)
00:25:17,00:25:18,- What a lady.
00:25:18,00:25:19,- What's that?
00:25:19,00:25:19,(laughing)
00:25:19,00:25:20,- A parachute.
00:25:20,00:25:21,- She didn't invent all these things.
00:25:21,00:25:23,"She came up with the idea, of course,"
00:25:23,00:25:24,but she didn't actually.
00:25:24,00:25:25,- I know what you're gonna say.
00:25:25,00:25:29,It's not an item that is designed to be a malfunction.
00:25:29,00:25:30,A parachute malfunction is interesting.
00:25:30,00:25:32,- Did you take this off my parachute actually?
00:25:32,00:25:33,(laughing)
00:25:33,00:25:35,"- The parachute one is basically,"
00:25:35,00:25:38,it makes your canopy stick out in quite a suggestive way.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"And most of these, if not all of them,"
00:25:41,00:25:43,I'd use the fact that May West was famous
00:25:43,00:25:44,for an hourglass figure.
00:25:44,00:25:45,"- Oh, really?"
00:25:45,00:25:46,"I thought the gas pump would be,"
00:25:46,00:25:49,"'cause she was like pump, pump, pump, pumping away."
00:25:49,00:25:50,- Oh.
00:25:50,00:25:51,(laughing)
00:25:51,00:25:52,- In the bedroom?
00:25:52,00:25:55,"- No, as in working hard in the industry."
00:25:55,00:25:55,"- Oh, right."
00:25:55,00:25:58,"- No, it was because it has like a slim waist kind of thing."
00:25:58,00:26:00,- I see.
00:26:00,00:26:03,- And the graph of the products of nuclear fission
00:26:03,00:26:07,of uranium is basically two sort of normal distribution curves.
00:26:07,00:26:09,So it's like a pair of boobs.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- Oh, okay."
00:26:11,00:26:13,"She was actually quite a sort of slim,"
00:26:13,00:26:14,straight up and down lady.
00:26:14,00:26:18,She wasn't actually a sort of Jessica Rabbit style.
00:26:18,00:26:20,- She wasn't Jessica Rabbit style
00:26:20,00:26:22,because that is just impossible.
00:26:22,00:26:23,- 'Cause it's cartoon.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- Cartoon, yeah, okay."
00:26:24,00:26:25,"- But, yeah, I mean, yeah."
00:26:25,00:26:27,"- I haven't studied her, actually,"
00:26:27,00:26:29,"I can picture her face, but I haven't studied her body."
00:26:29,00:26:30,I just assumed she had that.
00:26:30,00:26:31,It was that all over the place.
00:26:31,00:26:31,"- Well, I read that."
00:26:31,00:26:32,"I'd like to clarify,"
00:26:32,00:26:33,I haven't been studying pictures of Maywest.
00:26:33,00:26:37,"I just, I'm, yeah, I would say she was--"
00:26:37,00:26:38,- She was curvaceous.
00:26:38,00:26:38,- She was curvaceous.
00:26:38,00:26:39,"- Oh, okay."
00:26:39,00:26:40,- And she had the thin waist.
00:26:40,00:26:41,- Okay.
00:26:41,00:26:42,"- In actual fact, I believe the word curvaceous"
00:26:42,00:26:44,was coined specifically for her.
00:26:44,00:26:45,- No.
00:26:45,00:26:46,- Pretty interesting.
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- Yeah, if you look in the OED,"
00:26:47,00:26:51,basically all of the first few citations are about her.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"And the earliest one says,"
00:26:52,00:26:55,"""A new word has been coined to fit the personality"
00:26:55,00:26:56,"""of Maywest."
00:26:56,00:26:58,"""The word curvaceous is a combination of curves"
00:26:58,00:27:02,"""and vivacious to have Miss West's chief characteristic."""
00:27:02,00:27:03,- That's incredible.
00:27:03,00:27:04,That's so good.
00:27:04,00:27:06,I had no idea that's where the word came from.
00:27:06,00:27:06,That's brilliant.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"- Yes, 'cause we don't assume the vivacious bit."
00:27:08,00:27:10,You can't just have big boobs and big hips.
00:27:10,00:27:12,You've got to have the character to go with it.
00:27:12,00:27:13,- Yeah.
00:27:13,00:27:14,- Correct.
00:27:14,00:27:14,"- Is that a lesson for you ladies,"
00:27:14,00:27:15,an anti-feminist lesson?
00:27:15,00:27:17,(all laughing)
00:27:17,00:27:20,"- Yeah, when I say that to women on the tube."
00:27:20,00:27:21,(all laughing)
00:27:21,00:27:24,- There's no point just having big boobs.
00:27:24,00:27:25,I weren't your personality.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"I'm just asking you for your tickets, sir."
00:27:27,00:27:29,(all laughing)
00:27:29,00:27:30,- Okay.
00:27:30,00:27:32,"I mean, so there was another thing named after her"
00:27:32,00:27:34,"in the, actually, Sakamawbo,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,some twin turreted combat tanks.
00:27:36,00:27:37,- Yes.
00:27:37,00:27:37,"- Yes, reasons."
00:27:37,00:27:38,- Yes.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"- A live jacket,"
00:27:39,00:27:42,which makes you look like you've got big boobs.
00:27:42,00:27:43,- Yeah.
00:27:43,00:27:45,- The grip she had on the 20th century.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"We should step back and say who she is,"
00:27:47,00:27:51,because she was a great comedian of her time.
00:27:51,00:27:54,And her time would have been the 1930s and so on.
00:27:54,00:27:58,"She was in movies, she wrote novels, she wrote plays."
00:27:58,00:27:59,She has so many one-liners
00:27:59,00:28:02,and they were the kind of lines that you just saw.
00:28:02,00:28:04,You wouldn't get away with that at the time.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"- I used to be snow white, but I drifted."
00:28:07,00:28:09,All of that stuff.
00:28:09,00:28:10,- Without the noise.
00:28:10,00:28:11,"- No, with the noise."
00:28:11,00:28:12,- With the noise.
00:28:12,00:28:13,- That's the way that we're coming back
00:28:13,00:28:16,"to your comedy noise again, which we mentioned last week."
00:28:16,00:28:17,"- Can you do when I'm good, I'm good,"
00:28:17,00:28:18,"but when I'm bad, I'm better."
00:28:18,00:28:20,"- When I'm good, I'm very, very good."
00:28:20,00:28:22,"But when I'm bad, I'm better."
00:28:22,00:28:26,"- Ooh, whacka, whacka, whacka, whacka."
00:28:26,00:28:27,- Very whacka.
00:28:27,00:28:28,Is that a guy in your pocket?
00:28:28,00:28:29,I think that was her.
00:28:29,00:28:31,"- She did say that in a film in the end,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,but I don't think it was the first instance.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"She said it in the film weirdly in the seventh,"
00:28:34,00:28:35,like the last film she did
00:28:35,00:28:36,or one of the last films she did.
00:28:36,00:28:39,"- Oh yeah, yeah, she did a film at the edge of about 80,"
00:28:39,00:28:42,but she was described in her obituary as a sex personality.
00:28:42,00:28:46,It was a big part of her character and her persona.
00:28:46,00:28:49,"- Yeah, I think it's really weird that if you think of people"
00:28:49,00:28:50,"who push the boundaries of comedy,"
00:28:50,00:28:51,"Lenny Bruce will be someone,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,"we've spoken about him on the show before,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,who was jailed because he was saying words
00:28:55,00:28:57,that you weren't allowed to say on stage concepts.
00:28:57,00:28:58,That's what Mae West was doing.
00:28:58,00:29:02,"And she was in fact jailed for, meant to be 10 days."
00:29:02,00:29:03,"In the end, it was eight days"
00:29:03,00:29:05,'cause she got off a good behavior.
00:29:05,00:29:07,- One wonders what that good behavior was.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"- Oh yeah, I got off a good behavior, I know I got off."
00:29:10,00:29:12,- Someone else got off as well.
00:29:12,00:29:17,"- But yeah, she wrote a Broadway play in 1926 called Sex."
00:29:17,00:29:20,And the production was taken up by the city officials
00:29:20,00:29:21,as offensive.
00:29:21,00:29:23,"They said, ""You're gonna go to jail or pay a fine."""
00:29:23,00:29:25,"And she said, ""Put me in jail."""
00:29:25,00:29:26,'Cause she thought the publicity would be great.
00:29:26,00:29:28,But she also meant it.
00:29:28,00:29:30,"She was like, ""I should be saying this on stage."
00:29:30,00:29:31,"This is fine."""
00:29:31,00:29:32,She doesn't get the credit.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"- I read something really interesting about sex, the play."
00:29:34,00:29:38,I thought it was banned because it itself was so lurid
00:29:38,00:29:39,"and so sexy and too pornographic,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,but it had been on for about a year in New York
00:29:41,00:29:44,"before they stormed in and banned it, been on for a while."
00:29:44,00:29:46,But the thing that had happened was
00:29:46,00:29:48,she'd written another play called Drag.
00:29:48,00:29:51,"And that was showing somewhere else, I think in Connecticut."
00:29:51,00:29:54,And that was all about homosexuality.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"You know, it's called Drag."
00:29:55,00:29:56,"It ends in this huge, big drag show."
00:29:56,00:29:59,It's about lots of gay relationships happening.
00:29:59,00:30:01,The lead character is a guy who's in the closet.
00:30:01,00:30:04,And I believe that the authorities in New York
00:30:04,00:30:05,couldn't clamp down on that
00:30:05,00:30:07,"because it was outside their jurisdiction,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,but they really didn't want to get into New York.
00:30:09,00:30:11,So they then clamped down on sex.
00:30:11,00:30:12,- And the New York Times called it a crude
00:30:12,00:30:15,"and inept play, cheaply produced and polyactive."
00:30:15,00:30:16,- Is that a sex or drag?
00:30:16,00:30:17,- That was sex.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"- But of course, because it was being banned,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,everyone wanted to see it.
00:30:21,00:30:23,"And it became really, really popular."
00:30:23,00:30:26,Another thing was that it had African-American music in it.
00:30:26,00:30:30,And that was seen as hot jazz.
00:30:30,00:30:30,That was the other thing.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"You know, it features lots of sexy stuff."
00:30:34,00:30:36,"There is prostitution, there are pimps,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"there are corrupt cops who are not in themselves sexy,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,I suppose.
00:30:39,00:30:40,(all laughing)
00:30:40,00:30:41,It sounds pretty sexy.
00:30:41,00:30:42,Sorry.
00:30:42,00:30:45,I'm showing my predilections there.
00:30:45,00:30:48,"Anyway, but the point was that her character,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,because she played a lady of the night
00:30:50,00:30:53,and she really doesn't have anything to apologise for.
00:30:53,00:30:54,And she played a woman who thinks
00:30:54,00:30:56,she has nothing to apologise for.
00:30:56,00:31:00,And you were allowed to show grime and semeness
00:31:00,00:31:02,as long as everyone repents hard at the end.
00:31:02,00:31:03,"And she didn't, you know."
00:31:03,00:31:07,So I think that was another part of the moral objection to it.
00:31:07,00:31:10,"- Yeah, literally people must have been just on the floor"
00:31:10,00:31:11,"with shop, she was doing all this"
00:31:11,00:31:13,and sticking out for every minority there was
00:31:13,00:31:16,because she considered herself kind of among them.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"She'd come from the society's underbelly really,"
00:31:18,00:31:19,hadn't she?
00:31:19,00:31:21,"Her dad was a street fighter, I think."
00:31:21,00:31:22,"- Yeah, he was."
00:31:22,00:31:23,"He was a boxer, yeah."
00:31:23,00:31:27,"- Who was, although he went on to be a masseuse, weirdly."
00:31:27,00:31:28,- That's interesting.
00:31:28,00:31:28,Did he keep the gloves on?
00:31:28,00:31:29,Do you reckon?
00:31:29,00:31:30,(all laughing)
00:31:30,00:31:32,- Just like your predilection to get there.
00:31:32,00:31:34,(all laughing)
00:31:34,00:31:36,"- People asked for it, I think he'd go for it."
00:31:36,00:31:37,- That makes sense.
00:31:37,00:31:37,"You can't box anymore,"
00:31:37,00:31:39,but you've been in the industry
00:31:39,00:31:41,where they don't have lots of masseuses.
00:31:41,00:31:42,- Let me pound you in the ring.
00:31:42,00:31:43,That kind of stuff.
00:31:43,00:31:45,(all laughing)
00:31:45,00:31:47,"- Okay, he also became a special policeman,"
00:31:47,00:31:48,"which I'm not quite sure what that means,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,"but it sounds like he might also be up your street, Andy."
00:31:50,00:31:51,(all laughing)
00:31:51,00:31:53,"- Another sexy is a corrupt one, but yeah."
00:31:53,00:31:56,"That's a dirty cough, no doubt, yeah."
00:31:56,00:31:59,"- Can I just say back to sex, just on that?"
00:31:59,00:32:03,So the group that was campaigning against the play sex
00:32:03,00:32:07,was called the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.
00:32:07,00:32:11,"And they were founded by the world's greatest prude,"
00:32:11,00:32:16,"called Anthony Cornstock, a self-given nickname, I think."
00:32:16,00:32:18,And he had been inspired by the death of a friend
00:32:18,00:32:20,who'd become addicted to pornography
00:32:20,00:32:22,and masturbated himself to death.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- No.
00:32:23,00:32:24,- Or so he thought.
00:32:24,00:32:25,- Sad on the gravestone.
00:32:25,00:32:28,(all laughing)
00:32:28,00:32:31,"- Yeah, so he thought that that's what had happened."
00:32:31,00:32:34,And he decided to start the society for prudery.
00:32:34,00:32:37,And it was these guys who stopped sex.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"- I didn't know, I didn't know that."
00:32:38,00:32:41,That's incredible. - I've heard the name
00:32:41,00:32:43,"Cornstock. - You'll know the Cornstock law,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,"I think, which was an American thing"
00:32:45,00:32:49,"which stopped you from having any obscene material,"
00:32:49,00:32:50,but it stopped you from sending anything
00:32:50,00:32:51,through the post as well.
00:32:51,00:32:54,And what that meant was you couldn't send
00:32:54,00:32:57,any contraception leaflets or anything like that.
00:32:57,00:32:59,So it's part of that whole song.
00:32:59,00:33:01,"- Cornstock was a nickname, did you say?"
00:33:01,00:33:02,"- No, that was his surname."
00:33:02,00:33:05,His nickname was the world's greatest prude.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"- Oh, okay, when you said Cornstock,"
00:33:08,00:33:09,"I was like, oh, that's a weird nickname."
00:33:09,00:33:10,(all laughing)
00:33:10,00:33:12,"But also, it just made me think"
00:33:12,00:33:13,when you said the masturbation thing.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"I thought, oh, Cornstock, is that?"
00:33:15,00:33:18,'Cause Cornflakes was an anti-masturbation thing.
00:33:18,00:33:21,"Was it all about corn? - Your mind is incredible, Deb."
00:33:21,00:33:22,All the effort that you put
00:33:22,00:33:24,into making these unbelievably great connections
00:33:24,00:33:27,wouldn't be necessary if you just listened a bit more.
00:33:27,00:33:30,(all laughing)
00:33:30,00:33:32,- It's really amazing. - It's the shittest Colombo.
00:33:32,00:33:34,(all laughing)
00:33:34,00:33:36,- That's so embarrassing about his friend as well.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"- I know. - He keeps going around saying,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"""This is in honor of my friend."""
00:33:39,00:33:42,"""Wrightfully, dive masturbating."""
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- Yeah, it feels like he didn't really like that guy, didn't it?"
00:33:44,00:33:45,"- No, he was just having a bath"
00:33:45,00:33:46,and he got hit by lightning.
00:33:46,00:33:49,(all laughing)
00:33:49,00:33:52,- Mae West loved having an enema.
00:33:52,00:33:54,So when she was in her vaudeville days
00:33:54,00:33:55,"and she used to go to the bathrooms,"
00:33:55,00:33:59,"she was saying this, like, filthy, I'd never using these."
00:33:59,00:34:01,And so she used to give herself a daily enema
00:34:01,00:34:03,so that she didn't have to deal with them.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"And that became part of her,"
00:34:05,00:34:06,if you were doing a movie with her.
00:34:06,00:34:08,So Tony Curtis talks about this.
00:34:08,00:34:11,"He says on the last film that she did,"
00:34:11,00:34:12,"""Sex Tet,"" which he was in,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,he said that she would get her makeup done
00:34:14,00:34:17,"and then always, 11 a.m. approximately in the morning,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,"she would then have the final bit of getting ready,"
00:34:19,00:34:20,"which was to have her enema,"
00:34:20,00:34:21,and then she was ready for the set.
00:34:21,00:34:22,"- And then she said,"
00:34:22,00:34:26,"""I keep my friends close, but my enemas closer."""
00:34:26,00:34:29,- Nice. - Whack-a-whack-a-whack.
00:34:29,00:34:32,"- She did a really strong line in objectifying men,"
00:34:32,00:34:33,"which I think we approve of,"
00:34:33,00:34:35,'cause obviously women were used to being objectified
00:34:35,00:34:37,for thousands of years.
00:34:37,00:34:39,"After her sort of Hollywood career,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,she set up a vagus review of sort of
00:34:41,00:34:43,"these bulging, beefy muscle men"
00:34:43,00:34:45,so that women could come and look at them.
00:34:45,00:34:46,"'Cause she said, you know,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"""Men have always had something to look at,"
00:34:48,00:34:49,"""now it's time for the wives to have something."""
00:34:49,00:34:52,- I think it's basically magic Mike
00:34:52,00:34:53,that she sort of invented.
00:34:53,00:34:55,I know there were muscle shows before that.
00:34:55,00:34:58,"It's like ""Mr. Universe"" and stuff that Charles Atlas was in."
00:34:58,00:35:00,- Charles Atlas and Eugene Sandoval.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"So there were muscle men before,"
00:35:01,00:35:05,but I think she kind of turned it into a show.
00:35:05,00:35:06,- She turned it into more of a sexy thing.
00:35:06,00:35:08,- Coca-Cola bottles used to be called
00:35:08,00:35:09,"Maywest bottles as well, by the way."
00:35:09,00:35:12,- So the first thing in my fact was soda bottles
00:35:12,00:35:14,"are named after her, and that was what I'm talking about."
00:35:14,00:35:16,"- Yeah, and I thought, 'cause it said"
00:35:16,00:35:19,"that it was inspired by her, and that's not true."
00:35:19,00:35:20,That just sort of got around.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"But on Coca-Cola's website, they describe it."
00:35:22,00:35:24,These used to be called Maywest.
00:35:24,00:35:27,"So they were designed to look a bit like coca beans,"
00:35:27,00:35:31,and then they decided that they needed to be more curvy
00:35:31,00:35:34,because they kept rolling off the conveyor belts.
00:35:34,00:35:36,"So remember we talked about conveyor belts last week,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"and so they kept rolling off the conveyor belts,"
00:35:38,00:35:40,and so they changed the shape very slightly
00:35:40,00:35:43,so that they rolled over an axis and went straight
00:35:43,00:35:46,rather than kind of rolling off to the left or the right.
00:35:46,00:35:48,So that's why the modern Coca-Cola bottle looks like it is.
00:35:48,00:35:50,"- That's great, practical."
00:35:50,00:35:53,- She came to the UK once with a play.
00:35:53,00:35:56,"It was actually in 1947, which is the year that that guy,"
00:35:56,00:35:59,"Reddle, got to the fourth round of the men's singles"
00:35:59,00:36:00,at Wimbledon with one arm.
00:36:00,00:36:01,"- Wow, what were the chances?"
00:36:01,00:36:03,- That's not why she was here.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"She arrived, and for her first press conference,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,"she arrived, she said, ""I want every man in England"
00:36:08,00:36:09,"""to come up and see me."""
00:36:09,00:36:12,Especially this big Ben character I hear about.
00:36:12,00:36:13,"Brilliant. - Great, nice."
00:36:13,00:36:15,"- Anyway, when she was here, she did her play, obviously,"
00:36:15,00:36:16,but she also went to a boxing match.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"She went to the Dunlop factory,"
00:36:18,00:36:21,where she signed an inflatable life jacket.
00:36:21,00:36:23,- Yeah. - And I love this.
00:36:23,00:36:25,She went to the opening
00:36:25,00:36:28,of the British philatelic exhibition in Glasgow.
00:36:28,00:36:30,"There was a stamp exhibition on, and she was there."
00:36:30,00:36:34,- I think that she confused the word philately with philatio.
00:36:34,00:36:35,"- I mean, that's what happened, yeah."
00:36:35,00:36:38,"- Philately will get you nowhere, boys."
00:36:38,00:36:39,(laughing)
00:36:39,00:36:41,(upbeat music)
00:36:41,00:36:46,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:36:46,00:36:47,and that is my fact.
00:36:47,00:36:50,"My fact this week is that in 2013,"
00:36:50,00:36:53,a survey revealed that 97% of students
00:36:53,00:36:55,studying Finnish at Vienna University
00:36:55,00:36:58,were mainly doing so because of their love
00:36:58,00:37:00,for the country's death metal bands.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"And most of them, by the way, sing in English,"
00:37:02,00:37:05,so there's no real point in doing that.
00:37:05,00:37:08,"But yeah, death metal from Finland is responsible"
00:37:08,00:37:10,as the main reason for all these students
00:37:10,00:37:11,"studying the language. - I can see that, yeah."
00:37:11,00:37:13,- In a way. - Yeah.
00:37:13,00:37:14,- Can you? - I can actually.
00:37:14,00:37:16,- I find the lyrics in metal music
00:37:16,00:37:19,"quite difficult to make out, and I don't know."
00:37:19,00:37:20,"And I speak the language of English,"
00:37:20,00:37:22,which is the language I hear a lot of death metal in.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"- That's true. - Yeah, well,"
00:37:24,00:37:25,"yeah, what's interesting as well is that"
00:37:25,00:37:28,I had to listen to a bunch of the bands that were cited.
00:37:28,00:37:31,"Children of Bodham is a massive band,"
00:37:31,00:37:33,"and I listened to some of their songs,"
00:37:33,00:37:34,it's very clear what they're saying.
00:37:34,00:37:36,"- For listeners, that wasn't very clear what you said,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,"it's Bodham, not Bottom, isn't it?"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"- Oh, I said Bodham. - I know you did."
00:37:40,00:37:41,"- Oh, right. - But it does sound"
00:37:41,00:37:42,a bit like Children of Bodham.
00:37:42,00:37:44,- Maybe that's what they're going for.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Little bum joke?
00:37:45,00:37:46,- Little bum bum joke?
00:37:46,00:37:48,- The maywests of modern Finland.
00:37:48,00:37:49,(all laughing)
00:37:49,00:37:52,"Yeah, Stradivarius is another band, and him,"
00:37:52,00:37:53,"and yeah, they all sing in English,"
00:37:53,00:37:55,"and I listen to them, and yeah, it's quite clear."
00:37:55,00:37:56,"It is quite clear. - Oh, is it?"
00:37:56,00:37:57,"- Yeah, yeah. - That's all they're saying."
00:37:57,00:37:58,"- Yeah, I would say so."
00:37:58,00:38:00,Finland does seem to have a unique affinity
00:38:00,00:38:01,"for heavy metal, though."
00:38:01,00:38:03,"- Yeah, it really does. - Yeah."
00:38:03,00:38:05,"The figures wobble around a bit,"
00:38:05,00:38:08,but one recent tish figure was that there are
00:38:08,00:38:12,"53 and a half metal bands per 100,000 people in Finland,"
00:38:12,00:38:14,"and that is, that's a lot."
00:38:14,00:38:18,"The UK has about five metal bands per 100,000 people,"
00:38:18,00:38:18,so Finland--
00:38:18,00:38:20,- It still feels like a lot to me.
00:38:20,00:38:21,- Yes. - Enough.
00:38:21,00:38:23,It feels like too many to me.
00:38:23,00:38:24,"- No, you're right, five per 100,000 people."
00:38:24,00:38:27,"- If I think about the population of what,"
00:38:27,00:38:30,"I don't know, Bolton must be about 200,000,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,so that means we've got 10 metal bands in Bolton.
00:38:32,00:38:33,It feels like a lot.
00:38:33,00:38:35,- Yeah. - Does it?
00:38:35,00:38:37,"I mean, there could be real amateur"
00:38:37,00:38:38,just doing an open mic night.
00:38:38,00:38:41,"We're not talking charting bands necessarily, I don't--"
00:38:41,00:38:42,"- Maybe, I think you're right."
00:38:42,00:38:44,- They work in Tesco on the weekdays.
00:38:44,00:38:45,"- There's a town called Lemmy in Finland,"
00:38:45,00:38:47,"which has 3,000 people in this."
00:38:47,00:38:48,It's called Lemmy.
00:38:48,00:38:48,- What?
00:38:48,00:38:49,- What?
00:38:49,00:38:50,- After the guy from the town.
00:38:50,00:38:52,"- Yeah, no, great point."
00:38:52,00:38:54,"It's spelled a bit differently, but it is called Lemmy."
00:38:54,00:38:55,"Anyway, they've got 3,000 people"
00:38:55,00:38:58,and they have 13 metal bands.
00:38:58,00:39:01,"That really is the, that's the metal center of the universe."
00:39:01,00:39:02,"That is the core, you know."
00:39:02,00:39:03,"- Amazing, it's called Lemmy."
00:39:03,00:39:04,- Yeah.
00:39:04,00:39:05,"- They have a church of heavy metal,"
00:39:05,00:39:08,"and there's a guy who does metal mass,"
00:39:08,00:39:13,"so this very cool pastor who looks like a heavy metal fan,"
00:39:13,00:39:14,"but then he's a Lutheran pastor,"
00:39:14,00:39:16,"and he puts on the correct robes,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,"and he started in 2006 just adapting traditional hymns,"
00:39:19,00:39:21,"so he keeps the lyrics the same, you know,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"the creed and the color around it,"
00:39:23,00:39:26,but turns them into heavy metal soil.
00:39:26,00:39:28,"- Oh, thanks, bride, I'm beautiful."
00:39:28,00:39:29,- Exactly.
00:39:29,00:39:30,- That's great.
00:39:30,00:39:30,- That's really good.
00:39:30,00:39:32,"- It sounds really cool, it's really popular."
00:39:32,00:39:34,"- Heavy Sorus, another cool one."
00:39:34,00:39:36,They're a Finnish heavy metal band
00:39:36,00:39:38,where they're all dressed as dido-saws
00:39:38,00:39:40,and the songs are for children.
00:39:40,00:39:41,- Oh.
00:39:41,00:39:43,(laughing)
00:39:43,00:39:47,"- Their album, (speaks in foreign language)"
00:39:47,00:39:48,"which means ""Night of the Dinosaurs"""
00:39:48,00:39:51,was the second most popular album in Finland in 2010.
00:39:51,00:39:52,- Wow.
00:39:52,00:39:53,- Nice.
00:39:53,00:39:55,"- And their members include Millie Pilly,"
00:39:55,00:39:58,"Confymompi, Riffy Raffy, and Muffy Puffy."
00:39:58,00:40:00,(laughing)
00:40:00,00:40:02,"And according to their website,"
00:40:02,00:40:06,"they were in eggs in the Cretaceous period,"
00:40:06,00:40:08,"but they somehow fossilized,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,"and then came out of the eggs and survived,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,and then started a rock group.
00:40:12,00:40:13,- That's quite cool.
00:40:13,00:40:14,- That's very cool.
00:40:14,00:40:15,- Although someone has pointed out
00:40:15,00:40:17,"that Muffy Puffy is a stegosaurus,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,and Confymompi is an apatosaurus
00:40:19,00:40:22,who lived in the Jurassic period in that Cretaceous.
00:40:22,00:40:23,- Got to do your research
00:40:23,00:40:25,instead of your dinosaur marathon.
00:40:25,00:40:26,- Yeah.
00:40:26,00:40:26,- Muffy Puffy.
00:40:26,00:40:28,- Lordy's from there as well.
00:40:28,00:40:29,"- Yeah, Lordy."
00:40:29,00:40:30,- The Eurovision Song Contest winner.
00:40:30,00:40:32,"He calls himself Mr. Lordy,"
00:40:32,00:40:35,and he started the band when he met the other members
00:40:35,00:40:39,while he was running a Finnish kiss cruise
00:40:39,00:40:42,because he was the president of Kiss Army Finland.
00:40:42,00:40:43,"He sounds incredible, Mr. Lordy,"
00:40:43,00:40:45,as in I think he's basically
00:40:45,00:40:47,one of the great geeks of our world.
00:40:47,00:40:49,"He's a comic book illustrator,"
00:40:49,00:40:50,"he's a graphic designer,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,he's a special effects makeup artist.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"- Like, I think if you look at metal music,"
00:40:54,00:40:56,"it's obviously not true of everyone,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,but I think there is a crossover of nerdyness
00:40:58,00:40:59,for people who like metal.
00:40:59,00:41:00,"- Oh, God, yeah."
00:41:00,00:41:01,"- Well, Corey Taylor, when he came in for the 100th episode,"
00:41:01,00:41:05,"arrived in a doctor who, or a Sherlock T-shirt."
00:41:05,00:41:07,"- Yeah, there's another man of misfit, I guess,"
00:41:07,00:41:08,being into metal.
00:41:08,00:41:09,"It's not mainstream, except in Finland,"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"where it basically has crossed over into it,"
00:41:11,00:41:14,"but I think it's if you don't fit into the mainstream,"
00:41:14,00:41:14,you go for it.
00:41:14,00:41:18,And they also are famous in QI circles
00:41:18,00:41:19,for hosting the first ever
00:41:19,00:41:21,heavy metal knitting world championships.
00:41:21,00:41:22,"- Oh, yes."
00:41:22,00:41:23,- They do do that.
00:41:23,00:41:25,"- It is a bit stupid, that, isn't it?"
00:41:25,00:41:26,- Hey.
00:41:26,00:41:27,"- What's, um, what is it?"
00:41:27,00:41:30,- It's just literally doing heavy metal and knitting.
00:41:30,00:41:32,There doesn't seem to be-
00:41:32,00:41:33,- There's no extra bit.
00:41:33,00:41:34,- No.
00:41:34,00:41:36,- But is it like chess boxing where you do one minute
00:41:36,00:41:37,of one and then one minute of the other?
00:41:37,00:41:39,"- No, you do them simultaneously."
00:41:39,00:41:40,But they are judged and they're actually judged
00:41:40,00:41:42,on quite interesting criteria.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"- Sorry, how can you do them simultaneously?"
00:41:44,00:41:45,"- So, at least one member of your band"
00:41:45,00:41:47,has to be knitting something at the same time
00:41:47,00:41:50,"as performing and you are judged on various things,"
00:41:50,00:41:51,but partly on the piece of knitting
00:41:51,00:41:53,that you produce by the end of your set.
00:41:53,00:41:55,"- Everyone I know who knits, they're like,"
00:41:55,00:41:57,"oh, look at this scarf."
00:41:57,00:41:59,I've been working on it for four months.
00:41:59,00:42:01,"What have we, are they coming in with the final,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,"like, one day of knitting that's needed"
00:42:03,00:42:04,for the scarf or are they starting?
00:42:04,00:42:06,"- That's such, it's quite small,"
00:42:06,00:42:08,but they also do seem to go quite fast
00:42:08,00:42:08,in the ones I saw.
00:42:08,00:42:10,Maybe there was some clever video editing.
00:42:10,00:42:12,"- That's the tempo of heavy metal, isn't it?"
00:42:12,00:42:13,It probably does encourage speed.
00:42:13,00:42:16,"- Yes, you have to do it in time with the songs, of course."
00:42:16,00:42:17,"You want to judge for that, so."
00:42:17,00:42:21,"- Can I ask, do people ever do the knitting"
00:42:21,00:42:23,with their own bodies?
00:42:23,00:42:25,"And what I mean by that, sorry, what I mean is,"
00:42:25,00:42:28,do people ever get a maypole in the middle of the stage
00:42:28,00:42:30,and then they've all got a ribbon
00:42:30,00:42:32,and they move around the stage while they play?
00:42:32,00:42:35,"- That's not really knitting, so much as crocheting."
00:42:35,00:42:38,(laughing)
00:42:38,00:42:39,"- Because I watched ""The Wicked Man"" recently"
00:42:39,00:42:42,"for the first time, there's a great maypole scene in that."
00:42:42,00:42:43,"And that's sort of, ""The Wicked Man"""
00:42:43,00:42:45,"bleeds into that world, doesn't it?"
00:42:45,00:42:46,"- It's more platting, I think."
00:42:46,00:42:48,"- 'Cause it does feel like, for all the men in metal,"
00:42:48,00:42:51,"usually have large, gigantic beards, low hanging."
00:42:51,00:42:53,That's what should be being knitted while they're doing.
00:42:53,00:42:55,Someone should be working up.
00:42:55,00:42:55,(laughing)
00:42:55,00:42:57,- They probably accidentally catch someone's beard
00:42:57,00:42:59,sometimes and knit it into their jumper.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"- Sorry, baseball, you're part of it now."
00:43:01,00:43:02,You can never take the jumper off.
00:43:02,00:43:05,- I look forward to Andy's Morris dancing
00:43:05,00:43:06,platting competition.
00:43:06,00:43:09,(laughing)
00:43:09,00:43:12,"In 2019, Metallica played a gig in Finland,"
00:43:12,00:43:17,which was attended by 1% of everyone in the country.
00:43:17,00:43:20,"- Ooh, I remember that happening in Iceland as well,"
00:43:20,00:43:23,"I think, like it was an enormous percentage."
00:43:23,00:43:24,- That's very cool.
00:43:24,00:43:26,'Cause there are five and a half million Finns
00:43:26,00:43:29,"and they had 55,000 in the audience for that gig."
00:43:29,00:43:31,So the numbers do stack up.
00:43:31,00:43:33,"- Yeah, well done, Metallica."
00:43:33,00:43:35,- Do you wanna play a game of Finnish metal band
00:43:35,00:43:36,or game of thrones episode?
00:43:36,00:43:37,- Yes.
00:43:37,00:43:38,"- Ah, okay, of course."
00:43:38,00:43:40,"- No, I've seen every episode of Finland,"
00:43:40,00:43:42,so I'm confident about this.
00:43:42,00:43:44,- Throne of chaos.
00:43:44,00:43:45,- Band.
00:43:45,00:43:46,"- Andy, you've seen every episode."
00:43:46,00:43:47,"- I think band, I think band."
00:43:47,00:43:49,"- Game of thrones, then."
00:43:49,00:43:50,- It is a band.
00:43:50,00:43:52,They were unable to make commercial headway
00:43:52,00:43:54,"and broke up in August, 2005."
00:43:54,00:43:55,- Okay.
00:43:55,00:43:56,- Winter sun.
00:43:56,00:43:57,- Game of thrones.
00:43:57,00:43:58,- I'll say band.
00:43:58,00:43:59,- It's a band.
00:43:59,00:44:02,"It's not really death metal, says the singer."
00:44:02,00:44:04,"It's very difficult for me to label it,"
00:44:04,00:44:06,"but if someone put a gun to my forehead,"
00:44:06,00:44:07,I would probably say something like
00:44:07,00:44:09,"extreme melodic, majestic metal."
00:44:09,00:44:11,- If I think it'll just annoy whoever's put a gun
00:44:11,00:44:14,"to your head at this point, that's an irritating."
00:44:14,00:44:15,- The pointy end.
00:44:15,00:44:16,- Thrones.
00:44:16,00:44:17,- I'll say thrones.
00:44:17,00:44:18,- Metal.
00:44:18,00:44:19,- It is thrones.
00:44:19,00:44:20,- Ay.
00:44:20,00:44:22,- It refers to a sword fighting lesson
00:44:22,00:44:25,"that John gave to Arya before the farewell,"
00:44:25,00:44:28,"where he says, ""stick them with the pointy end."""
00:44:28,00:44:29,- Do you remember that note?
00:44:29,00:44:30,You say it?
00:44:30,00:44:30,- Yeah.
00:44:30,00:44:31,- Isn't it nice?
00:44:31,00:44:33,- But there's a lot of fun Finnish band names.
00:44:33,00:44:34,- Pierre Gunt.
00:44:34,00:44:36,(laughing)
00:44:36,00:44:37,"- You know it, Gunt."
00:44:37,00:44:40,- Does Gunt mean the same thing in Finland as it does here?
00:44:40,00:44:42,"- I looked it up in the Oxford English Dictionary,"
00:44:42,00:44:44,and it doesn't mean anything in this country.
00:44:44,00:44:45,"- Don't know what you're talking about, James."
00:44:45,00:44:48,"- But it's obviously based on Greek's Pierre Gents,"
00:44:48,00:44:52,but also it's guns in Finnish.
00:44:52,00:44:53,- I see.
00:44:53,00:44:55,- Climidia with a K.
00:44:55,00:44:55,- Ooh.
00:44:55,00:44:57,"- Los Bastardos, Finlandesses."
00:44:57,00:44:58,(laughing)
00:44:58,00:44:59,- Brilliant names.
00:44:59,00:45:00,- Those are great names.
00:45:00,00:45:01,- That's very good.
00:45:01,00:45:02,- I'm Finnish language.
00:45:02,00:45:02,- Oh yeah.
00:45:02,00:45:04,- I see.
00:45:04,00:45:05,- It's really hard.
00:45:05,00:45:06,- Yeah.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"- Like it's really, really difficult."
00:45:08,00:45:09,- For what reason?
00:45:09,00:45:10,- It's very complicated.
00:45:10,00:45:12,(laughing)
00:45:12,00:45:13,- It's got 15 different cases.
00:45:13,00:45:14,- Okay.
00:45:14,00:45:16,- And lots of people leave after arriving
00:45:16,00:45:19,"because it's just like language complexities,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,also bureaucracy and attacks.
00:45:21,00:45:23,- Lots of people leave after a lot of people move there
00:45:23,00:45:24,"and then go, ""Oh, sod this."""
00:45:24,00:45:27,"- Students who arrive, 36% of them leave within a year"
00:45:27,00:45:29,"of finishing their studies,"
00:45:29,00:45:31,so they don't stay on and make a life.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- And there's another reason which is,"
00:45:33,00:45:34,"I don't think anyone's tired of this,"
00:45:34,00:45:37,"but in Finland, apparently, there's almost no small talk."
00:45:37,00:45:39,You just pay for your coffee and you shut up.
00:45:39,00:45:42,"- I only learned one word of Finnish when I was there,"
00:45:42,00:45:44,"and it's kitos, which means thank you."
00:45:44,00:45:45,And the way I remembered it is
00:45:45,00:45:48,"'cause it's like mosquitoes, but without the moss bit."
00:45:48,00:45:49,- Oh really?
00:45:49,00:45:50,- Right.
00:45:50,00:45:51,"- And that's how they told it,"
00:45:51,00:45:53,'cause I actually got that through some small talk
00:45:53,00:45:54,in a cafe.
00:45:54,00:45:55,(laughing)
00:45:55,00:45:56,- They were eating it.
00:45:56,00:45:57,"- I was gonna say, we are gonna get letters"
00:45:57,00:45:58,off the back of that.
00:45:58,00:45:59,- I don't think we are.
00:45:59,00:46:02,- I think I've read quite a lot about Finnish culture before.
00:46:02,00:46:03,I think it became a thing in China
00:46:03,00:46:05,"to call yourself spiritually Finnish,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,and it's a very popular meme.
00:46:07,00:46:08,A lot of Chinese people tapped into this.
00:46:08,00:46:10,It's got millions of views.
00:46:10,00:46:12,The idea is that they like their own space.
00:46:12,00:46:15,"They're very taciturn, and I've never seen,"
00:46:15,00:46:16,and I've read so many accounts of Finns
00:46:16,00:46:17,being asked about this.
00:46:17,00:46:19,"I've never seen anyone say, this is bullshit."
00:46:19,00:46:20,We're all incredibly friendly.
00:46:20,00:46:21,(laughing)
00:46:21,00:46:22,- Okay.
00:46:22,00:46:23,- So do write in.
00:46:23,00:46:23,"- It's not unfriendly, yeah."
00:46:23,00:46:25,"It's just very, it's just quiet."
00:46:25,00:46:27,- Which country did I get a few emails
00:46:27,00:46:29,'cause I said they don't talk about the weather
00:46:29,00:46:30,'cause they have so much.
00:46:30,00:46:31,- That was somewhere in Scandinavia.
00:46:31,00:46:34,"- Yeah, yeah, definitely got emails off the back of that."
00:46:34,00:46:37,"- Just on the language, it is a really interesting language."
00:46:37,00:46:39,"It's the Uralic language,"
00:46:39,00:46:40,"which means it came from the Urals,"
00:46:40,00:46:44,and there are kind of three main Uralic languages.
00:46:44,00:46:46,"Finnish, Estonian, which makes sort of sense"
00:46:46,00:46:47,because that's--
00:46:47,00:46:48,- Right next to each other.
00:46:48,00:46:49,- You swim across.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"- Yeah, swim across a small bit of water."
00:46:51,00:46:52,And then Hungarian.
00:46:52,00:46:53,- So weird.
00:46:53,00:46:56,"- Which is, there's like four countries in between them"
00:46:56,00:46:57,if you follow them down.
00:46:57,00:46:59,"- And it's four countries,"
00:46:59,00:47:01,but they're four pretty big countries as well.
00:47:01,00:47:03,"- Yeah, it's so mad."
00:47:03,00:47:06,I think it's because it starts in the Urals
00:47:06,00:47:07,"to the east of both of them,"
00:47:07,00:47:10,"and then some people went just directly west,"
00:47:10,00:47:14,and I don't know why it didn't sort of drop bits of itself
00:47:14,00:47:16,"along the way in Ukraine or in bits of Russia,"
00:47:16,00:47:17,but it didn't.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"- But I think also like the Soviet Union,"
00:47:19,00:47:22,"they basically banned any other language, didn't they?"
00:47:22,00:47:23,"- Yeah, you're right, maybe that's--"
00:47:23,00:47:25,- So I think a lot of the smaller pockets just died out.
00:47:25,00:47:27,"- They got it, that's probably it."
00:47:27,00:47:29,"Yeah, and didn't quite reach Hungary that rule,"
00:47:29,00:47:31,even though obviously Hungary--
00:47:31,00:47:32,- I believe so.
00:47:32,00:47:33,- Being in part of the Eastern Bloc.
00:47:33,00:47:34,But you're hungry just sitting there
00:47:34,00:47:36,"in the same language family as the Finns,"
00:47:36,00:47:38,but unable to reach them.
00:47:38,00:47:39,"- Wild, sob."
00:47:39,00:47:43,"- The oldest writing in the Finnish family of languages,"
00:47:43,00:47:46,"which was found in the Urals, is very metal, actually."
00:47:46,00:47:49,"If you translate it into English,"
00:47:49,00:47:52,"it translates as God's arrow, ten is your name,"
00:47:52,00:47:55,"the arrow is God's own, the doom God leads."
00:47:55,00:47:56,- That's brilliant.
00:47:56,00:47:58,- And to go back to a former thing
00:47:58,00:47:59,"that we were talking about,"
00:47:59,00:48:02,we reckon that it was a magic spell
00:48:02,00:48:04,to stop lightning from getting you.
00:48:04,00:48:07,"You might say it in the bath, for instance."
00:48:07,00:48:09,- Yeah.
00:48:09,00:48:11,"- Yeah, it was found in Novgorod."
00:48:11,00:48:12,- Dan has a rubber duck with those words.
00:48:12,00:48:14,(all laughing)
00:48:14,00:48:15,"- Well, rubber, that'll be good."
00:48:15,00:48:17,"- Yes, put that rubber duck under your ass."
00:48:17,00:48:18,- Yeah.
00:48:18,00:48:19,- To avoid lightning.
00:48:19,00:48:20,- To avoid lightning.
00:48:20,00:48:22,"- Well, Dan, why have you got a rubber duck"
00:48:22,00:48:23,up your ass?
00:48:23,00:48:24,(all laughing)
00:48:24,00:48:26,"- I tell you, I was in the bath."
00:48:26,00:48:27,It was raining outside.
00:48:27,00:48:28,(all laughing)
00:48:28,00:48:29,- You're coming too careful.
00:48:29,00:48:31,(all laughing)
00:48:31,00:48:34,- They invented the happy or not buttons.
00:48:34,00:48:35,- The happy or not buttons.
00:48:35,00:48:36,"- Oh, so when you're in an airport"
00:48:36,00:48:39,"and you go through security and you have to say,"
00:48:39,00:48:42,did I have a good time or did I have a great time?
00:48:42,00:48:44,(all laughing)
00:48:44,00:48:45,There's like some little faces
00:48:45,00:48:46,and you press one under.
00:48:46,00:48:49,"- Exactly, that's a finished person,"
00:48:49,00:48:50,which I think is interesting
00:48:50,00:48:51,"because they're known for being quite deadpan,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,although they're always also found
00:48:53,00:48:56,"to be the happiest country in the world, confusingly."
00:48:56,00:48:58,"But yes, it was a finished guy"
00:48:58,00:48:59,"who invented them,"
00:48:59,00:49:00,marvelous and bad customer service.
00:49:00,00:49:03,And they've just been hugely kind of revolutionary
00:49:03,00:49:05,for customer service in a lot of places.
00:49:05,00:49:06,- Have they?
00:49:06,00:49:07,"- Yeah, because it changes how the staff acts."
00:49:07,00:49:10,"So Heathrow was their big break in 2012,"
00:49:10,00:49:11,called this finished guy.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"They said, can we have a couple of these or try them out?"
00:49:13,00:49:15,They got nine.
00:49:15,00:49:17,"Within, I think within two days,"
00:49:17,00:49:19,"Heathrow called the finished guy back and said,"
00:49:19,00:49:21,we need to shed loads of these right now
00:49:21,00:49:25,"'cause the staff insecurity had gone from being kind of sullen,"
00:49:25,00:49:28,occasionally a bit rude or just blanking customers.
00:49:28,00:49:30,"- Could I just say, for the next time I go through Heathrow,"
00:49:30,00:49:32,I've always found them to be lovely.
00:49:32,00:49:36,"- Yeah, see, they instill this kind of fear in people."
00:49:36,00:49:37,- Did this guy invent it
00:49:37,00:49:39,because him and all the rest of the finished people
00:49:39,00:49:40,hate small talks so much
00:49:40,00:49:42,that they're like even a machine
00:49:42,00:49:45,to ask that basic question is what I would prefer?
00:49:45,00:49:47,"- It could be, I actually thought it might be related"
00:49:47,00:49:50,'cause it's so quick and you don't need to do any kind of
00:49:50,00:49:51,"interacting at all, yeah."
00:49:51,00:49:52,"But it does make the staff, I think that's really interesting."
00:49:52,00:49:54,"Subconsciously, as soon as you're aware,"
00:49:54,00:49:57,that button's there for people's satisfaction to be logged.
00:49:57,00:49:59,The staff give a little gag and they'll actually--
00:49:59,00:50:00,- Can I ask a question about those?
00:50:00,00:50:02,I know you're not the expert in them
00:50:02,00:50:04,"and you've only read this thing, but--"
00:50:04,00:50:04,- It's been about three and a half minutes
00:50:04,00:50:06,"reading about them actually, so there we go."
00:50:06,00:50:08,- So when I walk out of security
00:50:08,00:50:10,and I've gone through really quickly
00:50:10,00:50:12,'cause I'm a good person who takes my belt off
00:50:12,00:50:14,before I go through and--
00:50:14,00:50:15,- Trousers down your ass.
00:50:15,00:50:18,(laughing)
00:50:18,00:50:18,- You're showing your phone number
00:50:18,00:50:21,to all the security people.
00:50:21,00:50:23,- Let me put the rose rubber gloves on you.
00:50:23,00:50:25,(laughing)
00:50:25,00:50:28,And I press the smiley button
00:50:28,00:50:29,and I press it like 10 times
00:50:29,00:50:31,'cause I had such a good time.
00:50:31,00:50:31,- Yeah.
00:50:31,00:50:34,- Does that count as 10 or do you think it doesn't?
00:50:34,00:50:36,"- Well, James, as the three and a half minutes,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,"well, I do know the answer to that."
00:50:38,00:50:41,"There is a little time restriction on it,"
00:50:41,00:50:42,"which means that, for instance,"
00:50:42,00:50:44,"staff or you can't cheat it,"
00:50:44,00:50:46,"so you can't log lots and lots in a row quickly,"
00:50:46,00:50:47,but you could keep coming back.
00:50:47,00:50:49,You could go get your cost to come back.
00:50:49,00:50:50,"- While you were saying that,"
00:50:50,00:50:52,all I could picture was what would it be like
00:50:52,00:50:54,to get gloved at an airport?
00:50:54,00:50:56,"I could see my session ending with them going,"
00:50:56,00:50:57,"""Okay, there's nothing there."
00:50:57,00:50:58,"You're free to go, Mr. Shriver."
00:50:58,00:50:59,"Here's your rubber duck by the way."""
00:50:59,00:51:00,(laughing)
00:51:00,00:51:03,(upbeat music)
00:51:03,00:51:06,"Okay, that is it."
00:51:06,00:51:07,That is all of our facts.
00:51:07,00:51:08,Thank you so much for listening.
00:51:08,00:51:10,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us
