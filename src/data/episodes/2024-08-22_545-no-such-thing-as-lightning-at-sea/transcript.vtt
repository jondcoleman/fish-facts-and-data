00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.280
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.320
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.600
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.120
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.640
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 My fact this week is that for at least 80 years,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.280
 the same thundercloud has been raining off the north coast of Australia.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.560
 It's called Hector the Convector.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.840
 Brilliant.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.600
 Or he's called Hector the Convector.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.560
 Is it actually he?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.400
 He's called Hector.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.960
 Yeah. Oh, clouds don't have.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 A lot of the press does give him a...

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.160
 Please, let's not get into pronouns for clouds.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.280
 She's called Hector, it's fine.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.040
 He's called Hector, like it must be a he, right?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.520
 Fair enough, it's a joke actually.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.080
 He should be called Cumulo Nimbus the Cumulo Nimbus.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.600
 Is it really a convector, a cloud?

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 I don't really know what convector means.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.480
 It does work by convection, yeah, as sort of, I mean all clouds do, but there's all...

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.040
 Culeo Nimbus, Culeo Nimbus.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.080
 Yeah, you said Culeo Nimbus the Cumulo Nimbus.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.520
 No, he didn't. You made that joke up into your own head.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 That's good.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240
 Yeah, better than what Andy said, which is just the name of the type of cloud.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.760
 I set him up, you tougher man.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.920
 Andy's correct, he is a Cumulo Nimbus,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.960
 but he does also form through the power of convection,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.560
 which, you know, is as hot air currents go up.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.880
 We know how clouds form, right?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 Yeah.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 He...

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.120
 Bagley.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.440
 If you don't know, ask your 12-year-old niece, nephew, daughter, son.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.480
 We'll probably go into it in more depth.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.640
 So, get excited about that.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.720
 But yeah, he builds up over the Tiwi Islands, Tiwi, which are...

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.640
 It's a really cute word.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.480
 It is a cute word.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.240
 It's north of Darwin, right?

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.800
 It's a little island off Australia.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.960
 Yes, and it's at three in the afternoon every single day from September to April,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.720
 which is before the rainy season, and then during the rainy season, he appears.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.240
 You can set your watch by it.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.080
 So, here's my question, right?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.480
 You know the, like, the never-ending super, whatever it's called,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.680
 the immortal soup, where it's just always been the same soup, and they just keep it.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.080
 So, you eat the soup, and then there's a little bit left,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.560
 and then they add more water and more vegetables and stuff.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.760
 So, the sum of it is...

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.200
 There's some of it always in.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.400
 This cloud does disappear.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.920
 Hector does go away.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800
 He's only there for the months that you just said, right?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.840
 September 3rd to April.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.320
 So, how can you say that it's the same Hector?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.880
 Well, Dan, not a single cell in your body, of course,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.640
 is the same as the cells in your body you were born with.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.880
 So, how can we say it's the same Dan?

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.560
 That's true.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.840
 But it is the same.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.800
 And also, Dan disappears for six months every year, doesn't he?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.720
 It's incredibly annoying for our recording channel.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.080
 I guess it's formed by the same forces every day.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.320
 Yeah, I was looking for named clouds, and there are so few.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.000
 Oh, yeah, that is surprising, isn't it?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.240
 I think considering the things that just transiently appear

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.280
 and then disappear in a matter of minutes.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.760
 I just thought there must be a shortlist on Wikipedia

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.920
 of celebrity clouds.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.360
 The one I can think of is the Tablecloth or the Table Mountain.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.280
 Oh, that's good.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.120
 I didn't know about that.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.520
 I didn't find that one.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.840
 What did you get, Dan?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.480
 Nothing.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.320
 Well, it's good you brought up.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.440
 The only one I found was the Lake Maracaibo one

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.080
 in western Venezuela, and that's an everlasting storm,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.320
 which is there about 260 nights a year.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.600
 So, again, we mentioned it about eight years ago.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.120
 It was a long, long time ago.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.920
 And it's at a point where a river empties into the lake,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.520
 Lake Maracaibo, and sailors have used it

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.200
 for centuries to navigate, because you can see it

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.480
 from 200 miles away.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.480
 And that's what Hector had a role in World War II,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.560
 was part of the war effort, because Hector was helping

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.480
 navigate Australian pilots or any pilots

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 that were coming in via Australia and Papua New Guinea.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.920
 So any pilot, meaning he was kind of a Swiss cloud, basically.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.920
 The neutral.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.640
 Yeah, he didn't disappear, practically,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.720
 when the Nazis turned up.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.200
 You know how, when you see a cloud from above,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.320
 it looks a bit flat.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.560
 So there's satellite, they've been talking really high up,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 shots from down up.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.160
 Even when you're flying over in an aeroplane,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.280
 it kind of looks bumpy-ish, but quite flat.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.840
 Absolutely right, it does, doesn't it?

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.080
 And if you look from above, they're sort of these big disks

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.240
 of cloud, which you can kind of see they're lumpy beneath,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.000
 and then they just top out, and it's really weird.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.520
 So the reason for that, I've been on this fantastic blog

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.240
 called cloudsandclimate.com.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.040
 Can't recommend it enough.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.240
 It's by a cloud scientist from Imperial College.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.840
 They form in rising air, right, which is warmer.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.000
 And as the air rises, it stays a bit warmer

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.840
 than the surrounding air.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.320
 So you get this cloud forming.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.760
 And then, at about 15 kilometers high,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.040
 it hits the tropopause, okay?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.080
 And that is a bit of the atmosphere

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.680
 where the temperature starts to increase again,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.200
 so the cloud stops rising.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.280
 So that's why these clouds are shaped like anvils.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.360
 The tropopause is the bit where the height is limited.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.640
 And it's why you get higher clouds over the equator,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.240
 'cause the tropopause is higher over the equator.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.920
 So that's why the very biggest thunder clouds

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.520
 happen near the equator,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.360
 'cause they've just got more room to grow

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.680
 before the temperature naturally limits them again.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.520
 - That's really interesting.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.800
 - That makes a lot of sense,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.960
 'cause it gets a bit warmer, doesn't it?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.160
 So it's like a knife slicing the top off

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.000
 when you hit the tropopause.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.400
 - Exactly, exactly like that.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.000
 - Nice.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.480
 - I discovered, by the way, I'm very lucky to be alive

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.920
 because I do a thing that should have killed me long ago.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.760
 And when I started researching this,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.760
 I thought lightning was connected to Hector.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.800
 But if I'm at home and if it's raining

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.160
 and it's a big storm outside,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.400
 I often would like to have like a hot bath,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.800
 like, you know, you're stuck inside.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.000
 I do that a lot.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.240
 - It turns out that's really dangerous over there.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.720
 - I think it's not really dangerous.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.560
 - It's not really dangerous?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.760
 - I should have died, it is a stretch, isn't it?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.880
 One of the things in your life

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.720
 should have killed you.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.000
 - What a daredevil, Dan Trover.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.440
 Another bath despite it being rainy outside.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.200
 I just didn't know this was a possibility

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.440
 that basically the ground near your home,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.080
 if it's hit by a lightning bolt,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.880
 it can be a conductor to bring it through the pipes

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.000
 into your, yeah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.840
 - What?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.440
 - I know, right, so there's examples.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.640
 Okay, in November 2007, a bolt struck a teenager

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.880
 who was washing her hair at home in Blandford, England.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.240
 It hit her wrist and it knocked the shower head

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.440
 out of her hand.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.920
 2001, Josephine Martine of Deal, England

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.320
 was blown out of her bathtub by a lightning bolt.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.160
 - No.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.720
 - Yeah, the mother of three had been soaking

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.120
 in her bathtub during a thunderstorm,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.400
 was catapulted naked through the air by a force of a bolt

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.000
 landing on the other side of the bathroom.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.840
 - Good Lord.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.160
 - Yeah.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.000
 - Were they fine or did they?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.760
 - Well, yeah, she survived 'cause there's a quote from her,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.720
 so I think she's too.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.560
 - Okay, yeah.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.840
 Shout out to the quote, isn't it?

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.120
 (laughing)

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.960
 - Yeah.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.800
 - Sorry, what, how does it hit?

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.640
 Sorry.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.480
 - What pipes?

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.120
 - It hits your, what, the pipes that take water

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.960
 into your house?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.880
 - Mine are all plastic.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.960
 - Oh, well, you're okay then.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.360
 But if you live in an old house.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.520
 - Oh, you're sort of copper and white.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.320
 - Weirdly, even though being in the bath

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.560
 in a lightning storm is a marginally,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.160
 not one percent more dangerous

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.600
 than not being in the bath, do you know where the most?

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.560
 - I just stand outside with the golf club,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.840
 holding it in the air and going,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.520
 "Well, at least I'm not in the bath."

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.480
 Like, "Dangerous Dan."

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.520
 (laughing)

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.920
 - Do you know where the safest place to be

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.360
 is during a lightning storm?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.200
 - Oh.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.040
 - There are sort of lots of answers to this question.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.280
 - Well, I'll say like, one thing you're often told

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.680
 is in your car because it has other wheels.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.520
 - Yes, that's good.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.200
 - Faraday cage sort of filament.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.120
 - I'm gonna say under the earth, deep in earth.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.640
 - You're thinking more along the right sort of scope

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.440
 that I was looking for rather than James's.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.000
 - Right, practical.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.920
 - Yeah, practical, this isn't practical.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.640
 - Fort Knox or something like this, like a place,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.800
 is it a particular place?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.080
 - No, I'm gonna tell you, it's the sea.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.680
 Lightning does not strike at the sea.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.040
 - Well, I've seen lightning striking in the city.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.760
 - It strikes, I think I've got a photo of it.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.160
 - It strikes a 10th as often.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.720
 I will backtrack slightly.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.560
 (laughing)

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.400
 It strikes a 10th as often at sea as it does on land.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.240
 It is very rare and which I think is really interesting.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.720
 - What is a bath but a tiny sea?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.560
 - Yeah.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.920
 (laughing)

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.760
 - Here's the thing,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.400
 if you're a bit scared of lightning like a lot of people are,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.240
 but you think, well, if I can't see it, I'll be okay.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.200
 You're not okay 'cause there's a thing called dark lightning.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.960
 And this is a shock of energy

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.040
 that can carry a million times more energy

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.720
 than visible lightning.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.300
 But if you get shocked, you might not even notice.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.440
 - What?

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.880
 - It's so weird 'cause it's radiation,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.920
 it's not electricity, it's radiation hitting you.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.520
 It can give you a maximum safe lifetime dose

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.440
 of ionizing radiation in a single instant.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.120
 So it might make you sick.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.400
 - So it's gonna give you the amount

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.360
 that you'd need to have accumulated over your life.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.040
 - Once, really.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.280
 So you'll need to avoid all radiation for evermore.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.640
 - Which is impossible, I'm afraid.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.480
 - Don't go outside.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480
 - Don't eat bananas.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.660
 - Don't go to Cornwall?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.960
 - Don't go to Cornwall's a bit more radioactive, isn't it?

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.800
 - It is.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.360
 - Yeah, but there's radiation everywhere.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.040
 So you're more likely to get cancers and stuff like that.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.880
 - Okay, right.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.000
 The thing is, there's one dark lightning occurrence

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.440
 for every thousand flashes.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.280
 We know 'cause of science,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.320
 but we don't know whether people have been hit by it

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.320
 because there's no physical, you know, you can't feel it.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.160
 - Can we counter it?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.600
 Like if there's a lightning storm on the way,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.440
 can I get my kids in some sort of anti-dark lightning suit

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.320
 that we all wear?

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.160
 Like a--

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.440
 - You can wear one of those hats with a little windmill on it

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.280
 and reindeer.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.120
 - Dance kids already wear those.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.960
 (all laughing)

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.320
 To protect against the heat and it's the whole thing.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.120
 - You can all climb into a microwave.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.600
 (all laughing)

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.120
 - 'Cause that doesn't let any radiation out, does it?

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.960
 - Oh, there we go.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.040
 (all laughing)

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.800
 - That way, quick, into the microwave.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.120
 - I already don't trust microwaves.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.080
 I don't understand that.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.640
 The whole thing where you can see the little holes

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.920
 and they're like, oh, the radioactive bits

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.200
 are just a bit bigger than the hole

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.760
 and can't get out, fuck off.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.600
 What if they make a hole?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.760
 - What are you talking about?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.800
 So there's a mesh in a microwave,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.160
 which is big enough that microwaves,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.520
 because of the wavelength, can't get out.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.400
 Often that's why no radiation leaks,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.800
 even though there was a massive conspiracy theory.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.760
 And I think the seventies, which dad still believes.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.800
 - Was that a conspiracy theory?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.640
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.480
 - Oh, wow.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.840
 - But you came up with it independently.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.080
 This is like convergent evolution or whatever.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.720
 (all laughing)

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.080
 - You know, we've never talked about Colonel William Rankin,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.280
 who do you guys know?

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.120
 - Chief Oliver.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.680
 - We've never mentioned him.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.520
 - What?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.800
 - I don't know who that is, sorry.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.840
 - So basically, no pilot has ever flown through

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.560
 cumulonimbus and succeeded,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.480
 which I think is really interesting

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.440
 because they're a common cloud,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.560
 but if you see one in a plane,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.400
 you cannot get through it

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.000
 because they're so huge and so dangerous.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.480
 And only one person until 2007, actually,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.720
 is known to have fallen all the way through one and survived.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.280
 And it is Lieutenant Colonel William Rankin.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.760
 - But he didn't have a great time of it.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.400
 - No, he wouldn't do it again.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.360
 (all laughing)

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.000
 - One star review.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.720
 The engine of his fighter jet failed in 1959.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.200
 And so he jumped out of the plane

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.360
 and went through the cloud.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.720
 And it's an insane situation to be in.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.160
 He got frostbite immediately.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160
 I'll just split a second.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.360
 Decompression meant that his eyes, ears,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.400
 nose, and mouth started bleeding profusely.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.960
 His abdomen swelled, he vomited.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.880
 He's in the middle of a cloud

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.600
 getting buffeted around by the cloud.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.320
 - Yeah, didn't he physically swell up?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.200
 Like he's just like a balloon sort of getting blown up?

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.040
 - I think he did.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.400
 It was amazing for those things

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.000
 that just looked so fluffy.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.840
 - I know.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.240
 - I mean, they look quite benign.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.080
 - But also you can't,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.800
 you don't just fall through that cloud.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.640
 - Oh, okay.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.480
 - It keeps you in it.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.320
 It's like a washing machine.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.160
 - Oh, 'cause of the correction.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.000
 - Your injection, yeah.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.840
 - Yeah.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.160
 - Especially because the buffeting of the cloud

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.880
 flicked a switch on his parachute somehow

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.880
 and opened it prematurely.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.720
 - No!

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.720
 - So he's stuck in his cloud.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.560
 - Oh, wow.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.160
 - He had to hold his breath to avoid drowning

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.080
 at repeated moments.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.840
 Anyway, he was in there for 40 minutes.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.160
 - Oh my God.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.120
 - It's gone up and down and up and down.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.960
 Awful.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.360
 - And then he got out and he wrote a book about it.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.440
 - And he survived.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.280
 - Yeah.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.120
 - James, do you remember?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.600
 I think there was one other story of someone

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.520
 who might have got it.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.280
 She was a paraglider and she got sucked up into it.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.240
 - Yeah, cloud sucked.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.640
 - Eva Visnierska.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640
 - Right.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.480
 - She did get sucked up.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.760
 And in fact, she was up there for three and a half hours.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.600
 - Oh my God.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.920
 (all laughing)

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.840
 Did we ever talk?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.080
 I don't think we did about the Hunger Tonga explosion

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.000
 in the Pacific.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 No.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.320
 This was big news,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.080
 but not as big as it should have been.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.920
 - Basically.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.760
 - Very recently.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.000
 - Very recently, 2021.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.680
 End of 2021.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.480
 It's an underwater volcano, basically.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.440
 And it went off and it blasted through

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.800
 150 meters of sea water, right?

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.400
 That's how far below the surface it is.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.680
 It then sent a plume of ash 36 miles into the air.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.520
 - Yeah, it's mental.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.360
 - Wow.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.880
 Five billion kilos of matter every second.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.800
 Five billion kilos every second.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.840
 - It's amazing, really.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.320
 - I remember it happening and thinking,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.280
 okay, that's, do you remember when that happened

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.640
 with Krakatoa?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.780
 - Krakatoa, yeah.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.480
 When Krakatoa went off, basically there was no summer

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.680
 for like three years, right?

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.240
 And I thought that was gonna happen with this one,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.280
 but it just seems to have petered out a bit.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.120
 - I know.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.960
 - It was so bizarre.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.280
 And then it produced the most intense lightning storm

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.640
 ever on the planet and higher than any lightning

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.480
 it had ever been.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.320
 - Did it cause by the ash?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.160
 That big ash cloud?

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.680
 - Yeah, this was 19 miles in the air.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.520
 - Wow.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.360
 - There was lightning going off.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.200
 - What?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.760
 - And over 11 hours of this particular storm,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.320
 there were 192,000 flashes of lightning.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.160
 Observe.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.000
 - Crazy.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.840
 - It's insane.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.200
 - And you say this was over the sea, was it?

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.360
 (all laughing)

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.200
 - I'm afraid.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.760
 I'm afraid it was.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.960
 - Don't think so.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.280
 (all laughing)

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.720
 I must have been a trigger for the light.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.800
 (all laughing)

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.380
 (upbeat music)

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.960
 And that is Andy.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.680
 - My fact is that during the Second World War,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.040
 a Polish pilot was shot down over Southern England

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.040
 and he and his parachute landed in the grounds

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.960
 of a very respectable tennis club.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.200
 He was immediately then signed in as a guest,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.320
 offered a racket, lent some white flannels

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.280
 and thrashed his opponents until the RAF came to collect him.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.720
 (all laughing)

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.680
 - Rankin would have been so jealous of his.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.200
 (all laughing)

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.840
 This is possibly the best parachute landing

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.800
 anyone's ever made.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.680
 Supposedly, I think it was a longstanding match

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.720
 and someone hadn't turned up.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.700
 It was a doubles match.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.540
 - Oh, I see.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.380
 - Oh, perfect.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.220
 (all laughing)

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.560
 That's amazing.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.880
 Oh, no, there's only three of us.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.720
 We can't play.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.560
 Wait a minute.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.320
 (all laughing)

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.280
 - This is so weird.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.320
 I should say what this is from.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.320
 This is from Anthony Beaver's book "The Second World War",

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.680
 which is so long and so good.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.600
 It's amazing.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.440
 - Oh, it's good though.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.800
 There's only a couple of hundred pages in.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.640
 I'm in the foothill.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.960
 You're gonna be hearing a lot more facts.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.040
 - I'm gonna say, when you're writing your review,

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.320
 start with so good.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.760
 Robin, so long, so good.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.840
 - I've been looking at it on my shelf

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.080
 for about nearly a year thinking I can never.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.920
 And then I've just started.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.480
 Anyway, it's great.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.320
 It's really good.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.720
 This is what I would say is the lighter facts in the book.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.840
 It's pretty harrowing.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.280
 - He goes heavy, Beaver.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.120
 Well done.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.960
 - I know.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.760
 But this is a light bit of beef and it's great.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.560
 Anyway, and this is all about the Polish pilots

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.800
 who fought with the RAF during the Second World War.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.960
 Poland was invaded by Germany and the Soviet Union

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.200
 simultaneously right at the start.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.720
 And yes, of course, you think it started 1930s

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.320
 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.920
 - I kind of think it started with the Treaty of Versailles.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.360
 - I'm so glad we're having this chat.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.600
 But the Polish armed forces were defeated

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.960
 pretty rapidly a few weeks

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.120
 and tens of thousands of soldiers of the pilot went

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.440
 to France, big mistake,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.280
 because several months later,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.320
 France was also overrun.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.760
 And then so the Polish pilots hadn't been deployed enough.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.080
 So they went to England.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.240
 They were quite annoyed at this point.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.360
 Quite, quite keen to get back in the fray.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 - Like annoyed with the Nazis,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.400
 not just generally annoyed, weren't they?

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.240
 - I think they're a bit annoyed with the Soviets as well.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.080
 - Yeah.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.400
 - And the Soviets, yep.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400
 - It was a time of justifiable annoyance

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.240
 was the hallmark of the, yeah.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.720
 And just a large chunk of the RAF actually was Polish

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.160
 during the Battle of Britain.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.920
 When they finally arrived in the UK

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.440
 and they were put up with the RAF,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.760
 the RAF people thought these guys are going to be terrible.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.320
 Why are we bringing them in?

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.920
 They've been defeated twice.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.080
 They're not going to be any good.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.560
 The language barrier didn't help

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.560
 because they obviously couldn't communicate

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.040
 if they're good by chatting to them.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.080
 So they said about training them,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.400
 but they did it almost in a slightly mocking sense.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.000
 So in order to teach them their kind of patterns in the sky,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.840
 they put them on tricycles and got them riding around.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.480
 Meanwhile, the Polish guys are thinking, what is this?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.920
 - Well, little tricycles, like little plastic.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.400
 - Actual tricycles, they were heavily kitted out.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.120
 So the tricycles had things like speedometers,

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.360
 compasses, radios.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.640
 So they were very, very tooled up tricycles, but...

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.240
 - I think this was a standard way of training pilots.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.360
 It wasn't just that they thought,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.240
 oh, we'll just put the Polish people on here.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.200
 - That was a good way. - Well, I think so.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.000
 But the Polish pilots, though, it was ridiculous

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.200
 because they were already trained up in this way.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.160
 - Yeah, right.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.800
 - And they fought in a slightly different way,

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.560
 which is that they would get up much closer

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.800
 to enemy planes in dogfights,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.240
 which made you more accurate, but was more dangerous.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.440
 So my grandad was in the Squadron 307, I think it was.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.520
 It was called the Eagle Owls

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.560
 'cause they were the only night fighter squadron

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.360
 of the Polish squadrons, but he flew Mosquitoes,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.080
 which were the only wooden planes.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.880
 And people thought they were mad as well at first.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.720
 It was Haveland, was the guy who made them,

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.560
 and it was called the Wooden Wonder.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.800
 At first, they thought, we can't do this.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.200
 It'll just be so fragile.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.800
 And it turned out to be brilliant.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.480
 And the thing about them was they were completely unarmed.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.680
 It's just carrying a bomb, but it's incredibly light

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.080
 because it's got no arms on it.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.960
 And it just relies on the fact that 'cause it's very light,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.280
 it can get away quickly, so they're very, very zippy.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.600
 - Like a Mosquito, I suppose.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.560
 - Like a Mosquito.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.160
 They were painted blue to match the sky

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
 'cause they were quite quiet as well, so you could--

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.080
 - Were they the ones, there was a plane,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.400
 and they needed a lot of furniture joiners, basically,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.040
 to make them, because they were made of wood.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.040
 And oh, wow, it was something like that.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.360
 - I was at the Aerospace Museum in Bristol last weekend.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.080
 And if you look at these old planes

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.680
 made out of canvas and wood and stuff,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.640
 do you think how on earth does that stay out?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.120
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary cool.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.920
 - It looks nicer as well, though, than Mosquito,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.960
 'cause it is made of wood,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.800
 so I think everyone would have stopped to admire it.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.360
 I got really confused reading an article

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.440
 which showed, actually, from his squadron,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.920
 which showed a picture of one of the other people in it

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.400
 standing next to his plane and had four swastikas on it.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.280
 And I couldn't, it took me ages to work out

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.200
 why there were four swastikas on it, do you know?

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.040
 - I do, actually.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.560
 - Yeah, go on, yeah, I didn't know this.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.320
 - Basically, it was an intimidation tactic,

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.040
 so you would put your kill list on the side of your plane.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.960
 So as people were flying up beside you,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.000
 they'd go, "Oh my God, he's killed six Nazis."

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.360
 - Oh, you put a swastika on every time you killed a Nazi?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.880
 - Yeah, you'd paint on the outside body.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.720
 - Those people who were doing riots,

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.880
 it's the UK last week, with swastikas on their body,

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.000
 had they all been attacking Nazis as well.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.160
 - That's absolutely correct.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.240
 - It wouldn't necessarily be just swastikas,

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.520
 it'd be skulls and so on, and there were different weights,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.120
 so you would have a skull that was colored

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.120
 in a certain way that said, "That's a death."

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.120
 The next one might be, "I damaged the plane."

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.760
 It was like a whole sort of like,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.640
 a bit of reading time for the enemy to catch up on.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.880
 - They were very rarely flying alongside each other

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.680
 for that long, to be honest.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.440
 - But it is a bit of a Wikipedia entry

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.760
 that you can see like, "Oh!"

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.920
 - And then they became famous as being really sort of brave

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.880
 and full of daring do, and that kind of stuff, didn't they?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.920
 - I think they were the most important in the battle of Britain.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.080
 A Polish squadron was the most important squadron

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.920
 down the West Coast.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.840
 - And that's why if you drive out of London

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.640
 to the West these days on the A-40,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.440
 you always see the Polish War Memorial,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.680
 which is one of the roundabouts,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.720
 which I've always seen and never really knew

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.760
 why Polish War Memorial and not all the other countries.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.600
 - Who is that?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.440
 I can't see that.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.240
 - Haven't you, you'd know if you grew up in my family,

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.200
 'cause every time we passed it on the way out of London,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.680
 my dad would go, "Oh, I forgot again."

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.360
 - Probably Polish the War Memorial.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.760
 - Oh, Polish, I see.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.840
 - Yeah, Polish War Memorial.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840
 - That was good.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.920
 - Yeah, and it's all in capitals and stuff.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.200
 Oh, that's a good joke if you're ever on the M-40.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.280
 - That's a great M-40 joke.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.320
 There's quite a few stories of these pilots

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.080
 who had to bail and landed in various places.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.000
 So the tennis match is a great one.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.520
 There was another pilot who,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.760
 he landed in a South London back garden

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.200
 and there was a girl waiting out there as she landed.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.960
 They got married two months later.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.800
 So that was really good.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.320
 - So she's like, "Oh, you know what?

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.600
 "It's a shame that I don't have someone to get my--"

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600
 - Who's that?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.120
 - Good men don't just fall out of the sky, honey.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.440
 You'll be waiting there ages.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.520
 There was a third guy who he landed

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.320
 and the people around him and the town

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.440
 thought that he was enemy,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.720
 so they were going in to lynch him

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.960
 and as they were getting close to him,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.200
 he just went, "Fuck off."

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.800
 And they went, "Oh, he's one of ours."

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.280
 - Like no German would know how to say, "Fuck off."

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.520
 (all laugh)

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.600
 - Tennis in war?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.800
 - Yeah, okay.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.760
 - Oh, wow. - Was this a tennis court?

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.600
 - Sure, yeah.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.840
 - Well, you know Roland Garros?

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.520
 - So what's that?

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520
 - It's where the French opens hell.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.640
 - Yeah, right.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.880
 Did you know Roland Garros was a man?

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.920
 He developed the first single seat fighter plane

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.920
 which was fitted with a machine gun.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.760
 That was his thing.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.000
 That's why they named the stadium after him

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.840
 'cause he was a war hero

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.280
 and they built the stadium in the '20s.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.200
 - It's quite a weird leap

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.720
 as in to decide to name a tennis stadium

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.040
 after some months of that, but yeah.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.880
 - It was a weird leap.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.320
 And he was, but he was a sort of pioneering pilot.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.920
 He was the first person to fly across the Mediterranean

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.080
 in about 1913, so very, very early stuff.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.720
 The problem was guns were always behind the propeller.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.560
 - Oh yeah. - And that was a big

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.400
 problem in the end. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.320
 - You shoot your propeller off, oh no.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.560
 - So annoying. - So did he invent

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.560
 the rotation? - No, he did not invent

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.400
 the clever system which allows you to fire

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.960
 in between the propellers passing.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.480
 - What a, imagine the genius

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.120
 who thought of that. - Well no, he just,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.400
 he and his mechanic developed a similar system,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.480
 but it was like a wedge which deflected

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.480
 the occasional rounds which did hit the propeller.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.480
 - Oh, I see. - So it was very much

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.920
 a forge job, and then I think it was a German engineer

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.360
 who actually thought, no, you developed

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.160
 the system to fire between.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.640
 - And can we just say before Dan says,

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.960
 what a genius who thought of that.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.680
 I think a lot of people had thought of that before.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.200
 That was like, first thing you think is,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.960
 well, we should just get it to fire between them.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.960
 I think it's actually putting that into action

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.760
 that proved difficult.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.240
 - I clearly met the person who pulled it off.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.820
 (all laughing)

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:48.680
 - Only thing, light bulb moment, guys.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.520
 We should just fly to the moon.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.160
 - Yeah, anyway, that was his,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.640
 his innovation was sort of not quite

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.480
 working that out, basically.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.040
 - But do you know he has a tennis connection?

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.880
 - Who? - Who?

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.880
 - Roland Garros, there's this amazing story

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.920
 which happened on April the 1st, but was real.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.320
 So he was this incredibly famous fly.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320
 He went down over France, 1915,

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.560
 and he was flying this plane he designed,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.160
 so he tried to burn it so the Germans

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.600
 didn't get hold of the technology,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.360
 but failed, and they did.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.560
 And he was in a German prison of war camp,

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.200
 and he sent these coded message back to France

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.520
 to arrange for the delivery of two tennis rackets.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.440
 And within the tennis racket handles hollowed out,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.640
 were in one handle a map of Germany,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.280
 and in the other handle a felt hat

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.240
 to use as a disguise for escaping.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.200
 (all laughing)

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.720
 - You're gonna look like a Frenchman

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.840
 if you're wearing a felt hat.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.560
 - Yeah, that's where they went wrong.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.720
 - You've got two tennis rackets handles worth of stuff.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.720
 I guess a map is a good thing to pick.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.560
 - A map is a good one.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.680
 - Yeah, I think a felt hat feels like

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.000
 a needless waste of a racket.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.960
 (all laughing)

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.360
 - What would you put in it, Andy?

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.280
 A sausage?

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.000
 (all laughing)

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.560
 Everyone's gonna believe you're a German

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.760
 if you're waving a sausage around.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.600
 - That's it.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.440
 - And it's just the right shape.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.560
 - Yeah, just a giant pepper army.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.200
 - Yeah, not thin sausage, but yeah.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.640
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.000
 - Well, no, it didn't, went with a felt hat.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.280
 And actually, I don't think he used it.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.560
 He ended up making his own costume

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.120
 to mimic the guard's costumes

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.080
 and then walked out dressed as a guard.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.920
 - What a legend.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.240
 - Yeah. - That's great.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.880
 - Speaking of clothing and tennis,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.360
 this is not about war,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.160
 but it's a story that I really like.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.720
 Pat Stewart, who was a tennis player in the '60s,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.240
 she was single and she was playing at Wimbledon

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.680
 and she wanted a boyfriend.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.800
 And so she embroidered her phone number on her knickers.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.040
 And the hope was that the paparazzi

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.240
 would take photos of it

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.160
 and then someone would give her a call.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.520
 - And?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.800
 - It seems like no one did.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.120
 - Oh.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.840
 - Although she did a few months later meet

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.280
 and marry a cricketer called John Edric,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.440
 but they did divorce a few months later.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.960
 But it's quite a nice way to advertise yourself, isn't it?

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.120
 It's quite forward.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.360
 - Yeah, it's not everyone's type.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.720
 - I would almost be a bit intimidated

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.360
 by someone that confident in themselves.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.760
 - And I think a lot of the Wimbledon audience

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.280
 might feel the same way.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.160
 I think maybe she hasn't chosen her audience.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.000
 - I just do, right?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.920
 Actually, I've got to put on a telegram.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.200
 - Have you heard of Hans Reddle?

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.240
 I'm looking at you especially,

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.480
 James and Anna, sports people.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.840
 - No, I don't think so.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.280
 - Well, of course he got to the fourth round

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.520
 of the men's singles in Wimbledon in 1947.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.360
 So I'm surprised you haven't heard that.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.040
 - Oh, Hans Reddle.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.760
 (laughing)

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.600
 - No, Reddle.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.800
 (laughing)

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.280
 Sorry, different name.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.240
 But it's quite impressive for a particular reason,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.080
 which is that he had one arm.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.600
 And he had lost his other arm in the Battle of Stalingrad.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.440
 - Really?

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.360
 - He seemed to be fighting, I presume,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.040
 in the German army, he was Austrian.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.160
 And he was given special dispensation

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.240
 to touch the ball twice every time.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.480
 - Come on.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.320
 - Oh, sorry.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.160
 - I'm watching you touch the ball.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.800
 - Every time he served.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.760
 So he would toss the ball into the air with his racket.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760
 - Oh, then serve.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.120
 - 'Cause otherwise, it does make it quite a lot easier.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.560
 (laughing)

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.140
 (upbeat music)

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.440
 and that is James.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that things named

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.240
 after May West include a soda bottle,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.080
 a gas pump, a parachute malfunction,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.960
 and a graph that explains the nuclear fission of uranium.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.360
 (laughing)

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.280
 - What a lady.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.120
 - What's that?

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.960
 (laughing)

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.800
 - A parachute.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.640
 - She didn't invent all these things.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.160
 She came up with the idea, of course,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.400
 but she didn't actually.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.280
 - I know what you're gonna say.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.000
 It's not an item that is designed to be a malfunction.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.800
 A parachute malfunction is interesting.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.160
 - Did you take this off my parachute actually?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.440
 (laughing)

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.240
 - The parachute one is basically,

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.480
 it makes your canopy stick out in quite a suggestive way.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.200
 And most of these, if not all of them,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.120
 I'd use the fact that May West was famous

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.800
 for an hourglass figure.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.640
 - Oh, really?

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.680
 I thought the gas pump would be,

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.560
 'cause she was like pump, pump, pump, pumping away.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.400
 - Oh.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.240
 (laughing)

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.480
 - In the bedroom?

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.000
 - No, as in working hard in the industry.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.840
 - Oh, right.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.960
 - No, it was because it has like a slim waist kind of thing.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.440
 - I see.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.560
 - And the graph of the products of nuclear fission

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.280
 of uranium is basically two sort of normal distribution curves.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.520
 So it's like a pair of boobs.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.400
 - Oh, okay.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.680
 She was actually quite a sort of slim,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.920
 straight up and down lady.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.800
 She wasn't actually a sort of Jessica Rabbit style.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.160
 - She wasn't Jessica Rabbit style

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.200
 because that is just impossible.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.040
 - 'Cause it's cartoon.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.320
 - Cartoon, yeah, okay.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.840
 - But, yeah, I mean, yeah.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.560
 - I haven't studied her, actually,

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.040
 I can picture her face, but I haven't studied her body.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.160
 I just assumed she had that.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.000
 It was that all over the place.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.820
 - Well, I read that.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.660
 I'd like to clarify,

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.880
 I haven't been studying pictures of Maywest.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.160
 I just, I'm, yeah, I would say she was--

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.000
 - She was curvaceous.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.840
 - She was curvaceous.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.680
 - Oh, okay.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.520
 - And she had the thin waist.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.360
 - Okay.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.920
 - In actual fact, I believe the word curvaceous

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.640
 was coined specifically for her.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.480
 - No.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.320
 - Pretty interesting.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.840
 - Yeah, if you look in the OED,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.160
 basically all of the first few citations are about her.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.960
 And the earliest one says,

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.400
 "A new word has been coined to fit the personality

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.440
 "of Maywest.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.880
 "The word curvaceous is a combination of curves

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.200
 "and vivacious to have Miss West's chief characteristic."

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.320
 - That's incredible.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.560
 That's so good.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.040
 I had no idea that's where the word came from.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:06.880
 That's brilliant.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.480
 - Yes, 'cause we don't assume the vivacious bit.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.600
 You can't just have big boobs and big hips.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.480
 You've got to have the character to go with it.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.320
 - Yeah.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.160
 - Correct.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.980
 - Is that a lesson for you ladies,

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.820
 an anti-feminist lesson?

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.280
 (all laughing)

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.560
 - Yeah, when I say that to women on the tube.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.640
 (all laughing)

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.000
 - There's no point just having big boobs.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.720
 I weren't your personality.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.760
 I'm just asking you for your tickets, sir.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.560
 (all laughing)

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.400
 - Okay.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.440
 I mean, so there was another thing named after her

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.280
 in the, actually, Sakamawbo,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.240
 some twin turreted combat tanks.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.080
 - Yes.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.920
 - Yes, reasons.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920
 - Yes.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.760
 - A live jacket,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.280
 which makes you look like you've got big boobs.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.120
 - Yeah.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.160
 - The grip she had on the 20th century.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.200
 We should step back and say who she is,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.280
 because she was a great comedian of her time.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.880
 And her time would have been the 1930s and so on.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.120
 She was in movies, she wrote novels, she wrote plays.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.960
 She has so many one-liners

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.520
 and they were the kind of lines that you just saw.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.680
 You wouldn't get away with that at the time.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.800
 - I used to be snow white, but I drifted.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.520
 All of that stuff.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.580
 - Without the noise.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.420
 - No, with the noise.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.260
 - With the noise.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.080
 - That's the way that we're coming back

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.440
 to your comedy noise again, which we mentioned last week.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.680
 - Can you do when I'm good, I'm good,

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.520
 but when I'm bad, I'm better.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.520
 - When I'm good, I'm very, very good.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.560
 But when I'm bad, I'm better.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.840
 - Ooh, whacka, whacka, whacka, whacka.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.680
 - Very whacka.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.500
 Is that a guy in your pocket?

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.800
 I think that was her.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.480
 - She did say that in a film in the end,

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.040
 but I don't think it was the first instance.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.960
 She said it in the film weirdly in the seventh,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.800
 like the last film she did

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.880
 or one of the last films she did.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.440
 - Oh yeah, yeah, she did a film at the edge of about 80,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.640
 but she was described in her obituary as a sex personality.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.160
 It was a big part of her character and her persona.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.040
 - Yeah, I think it's really weird that if you think of people

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.440
 who push the boundaries of comedy,

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.680
 Lenny Bruce will be someone,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.040
 we've spoken about him on the show before,

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.240
 who was jailed because he was saying words

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.560
 that you weren't allowed to say on stage concepts.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.880
 That's what Mae West was doing.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.440
 And she was in fact jailed for, meant to be 10 days.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.960
 In the end, it was eight days

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.600
 'cause she got off a good behavior.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.400
 - One wonders what that good behavior was.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.360
 - Oh yeah, I got off a good behavior, I know I got off.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.360
 - Someone else got off as well.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.280
 - But yeah, she wrote a Broadway play in 1926 called Sex.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.680
 And the production was taken up by the city officials

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.720
 as offensive.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.760
 They said, "You're gonna go to jail or pay a fine."

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.080
 And she said, "Put me in jail."

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.920
 'Cause she thought the publicity would be great.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.080
 But she also meant it.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.800
 She was like, "I should be saying this on stage.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.640
 This is fine."

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.480
 She doesn't get the credit.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.800
 - I read something really interesting about sex, the play.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.240
 I thought it was banned because it itself was so lurid

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.480
 and so sexy and too pornographic,

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.280
 but it had been on for about a year in New York

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.520
 before they stormed in and banned it, been on for a while.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.200
 But the thing that had happened was

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.400
 she'd written another play called Drag.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.080
 And that was showing somewhere else, I think in Connecticut.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.120
 And that was all about homosexuality.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.080
 You know, it's called Drag.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.840
 It ends in this huge, big drag show.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.080
 It's about lots of gay relationships happening.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.840
 The lead character is a guy who's in the closet.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.560
 And I believe that the authorities in New York

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.960
 couldn't clamp down on that

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.440
 because it was outside their jurisdiction,

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.440
 but they really didn't want to get into New York.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.160
 So they then clamped down on sex.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.880
 - And the New York Times called it a crude

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.680
 and inept play, cheaply produced and polyactive.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.720
 - Is that a sex or drag?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.560
 - That was sex.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.640
 - But of course, because it was being banned,

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.280
 everyone wanted to see it.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.240
 And it became really, really popular.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.720
 Another thing was that it had African-American music in it.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.080
 And that was seen as hot jazz.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:30.920
 That was the other thing.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.520
 You know, it features lots of sexy stuff.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.000
 There is prostitution, there are pimps,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.880
 there are corrupt cops who are not in themselves sexy,

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.720
 I suppose.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.800
 (all laughing)

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.800
 It sounds pretty sexy.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.640
 Sorry.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.760
 I'm showing my predilections there.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.000
 Anyway, but the point was that her character,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.360
 because she played a lady of the night

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.280
 and she really doesn't have anything to apologise for.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.840
 And she played a woman who thinks

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.080
 she has nothing to apologise for.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.000
 And you were allowed to show grime and semeness

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.840
 as long as everyone repents hard at the end.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.800
 And she didn't, you know.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.200
 So I think that was another part of the moral objection to it.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.080
 - Yeah, literally people must have been just on the floor

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.760
 with shop, she was doing all this

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.960
 and sticking out for every minority there was

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.080
 because she considered herself kind of among them.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.640
 She'd come from the society's underbelly really,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.480
 hadn't she?

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.840
 Her dad was a street fighter, I think.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.680
 - Yeah, he was.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.640
 He was a boxer, yeah.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.200
 - Who was, although he went on to be a masseuse, weirdly.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.040
 - That's interesting.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.880
 Did he keep the gloves on?

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.720
 Do you reckon?

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.560
 (all laughing)

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.280
 - Just like your predilection to get there.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.000
 (all laughing)

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.200
 - People asked for it, I think he'd go for it.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.040
 - That makes sense.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.880
 You can't box anymore,

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.480
 but you've been in the industry

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.120
 where they don't have lots of masseuses.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.320
 - Let me pound you in the ring.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.160
 That kind of stuff.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.400
 (all laughing)

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.160
 - Okay, he also became a special policeman,

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.200
 which I'm not quite sure what that means,

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.440
 but it sounds like he might also be up your street, Andy.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.280
 (all laughing)

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.080
 - Another sexy is a corrupt one, but yeah.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.360
 That's a dirty cough, no doubt, yeah.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.240
 - Can I just say back to sex, just on that?

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.040
 So the group that was campaigning against the play sex

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.280
 was called the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.360
 And they were founded by the world's greatest prude,

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.360
 called Anthony Cornstock, a self-given nickname, I think.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.840
 And he had been inspired by the death of a friend

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.600
 who'd become addicted to pornography

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.560
 and masturbated himself to death.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.400
 - No.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.600
 - Or so he thought.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.960
 - Sad on the gravestone.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.960
 (all laughing)

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.280
 - Yeah, so he thought that that's what had happened.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.280
 And he decided to start the society for prudery.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.120
 And it was these guys who stopped sex.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.920
 - I didn't know, I didn't know that.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.160
 That's incredible. - I've heard the name

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.480
 Cornstock. - You'll know the Cornstock law,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.840
 I think, which was an American thing

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.160
 which stopped you from having any obscene material,

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.600
 but it stopped you from sending anything

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.920
 through the post as well.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.240
 And what that meant was you couldn't send

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.600
 any contraception leaflets or anything like that.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.840
 So it's part of that whole song.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.640
 - Cornstock was a nickname, did you say?

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.760
 - No, that was his surname.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.480
 His nickname was the world's greatest prude.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.160
 - Oh, okay, when you said Cornstock,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.480
 I was like, oh, that's a weird nickname.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.680
 (all laughing)

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.680
 But also, it just made me think

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.800
 when you said the masturbation thing.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.400
 I thought, oh, Cornstock, is that?

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.600
 'Cause Cornflakes was an anti-masturbation thing.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.320
 Was it all about corn? - Your mind is incredible, Deb.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.520
 All the effort that you put

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.800
 into making these unbelievably great connections

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.240
 wouldn't be necessary if you just listened a bit more.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.320
 (all laughing)

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.280
 - It's really amazing. - It's the shittest Colombo.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.320
 (all laughing)

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.560
 - That's so embarrassing about his friend as well.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.880
 - I know. - He keeps going around saying,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.400
 "This is in honor of my friend."

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.840
 "Wrightfully, dive masturbating."

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.720
 - Yeah, it feels like he didn't really like that guy, didn't it?

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.600
 - No, he was just having a bath

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.720
 and he got hit by lightning.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.560
 (all laughing)

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.640
 - Mae West loved having an enema.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.440
 So when she was in her vaudeville days

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.960
 and she used to go to the bathrooms,

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.040
 she was saying this, like, filthy, I'd never using these.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.720
 And so she used to give herself a daily enema

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.280
 so that she didn't have to deal with them.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.040
 And that became part of her,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.480
 if you were doing a movie with her.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.440
 So Tony Curtis talks about this.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.000
 He says on the last film that she did,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.720
 "Sex Tet," which he was in,

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.760
 he said that she would get her makeup done

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.240
 and then always, 11 a.m. approximately in the morning,

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.000
 she would then have the final bit of getting ready,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.320
 which was to have her enema,

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.680
 and then she was ready for the set.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.680
 - And then she said,

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.120
 "I keep my friends close, but my enemas closer."

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.800
 - Nice. - Whack-a-whack-a-whack.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.920
 - She did a really strong line in objectifying men,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.920
 which I think we approve of,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.960
 'cause obviously women were used to being objectified

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.360
 for thousands of years.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.160
 After her sort of Hollywood career,

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.120
 she set up a vagus review of sort of

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.440
 these bulging, beefy muscle men

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.320
 so that women could come and look at them.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.400
 'Cause she said, you know,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.360
 "Men have always had something to look at,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.920
 "now it's time for the wives to have something."

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.000
 - I think it's basically magic Mike

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.680
 that she sort of invented.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.520
 I know there were muscle shows before that.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.880
 It's like "Mr. Universe" and stuff that Charles Atlas was in.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.720
 - Charles Atlas and Eugene Sandoval.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.880
 So there were muscle men before,

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.000
 but I think she kind of turned it into a show.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.400
 - She turned it into more of a sexy thing.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.080
 - Coca-Cola bottles used to be called

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.720
 Maywest bottles as well, by the way.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.560
 - So the first thing in my fact was soda bottles

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.800
 are named after her, and that was what I'm talking about.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.520
 - Yeah, and I thought, 'cause it said

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.400
 that it was inspired by her, and that's not true.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.440
 That just sort of got around.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.600
 But on Coca-Cola's website, they describe it.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.160
 These used to be called Maywest.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.520
 So they were designed to look a bit like coca beans,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.520
 and then they decided that they needed to be more curvy

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.320
 because they kept rolling off the conveyor belts.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.680
 So remember we talked about conveyor belts last week,

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.640
 and so they kept rolling off the conveyor belts,

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.480
 and so they changed the shape very slightly

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.160
 so that they rolled over an axis and went straight

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.320
 rather than kind of rolling off to the left or the right.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.840
 So that's why the modern Coca-Cola bottle looks like it is.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.560
 - That's great, practical.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.520
 - She came to the UK once with a play.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.880
 It was actually in 1947, which is the year that that guy,

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.520
 Reddle, got to the fourth round of the men's singles

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.880
 at Wimbledon with one arm.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.720
 - Wow, what were the chances?

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.800
 - That's not why she was here.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.240
 She arrived, and for her first press conference,

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.360
 she arrived, she said, "I want every man in England

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.520
 "to come up and see me."

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.240
 Especially this big Ben character I hear about.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.320
 Brilliant. - Great, nice.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.000
 - Anyway, when she was here, she did her play, obviously,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.800
 but she also went to a boxing match.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.680
 She went to the Dunlop factory,

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.040
 where she signed an inflatable life jacket.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.720
 - Yeah. - And I love this.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.000
 She went to the opening

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.160
 of the British philatelic exhibition in Glasgow.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.600
 There was a stamp exhibition on, and she was there.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.040
 - I think that she confused the word philately with philatio.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.920
 - I mean, that's what happened, yeah.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.000
 - Philately will get you nowhere, boys.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.320
 (laughing)

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.900
 (upbeat music)

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.160
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.840
 and that is my fact.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.320
 My fact this week is that in 2013,

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.500
 a survey revealed that 97% of students

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.760
 studying Finnish at Vienna University

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.200
 were mainly doing so because of their love

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.720
 for the country's death metal bands.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.960
 And most of them, by the way, sing in English,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.040
 so there's no real point in doing that.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.840
 But yeah, death metal from Finland is responsible

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.400
 as the main reason for all these students

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.880
 studying the language. - I can see that, yeah.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.160
 - In a way. - Yeah.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.520
 - Can you? - I can actually.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.120
 - I find the lyrics in metal music

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.320
 quite difficult to make out, and I don't know.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.840
 And I speak the language of English,

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.800
 which is the language I hear a lot of death metal in.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.000
 - That's true. - Yeah, well,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.560
 yeah, what's interesting as well is that

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.360
 I had to listen to a bunch of the bands that were cited.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.400
 Children of Bodham is a massive band,

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.240
 and I listened to some of their songs,

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.440
 it's very clear what they're saying.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.600
 - For listeners, that wasn't very clear what you said,

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.640
 it's Bodham, not Bottom, isn't it?

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.240
 - Oh, I said Bodham. - I know you did.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.400
 - Oh, right. - But it does sound

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.680
 a bit like Children of Bodham.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.000
 - Maybe that's what they're going for.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.200
 Little bum joke?

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.640
 - Little bum bum joke?

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.320
 - The maywests of modern Finland.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.600
 (all laughing)

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.600
 Yeah, Stradivarius is another band, and him,

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.880
 and yeah, they all sing in English,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.480
 and I listen to them, and yeah, it's quite clear.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.320
 It is quite clear. - Oh, is it?

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.400
 - Yeah, yeah. - That's all they're saying.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.600
 - Yeah, I would say so.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.120
 Finland does seem to have a unique affinity

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.640
 for heavy metal, though.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.240
 - Yeah, it really does. - Yeah.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.160
 The figures wobble around a bit,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.640
 but one recent tish figure was that there are

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.880
 53 and a half metal bands per 100,000 people in Finland,

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.720
 and that is, that's a lot.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.000
 The UK has about five metal bands per 100,000 people,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.840
 so Finland--

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.560
 - It still feels like a lot to me.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.400
 - Yes. - Enough.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.120
 It feels like too many to me.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.680
 - No, you're right, five per 100,000 people.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.800
 - If I think about the population of what,

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.160
 I don't know, Bolton must be about 200,000,

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.440
 so that means we've got 10 metal bands in Bolton.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.920
 It feels like a lot.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.160
 - Yeah. - Does it?

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.120
 I mean, there could be real amateur

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.720
 just doing an open mic night.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.200
 We're not talking charting bands necessarily, I don't--

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.040
 - Maybe, I think you're right.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.160
 - They work in Tesco on the weekdays.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.760
 - There's a town called Lemmy in Finland,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.200
 which has 3,000 people in this.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.040
 It's called Lemmy.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.880
 - What?

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.700
 - What?

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.540
 - After the guy from the town.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.120
 - Yeah, no, great point.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.400
 It's spelled a bit differently, but it is called Lemmy.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.880
 Anyway, they've got 3,000 people

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.400
 and they have 13 metal bands.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.160
 That really is the, that's the metal center of the universe.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.520
 That is the core, you know.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.640
 - Amazing, it's called Lemmy.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.600
 - Yeah.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.960
 - They have a church of heavy metal,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.200
 and there's a guy who does metal mass,

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.200
 so this very cool pastor who looks like a heavy metal fan,

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.920
 but then he's a Lutheran pastor,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.560
 and he puts on the correct robes,

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.880
 and he started in 2006 just adapting traditional hymns,

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.600
 so he keeps the lyrics the same, you know,

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.440
 the creed and the color around it,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.440
 but turns them into heavy metal soil.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.440
 - Oh, thanks, bride, I'm beautiful.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.280
 - Exactly.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.120
 - That's great.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.960
 - That's really good.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.400
 - It sounds really cool, it's really popular.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.800
 - Heavy Sorus, another cool one.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.520
 They're a Finnish heavy metal band

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.760
 where they're all dressed as dido-saws

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.840
 and the songs are for children.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.680
 - Oh.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.000
 (laughing)

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.080
 - Their album, (speaks in foreign language)

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.560
 which means "Night of the Dinosaurs"

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.680
 was the second most popular album in Finland in 2010.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.520
 - Wow.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.360
 - Nice.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.360
 - And their members include Millie Pilly,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.520
 Confymompi, Riffy Raffy, and Muffy Puffy.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.440
 (laughing)

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.240
 And according to their website,

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.600
 they were in eggs in the Cretaceous period,

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.000
 but they somehow fossilized,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.240
 and then came out of the eggs and survived,

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.640
 and then started a rock group.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.480
 - That's quite cool.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.320
 - That's very cool.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.600
 - Although someone has pointed out

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.360
 that Muffy Puffy is a stegosaurus,

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.520
 and Confymompi is an apatosaurus

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.280
 who lived in the Jurassic period in that Cretaceous.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.360
 - Got to do your research

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.280
 instead of your dinosaur marathon.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.120
 - Yeah.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:26.960
 - Muffy Puffy.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.240
 - Lordy's from there as well.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.080
 - Yeah, Lordy.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.480
 - The Eurovision Song Contest winner.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.120
 He calls himself Mr. Lordy,

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.880
 and he started the band when he met the other members

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.080
 while he was running a Finnish kiss cruise

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.040
 because he was the president of Kiss Army Finland.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.960
 He sounds incredible, Mr. Lordy,

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.480
 as in I think he's basically

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.160
 one of the great geeks of our world.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.120
 He's a comic book illustrator,

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.280
 he's a graphic designer,

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.360
 he's a special effects makeup artist.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.800
 - Like, I think if you look at metal music,

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.200
 it's obviously not true of everyone,

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.400
 but I think there is a crossover of nerdyness

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.240
 for people who like metal.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.080
 - Oh, God, yeah.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.760
 - Well, Corey Taylor, when he came in for the 100th episode,

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.640
 arrived in a doctor who, or a Sherlock T-shirt.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.480
 - Yeah, there's another man of misfit, I guess,

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.320
 being into metal.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.840
 It's not mainstream, except in Finland,

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.120
 where it basically has crossed over into it,

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.000
 but I think it's if you don't fit into the mainstream,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.960
 you go for it.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.320
 And they also are famous in QI circles

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.560
 for hosting the first ever

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.440
 heavy metal knitting world championships.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.800
 - Oh, yes.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.880
 - They do do that.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.520
 - It is a bit stupid, that, isn't it?

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.360
 - Hey.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.960
 - What's, um, what is it?

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.880
 - It's just literally doing heavy metal and knitting.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.040
 There doesn't seem to be-

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.160
 - There's no extra bit.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.000
 - No.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.080
 - But is it like chess boxing where you do one minute

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.200
 of one and then one minute of the other?

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.280
 - No, you do them simultaneously.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.960
 But they are judged and they're actually judged

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.600
 on quite interesting criteria.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.000
 - Sorry, how can you do them simultaneously?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.400
 - So, at least one member of your band

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.640
 has to be knitting something at the same time

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.000
 as performing and you are judged on various things,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.560
 but partly on the piece of knitting

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.520
 that you produce by the end of your set.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.600
 - Everyone I know who knits, they're like,

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.200
 oh, look at this scarf.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.680
 I've been working on it for four months.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.640
 What have we, are they coming in with the final,

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.280
 like, one day of knitting that's needed

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.840
 for the scarf or are they starting?

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.400
 - That's such, it's quite small,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.000
 but they also do seem to go quite fast

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.840
 in the ones I saw.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.240
 Maybe there was some clever video editing.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.160
 - That's the tempo of heavy metal, isn't it?

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.880
 It probably does encourage speed.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.200
 - Yes, you have to do it in time with the songs, of course.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.600
 You want to judge for that, so.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.240
 - Can I ask, do people ever do the knitting

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.080
 with their own bodies?

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.280
 And what I mean by that, sorry, what I mean is,

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.480
 do people ever get a maypole in the middle of the stage

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.280
 and then they've all got a ribbon

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.760
 and they move around the stage while they play?

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.960
 - That's not really knitting, so much as crocheting.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.240
 (laughing)

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.920
 - Because I watched "The Wicked Man" recently

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.120
 for the first time, there's a great maypole scene in that.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.440
 And that's sort of, "The Wicked Man"

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.040
 bleeds into that world, doesn't it?

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.960
 - It's more platting, I think.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.600
 - 'Cause it does feel like, for all the men in metal,

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.200
 usually have large, gigantic beards, low hanging.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.520
 That's what should be being knitted while they're doing.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.080
 Someone should be working up.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:55.920
 (laughing)

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.520
 - They probably accidentally catch someone's beard

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.240
 sometimes and knit it into their jumper.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.040
 - Sorry, baseball, you're part of it now.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.720
 You can never take the jumper off.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.120
 - I look forward to Andy's Morris dancing

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.760
 platting competition.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.000
 (laughing)

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.920
 In 2019, Metallica played a gig in Finland,

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.040
 which was attended by 1% of everyone in the country.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.840
 - Ooh, I remember that happening in Iceland as well,

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.280
 I think, like it was an enormous percentage.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.520
 - That's very cool.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.400
 'Cause there are five and a half million Finns

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.080
 and they had 55,000 in the audience for that gig.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.200
 So the numbers do stack up.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.200
 - Yeah, well done, Metallica.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.040
 - Do you wanna play a game of Finnish metal band

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.200
 or game of thrones episode?

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.040
 - Yes.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.400
 - Ah, okay, of course.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.360
 - No, I've seen every episode of Finland,

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.520
 so I'm confident about this.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.280
 - Throne of chaos.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.120
 - Band.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.440
 - Andy, you've seen every episode.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.760
 - I think band, I think band.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.240
 - Game of thrones, then.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.440
 - It is a band.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.080
 They were unable to make commercial headway

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.120
 and broke up in August, 2005.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.120
 - Okay.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.600
 - Winter sun.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.440
 - Game of thrones.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.520
 - I'll say band.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.720
 - It's a band.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.640
 It's not really death metal, says the singer.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.400
 It's very difficult for me to label it,

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.120
 but if someone put a gun to my forehead,

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.560
 I would probably say something like

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.720
 extreme melodic, majestic metal.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.360
 - If I think it'll just annoy whoever's put a gun

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.520
 to your head at this point, that's an irritating.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.520
 - The pointy end.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.360
 - Thrones.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.200
 - I'll say thrones.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.040
 - Metal.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.520
 - It is thrones.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.760
 - Ay.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.880
 - It refers to a sword fighting lesson

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.600
 that John gave to Arya before the farewell,

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.360
 where he says, "stick them with the pointy end."

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.200
 - Do you remember that note?

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.040
 You say it?

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:30.880
 - Yeah.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.720
 - Isn't it nice?

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.520
 - But there's a lot of fun Finnish band names.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.600
 - Pierre Gunt.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.800
 (laughing)

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.800
 - You know it, Gunt.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.560
 - Does Gunt mean the same thing in Finland as it does here?

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.720
 - I looked it up in the Oxford English Dictionary,

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.600
 and it doesn't mean anything in this country.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.880
 - Don't know what you're talking about, James.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.920
 - But it's obviously based on Greek's Pierre Gents,

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.080
 but also it's guns in Finnish.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.480
 - I see.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.040
 - Climidia with a K.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.880
 - Ooh.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.720
 - Los Bastardos, Finlandesses.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.560
 (laughing)

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.400
 - Brilliant names.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.240
 - Those are great names.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.080
 - That's very good.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.120
 - I'm Finnish language.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:02.960
 - Oh yeah.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.240
 - I see.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.680
 - It's really hard.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.520
 - Yeah.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.160
 - Like it's really, really difficult.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.560
 - For what reason?

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.520
 - It's very complicated.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.160
 (laughing)

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.960
 - It's got 15 different cases.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.800
 - Okay.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.800
 - And lots of people leave after arriving

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.720
 because it's just like language complexities,

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.080
 also bureaucracy and attacks.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.160
 - Lots of people leave after a lot of people move there

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.520
 and then go, "Oh, sod this."

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.800
 - Students who arrive, 36% of them leave within a year

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.320
 of finishing their studies,

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.320
 so they don't stay on and make a life.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.000
 - And there's another reason which is,

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.520
 I don't think anyone's tired of this,

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.720
 but in Finland, apparently, there's almost no small talk.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.880
 You just pay for your coffee and you shut up.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.440
 - I only learned one word of Finnish when I was there,

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.640
 and it's kitos, which means thank you.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.960
 And the way I remembered it is

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.680
 'cause it's like mosquitoes, but without the moss bit.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.520
 - Oh really?

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.360
 - Right.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.200
 - And that's how they told it,

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.640
 'cause I actually got that through some small talk

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.480
 in a cafe.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.320
 (laughing)

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.160
 - They were eating it.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.440
 - I was gonna say, we are gonna get letters

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.280
 off the back of that.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.120
 - I don't think we are.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.040
 - I think I've read quite a lot about Finnish culture before.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.360
 I think it became a thing in China

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.520
 to call yourself spiritually Finnish,

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.240
 and it's a very popular meme.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.840
 A lot of Chinese people tapped into this.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.040
 It's got millions of views.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.720
 The idea is that they like their own space.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.000
 They're very taciturn, and I've never seen,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.680
 and I've read so many accounts of Finns

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.520
 being asked about this.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.280
 I've never seen anyone say, this is bullshit.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.600
 We're all incredibly friendly.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.440
 (laughing)

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.280
 - Okay.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.120
 - So do write in.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:23.960
 - It's not unfriendly, yeah.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.720
 It's just very, it's just quiet.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.400
 - Which country did I get a few emails

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.120
 'cause I said they don't talk about the weather

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.120
 'cause they have so much.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.280
 - That was somewhere in Scandinavia.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.640
 - Yeah, yeah, definitely got emails off the back of that.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.760
 - Just on the language, it is a really interesting language.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.080
 It's the Uralic language,

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.360
 which means it came from the Urals,

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.000
 and there are kind of three main Uralic languages.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.720
 Finnish, Estonian, which makes sort of sense

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.560
 because that's--

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.400
 - Right next to each other.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.240
 - You swim across.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.040
 - Yeah, swim across a small bit of water.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.840
 And then Hungarian.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.680
 - So weird.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.640
 - Which is, there's like four countries in between them

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.660
 if you follow them down.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.480
 - And it's four countries,

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.700
 but they're four pretty big countries as well.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.480
 - Yeah, it's so mad.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.120
 I think it's because it starts in the Urals

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.400
 to the east of both of them,

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.200
 and then some people went just directly west,

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.600
 and I don't know why it didn't sort of drop bits of itself

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.960
 along the way in Ukraine or in bits of Russia,

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.800
 but it didn't.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.840
 - But I think also like the Soviet Union,

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.280
 they basically banned any other language, didn't they?

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.120
 - Yeah, you're right, maybe that's--

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.960
 - So I think a lot of the smaller pockets just died out.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.360
 - They got it, that's probably it.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.920
 Yeah, and didn't quite reach Hungary that rule,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.160
 even though obviously Hungary--

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.000
 - I believe so.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.200
 - Being in part of the Eastern Bloc.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.600
 But you're hungry just sitting there

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.100
 in the same language family as the Finns,

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.040
 but unable to reach them.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.320
 - Wild, sob.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.280
 - The oldest writing in the Finnish family of languages,

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.560
 which was found in the Urals, is very metal, actually.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.280
 If you translate it into English,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.560
 it translates as God's arrow, ten is your name,

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.800
 the arrow is God's own, the doom God leads.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.640
 - That's brilliant.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.760
 - And to go back to a former thing

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.720
 that we were talking about,

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.560
 we reckon that it was a magic spell

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.760
 to stop lightning from getting you.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.980
 You might say it in the bath, for instance.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.820
 - Yeah.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.200
 - Yeah, it was found in Novgorod.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.640
 - Dan has a rubber duck with those words.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.320
 (all laughing)

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.520
 - Well, rubber, that'll be good.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.840
 - Yes, put that rubber duck under your ass.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.680
 - Yeah.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.760
 - To avoid lightning.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.600
 - To avoid lightning.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.840
 - Well, Dan, why have you got a rubber duck

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.680
 up your ass?

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.520
 (all laughing)

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.400
 - I tell you, I was in the bath.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.840
 It was raining outside.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.680
 (all laughing)

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.880
 - You're coming too careful.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.200
 (all laughing)

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.280
 - They invented the happy or not buttons.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.280
 - The happy or not buttons.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.560
 - Oh, so when you're in an airport

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.800
 and you go through security and you have to say,

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.680
 did I have a good time or did I have a great time?

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.520
 (all laughing)

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.960
 There's like some little faces

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.800
 and you press one under.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.080
 - Exactly, that's a finished person,

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.040
 which I think is interesting

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.720
 because they're known for being quite deadpan,

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.680
 although they're always also found

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.200
 to be the happiest country in the world, confusingly.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.000
 But yes, it was a finished guy

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.200
 who invented them,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.680
 marvelous and bad customer service.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.280
 And they've just been hugely kind of revolutionary

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.240
 for customer service in a lot of places.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.080
 - Have they?

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.920
 - Yeah, because it changes how the staff acts.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.680
 So Heathrow was their big break in 2012,

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.600
 called this finished guy.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.840
 They said, can we have a couple of these or try them out?

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.320
 They got nine.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.680
 Within, I think within two days,

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.560
 Heathrow called the finished guy back and said,

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.200
 we need to shed loads of these right now

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.120
 'cause the staff insecurity had gone from being kind of sullen,

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.080
 occasionally a bit rude or just blanking customers.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.120
 - Could I just say, for the next time I go through Heathrow,

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.320
 I've always found them to be lovely.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.360
 - Yeah, see, they instill this kind of fear in people.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.400
 - Did this guy invent it

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.160
 because him and all the rest of the finished people

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.680
 hate small talks so much

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.280
 that they're like even a machine

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.200
 to ask that basic question is what I would prefer?

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.360
 - It could be, I actually thought it might be related

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.000
 'cause it's so quick and you don't need to do any kind of

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.280
 interacting at all, yeah.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.920
 But it does make the staff, I think that's really interesting.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.400
 Subconsciously, as soon as you're aware,

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.320
 that button's there for people's satisfaction to be logged.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.160
 The staff give a little gag and they'll actually--

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.360
 - Can I ask a question about those?

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.160
 I know you're not the expert in them

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.000
 and you've only read this thing, but--

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.840
 - It's been about three and a half minutes

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.280
 reading about them actually, so there we go.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.440
 - So when I walk out of security

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.280
 and I've gone through really quickly

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.680
 'cause I'm a good person who takes my belt off

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.480
 before I go through and--

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.680
 - Trousers down your ass.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.040
 (laughing)

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:18.880
 - You're showing your phone number

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.080
 to all the security people.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.000
 - Let me put the rose rubber gloves on you.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.240
 (laughing)

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.400
 And I press the smiley button

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.760
 and I press it like 10 times

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.120
 'cause I had such a good time.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:31.960
 - Yeah.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.760
 - Does that count as 10 or do you think it doesn't?

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.240
 - Well, James, as the three and a half minutes,

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.120
 well, I do know the answer to that.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.000
 There is a little time restriction on it,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 which means that, for instance,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.280
 staff or you can't cheat it,

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.720
 so you can't log lots and lots in a row quickly,

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.940
 but you could keep coming back.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.640
 You could go get your cost to come back.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.480
 - While you were saying that,

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.120
 all I could picture was what would it be like

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.480
 to get gloved at an airport?

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.280
 I could see my session ending with them going,

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.120
 "Okay, there's nothing there.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.320
 You're free to go, Mr. Shriver.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.920
 Here's your rubber duck by the way."

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.760
 (laughing)

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.340
 (upbeat music)

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.320
 Okay, that is it.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.680
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.560
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.640
 about the things that we've said

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.000
