00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,280
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,320
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,600
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski,

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,120
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,640
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,760
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,760
 My fact this week is that for at least 80 years,

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,280
 the same thundercloud has been raining off the north coast of Australia.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,560
 It's called Hector the Convector.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,840
 Brilliant.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,600
 Or he's called Hector the Convector.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,560
 Is it actually he?

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,400
 He's called Hector.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,960
 Yeah. Oh, clouds don't have.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,960
 A lot of the press does give him a...

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,160
 Please, let's not get into pronouns for clouds.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,280
 She's called Hector, it's fine.

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,040
 He's called Hector, like it must be a he, right?

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,520
 Fair enough, it's a joke actually.

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,080
 He should be called Cumulo Nimbus the Cumulo Nimbus.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,600
 Is it really a convector, a cloud?

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,920
 I don't really know what convector means.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,480
 It does work by convection, yeah, as sort of, I mean all clouds do, but there's all...

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,040
 Culeo Nimbus, Culeo Nimbus.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,080
 Yeah, you said Culeo Nimbus the Cumulo Nimbus.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,520
 No, he didn't. You made that joke up into your own head.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
 That's good.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,240
 Yeah, better than what Andy said, which is just the name of the type of cloud.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,760
 I set him up, you tougher man.

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,920
 Andy's correct, he is a Cumulo Nimbus,

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,960
 but he does also form through the power of convection,

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,560
 which, you know, is as hot air currents go up.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,880
 We know how clouds form, right?

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
 Yeah.

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
 He...

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,120
 Bagley.

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,440
 If you don't know, ask your 12-year-old niece, nephew, daughter, son.

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,480
 We'll probably go into it in more depth.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,640
 So, get excited about that.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,720
 But yeah, he builds up over the Tiwi Islands, Tiwi, which are...

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,640
 It's a really cute word.

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
 It is a cute word.

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,240
 It's north of Darwin, right?

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,800
 It's a little island off Australia.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,960
 Yes, and it's at three in the afternoon every single day from September to April,

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,720
 which is before the rainy season, and then during the rainy season, he appears.

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
 You can set your watch by it.

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,080
 So, here's my question, right?

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,480
 You know the, like, the never-ending super, whatever it's called,

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,680
 the immortal soup, where it's just always been the same soup, and they just keep it.

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,080
 So, you eat the soup, and then there's a little bit left,

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,560
 and then they add more water and more vegetables and stuff.

55
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,760
 So, the sum of it is...

56
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
 There's some of it always in.

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
 This cloud does disappear.

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,920
 Hector does go away.

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,800
 He's only there for the months that you just said, right?

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
 September 3rd to April.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,320
 So, how can you say that it's the same Hector?

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,880
 Well, Dan, not a single cell in your body, of course,

63
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,640
 is the same as the cells in your body you were born with.

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,880
 So, how can we say it's the same Dan?

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,560
 That's true.

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,840
 But it is the same.

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,800
 And also, Dan disappears for six months every year, doesn't he?

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,720
 It's incredibly annoying for our recording channel.

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,080
 I guess it's formed by the same forces every day.

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,320
 Yeah, I was looking for named clouds, and there are so few.

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,000
 Oh, yeah, that is surprising, isn't it?

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,240
 I think considering the things that just transiently appear

73
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
 and then disappear in a matter of minutes.

74
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,760
 I just thought there must be a shortlist on Wikipedia

75
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,920
 of celebrity clouds.

76
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
 The one I can think of is the Tablecloth or the Table Mountain.

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,280
 Oh, that's good.

78
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,120
 I didn't know about that.

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,520
 I didn't find that one.

80
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,840
 What did you get, Dan?

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,480
 Nothing.

82
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,960
 [LAUGHTER]

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,320
 Well, it's good you brought up.

84
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,440
 The only one I found was the Lake Maracaibo one

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
 in western Venezuela, and that's an everlasting storm,

86
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,320
 which is there about 260 nights a year.

87
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,600
 So, again, we mentioned it about eight years ago.

88
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,120
 It was a long, long time ago.

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,920
 And it's at a point where a river empties into the lake,

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,520
 Lake Maracaibo, and sailors have used it

91
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,200
 for centuries to navigate, because you can see it

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,480
 from 200 miles away.

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,480
 And that's what Hector had a role in World War II,

94
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,560
 was part of the war effort, because Hector was helping

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,480
 navigate Australian pilots or any pilots

96
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,320
 that were coming in via Australia and Papua New Guinea.

97
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,920
 So any pilot, meaning he was kind of a Swiss cloud, basically.

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
 The neutral.

99
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,640
 Yeah, he didn't disappear, practically,

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
 when the Nazis turned up.

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
 You know how, when you see a cloud from above,

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
 it looks a bit flat.

103
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,560
 So there's satellite, they've been talking really high up,

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,280
 shots from down up.

105
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,160
 Even when you're flying over in an aeroplane,

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,280
 it kind of looks bumpy-ish, but quite flat.

107
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,840
 Absolutely right, it does, doesn't it?

108
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
 And if you look from above, they're sort of these big disks

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
 of cloud, which you can kind of see they're lumpy beneath,

110
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,000
 and then they just top out, and it's really weird.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,520
 So the reason for that, I've been on this fantastic blog

112
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,240
 called cloudsandclimate.com.

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,040
 Can't recommend it enough.

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
 It's by a cloud scientist from Imperial College.

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,840
 They form in rising air, right, which is warmer.

116
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,000
 And as the air rises, it stays a bit warmer

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,840
 than the surrounding air.

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,320
 So you get this cloud forming.

119
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,760
 And then, at about 15 kilometers high,

120
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,040
 it hits the tropopause, okay?

121
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
 And that is a bit of the atmosphere

122
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
 where the temperature starts to increase again,

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,200
 so the cloud stops rising.

124
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
 So that's why these clouds are shaped like anvils.

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,360
 The tropopause is the bit where the height is limited.

126
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,640
 And it's why you get higher clouds over the equator,

127
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,240
 'cause the tropopause is higher over the equator.

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,920
 So that's why the very biggest thunder clouds

129
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
 happen near the equator,

130
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,360
 'cause they've just got more room to grow

131
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,680
 before the temperature naturally limits them again.

132
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
 - That's really interesting.

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,800
 - That makes a lot of sense,

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
 'cause it gets a bit warmer, doesn't it?

135
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,160
 So it's like a knife slicing the top off

136
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
 when you hit the tropopause.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
 - Exactly, exactly like that.

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
 - Nice.

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,480
 - I discovered, by the way, I'm very lucky to be alive

140
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,920
 because I do a thing that should have killed me long ago.

141
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,760
 And when I started researching this,

142
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,760
 I thought lightning was connected to Hector.

143
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,800
 But if I'm at home and if it's raining

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,160
 and it's a big storm outside,

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,400
 I often would like to have like a hot bath,

146
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
 like, you know, you're stuck inside.

147
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
 I do that a lot.

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,240
 - It turns out that's really dangerous over there.

149
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,720
 - I think it's not really dangerous.

150
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
 - It's not really dangerous?

151
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,760
 - I should have died, it is a stretch, isn't it?

152
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,880
 One of the things in your life

153
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
 should have killed you.

154
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,000
 - What a daredevil, Dan Trover.

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,440
 Another bath despite it being rainy outside.

156
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
 I just didn't know this was a possibility

157
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,440
 that basically the ground near your home,

158
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,080
 if it's hit by a lightning bolt,

159
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
 it can be a conductor to bring it through the pipes

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
 into your, yeah.

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
 - What?

162
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,440
 - I know, right, so there's examples.

163
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,640
 Okay, in November 2007, a bolt struck a teenager

164
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,880
 who was washing her hair at home in Blandford, England.

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,240
 It hit her wrist and it knocked the shower head

166
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
 out of her hand.

167
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,920
 2001, Josephine Martine of Deal, England

168
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,320
 was blown out of her bathtub by a lightning bolt.

169
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,160
 - No.

170
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,720
 - Yeah, the mother of three had been soaking

171
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
 in her bathtub during a thunderstorm,

172
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,400
 was catapulted naked through the air by a force of a bolt

173
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
 landing on the other side of the bathroom.

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,840
 - Good Lord.

175
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,160
 - Yeah.

176
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,000
 - Were they fine or did they?

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,760
 - Well, yeah, she survived 'cause there's a quote from her,

178
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,720
 so I think she's too.

179
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
 - Okay, yeah.

180
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
 Shout out to the quote, isn't it?

181
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,120
 (laughing)

182
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
 - Yeah.

183
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,800
 - Sorry, what, how does it hit?

184
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,640
 Sorry.

185
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
 - What pipes?

186
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,120
 - It hits your, what, the pipes that take water

187
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
 into your house?

188
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,880
 - Mine are all plastic.

189
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,960
 - Oh, well, you're okay then.

190
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,360
 But if you live in an old house.

191
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,520
 - Oh, you're sort of copper and white.

192
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,320
 - Weirdly, even though being in the bath

193
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,560
 in a lightning storm is a marginally,

194
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
 not one percent more dangerous

195
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,600
 than not being in the bath, do you know where the most?

196
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,560
 - I just stand outside with the golf club,

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
 holding it in the air and going,

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
 "Well, at least I'm not in the bath."

199
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,480
 Like, "Dangerous Dan."

200
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,520
 (laughing)

201
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,920
 - Do you know where the safest place to be

202
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,360
 is during a lightning storm?

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
 - Oh.

204
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,040
 - There are sort of lots of answers to this question.

205
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,280
 - Well, I'll say like, one thing you're often told

206
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
 is in your car because it has other wheels.

207
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,520
 - Yes, that's good.

208
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,200
 - Faraday cage sort of filament.

209
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,120
 - I'm gonna say under the earth, deep in earth.

210
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,640
 - You're thinking more along the right sort of scope

211
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,440
 that I was looking for rather than James's.

212
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,000
 - Right, practical.

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,920
 - Yeah, practical, this isn't practical.

214
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,640
 - Fort Knox or something like this, like a place,

215
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,800
 is it a particular place?

216
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,080
 - No, I'm gonna tell you, it's the sea.

217
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,680
 Lightning does not strike at the sea.

218
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,040
 - Well, I've seen lightning striking in the city.

219
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,760
 - It strikes, I think I've got a photo of it.

220
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,160
 - It strikes a 10th as often.

221
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
 I will backtrack slightly.

222
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,560
 (laughing)

223
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,400
 It strikes a 10th as often at sea as it does on land.

224
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,240
 It is very rare and which I think is really interesting.

225
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
 - What is a bath but a tiny sea?

226
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
 - Yeah.

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
 (laughing)

228
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
 - Here's the thing,

229
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,400
 if you're a bit scared of lightning like a lot of people are,

230
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,240
 but you think, well, if I can't see it, I'll be okay.

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,200
 You're not okay 'cause there's a thing called dark lightning.

232
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,960
 And this is a shock of energy

233
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,040
 that can carry a million times more energy

234
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,720
 than visible lightning.

235
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,300
 But if you get shocked, you might not even notice.

236
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,440
 - What?

237
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,880
 - It's so weird 'cause it's radiation,

238
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,920
 it's not electricity, it's radiation hitting you.

239
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,520
 It can give you a maximum safe lifetime dose

240
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,440
 of ionizing radiation in a single instant.

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,120
 So it might make you sick.

242
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
 - So it's gonna give you the amount

243
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,360
 that you'd need to have accumulated over your life.

244
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
 - Once, really.

246
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,280
 So you'll need to avoid all radiation for evermore.

247
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
 - Which is impossible, I'm afraid.

248
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
 - Don't go outside.

249
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
 - Don't eat bananas.

250
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,660
 - Don't go to Cornwall?

251
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,960
 - Don't go to Cornwall's a bit more radioactive, isn't it?

252
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,800
 - It is.

253
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
 - Yeah, but there's radiation everywhere.

254
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,040
 So you're more likely to get cancers and stuff like that.

255
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,880
 - Okay, right.

256
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,000
 The thing is, there's one dark lightning occurrence

257
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
 for every thousand flashes.

258
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,280
 We know 'cause of science,

259
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,320
 but we don't know whether people have been hit by it

260
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,320
 because there's no physical, you know, you can't feel it.

261
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
 - Can we counter it?

262
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
 Like if there's a lightning storm on the way,

263
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,440
 can I get my kids in some sort of anti-dark lightning suit

264
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
 that we all wear?

265
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,160
 Like a--

266
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,440
 - You can wear one of those hats with a little windmill on it

267
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
 and reindeer.

268
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,120
 - Dance kids already wear those.

269
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,960
 (all laughing)

270
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,320
 To protect against the heat and it's the whole thing.

271
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,120
 - You can all climb into a microwave.

272
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
 (all laughing)

273
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,120
 - 'Cause that doesn't let any radiation out, does it?

274
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,960
 - Oh, there we go.

275
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,040
 (all laughing)

276
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,800
 - That way, quick, into the microwave.

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,120
 - I already don't trust microwaves.

278
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
 I don't understand that.

279
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,640
 The whole thing where you can see the little holes

280
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,920
 and they're like, oh, the radioactive bits

281
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,200
 are just a bit bigger than the hole

282
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,760
 and can't get out, fuck off.

283
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,600
 What if they make a hole?

284
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,760
 - What are you talking about?

285
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,800
 So there's a mesh in a microwave,

286
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,160
 which is big enough that microwaves,

287
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,520
 because of the wavelength, can't get out.

288
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
 Often that's why no radiation leaks,

289
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800
 even though there was a massive conspiracy theory.

290
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,760
 And I think the seventies, which dad still believes.

291
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
 - Was that a conspiracy theory?

292
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,640
 - Oh, yeah.

293
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,480
 - Oh, wow.

294
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,840
 - But you came up with it independently.

295
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,080
 This is like convergent evolution or whatever.

296
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,720
 (all laughing)

297
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,080
 - You know, we've never talked about Colonel William Rankin,

298
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,280
 who do you guys know?

299
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
 - Chief Oliver.

300
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,680
 - We've never mentioned him.

301
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,520
 - What?

302
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,800
 - I don't know who that is, sorry.

303
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,840
 - So basically, no pilot has ever flown through

304
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,560
 cumulonimbus and succeeded,

305
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,480
 which I think is really interesting

306
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,440
 because they're a common cloud,

307
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,560
 but if you see one in a plane,

308
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,400
 you cannot get through it

309
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,000
 because they're so huge and so dangerous.

310
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,480
 And only one person until 2007, actually,

311
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
 is known to have fallen all the way through one and survived.

312
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,280
 And it is Lieutenant Colonel William Rankin.

313
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,760
 - But he didn't have a great time of it.

314
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,400
 - No, he wouldn't do it again.

315
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,360
 (all laughing)

316
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,000
 - One star review.

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,720
 The engine of his fighter jet failed in 1959.

318
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
 And so he jumped out of the plane

319
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,360
 and went through the cloud.

320
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,720
 And it's an insane situation to be in.

321
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,160
 He got frostbite immediately.

322
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
 I'll just split a second.

323
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,360
 Decompression meant that his eyes, ears,

324
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,400
 nose, and mouth started bleeding profusely.

325
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,960
 His abdomen swelled, he vomited.

326
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
 He's in the middle of a cloud

327
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,600
 getting buffeted around by the cloud.

328
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
 - Yeah, didn't he physically swell up?

329
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,200
 Like he's just like a balloon sort of getting blown up?

330
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
 - I think he did.

331
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,400
 It was amazing for those things

332
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,000
 that just looked so fluffy.

333
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
 - I know.

334
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,240
 - I mean, they look quite benign.

335
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
 - But also you can't,

336
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,800
 you don't just fall through that cloud.

337
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,640
 - Oh, okay.

338
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,480
 - It keeps you in it.

339
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,320
 It's like a washing machine.

340
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
 - Oh, 'cause of the correction.

341
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,000
 - Your injection, yeah.

342
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,840
 - Yeah.

343
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,160
 - Especially because the buffeting of the cloud

344
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,880
 flicked a switch on his parachute somehow

345
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
 and opened it prematurely.

346
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,720
 - No!

347
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
 - So he's stuck in his cloud.

348
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,560
 - Oh, wow.

349
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
 - He had to hold his breath to avoid drowning

350
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,080
 at repeated moments.

351
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,840
 Anyway, he was in there for 40 minutes.

352
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,160
 - Oh my God.

353
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,120
 - It's gone up and down and up and down.

354
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,960
 Awful.

355
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
 - And then he got out and he wrote a book about it.

356
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
 - And he survived.

357
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,280
 - Yeah.

358
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,120
 - James, do you remember?

359
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,600
 I think there was one other story of someone

360
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,520
 who might have got it.

361
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,280
 She was a paraglider and she got sucked up into it.

362
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,240
 - Yeah, cloud sucked.

363
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
 - Eva Visnierska.

364
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
 - Right.

365
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,480
 - She did get sucked up.

366
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,760
 And in fact, she was up there for three and a half hours.

367
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,600
 - Oh my God.

368
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,920
 (all laughing)

369
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,840
 Did we ever talk?

370
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,080
 I don't think we did about the Hunger Tonga explosion

371
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,000
 in the Pacific.

372
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 No.

373
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,320
 This was big news,

374
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,080
 but not as big as it should have been.

375
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,920
 - Basically.

376
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,760
 - Very recently.

377
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,000
 - Very recently, 2021.

378
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,680
 End of 2021.

379
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,480
 It's an underwater volcano, basically.

380
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,440
 And it went off and it blasted through

381
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,800
 150 meters of sea water, right?

382
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
 That's how far below the surface it is.

383
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,680
 It then sent a plume of ash 36 miles into the air.

384
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,520
 - Yeah, it's mental.

385
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,360
 - Wow.

386
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,880
 Five billion kilos of matter every second.

387
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
 Five billion kilos every second.

388
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,840
 - It's amazing, really.

389
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,320
 - I remember it happening and thinking,

390
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
 okay, that's, do you remember when that happened

391
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,640
 with Krakatoa?

392
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,780
 - Krakatoa, yeah.

393
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,480
 When Krakatoa went off, basically there was no summer

394
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
 for like three years, right?

395
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,240
 And I thought that was gonna happen with this one,

396
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,280
 but it just seems to have petered out a bit.

397
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,120
 - I know.

398
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
 - It was so bizarre.

399
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,280
 And then it produced the most intense lightning storm

400
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,640
 ever on the planet and higher than any lightning

401
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,480
 it had ever been.

402
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
 - Did it cause by the ash?

403
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,160
 That big ash cloud?

404
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
 - Yeah, this was 19 miles in the air.

405
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,520
 - Wow.

406
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,360
 - There was lightning going off.

407
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
 - What?

408
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,760
 - And over 11 hours of this particular storm,

409
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,320
 there were 192,000 flashes of lightning.

410
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,160
 Observe.

411
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
 - Crazy.

412
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,840
 - It's insane.

413
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,200
 - And you say this was over the sea, was it?

414
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,360
 (all laughing)

415
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
 - I'm afraid.

416
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,760
 I'm afraid it was.

417
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,960
 - Don't think so.

418
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,280
 (all laughing)

419
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,720
 I must have been a trigger for the light.

420
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
 (all laughing)

421
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,380
 (upbeat music)

422
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

423
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,960
 And that is Andy.

424
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,680
 - My fact is that during the Second World War,

425
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,040
 a Polish pilot was shot down over Southern England

426
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
 and he and his parachute landed in the grounds

427
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,960
 of a very respectable tennis club.

428
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,200
 He was immediately then signed in as a guest,

429
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,320
 offered a racket, lent some white flannels

430
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,280
 and thrashed his opponents until the RAF came to collect him.

431
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,720
 (all laughing)

432
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,680
 - Rankin would have been so jealous of his.

433
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,200
 (all laughing)

434
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
 This is possibly the best parachute landing

435
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,800
 anyone's ever made.

436
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,680
 Supposedly, I think it was a longstanding match

437
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,720
 and someone hadn't turned up.

438
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,700
 It was a doubles match.

439
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,540
 - Oh, I see.

440
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,380
 - Oh, perfect.

441
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,220
 (all laughing)

442
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,560
 That's amazing.

443
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,880
 Oh, no, there's only three of us.

444
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
 We can't play.

445
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,560
 Wait a minute.

446
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,320
 (all laughing)

447
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,280
 - This is so weird.

448
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,320
 I should say what this is from.

449
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,320
 This is from Anthony Beaver's book "The Second World War",

450
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,680
 which is so long and so good.

451
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,600
 It's amazing.

452
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
 - Oh, it's good though.

453
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,800
 There's only a couple of hundred pages in.

454
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,640
 I'm in the foothill.

455
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,960
 You're gonna be hearing a lot more facts.

456
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,040
 - I'm gonna say, when you're writing your review,

457
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,320
 start with so good.

458
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,760
 Robin, so long, so good.

459
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,840
 - I've been looking at it on my shelf

460
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,080
 for about nearly a year thinking I can never.

461
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,920
 And then I've just started.

462
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,480
 Anyway, it's great.

463
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,320
 It's really good.

464
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
 This is what I would say is the lighter facts in the book.

465
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,840
 It's pretty harrowing.

466
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
 - He goes heavy, Beaver.

467
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,120
 Well done.

468
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
 - I know.

469
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,760
 But this is a light bit of beef and it's great.

470
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,560
 Anyway, and this is all about the Polish pilots

471
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,800
 who fought with the RAF during the Second World War.

472
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,960
 Poland was invaded by Germany and the Soviet Union

473
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,200
 simultaneously right at the start.

474
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,720
 And yes, of course, you think it started 1930s

475
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,320
 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

476
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,920
 - I kind of think it started with the Treaty of Versailles.

477
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,360
 - I'm so glad we're having this chat.

478
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,600
 But the Polish armed forces were defeated

479
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,960
 pretty rapidly a few weeks

480
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,120
 and tens of thousands of soldiers of the pilot went

481
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,440
 to France, big mistake,

482
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,280
 because several months later,

483
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,320
 France was also overrun.

484
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,760
 And then so the Polish pilots hadn't been deployed enough.

485
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,080
 So they went to England.

486
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,240
 They were quite annoyed at this point.

487
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,360
 Quite, quite keen to get back in the fray.

488
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 - Like annoyed with the Nazis,

489
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,400
 not just generally annoyed, weren't they?

490
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,240
 - I think they're a bit annoyed with the Soviets as well.

491
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,080
 - Yeah.

492
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,400
 - And the Soviets, yep.

493
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
 - It was a time of justifiable annoyance

494
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,240
 was the hallmark of the, yeah.

495
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,720
 And just a large chunk of the RAF actually was Polish

496
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,160
 during the Battle of Britain.

497
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,920
 When they finally arrived in the UK

498
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,440
 and they were put up with the RAF,

499
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,760
 the RAF people thought these guys are going to be terrible.

500
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
 Why are we bringing them in?

501
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
 They've been defeated twice.

502
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,080
 They're not going to be any good.

503
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,560
 The language barrier didn't help

504
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
 because they obviously couldn't communicate

505
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,040
 if they're good by chatting to them.

506
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,080
 So they said about training them,

507
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,400
 but they did it almost in a slightly mocking sense.

508
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,000
 So in order to teach them their kind of patterns in the sky,

509
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,840
 they put them on tricycles and got them riding around.

510
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,480
 Meanwhile, the Polish guys are thinking, what is this?

511
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,920
 - Well, little tricycles, like little plastic.

512
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,400
 - Actual tricycles, they were heavily kitted out.

513
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,120
 So the tricycles had things like speedometers,

514
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,360
 compasses, radios.

515
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,640
 So they were very, very tooled up tricycles, but...

516
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,240
 - I think this was a standard way of training pilots.

517
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,360
 It wasn't just that they thought,

518
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,240
 oh, we'll just put the Polish people on here.

519
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,200
 - That was a good way. - Well, I think so.

520
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
 But the Polish pilots, though, it was ridiculous

521
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,200
 because they were already trained up in this way.

522
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,160
 - Yeah, right.

523
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,800
 - And they fought in a slightly different way,

524
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,560
 which is that they would get up much closer

525
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
 to enemy planes in dogfights,

526
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,240
 which made you more accurate, but was more dangerous.

527
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,440
 So my grandad was in the Squadron 307, I think it was.

528
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,520
 It was called the Eagle Owls

529
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,560
 'cause they were the only night fighter squadron

530
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,360
 of the Polish squadrons, but he flew Mosquitoes,

531
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,080
 which were the only wooden planes.

532
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,880
 And people thought they were mad as well at first.

533
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,720
 It was Haveland, was the guy who made them,

534
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,560
 and it was called the Wooden Wonder.

535
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,800
 At first, they thought, we can't do this.

536
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,200
 It'll just be so fragile.

537
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
 And it turned out to be brilliant.

538
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,480
 And the thing about them was they were completely unarmed.

539
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,680
 It's just carrying a bomb, but it's incredibly light

540
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,080
 because it's got no arms on it.

541
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,960
 And it just relies on the fact that 'cause it's very light,

542
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,280
 it can get away quickly, so they're very, very zippy.

543
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,600
 - Like a Mosquito, I suppose.

544
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,560
 - Like a Mosquito.

545
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
 They were painted blue to match the sky

546
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 'cause they were quite quiet as well, so you could--

547
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,080
 - Were they the ones, there was a plane,

548
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,400
 and they needed a lot of furniture joiners, basically,

549
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,040
 to make them, because they were made of wood.

550
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 And oh, wow, it was something like that.

551
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,360
 - I was at the Aerospace Museum in Bristol last weekend.

552
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,080
 And if you look at these old planes

553
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,680
 made out of canvas and wood and stuff,

554
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,640
 do you think how on earth does that stay out?

555
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,120
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary cool.

556
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,920
 - It looks nicer as well, though, than Mosquito,

557
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,960
 'cause it is made of wood,

558
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,800
 so I think everyone would have stopped to admire it.

559
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,360
 I got really confused reading an article

560
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,440
 which showed, actually, from his squadron,

561
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,920
 which showed a picture of one of the other people in it

562
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,400
 standing next to his plane and had four swastikas on it.

563
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,280
 And I couldn't, it took me ages to work out

564
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,200
 why there were four swastikas on it, do you know?

565
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,040
 - I do, actually.

566
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,560
 - Yeah, go on, yeah, I didn't know this.

567
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,320
 - Basically, it was an intimidation tactic,

568
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,040
 so you would put your kill list on the side of your plane.

569
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,960
 So as people were flying up beside you,

570
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,000
 they'd go, "Oh my God, he's killed six Nazis."

571
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,360
 - Oh, you put a swastika on every time you killed a Nazi?

572
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,880
 - Yeah, you'd paint on the outside body.

573
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
 - Those people who were doing riots,

574
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,880
 it's the UK last week, with swastikas on their body,

575
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,000
 had they all been attacking Nazis as well.

576
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,160
 - That's absolutely correct.

577
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,240
 - It wouldn't necessarily be just swastikas,

578
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,520
 it'd be skulls and so on, and there were different weights,

579
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
 so you would have a skull that was colored

580
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
 in a certain way that said, "That's a death."

581
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
 The next one might be, "I damaged the plane."

582
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,760
 It was like a whole sort of like,

583
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,640
 a bit of reading time for the enemy to catch up on.

584
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,880
 - They were very rarely flying alongside each other

585
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
 for that long, to be honest.

586
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,440
 - But it is a bit of a Wikipedia entry

587
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,760
 that you can see like, "Oh!"

588
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,920
 - And then they became famous as being really sort of brave

589
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,880
 and full of daring do, and that kind of stuff, didn't they?

590
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,920
 - I think they were the most important in the battle of Britain.

591
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,080
 A Polish squadron was the most important squadron

592
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,920
 down the West Coast.

593
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,840
 - And that's why if you drive out of London

594
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,640
 to the West these days on the A-40,

595
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,440
 you always see the Polish War Memorial,

596
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,680
 which is one of the roundabouts,

597
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,720
 which I've always seen and never really knew

598
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,760
 why Polish War Memorial and not all the other countries.

599
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,600
 - Who is that?

600
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,440
 I can't see that.

601
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
 - Haven't you, you'd know if you grew up in my family,

602
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,200
 'cause every time we passed it on the way out of London,

603
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,680
 my dad would go, "Oh, I forgot again."

604
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,360
 - Probably Polish the War Memorial.

605
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,760
 - Oh, Polish, I see.

606
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,840
 - Yeah, Polish War Memorial.

607
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
 - That was good.

608
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,920
 - Yeah, and it's all in capitals and stuff.

609
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,200
 Oh, that's a good joke if you're ever on the M-40.

610
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,280
 - That's a great M-40 joke.

611
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,320
 There's quite a few stories of these pilots

612
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,080
 who had to bail and landed in various places.

613
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,000
 So the tennis match is a great one.

614
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,520
 There was another pilot who,

615
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,760
 he landed in a South London back garden

616
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
 and there was a girl waiting out there as she landed.

617
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
 They got married two months later.

618
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
 So that was really good.

619
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,320
 - So she's like, "Oh, you know what?

620
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,600
 "It's a shame that I don't have someone to get my--"

621
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
 - Who's that?

622
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,120
 - Good men don't just fall out of the sky, honey.

623
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,440
 You'll be waiting there ages.

624
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
 There was a third guy who he landed

625
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,320
 and the people around him and the town

626
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,440
 thought that he was enemy,

627
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,720
 so they were going in to lynch him

628
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,960
 and as they were getting close to him,

629
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,200
 he just went, "Fuck off."

630
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,800
 And they went, "Oh, he's one of ours."

631
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,280
 - Like no German would know how to say, "Fuck off."

632
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,520
 (all laugh)

633
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,600
 - Tennis in war?

634
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,800
 - Yeah, okay.

635
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,760
 - Oh, wow. - Was this a tennis court?

636
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,600
 - Sure, yeah.

637
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,840
 - Well, you know Roland Garros?

638
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

639
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,520
 - So what's that?

640
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
 - It's where the French opens hell.

641
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,640
 - Yeah, right.

642
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
 Did you know Roland Garros was a man?

643
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,920
 He developed the first single seat fighter plane

644
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
 which was fitted with a machine gun.

645
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,760
 That was his thing.

646
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,000
 That's why they named the stadium after him

647
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,840
 'cause he was a war hero

648
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,280
 and they built the stadium in the '20s.

649
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,200
 - It's quite a weird leap

650
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
 as in to decide to name a tennis stadium

651
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,040
 after some months of that, but yeah.

652
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,880
 - It was a weird leap.

653
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,320
 And he was, but he was a sort of pioneering pilot.

654
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,920
 He was the first person to fly across the Mediterranean

655
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,080
 in about 1913, so very, very early stuff.

656
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,720
 The problem was guns were always behind the propeller.

657
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,560
 - Oh yeah. - And that was a big

658
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,400
 problem in the end. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
 - You shoot your propeller off, oh no.

660
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,560
 - So annoying. - So did he invent

661
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
 the rotation? - No, he did not invent

662
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,400
 the clever system which allows you to fire

663
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,960
 in between the propellers passing.

664
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,480
 - What a, imagine the genius

665
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,120
 who thought of that. - Well no, he just,

666
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,400
 he and his mechanic developed a similar system,

667
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,480
 but it was like a wedge which deflected

668
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
 the occasional rounds which did hit the propeller.

669
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
 - Oh, I see. - So it was very much

670
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,920
 a forge job, and then I think it was a German engineer

671
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,360
 who actually thought, no, you developed

672
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,160
 the system to fire between.

673
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,640
 - And can we just say before Dan says,

674
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,960
 what a genius who thought of that.

675
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,680
 I think a lot of people had thought of that before.

676
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,200
 That was like, first thing you think is,

677
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
 well, we should just get it to fire between them.

678
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
 I think it's actually putting that into action

679
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,760
 that proved difficult.

680
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,240
 - I clearly met the person who pulled it off.

681
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,820
 (all laughing)

682
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,680
 - Only thing, light bulb moment, guys.

683
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,520
 We should just fly to the moon.

684
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,160
 - Yeah, anyway, that was his,

685
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,640
 his innovation was sort of not quite

686
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,480
 working that out, basically.

687
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,040
 - But do you know he has a tennis connection?

688
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,880
 - Who? - Who?

689
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 - Roland Garros, there's this amazing story

690
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,920
 which happened on April the 1st, but was real.

691
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,320
 So he was this incredibly famous fly.

692
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 He went down over France, 1915,

693
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,560
 and he was flying this plane he designed,

694
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,160
 so he tried to burn it so the Germans

695
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,600
 didn't get hold of the technology,

696
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
 but failed, and they did.

697
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,560
 And he was in a German prison of war camp,

698
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,200
 and he sent these coded message back to France

699
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,520
 to arrange for the delivery of two tennis rackets.

700
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,440
 And within the tennis racket handles hollowed out,

701
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,640
 were in one handle a map of Germany,

702
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,280
 and in the other handle a felt hat

703
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,240
 to use as a disguise for escaping.

704
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,200
 (all laughing)

705
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,720
 - You're gonna look like a Frenchman

706
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,840
 if you're wearing a felt hat.

707
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,560
 - Yeah, that's where they went wrong.

708
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,720
 - You've got two tennis rackets handles worth of stuff.

709
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
 I guess a map is a good thing to pick.

710
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,560
 - A map is a good one.

711
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,680
 - Yeah, I think a felt hat feels like

712
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,000
 a needless waste of a racket.

713
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,960
 (all laughing)

714
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,360
 - What would you put in it, Andy?

715
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,280
 A sausage?

716
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,000
 (all laughing)

717
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,560
 Everyone's gonna believe you're a German

718
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,760
 if you're waving a sausage around.

719
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,600
 - That's it.

720
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,440
 - And it's just the right shape.

721
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,560
 - Yeah, just a giant pepper army.

722
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,200
 - Yeah, not thin sausage, but yeah.

723
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,640
 - Absolutely, yeah.

724
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,000
 - Well, no, it didn't, went with a felt hat.

725
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,280
 And actually, I don't think he used it.

726
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,560
 He ended up making his own costume

727
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,120
 to mimic the guard's costumes

728
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,080
 and then walked out dressed as a guard.

729
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,920
 - What a legend.

730
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,240
 - Yeah. - That's great.

731
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,880
 - Speaking of clothing and tennis,

732
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,360
 this is not about war,

733
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,160
 but it's a story that I really like.

734
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,720
 Pat Stewart, who was a tennis player in the '60s,

735
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,240
 she was single and she was playing at Wimbledon

736
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,680
 and she wanted a boyfriend.

737
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,800
 And so she embroidered her phone number on her knickers.

738
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,040
 And the hope was that the paparazzi

739
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,240
 would take photos of it

740
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,160
 and then someone would give her a call.

741
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,520
 - And?

742
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,800
 - It seems like no one did.

743
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,120
 - Oh.

744
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,840
 - Although she did a few months later meet

745
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,280
 and marry a cricketer called John Edric,

746
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,440
 but they did divorce a few months later.

747
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,960
 But it's quite a nice way to advertise yourself, isn't it?

748
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,120
 It's quite forward.

749
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,360
 - Yeah, it's not everyone's type.

750
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,720
 - I would almost be a bit intimidated

751
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,360
 by someone that confident in themselves.

752
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,760
 - And I think a lot of the Wimbledon audience

753
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,280
 might feel the same way.

754
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,160
 I think maybe she hasn't chosen her audience.

755
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
 - I just do, right?

756
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,920
 Actually, I've got to put on a telegram.

757
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,200
 - Have you heard of Hans Reddle?

758
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,240
 I'm looking at you especially,

759
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
 James and Anna, sports people.

760
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,840
 - No, I don't think so.

761
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,280
 - Well, of course he got to the fourth round

762
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,520
 of the men's singles in Wimbledon in 1947.

763
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,360
 So I'm surprised you haven't heard that.

764
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,040
 - Oh, Hans Reddle.

765
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,760
 (laughing)

766
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,600
 - No, Reddle.

767
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,800
 (laughing)

768
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,280
 Sorry, different name.

769
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,240
 But it's quite impressive for a particular reason,

770
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,080
 which is that he had one arm.

771
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,600
 And he had lost his other arm in the Battle of Stalingrad.

772
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,440
 - Really?

773
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,360
 - He seemed to be fighting, I presume,

774
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,040
 in the German army, he was Austrian.

775
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,160
 And he was given special dispensation

776
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,240
 to touch the ball twice every time.

777
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480
 - Come on.

778
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,320
 - Oh, sorry.

779
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,160
 - I'm watching you touch the ball.

780
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,800
 - Every time he served.

781
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,760
 So he would toss the ball into the air with his racket.

782
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 - Oh, then serve.

783
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,120
 - 'Cause otherwise, it does make it quite a lot easier.

784
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,560
 (laughing)

785
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,140
 (upbeat music)

786
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

787
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,440
 and that is James.

788
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that things named

789
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,240
 after May West include a soda bottle,

790
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,080
 a gas pump, a parachute malfunction,

791
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,960
 and a graph that explains the nuclear fission of uranium.

792
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,360
 (laughing)

793
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,280
 - What a lady.

794
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,120
 - What's that?

795
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,960
 (laughing)

796
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,800
 - A parachute.

797
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,640
 - She didn't invent all these things.

798
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,160
 She came up with the idea, of course,

799
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,400
 but she didn't actually.

800
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,280
 - I know what you're gonna say.

801
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,000
 It's not an item that is designed to be a malfunction.

802
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,800
 A parachute malfunction is interesting.

803
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,160
 - Did you take this off my parachute actually?

804
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
 (laughing)

805
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,240
 - The parachute one is basically,

806
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,480
 it makes your canopy stick out in quite a suggestive way.

807
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
 And most of these, if not all of them,

808
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,120
 I'd use the fact that May West was famous

809
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,800
 for an hourglass figure.

810
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,640
 - Oh, really?

811
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,680
 I thought the gas pump would be,

812
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,560
 'cause she was like pump, pump, pump, pumping away.

813
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,400
 - Oh.

814
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,240
 (laughing)

815
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,480
 - In the bedroom?

816
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,000
 - No, as in working hard in the industry.

817
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,840
 - Oh, right.

818
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,960
 - No, it was because it has like a slim waist kind of thing.

819
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,440
 - I see.

820
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,560
 - And the graph of the products of nuclear fission

821
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,280
 of uranium is basically two sort of normal distribution curves.

822
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,520
 So it's like a pair of boobs.

823
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,400
 - Oh, okay.

824
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,680
 She was actually quite a sort of slim,

825
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
 straight up and down lady.

826
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,800
 She wasn't actually a sort of Jessica Rabbit style.

827
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,160
 - She wasn't Jessica Rabbit style

828
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,200
 because that is just impossible.

829
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
 - 'Cause it's cartoon.

830
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,320
 - Cartoon, yeah, okay.

831
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,840
 - But, yeah, I mean, yeah.

832
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,560
 - I haven't studied her, actually,

833
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,040
 I can picture her face, but I haven't studied her body.

834
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,160
 I just assumed she had that.

835
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,000
 It was that all over the place.

836
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,820
 - Well, I read that.

837
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,660
 I'd like to clarify,

838
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,880
 I haven't been studying pictures of Maywest.

839
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,160
 I just, I'm, yeah, I would say she was--

840
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,000
 - She was curvaceous.

841
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,840
 - She was curvaceous.

842
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,680
 - Oh, okay.

843
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,520
 - And she had the thin waist.

844
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,360
 - Okay.

845
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,920
 - In actual fact, I believe the word curvaceous

846
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,640
 was coined specifically for her.

847
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
 - No.

848
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,320
 - Pretty interesting.

849
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
 - Yeah, if you look in the OED,

850
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,160
 basically all of the first few citations are about her.

851
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,960
 And the earliest one says,

852
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,400
 "A new word has been coined to fit the personality

853
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,440
 "of Maywest.

854
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,880
 "The word curvaceous is a combination of curves

855
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,200
 "and vivacious to have Miss West's chief characteristic."

856
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,320
 - That's incredible.

857
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,560
 That's so good.

858
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,040
 I had no idea that's where the word came from.

859
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,880
 That's brilliant.

860
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,480
 - Yes, 'cause we don't assume the vivacious bit.

861
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,600
 You can't just have big boobs and big hips.

862
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,480
 You've got to have the character to go with it.

863
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,320
 - Yeah.

864
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,160
 - Correct.

865
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,980
 - Is that a lesson for you ladies,

866
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,820
 an anti-feminist lesson?

867
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,280
 (all laughing)

868
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,560
 - Yeah, when I say that to women on the tube.

869
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,640
 (all laughing)

870
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,000
 - There's no point just having big boobs.

871
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,720
 I weren't your personality.

872
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,760
 I'm just asking you for your tickets, sir.

873
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,560
 (all laughing)

874
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,400
 - Okay.

875
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,440
 I mean, so there was another thing named after her

876
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,280
 in the, actually, Sakamawbo,

877
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,240
 some twin turreted combat tanks.

878
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,080
 - Yes.

879
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,920
 - Yes, reasons.

880
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
 - Yes.

881
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,760
 - A live jacket,

882
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,280
 which makes you look like you've got big boobs.

883
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,120
 - Yeah.

884
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,160
 - The grip she had on the 20th century.

885
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,200
 We should step back and say who she is,

886
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,280
 because she was a great comedian of her time.

887
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,880
 And her time would have been the 1930s and so on.

888
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,120
 She was in movies, she wrote novels, she wrote plays.

889
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,960
 She has so many one-liners

890
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,520
 and they were the kind of lines that you just saw.

891
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,680
 You wouldn't get away with that at the time.

892
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,800
 - I used to be snow white, but I drifted.

893
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,520
 All of that stuff.

894
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,580
 - Without the noise.

895
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,420
 - No, with the noise.

896
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,260
 - With the noise.

897
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,080
 - That's the way that we're coming back

898
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,440
 to your comedy noise again, which we mentioned last week.

899
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,680
 - Can you do when I'm good, I'm good,

900
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,520
 but when I'm bad, I'm better.

901
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
 - When I'm good, I'm very, very good.

902
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,560
 But when I'm bad, I'm better.

903
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,840
 - Ooh, whacka, whacka, whacka, whacka.

904
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,680
 - Very whacka.

905
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,500
 Is that a guy in your pocket?

906
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,800
 I think that was her.

907
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,480
 - She did say that in a film in the end,

908
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,040
 but I don't think it was the first instance.

909
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,960
 She said it in the film weirdly in the seventh,

910
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,800
 like the last film she did

911
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,880
 or one of the last films she did.

912
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,440
 - Oh yeah, yeah, she did a film at the edge of about 80,

913
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,640
 but she was described in her obituary as a sex personality.

914
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,160
 It was a big part of her character and her persona.

915
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,040
 - Yeah, I think it's really weird that if you think of people

916
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,440
 who push the boundaries of comedy,

917
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,680
 Lenny Bruce will be someone,

918
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,040
 we've spoken about him on the show before,

919
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,240
 who was jailed because he was saying words

920
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,560
 that you weren't allowed to say on stage concepts.

921
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,880
 That's what Mae West was doing.

922
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,440
 And she was in fact jailed for, meant to be 10 days.

923
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,960
 In the end, it was eight days

924
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,600
 'cause she got off a good behavior.

925
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,400
 - One wonders what that good behavior was.

926
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,360
 - Oh yeah, I got off a good behavior, I know I got off.

927
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
 - Someone else got off as well.

928
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,280
 - But yeah, she wrote a Broadway play in 1926 called Sex.

929
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,680
 And the production was taken up by the city officials

930
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,720
 as offensive.

931
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
 They said, "You're gonna go to jail or pay a fine."

932
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,080
 And she said, "Put me in jail."

933
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,920
 'Cause she thought the publicity would be great.

934
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,080
 But she also meant it.

935
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,800
 She was like, "I should be saying this on stage.

936
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,640
 This is fine."

937
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,480
 She doesn't get the credit.

938
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,800
 - I read something really interesting about sex, the play.

939
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,240
 I thought it was banned because it itself was so lurid

940
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,480
 and so sexy and too pornographic,

941
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,280
 but it had been on for about a year in New York

942
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,520
 before they stormed in and banned it, been on for a while.

943
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,200
 But the thing that had happened was

944
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,400
 she'd written another play called Drag.

945
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,080
 And that was showing somewhere else, I think in Connecticut.

946
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,120
 And that was all about homosexuality.

947
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,080
 You know, it's called Drag.

948
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,840
 It ends in this huge, big drag show.

949
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,080
 It's about lots of gay relationships happening.

950
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,840
 The lead character is a guy who's in the closet.

951
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,560
 And I believe that the authorities in New York

952
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
 couldn't clamp down on that

953
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,440
 because it was outside their jurisdiction,

954
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
 but they really didn't want to get into New York.

955
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,160
 So they then clamped down on sex.

956
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,880
 - And the New York Times called it a crude

957
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,680
 and inept play, cheaply produced and polyactive.

958
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,720
 - Is that a sex or drag?

959
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,560
 - That was sex.

960
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,640
 - But of course, because it was being banned,

961
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
 everyone wanted to see it.

962
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,240
 And it became really, really popular.

963
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,720
 Another thing was that it had African-American music in it.

964
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,080
 And that was seen as hot jazz.

965
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,920
 That was the other thing.

966
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,520
 You know, it features lots of sexy stuff.

967
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,000
 There is prostitution, there are pimps,

968
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,880
 there are corrupt cops who are not in themselves sexy,

969
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,720
 I suppose.

970
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,800
 (all laughing)

971
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
 It sounds pretty sexy.

972
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,640
 Sorry.

973
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,760
 I'm showing my predilections there.

974
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,000
 Anyway, but the point was that her character,

975
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,360
 because she played a lady of the night

976
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,280
 and she really doesn't have anything to apologise for.

977
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,840
 And she played a woman who thinks

978
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,080
 she has nothing to apologise for.

979
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,000
 And you were allowed to show grime and semeness

980
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,840
 as long as everyone repents hard at the end.

981
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,800
 And she didn't, you know.

982
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,200
 So I think that was another part of the moral objection to it.

983
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,080
 - Yeah, literally people must have been just on the floor

984
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
 with shop, she was doing all this

985
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,960
 and sticking out for every minority there was

986
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,080
 because she considered herself kind of among them.

987
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,640
 She'd come from the society's underbelly really,

988
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,480
 hadn't she?

989
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,840
 Her dad was a street fighter, I think.

990
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,680
 - Yeah, he was.

991
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,640
 He was a boxer, yeah.

992
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,200
 - Who was, although he went on to be a masseuse, weirdly.

993
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,040
 - That's interesting.

994
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,880
 Did he keep the gloves on?

995
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,720
 Do you reckon?

996
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,560
 (all laughing)

997
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,280
 - Just like your predilection to get there.

998
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,000
 (all laughing)

999
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,200
 - People asked for it, I think he'd go for it.

1000
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,040
 - That makes sense.

1001
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,880
 You can't box anymore,

1002
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,480
 but you've been in the industry

1003
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,120
 where they don't have lots of masseuses.

1004
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,320
 - Let me pound you in the ring.

1005
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,160
 That kind of stuff.

1006
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,400
 (all laughing)

1007
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,160
 - Okay, he also became a special policeman,

1008
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,200
 which I'm not quite sure what that means,

1009
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,440
 but it sounds like he might also be up your street, Andy.

1010
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,280
 (all laughing)

1011
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,080
 - Another sexy is a corrupt one, but yeah.

1012
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,360
 That's a dirty cough, no doubt, yeah.

1013
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,240
 - Can I just say back to sex, just on that?

1014
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,040
 So the group that was campaigning against the play sex

1015
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,280
 was called the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.

1016
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,360
 And they were founded by the world's greatest prude,

1017
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,360
 called Anthony Cornstock, a self-given nickname, I think.

1018
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,840
 And he had been inspired by the death of a friend

1019
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,600
 who'd become addicted to pornography

1020
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,560
 and masturbated himself to death.

1021
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,400
 - No.

1022
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
 - Or so he thought.

1023
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,960
 - Sad on the gravestone.

1024
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,960
 (all laughing)

1025
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,280
 - Yeah, so he thought that that's what had happened.

1026
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,280
 And he decided to start the society for prudery.

1027
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,120
 And it was these guys who stopped sex.

1028
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,920
 - I didn't know, I didn't know that.

1029
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,160
 That's incredible. - I've heard the name

1030
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,480
 Cornstock. - You'll know the Cornstock law,

1031
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,840
 I think, which was an American thing

1032
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,160
 which stopped you from having any obscene material,

1033
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,600
 but it stopped you from sending anything

1034
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,920
 through the post as well.

1035
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,240
 And what that meant was you couldn't send

1036
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,600
 any contraception leaflets or anything like that.

1037
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,840
 So it's part of that whole song.

1038
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,640
 - Cornstock was a nickname, did you say?

1039
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,760
 - No, that was his surname.

1040
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,480
 His nickname was the world's greatest prude.

1041
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,160
 - Oh, okay, when you said Cornstock,

1042
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,480
 I was like, oh, that's a weird nickname.

1043
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
 (all laughing)

1044
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
 But also, it just made me think

1045
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,800
 when you said the masturbation thing.

1046
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
 I thought, oh, Cornstock, is that?

1047
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,600
 'Cause Cornflakes was an anti-masturbation thing.

1048
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,320
 Was it all about corn? - Your mind is incredible, Deb.

1049
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,520
 All the effort that you put

1050
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,800
 into making these unbelievably great connections

1051
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,240
 wouldn't be necessary if you just listened a bit more.

1052
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,320
 (all laughing)

1053
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,280
 - It's really amazing. - It's the shittest Colombo.

1054
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,320
 (all laughing)

1055
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,560
 - That's so embarrassing about his friend as well.

1056
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,880
 - I know. - He keeps going around saying,

1057
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
 "This is in honor of my friend."

1058
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,840
 "Wrightfully, dive masturbating."

1059
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,720
 - Yeah, it feels like he didn't really like that guy, didn't it?

1060
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,600
 - No, he was just having a bath

1061
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,720
 and he got hit by lightning.

1062
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,560
 (all laughing)

1063
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,640
 - Mae West loved having an enema.

1064
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,440
 So when she was in her vaudeville days

1065
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,960
 and she used to go to the bathrooms,

1066
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,040
 she was saying this, like, filthy, I'd never using these.

1067
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,720
 And so she used to give herself a daily enema

1068
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,280
 so that she didn't have to deal with them.

1069
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,040
 And that became part of her,

1070
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,480
 if you were doing a movie with her.

1071
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,440
 So Tony Curtis talks about this.

1072
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,000
 He says on the last film that she did,

1073
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,720
 "Sex Tet," which he was in,

1074
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,760
 he said that she would get her makeup done

1075
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,240
 and then always, 11 a.m. approximately in the morning,

1076
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,000
 she would then have the final bit of getting ready,

1077
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,320
 which was to have her enema,

1078
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,680
 and then she was ready for the set.

1079
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
 - And then she said,

1080
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,120
 "I keep my friends close, but my enemas closer."

1081
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,800
 - Nice. - Whack-a-whack-a-whack.

1082
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,920
 - She did a really strong line in objectifying men,

1083
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
 which I think we approve of,

1084
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,960
 'cause obviously women were used to being objectified

1085
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,360
 for thousands of years.

1086
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,160
 After her sort of Hollywood career,

1087
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,120
 she set up a vagus review of sort of

1088
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,440
 these bulging, beefy muscle men

1089
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,320
 so that women could come and look at them.

1090
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,400
 'Cause she said, you know,

1091
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,360
 "Men have always had something to look at,

1092
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,920
 "now it's time for the wives to have something."

1093
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,000
 - I think it's basically magic Mike

1094
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,680
 that she sort of invented.

1095
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,520
 I know there were muscle shows before that.

1096
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,880
 It's like "Mr. Universe" and stuff that Charles Atlas was in.

1097
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
 - Charles Atlas and Eugene Sandoval.

1098
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
 So there were muscle men before,

1099
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,000
 but I think she kind of turned it into a show.

1100
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,400
 - She turned it into more of a sexy thing.

1101
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,080
 - Coca-Cola bottles used to be called

1102
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,720
 Maywest bottles as well, by the way.

1103
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,560
 - So the first thing in my fact was soda bottles

1104
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,800
 are named after her, and that was what I'm talking about.

1105
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,520
 - Yeah, and I thought, 'cause it said

1106
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,400
 that it was inspired by her, and that's not true.

1107
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,440
 That just sort of got around.

1108
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,600
 But on Coca-Cola's website, they describe it.

1109
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,160
 These used to be called Maywest.

1110
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,520
 So they were designed to look a bit like coca beans,

1111
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
 and then they decided that they needed to be more curvy

1112
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,320
 because they kept rolling off the conveyor belts.

1113
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,680
 So remember we talked about conveyor belts last week,

1114
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,640
 and so they kept rolling off the conveyor belts,

1115
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,480
 and so they changed the shape very slightly

1116
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,160
 so that they rolled over an axis and went straight

1117
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,320
 rather than kind of rolling off to the left or the right.

1118
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,840
 So that's why the modern Coca-Cola bottle looks like it is.

1119
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,560
 - That's great, practical.

1120
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,520
 - She came to the UK once with a play.

1121
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,880
 It was actually in 1947, which is the year that that guy,

1122
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,520
 Reddle, got to the fourth round of the men's singles

1123
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,880
 at Wimbledon with one arm.

1124
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,720
 - Wow, what were the chances?

1125
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,800
 - That's not why she was here.

1126
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,240
 She arrived, and for her first press conference,

1127
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,360
 she arrived, she said, "I want every man in England

1128
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,520
 "to come up and see me."

1129
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
 Especially this big Ben character I hear about.

1130
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,320
 Brilliant. - Great, nice.

1131
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,000
 - Anyway, when she was here, she did her play, obviously,

1132
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,800
 but she also went to a boxing match.

1133
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,680
 She went to the Dunlop factory,

1134
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,040
 where she signed an inflatable life jacket.

1135
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,720
 - Yeah. - And I love this.

1136
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,000
 She went to the opening

1137
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,160
 of the British philatelic exhibition in Glasgow.

1138
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,600
 There was a stamp exhibition on, and she was there.

1139
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,040
 - I think that she confused the word philately with philatio.

1140
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,920
 - I mean, that's what happened, yeah.

1141
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,000
 - Philately will get you nowhere, boys.

1142
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,320
 (laughing)

1143
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,900
 (upbeat music)

1144
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,160
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1145
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,840
 and that is my fact.

1146
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,320
 My fact this week is that in 2013,

1147
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,500
 a survey revealed that 97% of students

1148
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,760
 studying Finnish at Vienna University

1149
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,200
 were mainly doing so because of their love

1150
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,720
 for the country's death metal bands.

1151
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
 And most of them, by the way, sing in English,

1152
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,040
 so there's no real point in doing that.

1153
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,840
 But yeah, death metal from Finland is responsible

1154
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,400
 as the main reason for all these students

1155
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,880
 studying the language. - I can see that, yeah.

1156
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,160
 - In a way. - Yeah.

1157
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,520
 - Can you? - I can actually.

1158
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,120
 - I find the lyrics in metal music

1159
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,320
 quite difficult to make out, and I don't know.

1160
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,840
 And I speak the language of English,

1161
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,800
 which is the language I hear a lot of death metal in.

1162
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
 - That's true. - Yeah, well,

1163
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,560
 yeah, what's interesting as well is that

1164
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,360
 I had to listen to a bunch of the bands that were cited.

1165
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,400
 Children of Bodham is a massive band,

1166
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,240
 and I listened to some of their songs,

1167
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,440
 it's very clear what they're saying.

1168
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,600
 - For listeners, that wasn't very clear what you said,

1169
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,640
 it's Bodham, not Bottom, isn't it?

1170
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,240
 - Oh, I said Bodham. - I know you did.

1171
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,400
 - Oh, right. - But it does sound

1172
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,680
 a bit like Children of Bodham.

1173
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,000
 - Maybe that's what they're going for.

1174
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,200
 Little bum joke?

1175
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
 - Little bum bum joke?

1176
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,320
 - The maywests of modern Finland.

1177
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,600
 (all laughing)

1178
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,600
 Yeah, Stradivarius is another band, and him,

1179
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,880
 and yeah, they all sing in English,

1180
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,480
 and I listen to them, and yeah, it's quite clear.

1181
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,320
 It is quite clear. - Oh, is it?

1182
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,400
 - Yeah, yeah. - That's all they're saying.

1183
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,600
 - Yeah, I would say so.

1184
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,120
 Finland does seem to have a unique affinity

1185
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,640
 for heavy metal, though.

1186
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,240
 - Yeah, it really does. - Yeah.

1187
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,160
 The figures wobble around a bit,

1188
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,640
 but one recent tish figure was that there are

1189
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,880
 53 and a half metal bands per 100,000 people in Finland,

1190
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,720
 and that is, that's a lot.

1191
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,000
 The UK has about five metal bands per 100,000 people,

1192
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,840
 so Finland--

1193
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,560
 - It still feels like a lot to me.

1194
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,400
 - Yes. - Enough.

1195
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,120
 It feels like too many to me.

1196
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,680
 - No, you're right, five per 100,000 people.

1197
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,800
 - If I think about the population of what,

1198
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,160
 I don't know, Bolton must be about 200,000,

1199
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,440
 so that means we've got 10 metal bands in Bolton.

1200
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
 It feels like a lot.

1201
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,160
 - Yeah. - Does it?

1202
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,120
 I mean, there could be real amateur

1203
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,720
 just doing an open mic night.

1204
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,200
 We're not talking charting bands necessarily, I don't--

1205
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,040
 - Maybe, I think you're right.

1206
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,160
 - They work in Tesco on the weekdays.

1207
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,760
 - There's a town called Lemmy in Finland,

1208
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
 which has 3,000 people in this.

1209
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,040
 It's called Lemmy.

1210
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,880
 - What?

1211
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,700
 - What?

1212
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,540
 - After the guy from the town.

1213
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,120
 - Yeah, no, great point.

1214
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,400
 It's spelled a bit differently, but it is called Lemmy.

1215
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,880
 Anyway, they've got 3,000 people

1216
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,400
 and they have 13 metal bands.

1217
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,160
 That really is the, that's the metal center of the universe.

1218
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,520
 That is the core, you know.

1219
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,640
 - Amazing, it's called Lemmy.

1220
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,600
 - Yeah.

1221
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,960
 - They have a church of heavy metal,

1222
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,200
 and there's a guy who does metal mass,

1223
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,200
 so this very cool pastor who looks like a heavy metal fan,

1224
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,920
 but then he's a Lutheran pastor,

1225
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,560
 and he puts on the correct robes,

1226
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,880
 and he started in 2006 just adapting traditional hymns,

1227
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,600
 so he keeps the lyrics the same, you know,

1228
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,440
 the creed and the color around it,

1229
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,440
 but turns them into heavy metal soil.

1230
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
 - Oh, thanks, bride, I'm beautiful.

1231
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,280
 - Exactly.

1232
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,120
 - That's great.

1233
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,960
 - That's really good.

1234
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,400
 - It sounds really cool, it's really popular.

1235
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
 - Heavy Sorus, another cool one.

1236
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,520
 They're a Finnish heavy metal band

1237
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,760
 where they're all dressed as dido-saws

1238
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,840
 and the songs are for children.

1239
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,680
 - Oh.

1240
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,000
 (laughing)

1241
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,080
 - Their album, (speaks in foreign language)

1242
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,560
 which means "Night of the Dinosaurs"

1243
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,680
 was the second most popular album in Finland in 2010.

1244
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,520
 - Wow.

1245
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,360
 - Nice.

1246
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
 - And their members include Millie Pilly,

1247
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,520
 Confymompi, Riffy Raffy, and Muffy Puffy.

1248
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,440
 (laughing)

1249
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,240
 And according to their website,

1250
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,600
 they were in eggs in the Cretaceous period,

1251
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,000
 but they somehow fossilized,

1252
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,240
 and then came out of the eggs and survived,

1253
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,640
 and then started a rock group.

1254
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,480
 - That's quite cool.

1255
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,320
 - That's very cool.

1256
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,600
 - Although someone has pointed out

1257
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,360
 that Muffy Puffy is a stegosaurus,

1258
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,520
 and Confymompi is an apatosaurus

1259
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,280
 who lived in the Jurassic period in that Cretaceous.

1260
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
 - Got to do your research

1261
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,280
 instead of your dinosaur marathon.

1262
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,120
 - Yeah.

1263
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,960
 - Muffy Puffy.

1264
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,240
 - Lordy's from there as well.

1265
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,080
 - Yeah, Lordy.

1266
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,480
 - The Eurovision Song Contest winner.

1267
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,120
 He calls himself Mr. Lordy,

1268
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,880
 and he started the band when he met the other members

1269
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,080
 while he was running a Finnish kiss cruise

1270
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,040
 because he was the president of Kiss Army Finland.

1271
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,960
 He sounds incredible, Mr. Lordy,

1272
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,480
 as in I think he's basically

1273
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,160
 one of the great geeks of our world.

1274
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,120
 He's a comic book illustrator,

1275
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,280
 he's a graphic designer,

1276
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,360
 he's a special effects makeup artist.

1277
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,800
 - Like, I think if you look at metal music,

1278
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,200
 it's obviously not true of everyone,

1279
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,400
 but I think there is a crossover of nerdyness

1280
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,240
 for people who like metal.

1281
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,080
 - Oh, God, yeah.

1282
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,760
 - Well, Corey Taylor, when he came in for the 100th episode,

1283
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,640
 arrived in a doctor who, or a Sherlock T-shirt.

1284
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,480
 - Yeah, there's another man of misfit, I guess,

1285
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,320
 being into metal.

1286
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,840
 It's not mainstream, except in Finland,

1287
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,120
 where it basically has crossed over into it,

1288
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,000
 but I think it's if you don't fit into the mainstream,

1289
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,960
 you go for it.

1290
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,320
 And they also are famous in QI circles

1291
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,560
 for hosting the first ever

1292
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,440
 heavy metal knitting world championships.

1293
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,800
 - Oh, yes.

1294
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,880
 - They do do that.

1295
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,520
 - It is a bit stupid, that, isn't it?

1296
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,360
 - Hey.

1297
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,960
 - What's, um, what is it?

1298
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,880
 - It's just literally doing heavy metal and knitting.

1299
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,040
 There doesn't seem to be-

1300
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,160
 - There's no extra bit.

1301
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,000
 - No.

1302
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,080
 - But is it like chess boxing where you do one minute

1303
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,200
 of one and then one minute of the other?

1304
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,280
 - No, you do them simultaneously.

1305
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,960
 But they are judged and they're actually judged

1306
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,600
 on quite interesting criteria.

1307
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,000
 - Sorry, how can you do them simultaneously?

1308
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,400
 - So, at least one member of your band

1309
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,640
 has to be knitting something at the same time

1310
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,000
 as performing and you are judged on various things,

1311
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,560
 but partly on the piece of knitting

1312
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,520
 that you produce by the end of your set.

1313
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,600
 - Everyone I know who knits, they're like,

1314
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,200
 oh, look at this scarf.

1315
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,680
 I've been working on it for four months.

1316
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,640
 What have we, are they coming in with the final,

1317
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,280
 like, one day of knitting that's needed

1318
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,840
 for the scarf or are they starting?

1319
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,400
 - That's such, it's quite small,

1320
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
 but they also do seem to go quite fast

1321
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,840
 in the ones I saw.

1322
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,240
 Maybe there was some clever video editing.

1323
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,160
 - That's the tempo of heavy metal, isn't it?

1324
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,880
 It probably does encourage speed.

1325
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,200
 - Yes, you have to do it in time with the songs, of course.

1326
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,600
 You want to judge for that, so.

1327
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,240
 - Can I ask, do people ever do the knitting

1328
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,080
 with their own bodies?

1329
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,280
 And what I mean by that, sorry, what I mean is,

1330
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,480
 do people ever get a maypole in the middle of the stage

1331
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,280
 and then they've all got a ribbon

1332
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,760
 and they move around the stage while they play?

1333
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,960
 - That's not really knitting, so much as crocheting.

1334
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,240
 (laughing)

1335
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,920
 - Because I watched "The Wicked Man" recently

1336
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,120
 for the first time, there's a great maypole scene in that.

1337
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,440
 And that's sort of, "The Wicked Man"

1338
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,040
 bleeds into that world, doesn't it?

1339
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,960
 - It's more platting, I think.

1340
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,600
 - 'Cause it does feel like, for all the men in metal,

1341
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,200
 usually have large, gigantic beards, low hanging.

1342
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,520
 That's what should be being knitted while they're doing.

1343
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,080
 Someone should be working up.

1344
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,920
 (laughing)

1345
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,520
 - They probably accidentally catch someone's beard

1346
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,240
 sometimes and knit it into their jumper.

1347
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,040
 - Sorry, baseball, you're part of it now.

1348
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,720
 You can never take the jumper off.

1349
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,120
 - I look forward to Andy's Morris dancing

1350
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,760
 platting competition.

1351
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,000
 (laughing)

1352
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,920
 In 2019, Metallica played a gig in Finland,

1353
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,040
 which was attended by 1% of everyone in the country.

1354
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,840
 - Ooh, I remember that happening in Iceland as well,

1355
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,280
 I think, like it was an enormous percentage.

1356
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,520
 - That's very cool.

1357
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,400
 'Cause there are five and a half million Finns

1358
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,080
 and they had 55,000 in the audience for that gig.

1359
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,200
 So the numbers do stack up.

1360
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
 - Yeah, well done, Metallica.

1361
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,040
 - Do you wanna play a game of Finnish metal band

1362
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,200
 or game of thrones episode?

1363
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,040
 - Yes.

1364
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,400
 - Ah, okay, of course.

1365
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,360
 - No, I've seen every episode of Finland,

1366
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,520
 so I'm confident about this.

1367
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,280
 - Throne of chaos.

1368
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,120
 - Band.

1369
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,440
 - Andy, you've seen every episode.

1370
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,760
 - I think band, I think band.

1371
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,240
 - Game of thrones, then.

1372
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,440
 - It is a band.

1373
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,080
 They were unable to make commercial headway

1374
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,120
 and broke up in August, 2005.

1375
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,120
 - Okay.

1376
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,600
 - Winter sun.

1377
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,440
 - Game of thrones.

1378
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,520
 - I'll say band.

1379
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,720
 - It's a band.

1380
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,640
 It's not really death metal, says the singer.

1381
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,400
 It's very difficult for me to label it,

1382
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,120
 but if someone put a gun to my forehead,

1383
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,560
 I would probably say something like

1384
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,720
 extreme melodic, majestic metal.

1385
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,360
 - If I think it'll just annoy whoever's put a gun

1386
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,520
 to your head at this point, that's an irritating.

1387
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,520
 - The pointy end.

1388
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,360
 - Thrones.

1389
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,200
 - I'll say thrones.

1390
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,040
 - Metal.

1391
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,520
 - It is thrones.

1392
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,760
 - Ay.

1393
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,880
 - It refers to a sword fighting lesson

1394
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,600
 that John gave to Arya before the farewell,

1395
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,360
 where he says, "stick them with the pointy end."

1396
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,200
 - Do you remember that note?

1397
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,040
 You say it?

1398
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,880
 - Yeah.

1399
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,720
 - Isn't it nice?

1400
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,520
 - But there's a lot of fun Finnish band names.

1401
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,600
 - Pierre Gunt.

1402
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,800
 (laughing)

1403
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
 - You know it, Gunt.

1404
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,560
 - Does Gunt mean the same thing in Finland as it does here?

1405
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,720
 - I looked it up in the Oxford English Dictionary,

1406
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,600
 and it doesn't mean anything in this country.

1407
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,880
 - Don't know what you're talking about, James.

1408
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,920
 - But it's obviously based on Greek's Pierre Gents,

1409
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,080
 but also it's guns in Finnish.

1410
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,480
 - I see.

1411
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,040
 - Climidia with a K.

1412
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,880
 - Ooh.

1413
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,720
 - Los Bastardos, Finlandesses.

1414
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,560
 (laughing)

1415
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,400
 - Brilliant names.

1416
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,240
 - Those are great names.

1417
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,080
 - That's very good.

1418
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,120
 - I'm Finnish language.

1419
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,960
 - Oh yeah.

1420
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,240
 - I see.

1421
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,680
 - It's really hard.

1422
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,520
 - Yeah.

1423
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,160
 - Like it's really, really difficult.

1424
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,560
 - For what reason?

1425
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,520
 - It's very complicated.

1426
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,160
 (laughing)

1427
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,960
 - It's got 15 different cases.

1428
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,800
 - Okay.

1429
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
 - And lots of people leave after arriving

1430
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,720
 because it's just like language complexities,

1431
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,080
 also bureaucracy and attacks.

1432
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,160
 - Lots of people leave after a lot of people move there

1433
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,520
 and then go, "Oh, sod this."

1434
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,800
 - Students who arrive, 36% of them leave within a year

1435
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,320
 of finishing their studies,

1436
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,320
 so they don't stay on and make a life.

1437
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,000
 - And there's another reason which is,

1438
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,520
 I don't think anyone's tired of this,

1439
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,720
 but in Finland, apparently, there's almost no small talk.

1440
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,880
 You just pay for your coffee and you shut up.

1441
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,440
 - I only learned one word of Finnish when I was there,

1442
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,640
 and it's kitos, which means thank you.

1443
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,960
 And the way I remembered it is

1444
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,680
 'cause it's like mosquitoes, but without the moss bit.

1445
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,520
 - Oh really?

1446
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,360
 - Right.

1447
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,200
 - And that's how they told it,

1448
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,640
 'cause I actually got that through some small talk

1449
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,480
 in a cafe.

1450
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,320
 (laughing)

1451
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,160
 - They were eating it.

1452
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,440
 - I was gonna say, we are gonna get letters

1453
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,280
 off the back of that.

1454
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,120
 - I don't think we are.

1455
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,040
 - I think I've read quite a lot about Finnish culture before.

1456
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,360
 I think it became a thing in China

1457
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,520
 to call yourself spiritually Finnish,

1458
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,240
 and it's a very popular meme.

1459
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,840
 A lot of Chinese people tapped into this.

1460
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,040
 It's got millions of views.

1461
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,720
 The idea is that they like their own space.

1462
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,000
 They're very taciturn, and I've never seen,

1463
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,680
 and I've read so many accounts of Finns

1464
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,520
 being asked about this.

1465
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,280
 I've never seen anyone say, this is bullshit.

1466
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,600
 We're all incredibly friendly.

1467
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,440
 (laughing)

1468
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,280
 - Okay.

1469
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,120
 - So do write in.

1470
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,960
 - It's not unfriendly, yeah.

1471
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,720
 It's just very, it's just quiet.

1472
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,400
 - Which country did I get a few emails

1473
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,120
 'cause I said they don't talk about the weather

1474
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,120
 'cause they have so much.

1475
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,280
 - That was somewhere in Scandinavia.

1476
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,640
 - Yeah, yeah, definitely got emails off the back of that.

1477
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,760
 - Just on the language, it is a really interesting language.

1478
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,080
 It's the Uralic language,

1479
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,360
 which means it came from the Urals,

1480
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,000
 and there are kind of three main Uralic languages.

1481
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,720
 Finnish, Estonian, which makes sort of sense

1482
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,560
 because that's--

1483
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,400
 - Right next to each other.

1484
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,240
 - You swim across.

1485
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,040
 - Yeah, swim across a small bit of water.

1486
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,840
 And then Hungarian.

1487
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,680
 - So weird.

1488
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,640
 - Which is, there's like four countries in between them

1489
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,660
 if you follow them down.

1490
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,480
 - And it's four countries,

1491
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,700
 but they're four pretty big countries as well.

1492
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,480
 - Yeah, it's so mad.

1493
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,120
 I think it's because it starts in the Urals

1494
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,400
 to the east of both of them,

1495
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,200
 and then some people went just directly west,

1496
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,600
 and I don't know why it didn't sort of drop bits of itself

1497
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,960
 along the way in Ukraine or in bits of Russia,

1498
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,800
 but it didn't.

1499
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,840
 - But I think also like the Soviet Union,

1500
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,280
 they basically banned any other language, didn't they?

1501
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,120
 - Yeah, you're right, maybe that's--

1502
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,960
 - So I think a lot of the smaller pockets just died out.

1503
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,360
 - They got it, that's probably it.

1504
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,920
 Yeah, and didn't quite reach Hungary that rule,

1505
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,160
 even though obviously Hungary--

1506
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,000
 - I believe so.

1507
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,200
 - Being in part of the Eastern Bloc.

1508
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,600
 But you're hungry just sitting there

1509
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,100
 in the same language family as the Finns,

1510
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,040
 but unable to reach them.

1511
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,320
 - Wild, sob.

1512
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,280
 - The oldest writing in the Finnish family of languages,

1513
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,560
 which was found in the Urals, is very metal, actually.

1514
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,280
 If you translate it into English,

1515
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,560
 it translates as God's arrow, ten is your name,

1516
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,800
 the arrow is God's own, the doom God leads.

1517
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,640
 - That's brilliant.

1518
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,760
 - And to go back to a former thing

1519
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,720
 that we were talking about,

1520
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,560
 we reckon that it was a magic spell

1521
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,760
 to stop lightning from getting you.

1522
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,980
 You might say it in the bath, for instance.

1523
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,820
 - Yeah.

1524
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,200
 - Yeah, it was found in Novgorod.

1525
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,640
 - Dan has a rubber duck with those words.

1526
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,320
 (all laughing)

1527
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,520
 - Well, rubber, that'll be good.

1528
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,840
 - Yes, put that rubber duck under your ass.

1529
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,680
 - Yeah.

1530
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,760
 - To avoid lightning.

1531
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,600
 - To avoid lightning.

1532
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,840
 - Well, Dan, why have you got a rubber duck

1533
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,680
 up your ass?

1534
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,520
 (all laughing)

1535
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,400
 - I tell you, I was in the bath.

1536
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,840
 It was raining outside.

1537
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,680
 (all laughing)

1538
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,880
 - You're coming too careful.

1539
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,200
 (all laughing)

1540
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,280
 - They invented the happy or not buttons.

1541
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
 - The happy or not buttons.

1542
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,560
 - Oh, so when you're in an airport

1543
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,800
 and you go through security and you have to say,

1544
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,680
 did I have a good time or did I have a great time?

1545
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,520
 (all laughing)

1546
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,960
 There's like some little faces

1547
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,800
 and you press one under.

1548
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,080
 - Exactly, that's a finished person,

1549
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,040
 which I think is interesting

1550
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,720
 because they're known for being quite deadpan,

1551
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,680
 although they're always also found

1552
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,200
 to be the happiest country in the world, confusingly.

1553
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,000
 But yes, it was a finished guy

1554
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,200
 who invented them,

1555
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,680
 marvelous and bad customer service.

1556
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,280
 And they've just been hugely kind of revolutionary

1557
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,240
 for customer service in a lot of places.

1558
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,080
 - Have they?

1559
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,920
 - Yeah, because it changes how the staff acts.

1560
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,680
 So Heathrow was their big break in 2012,

1561
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,600
 called this finished guy.

1562
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,840
 They said, can we have a couple of these or try them out?

1563
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,320
 They got nine.

1564
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,680
 Within, I think within two days,

1565
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,560
 Heathrow called the finished guy back and said,

1566
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,200
 we need to shed loads of these right now

1567
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,120
 'cause the staff insecurity had gone from being kind of sullen,

1568
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,080
 occasionally a bit rude or just blanking customers.

1569
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,120
 - Could I just say, for the next time I go through Heathrow,

1570
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,320
 I've always found them to be lovely.

1571
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,360
 - Yeah, see, they instill this kind of fear in people.

1572
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,400
 - Did this guy invent it

1573
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,160
 because him and all the rest of the finished people

1574
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,680
 hate small talks so much

1575
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,280
 that they're like even a machine

1576
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,200
 to ask that basic question is what I would prefer?

1577
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,360
 - It could be, I actually thought it might be related

1578
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,000
 'cause it's so quick and you don't need to do any kind of

1579
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,280
 interacting at all, yeah.

1580
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,920
 But it does make the staff, I think that's really interesting.

1581
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,400
 Subconsciously, as soon as you're aware,

1582
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,320
 that button's there for people's satisfaction to be logged.

1583
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,160
 The staff give a little gag and they'll actually--

1584
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,360
 - Can I ask a question about those?

1585
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,160
 I know you're not the expert in them

1586
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,000
 and you've only read this thing, but--

1587
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,840
 - It's been about three and a half minutes

1588
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,280
 reading about them actually, so there we go.

1589
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,440
 - So when I walk out of security

1590
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,280
 and I've gone through really quickly

1591
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,680
 'cause I'm a good person who takes my belt off

1592
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,480
 before I go through and--

1593
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,680
 - Trousers down your ass.

1594
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,040
 (laughing)

1595
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,880
 - You're showing your phone number

1596
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,080
 to all the security people.

1597
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,000
 - Let me put the rose rubber gloves on you.

1598
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,240
 (laughing)

1599
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,400
 And I press the smiley button

1600
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,760
 and I press it like 10 times

1601
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,120
 'cause I had such a good time.

1602
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,960
 - Yeah.

1603
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,760
 - Does that count as 10 or do you think it doesn't?

1604
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,240
 - Well, James, as the three and a half minutes,

1605
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,120
 well, I do know the answer to that.

1606
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,000
 There is a little time restriction on it,

1607
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 which means that, for instance,

1608
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,280
 staff or you can't cheat it,

1609
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,720
 so you can't log lots and lots in a row quickly,

1610
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,940
 but you could keep coming back.

1611
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,640
 You could go get your cost to come back.

1612
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,480
 - While you were saying that,

1613
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,120
 all I could picture was what would it be like

1614
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,480
 to get gloved at an airport?

1615
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,280
 I could see my session ending with them going,

1616
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,120
 "Okay, there's nothing there.

1617
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,320
 You're free to go, Mr. Shriver.

1618
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,920
 Here's your rubber duck by the way."

1619
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,760
 (laughing)

1620
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,340
 (upbeat music)

1621
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,320
 Okay, that is it.

1622
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,360
 That is all of our facts.

1623
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,680

 So have a look at the list,

1648
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,780

1649

1650

1653
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,540
 Goodbye.

1654
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,120

1655
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,700
