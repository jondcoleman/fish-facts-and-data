00:00:00,00:00:16,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish coming to you from"
00:00:16,00:00:18,the QILs in Covent Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:25,"My name is Anna Toshinsky, I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Alex Bell and James Harkin."
00:00:25,00:00:28,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts
00:00:28,00:00:33,from the last seven days in no particular order here they are.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"And that's starting with you Andy."""
00:00:36,00:00:42,My fact this week is that Czech dear still avoid crossing the Iron Curtain between Germany
00:00:42,00:00:45,and the Czech Republic.
00:00:45,00:00:50,So they used to be the Iron Curtain which was a very very long electrified fence in between
00:00:50,00:00:55,the two countries during the Cold War and at the end of the Cold War the Czech and the
00:00:55,00:00:58,German authorities they established a nature reserve going across the country they thought
00:00:58,00:01:03,"this is a really nice idea, we'll have this huge habitat, all sorts of species, we'll"
00:01:03,00:01:07,have lots of them to play in and there'll be more animals as a result and it'll be good
00:01:07,00:01:12,for biodiversity and it turns out 20 years later that dear on the Czech side just will not
00:01:12,00:01:13,cross that border.
00:01:13,00:01:16,So what you're saying is that all dear are communist?
00:01:16,00:01:20,These are red dear for a nice day.
00:01:20,00:01:24,"And the headline from the Wall Street Journal when this study was reported was ""deep in the"
00:01:24,00:01:27,"forest, Bambia remains the Cold War's last prisoner."""
00:01:27,00:01:30,She's a good headline.
00:01:30,00:01:35,There's a strip through Germany which was called the death strip I think because it was that
00:01:35,00:01:39,strip it was sort of like a five kilometer area between East and West Germany where you
00:01:39,00:01:43,weren't allowed to cross and it was cordoned off with lots of barbed wire and walls and you
00:01:43,00:01:48,"know men with guns and high towers and stuff and because no one touched it, no humans touched"
00:01:48,00:01:53,"it for about 50 years it's now got like more, it's the most biodiverse area in Germany."
00:01:53,00:01:54,It's got more wildlife than your own journey.
00:01:54,00:01:57,Is that supposedly true of Chernobyl as well?
00:01:57,00:01:58,It is yes isn't it?
00:01:58,00:02:03,"The last leading to that old joke, why shouldn't you go wildlife spotting in Ukraine?"
00:02:03,00:02:04,Why?
00:02:04,00:02:09,Because Chernobyl's biodiversity is very high and we can't run the risk of damaging it.
00:02:09,00:02:13,Also Chernobyl fall off.
00:02:13,00:02:16,"Just going back to the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall, did you know I maybe everyone"
00:02:16,00:02:20,knows this but the Berlin Wall came down by accident kind of?
00:02:20,00:02:21,"Yeah, sort of."
00:02:21,00:02:26,"Yeah, so they were negotiations and there was going to be a change of how easily people"
00:02:26,00:02:31,were allowed to cross and they had a live television press conference which was a bit of a
00:02:31,00:02:36,rarity then it was a bit of a novelty and the guy announcing it mixes words up quite a
00:02:36,00:02:40,bit carried away so there's lots of changes happening they're all happening immediately
00:02:40,00:02:42,and then people massed outside the wall.
00:02:42,00:02:46,"Yeah, there's footage of him when he's asked directly so when are people going to be able"
00:02:46,00:02:50,to cross freely between East and West Berlin and he sort of grapples with a bit of a press
00:02:50,00:02:56,release and looks at the back of it and goes immediately and then they go for it.
00:02:56,00:03:01,And I read a theory that the checkpoint guard who was in charge that day was a guy called
00:03:01,00:03:06,Harold Yeager and he sort of caved in to all these protesters who came flooding towards
00:03:06,00:03:12,him saying let us through and one of the ideas of why he would cave in is that he was waiting
00:03:12,00:03:16,on the results of a cancer test I read in one article and he was nervous and worried
00:03:16,00:03:20,about that and he just sort of thought oh bugger this I'm you know I'll let them get through
00:03:20,00:03:21,he was fine by the way.
00:03:21,00:03:22,This needs to be a movie.
00:03:22,00:03:23,It's amazing.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Yeah.
00:03:24,00:03:29,Just on that there was a thing in the I think it was the second world war where shortly
00:03:29,00:03:32,"after like the horrible defeat at Dunkirk and you know things were looking really, really"
00:03:32,00:03:33,bad for Britain.
00:03:33,00:03:38,I think it was about this time and there was a sort of offer from Germany or an offer
00:03:38,00:03:44,of a negotiated settlement and the BBC Newsreader who was announcing the terms of this
00:03:44,00:03:51,said well obviously we're not going to accept that way before anyone and you know true
00:03:51,00:03:59,enough they did decline but he said afterwards yeah I read us that was a bit strong.
00:03:59,00:04:03,Do you know who invented the phrase Iron Curtain?
00:04:03,00:04:05,Winston Churchill.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Everyone says it was Churchill.
00:04:06,00:04:08,Everyone says it in that stupid vice.
00:04:08,00:04:12,It's almost as if they know it's the wrong answer.
00:04:12,00:04:16,Gerbil's used it before Churchill did and before that it was used by an author called Ethel
00:04:16,00:04:21,Snowden in 1920 but Gerbil's wrote it way before Churchill did and he wrote an article
00:04:21,00:04:25,called The Year 2000 where he was predicting exactly what was going to happen in the year
00:04:25,00:04:30,2000 and he said that our children's children will also have had children and the events of
00:04:30,00:04:32,this war would have sunk into myth.
00:04:32,00:04:35,The first bit of that prediction actually isn't that impressive.
00:04:35,00:04:36,Nice true.
00:04:36,00:04:40,But he also said one more fly from Berlin to Paris for breakfast in 15 minutes.
00:04:40,00:04:43,It takes longer than that though doesn't it?
00:04:43,00:04:46,I mean even getting through security takes longer than that.
00:04:46,00:04:48,Yeah so Gerbil's was wrong.
00:04:48,00:04:51,About loads of things that I like to say.
00:04:51,00:04:52,Sorry.
00:04:52,00:04:57,So there are two species of millipede in Tasmania that never meet each other.
00:04:57,00:04:58,Oh yeah.
00:04:58,00:04:59,Okay.
00:04:59,00:05:03,There's like an invisible line that they never cross but the interesting thing about it
00:05:03,00:05:08,is it doesn't follow any kind of rivers or hills or natural contours is just like an
00:05:08,00:05:10,invisible line and no one knows why.
00:05:10,00:05:13,Rob Meziboff who's a millipede specialist.
00:05:13,00:05:16,He said it has got nothing to do with the environment.
00:05:16,00:05:19,It's like a political thing between these two species.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Oh wow.
00:05:20,00:05:21,Is it a leg dispute?
00:05:21,00:05:23,It feels like it's going to be a leg dispute isn't it?
00:05:23,00:05:24,That's just stereotyping.
00:05:24,00:05:27,You think that everything that millipedes do is to do with their legs?
00:05:27,00:05:28,Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:29,98 legs good.
00:05:29,00:05:30,99 legs bad.
00:05:30,00:05:35,"But there might be, I mean you might, the thing is you're so long as a millipede that"
00:05:35,00:05:40,you might end up in enemy territory without realising it.
00:05:40,00:05:41,You've got your back off.
00:05:41,00:05:42,Yeah.
00:05:42,00:05:44,If you're like backing up somewhere.
00:05:44,00:05:46,Can millipedes walk backwards if they want to?
00:05:46,00:05:48,I think they probably can.
00:05:48,00:05:49,I think they probably can't.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Why really?
00:05:50,00:05:52,Why wouldn't they be able to any more than anyone else?
00:05:52,00:05:56,I think because it's a really tough job to coordinate that many legs surely.
00:05:56,00:05:57,Okay.
00:05:57,00:05:58,Okay.
00:05:58,00:06:03,"If there are any millipede experts listening, if you could tweet me at egg shapes and the"
00:06:03,00:06:07,"at Andrew Hunter M and let us know which of us is correct here, I think there's a"
00:06:07,00:06:08,pint riding on it.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Yeah.
00:06:09,00:06:26,And there are a couple of instances where the millipedes that belong to one side have ended
00:06:26,00:06:29,up in a little blob on the other side and they think maybe they were taken over accidentally
00:06:29,00:06:33,on a truck and then but they still aren't mingling.
00:06:33,00:06:34,Maybe they're embassies.
00:06:34,00:06:35,Oh yeah.
00:06:35,00:06:37,They're millipede embassies.
00:06:37,00:06:38,That's what it is.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Yeah.
00:06:39,00:06:40,That's quite cool.
00:06:40,00:06:46,I think it's called parapetric speciation and it's where I think there are like two populations
00:06:46,00:06:50,of an animal that don't mingle and usually it's because there's a ditch in between them
00:06:50,00:06:54,or there's some kind of topographical or geographical reason for it.
00:06:54,00:06:55,Or millipede racism.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Or millipede racism.
00:06:56,00:07:01,Or we put a great big wall up for you isn't it?
00:07:01,00:07:04,But yeah and it means that populations tend not to mingle with each other at all.
00:07:04,00:07:05,They'll rub up against each other.
00:07:05,00:07:07,They'll occasionally have a chat but they'll only really make with the people on their
00:07:07,00:07:08,side.
00:07:08,00:07:12,Especially that creates and that means they spur up into two different species.
00:07:12,00:07:17,"And it also happens with velvet walking worms in Tasmania, that's another mystery."
00:07:17,00:07:19,So maybe Tasmanians are just unbelievably anti-social.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"Sorry, this is a walking worm."
00:07:21,00:07:22,"Yeah, that sounds amazing."
00:07:22,00:07:23,That's right.
00:07:23,00:07:24,A velvet walking worm.
00:07:24,00:07:26,I didn't look into the explanation for the name.
00:07:26,00:07:31,"What I imagine is that the worm, it doesn't have any legs but it kind of squeezes itself"
00:07:31,00:07:36,up into two halves and walks like a pair of legs.
00:07:36,00:07:41,"Let's just go on believing is that they're never Google it, anyone, nobody Google it."
00:07:41,00:07:47,Another thing is that there is a species of shark called mecosharks and there's a line underneath
00:07:47,00:07:52,the sea where if you catch a shark from one side of it then it will be male and if you catch
00:07:52,00:07:54,one from the other side of it it'll always be female.
00:07:54,00:07:56,And that's why that is either.
00:07:56,00:08:00,Do they only have sex on either side of the line?
00:08:00,00:08:03,They must just come together for one part of the year I guess.
00:08:03,00:08:05,Speaking of sex on borders.
00:08:05,00:08:07,I think it's in Switzerland.
00:08:07,00:08:11,That's the last time you're invited to that bookshelf.
00:08:11,00:08:16,"I think it's in Switzerland, on the border of Switzerland and maybe France or another country."
00:08:16,00:08:21,There's a hotel with a penthouse in it and the penthouse bed is on the border.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"Cool, so you can take off two countries in one go."
00:08:24,00:08:25,I don't know if you need passports or anything.
00:08:25,00:08:27,Are you taking off all the countries?
00:08:27,00:08:31,"Yeah, and it's so irritating because I don't enjoy sex so the idea being able to take off"
00:08:31,00:08:34,multiple countries in one attempt.
00:08:34,00:08:36,That's a dream country.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Dear.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"Yes, dear."
00:08:38,00:08:39,"Oh, dear."
00:08:39,00:08:43,Dear aren't always herbivores.
00:08:43,00:08:44,Really?
00:08:44,00:08:49,"They've been caught eating birds, out straight out the nest, other meats and stuff like that."
00:08:49,00:08:52,And so apparently there are several species that will or quite a lot of species that will
00:08:52,00:08:54,eat meat if it's available.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Really?
00:08:55,00:08:59,"And on a related note, cows, I've watched a video today of a cow eating a live chicken just"
00:08:59,00:09:00,off the ground.
00:09:00,00:09:05,"You're a sick puppy, Alex."
00:09:05,00:09:06,"And also, dear, don't have gallbladders."
00:09:06,00:09:08,That's the only other thing I have about them.
00:09:08,00:09:11,How do they blotter their gallblad?
00:09:11,00:09:12,Warful.
00:09:12,00:09:14,I know what you're saying.
00:09:14,00:09:23,"OK, time for fact number two and that is James's facts."
00:09:23,00:09:28,My fact this week is that if every car in Monaco decided to go for a drive at the same
00:09:28,00:09:32,"time, they wouldn't fit on the roads."
00:09:32,00:09:34,How much time have you been working that out?
00:09:34,00:09:35,Not so much.
00:09:35,00:09:41,"So this comes from the economist world in figures, I think it's called, which is a yearly"
00:09:41,00:09:43,book that has loads of statistics in it.
00:09:43,00:09:49,"And the length of the Monaco road system, if you divide it by the number of cars, is less"
00:09:49,00:09:53,"than the average length of a car, according to my calculations."
00:09:53,00:09:56,"Which if they're wrong, please don't write it."
00:09:56,00:10:02,"But I reckon that each car had about, you know, just around two metres of space and definitely"
00:10:02,00:10:03,cars along the amount of an average.
00:10:03,00:10:04,"Yeah, wow."
00:10:04,00:10:08,Should we do a test and ask everyone in Monaco to get in their cars and go on to the roads?
00:10:08,00:10:10,"Now, if you're listening to prove this fact wrong."
00:10:10,00:10:13,"Because this is a podcast, people listen at different times."
00:10:13,00:10:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:14,00:10:15,"No, you're right."
00:10:15,00:10:16,We'd need to arrange that.
00:10:16,00:10:18,And we need the entire population of Monaco to be listeners.
00:10:18,00:10:19,I'm fairly sure they are.
00:10:19,00:10:20,I think that's all the policies.
00:10:20,00:10:23,"Obviously, also forgetting that's an incredibly irresponsible thing to do as well."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"Of course, multiple days."
00:10:24,00:10:27,"No one said this is a perfect plan, guys."
00:10:27,00:10:31,So does Monaco have more cars per capita than anywhere else in the world?
00:10:31,00:10:35,"I think it does, and if not, it's in the top two."
00:10:35,00:10:41,"I read that they've got, and these figures are a couple of years old, 771 cars per"
00:10:41,00:10:42,thousand citizens.
00:10:42,00:10:43,"Yeah, it's a bit more than that now."
00:10:43,00:10:44,Okay.
00:10:44,00:10:49,"So that sounds like a lot, considering how many citizens there are, or how few citizens"
00:10:49,00:10:50,there are.
00:10:50,00:10:55,"It's the second most populated country on Earth, I think."
00:10:55,00:10:56,It's China.
00:10:56,00:11:03,"It's amazing considering Monaco is only two square kilometers, but it's got just shy"
00:11:03,00:11:05,of a billion people living in it.
00:11:05,00:11:06,Order.
00:11:06,00:11:07,Order.
00:11:07,00:11:08,Sorry.
00:11:08,00:11:09,Alex.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"Yes, because apparently Monaco is also the second most densely populated country on Earth"
00:11:12,00:11:15,"after some place in China, I think."
00:11:15,00:11:16,Like how?
00:11:16,00:11:17,I could be.
00:11:17,00:11:19,"Anyway, it's the second most densely populated country on Earth."
00:11:19,00:11:22,And they also have more cars than any other people in Earth as well.
00:11:22,00:11:28,"And one whole third of them are millionaires, 30% of the population of Monaco."
00:11:28,00:11:29,300 million.
00:11:29,00:11:40,"That's right, there are 30,000 people living in two square kilometers, so it's incredibly"
00:11:40,00:11:41,densely populated.
00:11:41,00:11:45,"It really skews the statistics, doesn't it, because they have like 100% literacy rates,"
00:11:45,00:11:50,and I give the life expectancy is like 98 or something ridiculous.
00:11:50,00:11:51,Yeah.
00:11:51,00:11:56,"In fact, it's also the oldest country in terms of the proportion of the population who are"
00:11:56,00:12:01,"aged over 65, so there it's 27.8% of the population."
00:12:01,00:12:04,"So in the UK it's about 17%, 18%."
00:12:04,00:12:12,"So as a result of that, in 2009 Monaco spent 1.2% of its GDP on education, essentially there"
00:12:12,00:12:14,are no children.
00:12:14,00:12:19,"When you were saying the size of it is 2 square kilometers, I like to say that it's almost exactly"
00:12:19,00:12:26,"the same size as chipping, sodbury quarry, because when I Google things that were 2 square kilometers"
00:12:26,00:12:28,in size that was the first thing we did.
00:12:28,00:12:29,That's very cool.
00:12:29,00:12:33,I think your Google result may be personalized.
00:12:33,00:12:39,"There's another thing which is 2 square kilometers in size, which is the largest building"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"in the world, which is in China."
00:12:41,00:12:49,"This single shopping centre is 1.76 million square meters, and that is the total area of"
00:12:49,00:12:50,Monaco basically.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Wow.
00:12:51,00:12:55,"Because they say that a lot of the biggest buildings are aircraft hangers, aren't they?"
00:12:55,00:12:56,Oh yeah.
00:12:56,00:13:01,"It's amazing seeing aircraft factories and how big they are as well, because those are the"
00:13:01,00:13:04,"same as, you know, they're really, really, really massive aircraft hangers, you know."
00:13:04,00:13:08,"I was watching a video of, this is really off topic, but I was watching a video of a German"
00:13:08,00:13:12,"factory that makes houses, basically like, entire houses of the flat back."
00:13:12,00:13:17,"And the whole factory is sort of this big white sterile place, and nothing touches the floor."
00:13:17,00:13:18,Everything is suspended from the ceiling.
00:13:18,00:13:19,Wow.
00:13:19,00:13:20,Yeah.
00:13:20,00:13:21,Why is that?
00:13:21,00:13:25,"Just in the interest of kind of tidiness and cleanliness and, you know, you can't lose anything."
00:13:25,00:13:28,"Everything sort of, everything, all the bits are always kind of hanging and going from"
00:13:28,00:13:29,rails and stuff.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Oh, that is a weird thing."
00:13:30,00:13:34,"Really, I've got some DIY to do this weekend at my place."
00:13:34,00:13:38,"Is that why they call it a aircraft hanger, because they hang clothes?"
00:13:38,00:13:39,No.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"It's hangar, isn't it?"
00:13:40,00:13:41,Yeah.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Isn't it?
00:13:42,00:13:43,What on earth is that?
00:13:43,00:13:44,That's not a word.
00:13:44,00:13:45,"No, but it's like a coat hanger."
00:13:45,00:13:46,But it's not a coat hanger.
00:13:46,00:13:50,"I actually have a coat hanger, which is for all my coats."
00:13:50,00:13:54,I've just got all so many millions of coats.
00:13:54,00:14:01,Because it's such a loser.
00:14:01,00:14:06,"Actually, speaking of planes, so your fact is about all the cars not fitting on the road."
00:14:06,00:14:10,Is the same true for all the planes fitting in the sky?
00:14:10,00:14:11,No.
00:14:11,00:14:12,Yes.
00:14:12,00:14:13,"No, the opposite."
00:14:13,00:14:14,I know what you're going to say.
00:14:14,00:14:15,All the planes fitting on the ground.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:17,I have heard that.
00:14:17,00:14:20,That's why there's always planes in the air because they wouldn't fit all fit in the
00:14:20,00:14:21,air pots.
00:14:21,00:14:24,"And they used to say during the millennium when the millennium was coming, everyone said,"
00:14:24,00:14:25,"""Oh, gosh."
00:14:25,00:14:26,What are we going to do?
00:14:26,00:14:27,"We're going to have to ground all the planes, but they weren't fitting the airports."""
00:14:27,00:14:30,But I've slightly looked into it and it's definitely not true.
00:14:30,00:14:34,I think the only thing is they wouldn't all be able to fit in an airport whilst being connected
00:14:34,00:14:36,"to an airport, so passengers could board them."
00:14:36,00:14:39,"Because I mean, airports are huge, airplanes only take up about a 20th of them."
00:14:39,00:14:41,The rest is just tarmac.
00:14:41,00:14:42,So I think they could all fit.
00:14:42,00:14:48,"I mean, again, if you're a pilot or a millipede, do write in if you think that's not right."
00:14:48,00:14:53,It would be an act of confidence to build and deliver it under capacity in all the airports
00:14:53,00:14:57,"in the world, like Ryanair booking more people onto a flight than actually some people"
00:14:57,00:14:58,won't turn up.
00:14:58,00:15:04,"So they probably built the airports and then made more planes, rather than thought, ""Well,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"this is the maximum number of planes we're ever going to build."""
00:15:07,00:15:10,Now let's start on the airport.
00:15:10,00:15:14,So your fact is about lots of people going out and doing something at the same time.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"Yes, it is."
00:15:15,00:15:19,So I was looking at a couple of things all humans could do at the same time that might make
00:15:19,00:15:22,a big difference to the world.
00:15:22,00:15:27,"So Carton Driver magazine worked out in the course of a really quite long article, a lot"
00:15:27,00:15:33,"of maths, that if everyone in the world got in their cars at once and put their foot on"
00:15:33,00:15:38,"the accelerator all at once, pointing in the same direction, then the opposing force that"
00:15:38,00:15:46,would create from the earth would cause the rotation of the earth to speed up by 0.1 miles
00:15:46,00:15:47,per hour.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"Which means you make the day longer, so you get there faster."
00:15:49,00:15:51,"Yeah, it's a perfect way to stop itself being late."
00:15:51,00:15:54,But the traffic would be really bad because everyone is out on the road.
00:15:54,00:15:55,It's a good point.
00:15:55,00:15:57,"It's a flawed plan, again."
00:15:57,00:16:03,"So Monaco is famous for its grompries, and this fact is about Monaco and Cars."
00:16:03,00:16:07,Actually the second ever grompry was held in Monaco.
00:16:07,00:16:12,The race was mowed after a large pile-up on the first lap when an enormous wave from the
00:16:12,00:16:14,half of flooded the course.
00:16:14,00:16:15,Oh my god.
00:16:15,00:16:16,I know.
00:16:16,00:16:17,Is that amazing?
00:16:17,00:16:20,"So were they all just going in and then they all just left there, covered in seaweed?"
00:16:20,00:16:22,That would be amazing.
00:16:22,00:16:23,That would be amazing.
00:16:23,00:16:25,And by making a squid in the car next to them.
00:16:25,00:16:28,"It's very like wacky races, isn't it?"
00:16:28,00:16:29,Was that the one?
00:16:29,00:16:32,So there was a guy called William Grover Williams who was the winner of the first Monaco
00:16:32,00:16:33,grompry.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Was it in 1929?
00:16:34,00:16:38,"Or, anyway, I think the first Monaco grompry was in 1929 and the winner was this guy called"
00:16:38,00:16:40,William Grover Williams.
00:16:40,00:16:45,And he went on to become a spy because I think he was employed for the French resistance
00:16:45,00:16:49,in World War II as a driver and it turned out he had quite a lot of other talents.
00:16:49,00:16:50,What was his name?
00:16:50,00:16:51,William Grover Williams?
00:16:51,00:16:57,It feels like he's a spy and they've got what's your name and he goes William Williams?
00:16:57,00:17:03,"It sounds also, it's exactly the same as Bond James Bond, so to be fair, you know."
00:17:03,00:17:04,"Oh, you're right."
00:17:04,00:17:05,The name's William.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Grover Williams.
00:17:06,00:17:14,"Anyway, apparently so he was allegedly the Nazis claimed captured and executed but there"
00:17:14,00:17:18,were a lot of sightings of him afterwards and Rumor had it that he became a grocer in
00:17:18,00:17:19,sorry.
00:17:19,00:17:23,It's William Grover Williams.
00:17:23,00:17:31,"Just going back to the Monaco grompry in 2004 when Oceans 12 came out, they did a publicity"
00:17:31,00:17:36,"stunt where the Jaguar cars in the race were fitted with a new nose cone, each of which"
00:17:36,00:17:43,"had a diamond worth in excess of $300,000 inside the nose cone."
00:17:43,00:17:48,"During the first lap, Jaguar driver Christian Klein crashed his diamond encrusted car."
00:17:48,00:17:53,They weren't allowed to go straight to kind of sort out the car because they had to do it
00:17:53,00:17:57,"after the race finished and by the time they got there, they couldn't find the diamond."
00:17:57,00:17:59,And no one knows where the diamond is to this day.
00:17:59,00:18:03,I bet one person knows.
00:18:03,00:18:12,"OK, time for fact number three and that is my facts."
00:18:12,00:18:18,My fact this week is at the town of Centrelia in Pennsylvania has been on fire since 1962.
00:18:18,00:18:23,"So people aren't entirely sure how the fire started, but it's thought that people were burning"
00:18:23,00:18:24,trash.
00:18:24,00:18:31,So there's just a heap of trash or garbage in Centrelia and they set fire to it.
00:18:31,00:18:36,And the thing about Centrelia is they had a huge network of mines sort of underneath it
00:18:36,00:18:38,and largely towards the outskirts of it.
00:18:38,00:18:42,And the fire kind of fell down into one of the mines and their coal mines.
00:18:42,00:18:45,And so obviously coal sets fire quite easily.
00:18:45,00:18:46,Pretty quite well.
00:18:46,00:18:50,And so the coal does caught fire and it's been going ever since.
00:18:50,00:18:54,And they keep trying to put it out or they kept trying to put it out up until the 80s and
00:18:54,00:18:55,then they just gave up.
00:18:55,00:19:01,"And yeah, you have a population of over a thousand and now its population is 11 I think."
00:19:01,00:19:02,"Oh, I've heard seven."
00:19:02,00:19:03,Has it gone down?
00:19:03,00:19:04,"2010, there were tens."
00:19:04,00:19:07,I can't find somebody moved there.
00:19:07,00:19:13,"Come to Centrelia, it's on fire."
00:19:13,00:19:15,It's an incredible story.
00:19:15,00:19:16,It's so weird.
00:19:16,00:19:18,There's not unusual these things across America.
00:19:18,00:19:21,There are hundreds of all across the world in fact.
00:19:21,00:19:24,So I think there are over 200 other mine fires in America.
00:19:24,00:19:28,There are thousands in China where there are lots of coal mines obviously.
00:19:28,00:19:34,"Apparently in total, these coal fires account for 3% of the world's CO2 emissions, which"
00:19:34,00:19:35,just is insane.
00:19:35,00:19:37,And so they're not all people chucking stuff down.
00:19:37,00:19:40,I think sometimes it's natural and there are all sorts of other occurrences of underground
00:19:40,00:19:44,"fires made, but many coal produced at CO2, three percent."
00:19:44,00:19:48,I read that the ones in China alone are 1% of the world's CO2.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Yeah.
00:19:49,00:19:53,"A couple years ago, the Chinese government said that they'd been putting them out and they"
00:19:53,00:19:54,were just lying.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"And all these kind of things went wrong saying, I can still see the fire down there."
00:19:57,00:20:01,But the main one is the one in Australia.
00:20:01,00:20:03,You guys must have all seen that one right?
00:20:03,00:20:04,Yeah.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"Burning mountain, which has been going for 5,500 years."
00:20:07,00:20:08,"Yeah, it's mountain."
00:20:08,00:20:09,I don't think you can blame that on us.
00:20:09,00:20:10,That wasn't trash burning.
00:20:10,00:20:17,"Well, I read about the ex-possible explanations for Burning Mountain and apparently scientists"
00:20:17,00:20:21,"think it may have been caused by a lightning strike or spontaneous combustion, which is very"
00:20:21,00:20:24,"much science-speak for, we don't know."
00:20:24,00:20:30,"Also in Pennsylvania and Texas and some other places, you can get flammable water."
00:20:30,00:20:31,So...
00:20:31,00:20:32,petrol.
00:20:32,00:20:33,Yeah.
00:20:33,00:20:39,Now what means some of that flammable water for my power?
00:20:39,00:20:40,It's water.
00:20:40,00:20:43,It can even be drinking water that's just got high levels of methane trapped inside it.
00:20:43,00:20:46,"And if you put a match to it, it will go in flames of it."
00:20:46,00:20:47,Really?
00:20:47,00:20:50,"And if you've got sort of level water, you can sort of set fire to the surface of it, a bit"
00:20:50,00:20:52,like when you set fire to brandy on your Christmas pudding.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"And there are videos online you can watch this woman just lighting, setting fire to the"
00:20:56,00:20:57,water coming out of her kitchen taps.
00:20:57,00:20:58,I do watch them on the internet.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Do you watch them on the internet?
00:20:59,00:21:00,Do you watch them on the internet?
00:21:00,00:21:01,Do you watch them on the video?
00:21:01,00:21:06,"It must be really dangerous, though, because surely if the fire travels along the pipe."
00:21:06,00:21:09,It never really catches that much because there's not enough methane in the water.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Okay.
00:21:10,00:21:11,"And there's water as well, so."
00:21:11,00:21:12,"Oh, yeah, true."
00:21:12,00:21:14,Here's the thing about coal fires.
00:21:14,00:21:19,"When the Titanic set sail out of Southampton, she was on fire in the coal bunker because that"
00:21:19,00:21:23,"was what the Titanic's fuel was, huge, huge bunkers of coal."
00:21:23,00:21:27,"There was a fire in there which had been burning, possibly since the 2nd April, which was eight"
00:21:27,00:21:28,days before.
00:21:28,00:21:33,A fire that wasn't supposed to be burning that wasn't being used to fuel the...
00:21:33,00:21:34,Exactly.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"Yeah, yeah, just in the coal bunkers there was a fire happening and the crew took a day"
00:21:37,00:21:38,to put it out.
00:21:38,00:21:39,I can't believe they didn't spot it for a week.
00:21:39,00:21:41,The whole thinking thing is dying to make sense.
00:21:41,00:21:42,It was very slam-past.
00:21:42,00:21:44,It was negligent crews.
00:21:44,00:21:50,"Maybe what they were thinking is what we need as an enormous amount of very, very cold water."
00:21:50,00:21:54,"Be careful what you wish for, Frank."
00:21:54,00:21:58,"Fire is a really important in nature, aren't they?"
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Especially in America, some of their big trees like the Sequoias."
00:22:01,00:22:06,They rely on forest fires to kind of keep them healthy and keep them regrowing.
00:22:06,00:22:12,"Not because in America, everywhere, really, they have this kind of anti-forest fire thing,"
00:22:12,00:22:16,"which is essentially to stop people from throwing cigarette butts around, but actually kind"
00:22:16,00:22:18,of says that all fire is bad.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"Whenever there's a fire, they try and put it out really, really quickly, which actually"
00:22:21,00:22:26,can be quite bad for the ecosystem because you do need these fires for things like sequoias
00:22:26,00:22:27,to grow.
00:22:27,00:22:30,"Yeah, you do, because they have pine cones, isn't it?"
00:22:30,00:22:33,There are certain pine cones which are held together really tightly by resin that relies
00:22:33,00:22:37,"on fire to get hot enough that it, the resin melts and it seeds, so..."
00:22:37,00:22:40,"I'm not saying we should set fire to every forest, but you know, the odd little fire is"
00:22:40,00:22:41,quite important.
00:22:41,00:22:43,"Occasional tree wouldn't hurt, guys."
00:22:43,00:22:46,"Other forests where they have managed fires, sometimes."
00:22:46,00:22:47,Yes.
00:22:47,00:22:48,They burn sometimes.
00:22:48,00:22:50,It's amazing that they need fires.
00:22:50,00:22:52,The idea that there's a type of pine cone that has fire as part of its natural habitat.
00:22:52,00:22:53,I find it incredible.
00:22:53,00:22:54,But yeah.
00:22:54,00:22:55,But there are controlled fires.
00:22:55,00:22:56,You see them a lot.
00:22:56,00:22:57,I can't remember where.
00:22:57,00:22:58,I think you see them in Spain.
00:22:58,00:23:01,"But I think it's often to prevent other fires from actually happening, is to pre-empt"
00:23:01,00:23:02,the fire.
00:23:02,00:23:03,To that fire.
00:23:03,00:23:06,It is literally fighting fire with fires.
00:23:06,00:23:12,"I've got one more thing about fire, which is the record for the longest distance run while"
00:23:12,00:23:17,"on fire, which is 200 metres, which is pretty good."
00:23:17,00:23:19,How on fire was this person?
00:23:19,00:23:21,"At the beginning, he is so on fire."
00:23:21,00:23:23,"I mean, he's really, really, really aflame."
00:23:23,00:23:28,"By the end of it, it's just his back, which is on fire, because I think a lot of it is put"
00:23:28,00:23:33,"out over the course of the run, but he's an Austrian stuntman called Joe Tudling."
00:23:33,00:23:37,And he already had the record for the longest time on fire.
00:23:37,00:23:39,And then he broke this one.
00:23:39,00:23:40,"And then they said, ""What are you going to do next?"""
00:23:40,00:23:44,"And he said, ""Well, I've got three more records to break, which is the furthest distance"
00:23:44,00:23:46,"being pulled by a horse while on fire."""
00:23:46,00:23:51,And then the furthest distance being pulled by a quad bike while on fire.
00:23:51,00:23:53,And then a small motor vehicle while on fire.
00:23:53,00:23:54,So he's found his knee.
00:23:54,00:23:59,"I've had some time off, get married while on fire."
00:23:59,00:24:06,"Maybe retired, just from gardening while on fire."
00:24:06,00:24:12,"OK, time for our final fact, and that is Alex."
00:24:12,00:24:17,My fact this week is that the first recorded traffic casualty was a Roman pig who was run
00:24:17,00:24:21,over by a chariot carrying an ornamental phallus.
00:24:21,00:24:24,"OK, let's start with the chariot."
00:24:24,00:24:26,Why was it carrying a massive phallus?
00:24:26,00:24:32,"Well, because it was probably part of the Dionysic Festival, which was basically just this"
00:24:32,00:24:36,"big festival where they had loads of phalluses, it was also due with fertility and generally"
00:24:36,00:24:38,being a bit raucous.
00:24:38,00:24:42,"So we're sure it wasn't a metaphor, and then it wasn't just being driven by the Roman"
00:24:42,00:24:44,Pears Morgan.
00:24:44,00:24:49,"This fact is from the pig's Delhi of Odessa, which is basically a headstone, a tombstone,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,which has an old poem on it in Greek.
00:24:51,00:24:56,"It was Roman, but it was written in Greek, and also an engraving, a picture of the pig being"
00:24:56,00:24:58,run over by a cart which has a huge dick on it.
00:24:58,00:25:03,"And it's basically a sort of satirical, slightly funny headstone, because it's eulogising"
00:25:03,00:25:05,a pig rather than a person.
00:25:05,00:25:10,"But the pig was supposedly on his way on the Veeer Ignatia, which is the road he was on,"
00:25:10,00:25:15,"and was kind of all very excited about having a great life, and then got run over by a chariot."
00:25:15,00:25:16,It's very sad.
00:25:16,00:25:22,"And pigs are worse symbols of fertility, I think, as well at the time, everything is"
00:25:22,00:25:23,symbol of fertility.
00:25:23,00:25:29,"I want to know in ancient Greece, I think, ancient Greeks wore oaths over the testicles"
00:25:29,00:25:34,"of pigs, because I don't know why they would do that actually, just because it's a symbol"
00:25:34,00:25:35,of fertility.
00:25:35,00:25:36,It was a lot of the time.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Yeah.
00:25:37,00:25:38,Is that right?
00:25:38,00:25:41,"They always say that the word testimony comes from putting your hands over your genitals,"
00:25:41,00:25:43,which I'm pretty sure isn't true.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"Yeah, I think that's right."
00:25:44,00:25:47,But it'd be nice if instead it was the pig testicles where it came from.
00:25:47,00:25:48,It would.
00:25:48,00:25:49,"It's not true either, is it?"
00:25:49,00:25:50,No.
00:25:50,00:25:51,It would be nice.
00:25:51,00:25:55,I was kind of just looking at generally Roman pigs and what they got up to.
00:25:55,00:26:00,"There's accounts of the migarians, apparently, dipping pigs in oil, and setting fires to them,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,"and then driving towards elephants, and then the elephants would trample them and get"
00:26:03,00:26:05,"very scared and trample everyone, and there would just be general chaos."
00:26:05,00:26:10,"I was going to ask about that, because I remember half-remember reading a thing about setting"
00:26:10,00:26:14,"fire to pigs and thinking they were dragons or something, because they're screaming and"
00:26:14,00:26:15,there was fire and stuff like that.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"I think it's the noise that made them so scary, so it definitely hurts."
00:26:18,00:26:19,Yeah.
00:26:19,00:26:22,"And then the enemy elephants trample their own people to death, don't they?"
00:26:22,00:26:23,Yeah.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"But you have the elephants at the front of your army, is that the idea?"
00:26:25,00:26:29,"So when they see the pigs coming, they turn around and trample the enemy army."
00:26:29,00:26:30,Yeah.
00:26:30,00:26:35,"This is something really, really 100% completely not related at all."
00:26:35,00:26:39,"But I was reading this yesterday in Covent Garden and around here, they had some riots"
00:26:39,00:26:45,"when they changed the prices of theatres, and they called the op riots, and people shouted"
00:26:45,00:26:49,"op, op, and op meant old price, or it could have been OP or op."
00:26:49,00:26:53,"But one of the things that they did was, as soon as their play had started, everyone would"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"turn the backs to their play, and then start doing these chants and stuff like this."
00:26:57,00:27:02,"And another thing apparently they did was kind of prod pigs to make them squeal, like in"
00:27:02,00:27:05,"opportune times, to put off the actors."
00:27:05,00:27:10,"And just like the idea of, I don't know, kind of sneaking a pig into the pig."
00:27:10,00:27:11,Do you dress it up?
00:27:11,00:27:12,"I was like, oh, wait."
00:27:12,00:27:17,I like the idea that it wouldn't be distracting enough for an actor if just a person in the
00:27:17,00:27:18,audience started shrieking.
00:27:18,00:27:22,"Yeah, I tend to go to the trouble of smuggling a pig in."
00:27:22,00:27:27,Someone else who prodded pigs was Louis XI.
00:27:27,00:27:31,"I think went apparently when he was depressed, he liked to get pigs dressed up and have"
00:27:31,00:27:36,"them poked so they'd dance for him, and he constantly kept with him a dancing troop of pigs"
00:27:36,00:27:37,to entertain him.
00:27:37,00:27:39,"Is that Louis XI, King of France?"
00:27:39,00:27:40,Yes.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"Okay, cool."
00:27:41,00:27:42,Just checking.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Yes.
00:27:43,00:27:44,I think there's such a thing as too much power.
00:27:44,00:27:45,Are you doing that for entertainment?
00:27:45,00:27:49,"Yeah, you'd think you would sit back at one point and go, oh my gosh, what have I become?"
00:27:49,00:27:50,I'm not doing my life.
00:27:50,00:27:54,"But on the other hand, look at these great pigs."
00:27:54,00:27:57,You know we've talked about cat pianos on QI.
00:27:57,00:28:01,"So you have like 12 different cats, and they all make a different tone."
00:28:01,00:28:05,And you press a key and it hits the cat and they squeal at a different tone.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"And it was invented by a guy called Anastasius Kietcher, or something."
00:28:09,00:28:10,Yes.
00:28:10,00:28:16,"There is also a Pigginino, there was a Pigginino, which is the Pig equivalent."
00:28:16,00:28:21,"Oh, I thought it was a sandwich with a Pig in it, but just one sandwich, mate."
00:28:21,00:28:22,It wasn't.
00:28:22,00:28:24,It was a piano with a Pig in it.
00:28:24,00:28:25,It was a musical instrument.
00:28:25,00:28:30,"I think this might have been conceived by Louis XI as well, of France, because he liked"
00:28:30,00:28:32,the idea of torturing pigs for his own entertainment.
00:28:32,00:28:33,And the idea was conceived.
00:28:33,00:28:37,"I'm not sure if they ever made one, but he challenged someone to make one."
00:28:37,00:28:41,"And the idea is that, yeah, you pull a high load of pigs in a piano and then you bash them"
00:28:41,00:28:44,"with keys, which is a pretty big piano, so grand."
00:28:44,00:28:45,Yeah.
00:28:45,00:28:49,"I mean, it depends on the size of the keyboard, as if it's an 88 key piano, then yeah, massively."
00:28:49,00:28:50,Does it hit them?
00:28:50,00:28:52,Or does it pull the tails?
00:28:52,00:28:53,I just make them squeal.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"However, where you want to make them squeal is the idea."
00:28:56,00:28:57,I don't know.
00:28:57,00:28:58,"You could do a number of things, I guess."
00:28:58,00:29:00,There's a Pig Olympics.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Yeah.
00:29:01,00:29:02,There's Pig Olympics.
00:29:02,00:29:04,It's organised by the Sport Pig Federation.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"And there's Pig Running, Pig Swimming, Pig Hurdles, Pig Jumping."
00:29:06,00:29:07,Pig Hurdles!
00:29:07,00:29:08,Pig Football.
00:29:08,00:29:09,I'd rather watch Pig Hurdles.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Yeah.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"Yeah, no."
00:29:11,00:29:12,"It's just, you know, Pig Jumping with little hurdles."
00:29:12,00:29:15,"I think none of these sports, you watch them, and it's actually just pigs running around,"
00:29:15,00:29:16,"you know, thing."
00:29:16,00:29:21,"The football works, but they cover the football in fish oil, so they run around looking at them."
00:29:21,00:29:22,I've seen pigs playing football.
00:29:22,00:29:27,Are you not supposed to give pigs balls and stuff to play with because they get bored
00:29:27,00:29:28,otherwise?
00:29:28,00:29:29,"Yes, you law."
00:29:29,00:29:30,You have to give...
00:29:30,00:29:32,Farmers have to stimulate pigs.
00:29:32,00:29:35,Farmers have to give pigs stimulation.
00:29:35,00:29:36,Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:42,"I've done a bit of research on penis festivals, of course you have, to go on from ornamental"
00:29:42,00:29:43,palaces.
00:29:43,00:29:47,"So, there are some which still exist all over the world today."
00:29:47,00:29:50,"Where's the closest one to here, do you think?"
00:29:50,00:29:51,"Well, the closest one to here is..."
00:29:51,00:29:52,Is in 10 minutes time.
00:29:52,00:29:53,Is it?
00:29:53,00:29:54,It's got us.
00:29:54,00:29:57,I think that's in Greece.
00:29:57,00:29:58,OK.
00:29:58,00:30:03,"In a place called Tinevos, but in the Japanese city of Kawasaki, they have an annual festival"
00:30:03,00:30:04,of the steel phallus.
00:30:04,00:30:05,Do they?
00:30:05,00:30:09,"And they parade an enormous pink statue of a penis through the streets, and you can ride"
00:30:09,00:30:12,a battering ram which is shaped like a penis.
00:30:12,00:30:15,You can buy sweets which are shaped like penises.
00:30:15,00:30:16,You can dress as penises.
00:30:16,00:30:21,"I mean, just take any normal activity and replace the main noun with a penis."
00:30:21,00:30:24,You can dress as penis while on fire.
00:30:24,00:30:30,"Also, the massive effigy that they carry through the streets is called Elizabeth, for no discernible"
00:30:30,00:30:33,reason.
00:30:33,00:30:38,"In 2003, cabinet magazine held a world's most phallic building competition."
00:30:38,00:30:42,"The point was the Yipsilanti Water Tower in Michigan, which is nicknamed the Brick Dick."
00:30:42,00:30:46,"A lot of contenders for that prize, like every skyscraper."
00:30:46,00:30:47,Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:51,"So, just about phallic looking buildings, do you remember seeing that picture on Google"
00:30:51,00:30:53,Earth of a church that looked like a penis?
00:30:53,00:30:54,No.
00:30:54,00:31:01,"It was in Dixon, Illinois, and it kind of did the rounds a few years ago."
00:31:01,00:31:05,"And it really does, you know, you can see where they're coming from, really."
00:31:05,00:31:10,"But a spokesman for the church said, ""The church was not designed to be seen from above."""
00:31:10,00:31:15,"You hang on, when they say the building wasn't designed to be seen from above, all buildings"
00:31:15,00:31:19,"have architectural plans, which you will be able to see."
00:31:19,00:31:20,That's so true.
00:31:20,00:31:21,That's a really good point.
00:31:21,00:31:27,"One more thing on penises. I found a cabaret event that was held in March of this year, which"
00:31:27,00:31:31,was specifically for men with small penises.
00:31:31,00:31:36,"It was established by a fellow called Ant Smith, who says he has a small penis."
00:31:36,00:31:39,"I'm going to be very glad you named Jackson, I'm shocked."
00:31:39,00:31:43,"But he was in all the papers at the time, I mean, he was trying to publicise this."
00:31:43,00:31:46,"He was trying to get the word out there, saying, ""This is something that really worries"
00:31:46,00:31:50,"a lot of men, and just come to terms with it, and it was to help men come to terms with"
00:31:50,00:31:51,"it."""
00:31:51,00:31:56,And the entry fee was that you had to pay 50p per inch of declared penis.
00:31:56,00:31:59,"That's really good, I'm glad he's doing that."
00:31:59,00:32:04,And it is kind of ridiculous that we make fun of that and keep on stoking this ridiculous
00:32:04,00:32:05,fire.
00:32:05,00:32:06,I think we're celebrating it.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Small penises.
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Well, this kind of event."
00:32:08,00:32:12,"Yeah, I think we're all saying, ""Well done, Ant Smith."""
00:32:12,00:32:13,Definitely.
00:32:13,00:32:16,"But if I got along, I would have had to pay six quid."
00:32:16,00:32:21,"No, I'd have paid £1.50."
00:32:21,00:32:25,I'll just round it down.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"OK, that's all of our facts for this week."
00:32:27,00:32:28,Thanks very much for listening.
