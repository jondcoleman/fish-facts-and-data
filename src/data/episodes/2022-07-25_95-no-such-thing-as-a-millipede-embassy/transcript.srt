1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,260
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish coming to you from

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,980
 the QILs in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,180
 My name is Anna Toshinsky, I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Alex Bell and James Harkin.

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,540
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,780
 from the last seven days in no particular order here they are.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,820
 And that's starting with you Andy."

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,860
 My fact this week is that Czech dear still avoid crossing the Iron Curtain between Germany

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,100
 and the Czech Republic.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,820
 So they used to be the Iron Curtain which was a very very long electrified fence in between

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,100
 the two countries during the Cold War and at the end of the Cold War the Czech and the

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,980
 German authorities they established a nature reserve going across the country they thought

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,100
 this is a really nice idea, we'll have this huge habitat, all sorts of species, we'll

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,420
 have lots of them to play in and there'll be more animals as a result and it'll be good

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,020
 for biodiversity and it turns out 20 years later that dear on the Czech side just will not

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,020
 cross that border.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,100
 So what you're saying is that all dear are communist?

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,300
 These are red dear for a nice day.

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,500
 And the headline from the Wall Street Journal when this study was reported was "deep in the

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,860
 forest, Bambia remains the Cold War's last prisoner."

20
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,700
 She's a good headline.

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,940
 There's a strip through Germany which was called the death strip I think because it was that

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,740
 strip it was sort of like a five kilometer area between East and West Germany where you

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,460
 weren't allowed to cross and it was cordoned off with lots of barbed wire and walls and you

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,420
 know men with guns and high towers and stuff and because no one touched it, no humans touched

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,100
 it for about 50 years it's now got like more, it's the most biodiverse area in Germany.

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,940
 It's got more wildlife than your own journey.

27
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,180
 Is that supposedly true of Chernobyl as well?

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,700
 It is yes isn't it?

29
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,620
 The last leading to that old joke, why shouldn't you go wildlife spotting in Ukraine?

30
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
 Why?

31
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,780
 Because Chernobyl's biodiversity is very high and we can't run the risk of damaging it.

32
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,580
 Also Chernobyl fall off.

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,860
 Just going back to the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall, did you know I maybe everyone

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,140
 knows this but the Berlin Wall came down by accident kind of?

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
 Yeah, sort of.

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,900
 Yeah, so they were negotiations and there was going to be a change of how easily people

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,220
 were allowed to cross and they had a live television press conference which was a bit of a

38
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,420
 rarity then it was a bit of a novelty and the guy announcing it mixes words up quite a

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,460
 bit carried away so there's lots of changes happening they're all happening immediately

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,220
 and then people massed outside the wall.

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,820
 Yeah, there's footage of him when he's asked directly so when are people going to be able

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,700
 to cross freely between East and West Berlin and he sort of grapples with a bit of a press

43
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,220
 release and looks at the back of it and goes immediately and then they go for it.

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,500
 And I read a theory that the checkpoint guard who was in charge that day was a guy called

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,580
 Harold Yeager and he sort of caved in to all these protesters who came flooding towards

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:12,060
 him saying let us through and one of the ideas of why he would cave in is that he was waiting

47
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,220
 on the results of a cancer test I read in one article and he was nervous and worried

48
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,620
 about that and he just sort of thought oh bugger this I'm you know I'll let them get through

49
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
 he was fine by the way.

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
 This needs to be a movie.

51
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
 It's amazing.

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,620
 Yeah.

53
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,260
 Just on that there was a thing in the I think it was the second world war where shortly

54
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,860
 after like the horrible defeat at Dunkirk and you know things were looking really, really

55
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,940
 bad for Britain.

56
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,700
 I think it was about this time and there was a sort of offer from Germany or an offer

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,500
 of a negotiated settlement and the BBC Newsreader who was announcing the terms of this

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,860
 said well obviously we're not going to accept that way before anyone and you know true

59
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,500
 enough they did decline but he said afterwards yeah I read us that was a bit strong.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 Do you know who invented the phrase Iron Curtain?

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,300
 Winston Churchill.

62
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
 Everyone says it was Churchill.

63
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
 Everyone says it in that stupid vice.

64
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,380
 It's almost as if they know it's the wrong answer.

65
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,940
 Gerbil's used it before Churchill did and before that it was used by an author called Ethel

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,780
 Snowden in 1920 but Gerbil's wrote it way before Churchill did and he wrote an article

67
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,620
 called The Year 2000 where he was predicting exactly what was going to happen in the year

68
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,940
 2000 and he said that our children's children will also have had children and the events of

69
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,900
 this war would have sunk into myth.

70
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,580
 The first bit of that prediction actually isn't that impressive.

71
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
 Nice true.

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,780
 But he also said one more fly from Berlin to Paris for breakfast in 15 minutes.

73
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,060
 It takes longer than that though doesn't it?

74
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,500
 I mean even getting through security takes longer than that.

75
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,900
 Yeah so Gerbil's was wrong.

76
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,860
 About loads of things that I like to say.

77
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
 Sorry.

78
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,860
 So there are two species of millipede in Tasmania that never meet each other.

79
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,860
 Oh yeah.

80
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
 Okay.

81
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,220
 There's like an invisible line that they never cross but the interesting thing about it

82
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,340
 is it doesn't follow any kind of rivers or hills or natural contours is just like an

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,740
 invisible line and no one knows why.

84
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,900
 Rob Meziboff who's a millipede specialist.

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,220
 He said it has got nothing to do with the environment.

86
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,260
 It's like a political thing between these two species.

87
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
 Oh wow.

88
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
 Is it a leg dispute?

89
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,900
 It feels like it's going to be a leg dispute isn't it?

90
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
 That's just stereotyping.

91
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,500
 You think that everything that millipedes do is to do with their legs?

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 Yeah.

93
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 98 legs good.

94
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 99 legs bad.

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,580
 But there might be, I mean you might, the thing is you're so long as a millipede that

96
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,140
 you might end up in enemy territory without realising it.

97
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
 You've got your back off.

98
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
 Yeah.

99
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,460
 If you're like backing up somewhere.

100
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,740
 Can millipedes walk backwards if they want to?

101
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,380
 I think they probably can.

102
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,380
 I think they probably can't.

103
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,380
 Why really?

104
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,460
 Why wouldn't they be able to any more than anyone else?

105
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,380
 I think because it's a really tough job to coordinate that many legs surely.

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,380
 Okay.

107
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,380
 Okay.

108
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,580
 If there are any millipede experts listening, if you could tweet me at egg shapes and the

109
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,780
 at Andrew Hunter M and let us know which of us is correct here, I think there's a

110
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
 pint riding on it.

111
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,780
 Yeah.

112
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:26,300
 And there are a couple of instances where the millipedes that belong to one side have ended

113
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,980
 up in a little blob on the other side and they think maybe they were taken over accidentally

114
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,020
 on a truck and then but they still aren't mingling.

115
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
 Maybe they're embassies.

116
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
 Oh yeah.

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,020
 They're millipede embassies.

118
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
 That's what it is.

119
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
 Yeah.

120
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
 That's quite cool.

121
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,100
 I think it's called parapetric speciation and it's where I think there are like two populations

122
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,340
 of an animal that don't mingle and usually it's because there's a ditch in between them

123
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,260
 or there's some kind of topographical or geographical reason for it.

124
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
 Or millipede racism.

125
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,260
 Or millipede racism.

126
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,420
 Or we put a great big wall up for you isn't it?

127
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,180
 But yeah and it means that populations tend not to mingle with each other at all.

128
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,180
 They'll rub up against each other.

129
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,820
 They'll occasionally have a chat but they'll only really make with the people on their

130
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
 side.

131
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,020
 Especially that creates and that means they spur up into two different species.

132
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,180
 And it also happens with velvet walking worms in Tasmania, that's another mystery.

133
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,740
 So maybe Tasmanians are just unbelievably anti-social.

134
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,580
 Sorry, this is a walking worm.

135
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,580
 Yeah, that sounds amazing.

136
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
 That's right.

137
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,580
 A velvet walking worm.

138
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,740
 I didn't look into the explanation for the name.

139
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,060
 What I imagine is that the worm, it doesn't have any legs but it kind of squeezes itself

140
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,940
 up into two halves and walks like a pair of legs.

141
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,540
 Let's just go on believing is that they're never Google it, anyone, nobody Google it.

142
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,740
 Another thing is that there is a species of shark called mecosharks and there's a line underneath

143
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,140
 the sea where if you catch a shark from one side of it then it will be male and if you catch

144
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,540
 one from the other side of it it'll always be female.

145
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,580
 And that's why that is either.

146
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,460
 Do they only have sex on either side of the line?

147
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,780
 They must just come together for one part of the year I guess.

148
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,180
 Speaking of sex on borders.

149
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,780
 I think it's in Switzerland.

150
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,580
 That's the last time you're invited to that bookshelf.

151
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,500
 I think it's in Switzerland, on the border of Switzerland and maybe France or another country.

152
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,220
 There's a hotel with a penthouse in it and the penthouse bed is on the border.

153
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,260
 Cool, so you can take off two countries in one go.

154
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,740
 I don't know if you need passports or anything.

155
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,300
 Are you taking off all the countries?

156
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,180
 Yeah, and it's so irritating because I don't enjoy sex so the idea being able to take off

157
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,020
 multiple countries in one attempt.

158
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,620
 That's a dream country.

159
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
 Dear.

160
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
 Yes, dear.

161
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
 Oh, dear.

162
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,620
 Dear aren't always herbivores.

163
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
 Really?

164
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,220
 They've been caught eating birds, out straight out the nest, other meats and stuff like that.

165
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,460
 And so apparently there are several species that will or quite a lot of species that will

166
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,380
 eat meat if it's available.

167
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
 Really?

168
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,740
 And on a related note, cows, I've watched a video today of a cow eating a live chicken just

169
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
 off the ground.

170
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,220
 You're a sick puppy, Alex.

171
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,740
 And also, dear, don't have gallbladders.

172
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,180
 That's the only other thing I have about them.

173
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,340
 How do they blotter their gallblad?

174
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
 Warful.

175
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,420
 I know what you're saying.

176
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:23,260
 OK, time for fact number two and that is James's facts.

177
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,500
 My fact this week is that if every car in Monaco decided to go for a drive at the same

178
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,780
 time, they wouldn't fit on the roads.

179
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,660
 How much time have you been working that out?

180
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
 Not so much.

181
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,180
 So this comes from the economist world in figures, I think it's called, which is a yearly

182
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,500
 book that has loads of statistics in it.

183
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,740
 And the length of the Monaco road system, if you divide it by the number of cars, is less

184
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,780
 than the average length of a car, according to my calculations.

185
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,700
 Which if they're wrong, please don't write it.

186
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,180
 But I reckon that each car had about, you know, just around two metres of space and definitely

187
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,780
 cars along the amount of an average.

188
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,780
 Yeah, wow.

189
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,180
 Should we do a test and ask everyone in Monaco to get in their cars and go on to the roads?

190
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,540
 Now, if you're listening to prove this fact wrong.

191
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,060
 Because this is a podcast, people listen at different times.

192
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
 Oh, yeah.

193
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
 No, you're right.

194
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
 We'd need to arrange that.

195
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,140
 And we need the entire population of Monaco to be listeners.

196
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
 I'm fairly sure they are.

197
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
 I think that's all the policies.

198
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,380
 Obviously, also forgetting that's an incredibly irresponsible thing to do as well.

199
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
 Of course, multiple days.

200
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,940
 No one said this is a perfect plan, guys.

201
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,580
 So does Monaco have more cars per capita than anywhere else in the world?

202
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,700
 I think it does, and if not, it's in the top two.

203
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,100
 I read that they've got, and these figures are a couple of years old, 771 cars per

204
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
 thousand citizens.

205
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,660
 Yeah, it's a bit more than that now.

206
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
 Okay.

207
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,340
 So that sounds like a lot, considering how many citizens there are, or how few citizens

208
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
 there are.

209
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,660
 It's the second most populated country on Earth, I think.

210
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
 It's China.

211
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,020
 It's amazing considering Monaco is only two square kilometers, but it's got just shy

212
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,260
 of a billion people living in it.

213
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
 Order.

214
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
 Order.

215
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
 Sorry.

216
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
 Alex.

217
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,780
 Yes, because apparently Monaco is also the second most densely populated country on Earth

218
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,220
 after some place in China, I think.

219
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
 Like how?

220
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
 I could be.

221
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,900
 Anyway, it's the second most densely populated country on Earth.

222
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,820
 And they also have more cars than any other people in Earth as well.

223
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,780
 And one whole third of them are millionaires, 30% of the population of Monaco.

224
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
 300 million.

225
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:40,220
 That's right, there are 30,000 people living in two square kilometers, so it's incredibly

226
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
 densely populated.

227
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,940
 It really skews the statistics, doesn't it, because they have like 100% literacy rates,

228
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,260
 and I give the life expectancy is like 98 or something ridiculous.

229
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
 Yeah.

230
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,180
 In fact, it's also the oldest country in terms of the proportion of the population who are

231
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,060
 aged over 65, so there it's 27.8% of the population.

232
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,820
 So in the UK it's about 17%, 18%.

233
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:12,540
 So as a result of that, in 2009 Monaco spent 1.2% of its GDP on education, essentially there

234
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,580
 are no children.

235
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,980
 When you were saying the size of it is 2 square kilometers, I like to say that it's almost exactly

236
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,580
 the same size as chipping, sodbury quarry, because when I Google things that were 2 square kilometers

237
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,860
 in size that was the first thing we did.

238
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,860
 That's very cool.

239
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,820
 I think your Google result may be personalized.

240
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,300
 There's another thing which is 2 square kilometers in size, which is the largest building

241
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,540
 in the world, which is in China.

242
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:49,180
 This single shopping centre is 1.76 million square meters, and that is the total area of

243
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
 Monaco basically.

244
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,180
 Wow.

245
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,660
 Because they say that a lot of the biggest buildings are aircraft hangers, aren't they?

246
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
 Oh yeah.

247
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,220
 It's amazing seeing aircraft factories and how big they are as well, because those are the

248
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,740
 same as, you know, they're really, really, really massive aircraft hangers, you know.

249
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,620
 I was watching a video of, this is really off topic, but I was watching a video of a German

250
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,460
 factory that makes houses, basically like, entire houses of the flat back.

251
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,260
 And the whole factory is sort of this big white sterile place, and nothing touches the floor.

252
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,980
 Everything is suspended from the ceiling.

253
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,980
 Wow.

254
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
 Yeah.

255
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
 Why is that?

256
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,860
 Just in the interest of kind of tidiness and cleanliness and, you know, you can't lose anything.

257
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,460
 Everything sort of, everything, all the bits are always kind of hanging and going from

258
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
 rails and stuff.

259
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
 Oh, that is a weird thing.

260
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,460
 Really, I've got some DIY to do this weekend at my place.

261
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,980
 Is that why they call it a aircraft hanger, because they hang clothes?

262
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
 No.

263
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
 It's hangar, isn't it?

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,980
 Yeah.

265
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
 Isn't it?

266
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
 What on earth is that?

267
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
 That's not a word.

268
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
 No, but it's like a coat hanger.

269
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
 But it's not a coat hanger.

270
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,180
 I actually have a coat hanger, which is for all my coats.

271
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,420
 I've just got all so many millions of coats.

272
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:01,300
 Because it's such a loser.

273
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,180
 Actually, speaking of planes, so your fact is about all the cars not fitting on the road.

274
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,100
 Is the same true for all the planes fitting in the sky?

275
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
 No.

276
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
 Yes.

277
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
 No, the opposite.

278
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
 I know what you're going to say.

279
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
 All the planes fitting on the ground.

280
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
 Yeah.

281
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
 I have heard that.

282
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,620
 That's why there's always planes in the air because they wouldn't fit all fit in the

283
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,620
 air pots.

284
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,620
 And they used to say during the millennium when the millennium was coming, everyone said,

285
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
 "Oh, gosh.

286
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
 What are we going to do?

287
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,620
 We're going to have to ground all the planes, but they weren't fitting the airports."

288
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,220
 But I've slightly looked into it and it's definitely not true.

289
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,260
 I think the only thing is they wouldn't all be able to fit in an airport whilst being connected

290
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,220
 to an airport, so passengers could board them.

291
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,700
 Because I mean, airports are huge, airplanes only take up about a 20th of them.

292
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,980
 The rest is just tarmac.

293
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
 So I think they could all fit.

294
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,380
 I mean, again, if you're a pilot or a millipede, do write in if you think that's not right.

295
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,500
 It would be an act of confidence to build and deliver it under capacity in all the airports

296
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,900
 in the world, like Ryanair booking more people onto a flight than actually some people

297
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
 won't turn up.

298
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:04,540
 So they probably built the airports and then made more planes, rather than thought, "Well,

299
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,620
 this is the maximum number of planes we're ever going to build."

300
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,580
 Now let's start on the airport.

301
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,380
 So your fact is about lots of people going out and doing something at the same time.

302
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,980
 Yes, it is.

303
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,740
 So I was looking at a couple of things all humans could do at the same time that might make

304
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,620
 a big difference to the world.

305
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,500
 So Carton Driver magazine worked out in the course of a really quite long article, a lot

306
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,420
 of maths, that if everyone in the world got in their cars at once and put their foot on

307
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,420
 the accelerator all at once, pointing in the same direction, then the opposing force that

308
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:46,940
 would create from the earth would cause the rotation of the earth to speed up by 0.1 miles

309
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
 per hour.

310
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,900
 Which means you make the day longer, so you get there faster.

311
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,500
 Yeah, it's a perfect way to stop itself being late.

312
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,340
 But the traffic would be really bad because everyone is out on the road.

313
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,500
 It's a good point.

314
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,180
 It's a flawed plan, again.

315
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,580
 So Monaco is famous for its grompries, and this fact is about Monaco and Cars.

316
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,780
 Actually the second ever grompry was held in Monaco.

317
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,940
 The race was mowed after a large pile-up on the first lap when an enormous wave from the

318
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,580
 half of flooded the course.

319
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
 Oh my god.

320
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
 I know.

321
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
 Is that amazing?

322
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,300
 So were they all just going in and then they all just left there, covered in seaweed?

323
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
 That would be amazing.

324
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
 That would be amazing.

325
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
 And by making a squid in the car next to them.

326
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,460
 It's very like wacky races, isn't it?

327
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
 Was that the one?

328
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,340
 So there was a guy called William Grover Williams who was the winner of the first Monaco

329
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
 grompry.

330
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
 Was it in 1929?

331
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,700
 Or, anyway, I think the first Monaco grompry was in 1929 and the winner was this guy called

332
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,540
 William Grover Williams.

333
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,580
 And he went on to become a spy because I think he was employed for the French resistance

334
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,900
 in World War II as a driver and it turned out he had quite a lot of other talents.

335
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
 What was his name?

336
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
 William Grover Williams?

337
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,260
 It feels like he's a spy and they've got what's your name and he goes William Williams?

338
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,500
 It sounds also, it's exactly the same as Bond James Bond, so to be fair, you know.

339
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 Oh, you're right.

340
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 The name's William.

341
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 Grover Williams.

342
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 Anyway, apparently so he was allegedly the Nazis claimed captured and executed but there

343
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,660
 were a lot of sightings of him afterwards and Rumor had it that he became a grocer in

344
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
 sorry.

345
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,940
 It's William Grover Williams.

346
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:31,020
 Just going back to the Monaco grompry in 2004 when Oceans 12 came out, they did a publicity

347
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,260
 stunt where the Jaguar cars in the race were fitted with a new nose cone, each of which

348
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:43,100
 had a diamond worth in excess of $300,000 inside the nose cone.

349
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,780
 During the first lap, Jaguar driver Christian Klein crashed his diamond encrusted car.

350
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,140
 They weren't allowed to go straight to kind of sort out the car because they had to do it

351
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,380
 after the race finished and by the time they got there, they couldn't find the diamond.

352
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,980
 And no one knows where the diamond is to this day.

353
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,620
 I bet one person knows.

354
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:12,940
 OK, time for fact number three and that is my facts.

355
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,260
 My fact this week is at the town of Centrelia in Pennsylvania has been on fire since 1962.

356
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,740
 So people aren't entirely sure how the fire started, but it's thought that people were burning

357
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
 trash.

358
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:31,820
 So there's just a heap of trash or garbage in Centrelia and they set fire to it.

359
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,500
 And the thing about Centrelia is they had a huge network of mines sort of underneath it

360
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,780
 and largely towards the outskirts of it.

361
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,860
 And the fire kind of fell down into one of the mines and their coal mines.

362
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,420
 And so obviously coal sets fire quite easily.

363
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,420
 Pretty quite well.

364
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,860
 And so the coal does caught fire and it's been going ever since.

365
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,180
 And they keep trying to put it out or they kept trying to put it out up until the 80s and

366
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,980
 then they just gave up.

367
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,380
 And yeah, you have a population of over a thousand and now its population is 11 I think.

368
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
 Oh, I've heard seven.

369
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
 Has it gone down?

370
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
 2010, there were tens.

371
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,340
 I can't find somebody moved there.

372
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,660
 Come to Centrelia, it's on fire.

373
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,180
 It's an incredible story.

374
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,180
 It's so weird.

375
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,860
 There's not unusual these things across America.

376
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,020
 There are hundreds of all across the world in fact.

377
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,940
 So I think there are over 200 other mine fires in America.

378
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,140
 There are thousands in China where there are lots of coal mines obviously.

379
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,100
 Apparently in total, these coal fires account for 3% of the world's CO2 emissions, which

380
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
 just is insane.

381
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,540
 And so they're not all people chucking stuff down.

382
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,740
 I think sometimes it's natural and there are all sorts of other occurrences of underground

383
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,340
 fires made, but many coal produced at CO2, three percent.

384
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,660
 I read that the ones in China alone are 1% of the world's CO2.

385
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
 Yeah.

386
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,100
 A couple years ago, the Chinese government said that they'd been putting them out and they

387
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
 were just lying.

388
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,940
 And all these kind of things went wrong saying, I can still see the fire down there.

389
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,620
 But the main one is the one in Australia.

390
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,100
 You guys must have all seen that one right?

391
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
 Yeah.

392
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,420
 Burning mountain, which has been going for 5,500 years.

393
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
 Yeah, it's mountain.

394
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,900
 I don't think you can blame that on us.

395
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
 That wasn't trash burning.

396
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,500
 Well, I read about the ex-possible explanations for Burning Mountain and apparently scientists

397
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,380
 think it may have been caused by a lightning strike or spontaneous combustion, which is very

398
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,180
 much science-speak for, we don't know.

399
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,260
 Also in Pennsylvania and Texas and some other places, you can get flammable water.

400
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
 So...

401
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
 petrol.

402
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
 Yeah.

403
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,500
 Now what means some of that flammable water for my power?

404
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 It's water.

405
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,660
 It can even be drinking water that's just got high levels of methane trapped inside it.

406
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,740
 And if you put a match to it, it will go in flames of it.

407
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
 Really?

408
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,020
 And if you've got sort of level water, you can sort of set fire to the surface of it, a bit

409
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,540
 like when you set fire to brandy on your Christmas pudding.

410
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,740
 And there are videos online you can watch this woman just lighting, setting fire to the

411
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
 water coming out of her kitchen taps.

412
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,740
 I do watch them on the internet.

413
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
 Do you watch them on the internet?

414
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
 Do you watch them on the internet?

415
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,740
 Do you watch them on the video?

416
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,460
 It must be really dangerous, though, because surely if the fire travels along the pipe.

417
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,460
 It never really catches that much because there's not enough methane in the water.

418
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,460
 Okay.

419
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,460
 And there's water as well, so.

420
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
 Oh, yeah, true.

421
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,660
 Here's the thing about coal fires.

422
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,700
 When the Titanic set sail out of Southampton, she was on fire in the coal bunker because that

423
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,100
 was what the Titanic's fuel was, huge, huge bunkers of coal.

424
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,640
 There was a fire in there which had been burning, possibly since the 2nd April, which was eight

425
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 days before.

426
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,140
 A fire that wasn't supposed to be burning that wasn't being used to fuel the...

427
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,140
 Exactly.

428
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,100
 Yeah, yeah, just in the coal bunkers there was a fire happening and the crew took a day

429
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
 to put it out.

430
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,860
 I can't believe they didn't spot it for a week.

431
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
 The whole thinking thing is dying to make sense.

432
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
 It was very slam-past.

433
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
 It was negligent crews.

434
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,220
 Maybe what they were thinking is what we need as an enormous amount of very, very cold water.

435
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,380
 Be careful what you wish for, Frank.

436
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,020
 Fire is a really important in nature, aren't they?

437
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,420
 Especially in America, some of their big trees like the Sequoias.

438
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,300
 They rely on forest fires to kind of keep them healthy and keep them regrowing.

439
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:12,460
 Not because in America, everywhere, really, they have this kind of anti-forest fire thing,

440
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,900
 which is essentially to stop people from throwing cigarette butts around, but actually kind

441
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,980
 of says that all fire is bad.

442
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,940
 Whenever there's a fire, they try and put it out really, really quickly, which actually

443
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,740
 can be quite bad for the ecosystem because you do need these fires for things like sequoias

444
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
 to grow.

445
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,100
 Yeah, you do, because they have pine cones, isn't it?

446
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,100
 There are certain pine cones which are held together really tightly by resin that relies

447
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,140
 on fire to get hot enough that it, the resin melts and it seeds, so...

448
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,980
 I'm not saying we should set fire to every forest, but you know, the odd little fire is

449
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
 quite important.

450
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,780
 Occasional tree wouldn't hurt, guys.

451
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,380
 Other forests where they have managed fires, sometimes.

452
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
 Yes.

453
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
 They burn sometimes.

454
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,420
 It's amazing that they need fires.

455
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,940
 The idea that there's a type of pine cone that has fire as part of its natural habitat.

456
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
 I find it incredible.

457
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
 But yeah.

458
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
 But there are controlled fires.

459
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
 You see them a lot.

460
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
 I can't remember where.

461
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
 I think you see them in Spain.

462
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,460
 But I think it's often to prevent other fires from actually happening, is to pre-empt

463
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
 the fire.

464
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
 To that fire.

465
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,460
 It is literally fighting fire with fires.

466
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,060
 I've got one more thing about fire, which is the record for the longest distance run while

467
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:17,900
 on fire, which is 200 metres, which is pretty good.

468
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,300
 How on fire was this person?

469
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,420
 At the beginning, he is so on fire.

470
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,820
 I mean, he's really, really, really aflame.

471
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,100
 By the end of it, it's just his back, which is on fire, because I think a lot of it is put

472
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,780
 out over the course of the run, but he's an Austrian stuntman called Joe Tudling.

473
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,540
 And he already had the record for the longest time on fire.

474
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,140
 And then he broke this one.

475
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,740
 And then they said, "What are you going to do next?"

476
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,500
 And he said, "Well, I've got three more records to break, which is the furthest distance

477
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,820
 being pulled by a horse while on fire."

478
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,180
 And then the furthest distance being pulled by a quad bike while on fire.

479
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,700
 And then a small motor vehicle while on fire.

480
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
 So he's found his knee.

481
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,460
 I've had some time off, get married while on fire.

482
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:06,460
 Maybe retired, just from gardening while on fire.

483
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,260
 OK, time for our final fact, and that is Alex.

484
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,500
 My fact this week is that the first recorded traffic casualty was a Roman pig who was run

485
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,900
 over by a chariot carrying an ornamental phallus.

486
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,340
 OK, let's start with the chariot.

487
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,380
 Why was it carrying a massive phallus?

488
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,140
 Well, because it was probably part of the Dionysic Festival, which was basically just this

489
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,900
 big festival where they had loads of phalluses, it was also due with fertility and generally

490
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,580
 being a bit raucous.

491
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,020
 So we're sure it wasn't a metaphor, and then it wasn't just being driven by the Roman

492
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,580
 Pears Morgan.

493
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,900
 This fact is from the pig's Delhi of Odessa, which is basically a headstone, a tombstone,

494
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,540
 which has an old poem on it in Greek.

495
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,060
 It was Roman, but it was written in Greek, and also an engraving, a picture of the pig being

496
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,700
 run over by a cart which has a huge dick on it.

497
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,700
 And it's basically a sort of satirical, slightly funny headstone, because it's eulogising

498
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,980
 a pig rather than a person.

499
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,660
 But the pig was supposedly on his way on the Veeer Ignatia, which is the road he was on,

500
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,100
 and was kind of all very excited about having a great life, and then got run over by a chariot.

501
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
 It's very sad.

502
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,860
 And pigs are worse symbols of fertility, I think, as well at the time, everything is

503
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
 symbol of fertility.

504
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,660
 I want to know in ancient Greece, I think, ancient Greeks wore oaths over the testicles

505
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,060
 of pigs, because I don't know why they would do that actually, just because it's a symbol

506
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
 of fertility.

507
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
 It was a lot of the time.

508
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
 Yeah.

509
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
 Is that right?

510
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,780
 They always say that the word testimony comes from putting your hands over your genitals,

511
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,020
 which I'm pretty sure isn't true.

512
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
 Yeah, I think that's right.

513
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,700
 But it'd be nice if instead it was the pig testicles where it came from.

514
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
 It would.

515
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
 It's not true either, is it?

516
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
 No.

517
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
 It would be nice.

518
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,260
 I was kind of just looking at generally Roman pigs and what they got up to.

519
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,420
 There's accounts of the migarians, apparently, dipping pigs in oil, and setting fires to them,

520
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,300
 and then driving towards elephants, and then the elephants would trample them and get

521
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,540
 very scared and trample everyone, and there would just be general chaos.

522
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,180
 I was going to ask about that, because I remember half-remember reading a thing about setting

523
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,660
 fire to pigs and thinking they were dragons or something, because they're screaming and

524
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
 there was fire and stuff like that.

525
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,220
 I think it's the noise that made them so scary, so it definitely hurts.

526
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
 Yeah.

527
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,220
 And then the enemy elephants trample their own people to death, don't they?

528
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,220
 Yeah.

529
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,300
 But you have the elephants at the front of your army, is that the idea?

530
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,660
 So when they see the pigs coming, they turn around and trample the enemy army.

531
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
 Yeah.

532
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,220
 This is something really, really 100% completely not related at all.

533
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,900
 But I was reading this yesterday in Covent Garden and around here, they had some riots

534
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,260
 when they changed the prices of theatres, and they called the op riots, and people shouted

535
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,700
 op, op, and op meant old price, or it could have been OP or op.

536
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,380
 But one of the things that they did was, as soon as their play had started, everyone would

537
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,780
 turn the backs to their play, and then start doing these chants and stuff like this.

538
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,860
 And another thing apparently they did was kind of prod pigs to make them squeal, like in

539
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,740
 opportune times, to put off the actors.

540
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,140
 And just like the idea of, I don't know, kind of sneaking a pig into the pig.

541
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,140
 Do you dress it up?

542
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
 I was like, oh, wait.

543
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,140
 I like the idea that it wouldn't be distracting enough for an actor if just a person in the

544
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
 audience started shrieking.

545
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,660
 Yeah, I tend to go to the trouble of smuggling a pig in.

546
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,820
 Someone else who prodded pigs was Louis XI.

547
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,620
 I think went apparently when he was depressed, he liked to get pigs dressed up and have

548
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,420
 them poked so they'd dance for him, and he constantly kept with him a dancing troop of pigs

549
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
 to entertain him.

550
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,620
 Is that Louis XI, King of France?

551
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,620
 Yes.

552
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
 Okay, cool.

553
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
 Just checking.

554
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
 Yes.

555
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
 I think there's such a thing as too much power.

556
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,620
 Are you doing that for entertainment?

557
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,260
 Yeah, you'd think you would sit back at one point and go, oh my gosh, what have I become?

558
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
 I'm not doing my life.

559
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,100
 But on the other hand, look at these great pigs.

560
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,660
 You know we've talked about cat pianos on QI.

561
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,420
 So you have like 12 different cats, and they all make a different tone.

562
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,540
 And you press a key and it hits the cat and they squeal at a different tone.

563
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,500
 And it was invented by a guy called Anastasius Kietcher, or something.

564
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 Yes.

565
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,100
 There is also a Pigginino, there was a Pigginino, which is the Pig equivalent.

566
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,660
 Oh, I thought it was a sandwich with a Pig in it, but just one sandwich, mate.

567
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,660
 It wasn't.

568
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,700
 It was a piano with a Pig in it.

569
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
 It was a musical instrument.

570
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,260
 I think this might have been conceived by Louis XI as well, of France, because he liked

571
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,820
 the idea of torturing pigs for his own entertainment.

572
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
 And the idea was conceived.

573
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,780
 I'm not sure if they ever made one, but he challenged someone to make one.

574
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,660
 And the idea is that, yeah, you pull a high load of pigs in a piano and then you bash them

575
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,540
 with keys, which is a pretty big piano, so grand.

576
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
 Yeah.

577
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,580
 I mean, it depends on the size of the keyboard, as if it's an 88 key piano, then yeah, massively.

578
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
 Does it hit them?

579
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
 Or does it pull the tails?

580
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
 I just make them squeal.

581
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,140
 However, where you want to make them squeal is the idea.

582
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
 I don't know.

583
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,380
 You could do a number of things, I guess.

584
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,380
 There's a Pig Olympics.

585
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
 Yeah.

586
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
 There's Pig Olympics.

587
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,100
 It's organised by the Sport Pig Federation.

588
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,860
 And there's Pig Running, Pig Swimming, Pig Hurdles, Pig Jumping.

589
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
 Pig Hurdles!

590
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
 Pig Football.

591
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
 I'd rather watch Pig Hurdles.

592
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,860
 Yeah.

593
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,860
 Yeah, no.

594
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,860
 It's just, you know, Pig Jumping with little hurdles.

595
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,860
 I think none of these sports, you watch them, and it's actually just pigs running around,

596
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,860
 you know, thing.

597
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,100
 The football works, but they cover the football in fish oil, so they run around looking at them.

598
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,380
 I've seen pigs playing football.

599
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,580
 Are you not supposed to give pigs balls and stuff to play with because they get bored

600
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,580
 otherwise?

601
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,580
 Yes, you law.

602
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
 You have to give...

603
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
 Farmers have to stimulate pigs.

604
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,340
 Farmers have to give pigs stimulation.

605
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,340
 Yeah.

606
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,820
 I've done a bit of research on penis festivals, of course you have, to go on from ornamental

607
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
 palaces.

608
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,420
 So, there are some which still exist all over the world today.

609
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,220
 Where's the closest one to here, do you think?

610
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
 Well, the closest one to here is...

611
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,220
 Is in 10 minutes time.

612
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,220
 Is it?

613
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,220
 It's got us.

614
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,220
 I think that's in Greece.

615
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,220
 OK.

616
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,540
 In a place called Tinevos, but in the Japanese city of Kawasaki, they have an annual festival

617
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
 of the steel phallus.

618
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
 Do they?

619
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,900
 And they parade an enormous pink statue of a penis through the streets, and you can ride

620
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,540
 a battering ram which is shaped like a penis.

621
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,020
 You can buy sweets which are shaped like penises.

622
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,340
 You can dress as penises.

623
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,740
 I mean, just take any normal activity and replace the main noun with a penis.

624
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,940
 You can dress as penis while on fire.

625
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,580
 Also, the massive effigy that they carry through the streets is called Elizabeth, for no discernible

626
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,100
 reason.

627
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,100
 In 2003, cabinet magazine held a world's most phallic building competition.

628
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,540
 The point was the Yipsilanti Water Tower in Michigan, which is nicknamed the Brick Dick.

629
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,020
 A lot of contenders for that prize, like every skyscraper.

630
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,020
 Yeah.

631
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,220
 So, just about phallic looking buildings, do you remember seeing that picture on Google

632
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,820
 Earth of a church that looked like a penis?

633
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,820
 No.

634
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:01,420
 It was in Dixon, Illinois, and it kind of did the rounds a few years ago.

635
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,660
 And it really does, you know, you can see where they're coming from, really.

636
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,620
 But a spokesman for the church said, "The church was not designed to be seen from above."

637
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,340
 You hang on, when they say the building wasn't designed to be seen from above, all buildings

638
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,100
 have architectural plans, which you will be able to see.

639
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
 That's so true.

640
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
 That's a really good point.

641
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,660
 One more thing on penises. I found a cabaret event that was held in March of this year, which

642
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,460
 was specifically for men with small penises.

643
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,020
 It was established by a fellow called Ant Smith, who says he has a small penis.

644
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,860
 I'm going to be very glad you named Jackson, I'm shocked.

645
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,500
 But he was in all the papers at the time, I mean, he was trying to publicise this.

646
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,940
 He was trying to get the word out there, saying, "This is something that really worries

647
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,620
 a lot of men, and just come to terms with it, and it was to help men come to terms with

648
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,620
 it."

649
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,500
 And the entry fee was that you had to pay 50p per inch of declared penis.

650
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,580
 That's really good, I'm glad he's doing that.

651
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,380
 And it is kind of ridiculous that we make fun of that and keep on stoking this ridiculous

652
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
 fire.

653
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,380
 I think we're celebrating it.

654
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,380
 Small penises.

655
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,860
 Well, this kind of event.

656
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,060
 Yeah, I think we're all saying, "Well done, Ant Smith."

657
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,060
 Definitely.

658
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,100
 But if I got along, I would have had to pay six quid.

659
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,420
 No, I'd have paid £1.50.

660
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,660
 I'll just round it down.

661
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,740
 OK, that's all of our facts for this week.

662
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
