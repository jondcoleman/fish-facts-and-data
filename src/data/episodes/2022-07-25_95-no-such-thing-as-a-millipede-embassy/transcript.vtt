00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish coming to you from

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.980
 the QILs in Covent Garden.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.180
 My name is Anna Toshinsky, I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Alex Bell and James Harkin.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.540
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.780
 from the last seven days in no particular order here they are.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.820
 And that's starting with you Andy."

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.860
 My fact this week is that Czech dear still avoid crossing the Iron Curtain between Germany

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.100
 and the Czech Republic.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.820
 So they used to be the Iron Curtain which was a very very long electrified fence in between

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.100
 the two countries during the Cold War and at the end of the Cold War the Czech and the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 German authorities they established a nature reserve going across the country they thought

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.100
 this is a really nice idea, we'll have this huge habitat, all sorts of species, we'll

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.420
 have lots of them to play in and there'll be more animals as a result and it'll be good

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.020
 for biodiversity and it turns out 20 years later that dear on the Czech side just will not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 cross that border.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.100
 So what you're saying is that all dear are communist?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.300
 These are red dear for a nice day.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.500
 And the headline from the Wall Street Journal when this study was reported was "deep in the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.860
 forest, Bambia remains the Cold War's last prisoner."

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.700
 She's a good headline.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.940
 There's a strip through Germany which was called the death strip I think because it was that

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.740
 strip it was sort of like a five kilometer area between East and West Germany where you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.460
 weren't allowed to cross and it was cordoned off with lots of barbed wire and walls and you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 know men with guns and high towers and stuff and because no one touched it, no humans touched

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.100
 it for about 50 years it's now got like more, it's the most biodiverse area in Germany.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.940
 It's got more wildlife than your own journey.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.180
 Is that supposedly true of Chernobyl as well?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.700
 It is yes isn't it?

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.620
 The last leading to that old joke, why shouldn't you go wildlife spotting in Ukraine?

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.620
 Why?

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.780
 Because Chernobyl's biodiversity is very high and we can't run the risk of damaging it.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.580
 Also Chernobyl fall off.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.860
 Just going back to the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall, did you know I maybe everyone

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.140
 knows this but the Berlin Wall came down by accident kind of?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.140
 Yeah, sort of.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.900
 Yeah, so they were negotiations and there was going to be a change of how easily people

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.220
 were allowed to cross and they had a live television press conference which was a bit of a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.420
 rarity then it was a bit of a novelty and the guy announcing it mixes words up quite a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.460
 bit carried away so there's lots of changes happening they're all happening immediately

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.220
 and then people massed outside the wall.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.820
 Yeah, there's footage of him when he's asked directly so when are people going to be able

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.700
 to cross freely between East and West Berlin and he sort of grapples with a bit of a press

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.220
 release and looks at the back of it and goes immediately and then they go for it.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.500
 And I read a theory that the checkpoint guard who was in charge that day was a guy called

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.580
 Harold Yeager and he sort of caved in to all these protesters who came flooding towards

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.060
 him saying let us through and one of the ideas of why he would cave in is that he was waiting

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.220
 on the results of a cancer test I read in one article and he was nervous and worried

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.620
 about that and he just sort of thought oh bugger this I'm you know I'll let them get through

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.620
 he was fine by the way.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 This needs to be a movie.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.620
 It's amazing.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.620
 Yeah.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.260
 Just on that there was a thing in the I think it was the second world war where shortly

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.860
 after like the horrible defeat at Dunkirk and you know things were looking really, really

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.940
 bad for Britain.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.700
 I think it was about this time and there was a sort of offer from Germany or an offer

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.500
 of a negotiated settlement and the BBC Newsreader who was announcing the terms of this

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.860
 said well obviously we're not going to accept that way before anyone and you know true

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.500
 enough they did decline but he said afterwards yeah I read us that was a bit strong.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 Do you know who invented the phrase Iron Curtain?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.300
 Winston Churchill.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.300
 Everyone says it was Churchill.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.700
 Everyone says it in that stupid vice.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.380
 It's almost as if they know it's the wrong answer.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.940
 Gerbil's used it before Churchill did and before that it was used by an author called Ethel

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.780
 Snowden in 1920 but Gerbil's wrote it way before Churchill did and he wrote an article

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.620
 called The Year 2000 where he was predicting exactly what was going to happen in the year

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.940
 2000 and he said that our children's children will also have had children and the events of

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.900
 this war would have sunk into myth.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.580
 The first bit of that prediction actually isn't that impressive.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.580
 Nice true.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.780
 But he also said one more fly from Berlin to Paris for breakfast in 15 minutes.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.060
 It takes longer than that though doesn't it?

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.500
 I mean even getting through security takes longer than that.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.900
 Yeah so Gerbil's was wrong.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.860
 About loads of things that I like to say.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.860
 Sorry.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.860
 So there are two species of millipede in Tasmania that never meet each other.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.860
 Oh yeah.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.860
 Okay.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.220
 There's like an invisible line that they never cross but the interesting thing about it

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.340
 is it doesn't follow any kind of rivers or hills or natural contours is just like an

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.740
 invisible line and no one knows why.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.900
 Rob Meziboff who's a millipede specialist.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.220
 He said it has got nothing to do with the environment.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.260
 It's like a political thing between these two species.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.260
 Oh wow.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.260
 Is it a leg dispute?

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.900
 It feels like it's going to be a leg dispute isn't it?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 That's just stereotyping.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.500
 You think that everything that millipedes do is to do with their legs?

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 Yeah.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500
 98 legs good.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.500
 99 legs bad.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.580
 But there might be, I mean you might, the thing is you're so long as a millipede that

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.140
 you might end up in enemy territory without realising it.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.140
 You've got your back off.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.140
 Yeah.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.460
 If you're like backing up somewhere.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.740
 Can millipedes walk backwards if they want to?

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.380
 I think they probably can.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.380
 I think they probably can't.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.380
 Why really?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.460
 Why wouldn't they be able to any more than anyone else?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.380
 I think because it's a really tough job to coordinate that many legs surely.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.380
 Okay.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.380
 Okay.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.580
 If there are any millipede experts listening, if you could tweet me at egg shapes and the

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.780
 at Andrew Hunter M and let us know which of us is correct here, I think there's a

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.780
 pint riding on it.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.780
 Yeah.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:26.300
 And there are a couple of instances where the millipedes that belong to one side have ended

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.980
 up in a little blob on the other side and they think maybe they were taken over accidentally

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.020
 on a truck and then but they still aren't mingling.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.020
 Maybe they're embassies.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.020
 Oh yeah.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.020
 They're millipede embassies.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.020
 That's what it is.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.020
 Yeah.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.020
 That's quite cool.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.100
 I think it's called parapetric speciation and it's where I think there are like two populations

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.340
 of an animal that don't mingle and usually it's because there's a ditch in between them

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.260
 or there's some kind of topographical or geographical reason for it.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.260
 Or millipede racism.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.260
 Or millipede racism.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.420
 Or we put a great big wall up for you isn't it?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.180
 But yeah and it means that populations tend not to mingle with each other at all.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.180
 They'll rub up against each other.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.820
 They'll occasionally have a chat but they'll only really make with the people on their

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.820
 side.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.020
 Especially that creates and that means they spur up into two different species.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.180
 And it also happens with velvet walking worms in Tasmania, that's another mystery.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.740
 So maybe Tasmanians are just unbelievably anti-social.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.580
 Sorry, this is a walking worm.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.580
 Yeah, that sounds amazing.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.580
 That's right.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.580
 A velvet walking worm.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.740
 I didn't look into the explanation for the name.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.060
 What I imagine is that the worm, it doesn't have any legs but it kind of squeezes itself

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.940
 up into two halves and walks like a pair of legs.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.540
 Let's just go on believing is that they're never Google it, anyone, nobody Google it.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:47.740
 Another thing is that there is a species of shark called mecosharks and there's a line underneath

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.140
 the sea where if you catch a shark from one side of it then it will be male and if you catch

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.540
 one from the other side of it it'll always be female.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.580
 And that's why that is either.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.460
 Do they only have sex on either side of the line?

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.780
 They must just come together for one part of the year I guess.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.180
 Speaking of sex on borders.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.780
 I think it's in Switzerland.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.580
 That's the last time you're invited to that bookshelf.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.500
 I think it's in Switzerland, on the border of Switzerland and maybe France or another country.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.220
 There's a hotel with a penthouse in it and the penthouse bed is on the border.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.260
 Cool, so you can take off two countries in one go.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.740
 I don't know if you need passports or anything.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.300
 Are you taking off all the countries?

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.180
 Yeah, and it's so irritating because I don't enjoy sex so the idea being able to take off

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.020
 multiple countries in one attempt.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.620
 That's a dream country.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.620
 Dear.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.620
 Yes, dear.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.620
 Oh, dear.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.620
 Dear aren't always herbivores.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.620
 Really?

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.220
 They've been caught eating birds, out straight out the nest, other meats and stuff like that.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.460
 And so apparently there are several species that will or quite a lot of species that will

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.380
 eat meat if it's available.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.380
 Really?

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.740
 And on a related note, cows, I've watched a video today of a cow eating a live chicken just

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.740
 off the ground.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.220
 You're a sick puppy, Alex.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.740
 And also, dear, don't have gallbladders.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.180
 That's the only other thing I have about them.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.340
 How do they blotter their gallblad?

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.340
 Warful.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.420
 I know what you're saying.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:23.260
 OK, time for fact number two and that is James's facts.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.500
 My fact this week is that if every car in Monaco decided to go for a drive at the same

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.780
 time, they wouldn't fit on the roads.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.660
 How much time have you been working that out?

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.660
 Not so much.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.180
 So this comes from the economist world in figures, I think it's called, which is a yearly

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.500
 book that has loads of statistics in it.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.740
 And the length of the Monaco road system, if you divide it by the number of cars, is less

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.780
 than the average length of a car, according to my calculations.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.700
 Which if they're wrong, please don't write it.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:02.180
 But I reckon that each car had about, you know, just around two metres of space and definitely

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.780
 cars along the amount of an average.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.780
 Yeah, wow.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.180
 Should we do a test and ask everyone in Monaco to get in their cars and go on to the roads?

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.540
 Now, if you're listening to prove this fact wrong.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.060
 Because this is a podcast, people listen at different times.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.060
 No, you're right.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.060
 We'd need to arrange that.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.140
 And we need the entire population of Monaco to be listeners.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.140
 I'm fairly sure they are.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.140
 I think that's all the policies.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.380
 Obviously, also forgetting that's an incredibly irresponsible thing to do as well.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.380
 Of course, multiple days.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.940
 No one said this is a perfect plan, guys.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.580
 So does Monaco have more cars per capita than anywhere else in the world?

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.700
 I think it does, and if not, it's in the top two.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:41.100
 I read that they've got, and these figures are a couple of years old, 771 cars per

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.100
 thousand citizens.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.660
 Yeah, it's a bit more than that now.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.660
 Okay.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.340
 So that sounds like a lot, considering how many citizens there are, or how few citizens

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.340
 there are.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.660
 It's the second most populated country on Earth, I think.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.660
 It's China.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:03.020
 It's amazing considering Monaco is only two square kilometers, but it's got just shy

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.260
 of a billion people living in it.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.260
 Order.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.260
 Order.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.260
 Sorry.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.260
 Alex.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.780
 Yes, because apparently Monaco is also the second most densely populated country on Earth

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.220
 after some place in China, I think.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.220
 Like how?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.220
 I could be.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.900
 Anyway, it's the second most densely populated country on Earth.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.820
 And they also have more cars than any other people in Earth as well.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:28.780
 And one whole third of them are millionaires, 30% of the population of Monaco.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.780
 300 million.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:40.220
 That's right, there are 30,000 people living in two square kilometers, so it's incredibly

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.220
 densely populated.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.940
 It really skews the statistics, doesn't it, because they have like 100% literacy rates,

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.260
 and I give the life expectancy is like 98 or something ridiculous.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.260
 Yeah.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.180
 In fact, it's also the oldest country in terms of the proportion of the population who are

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.060
 aged over 65, so there it's 27.8% of the population.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.820
 So in the UK it's about 17%, 18%.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:12.540
 So as a result of that, in 2009 Monaco spent 1.2% of its GDP on education, essentially there

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.580
 are no children.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.980
 When you were saying the size of it is 2 square kilometers, I like to say that it's almost exactly

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.580
 the same size as chipping, sodbury quarry, because when I Google things that were 2 square kilometers

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.860
 in size that was the first thing we did.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.860
 That's very cool.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.820
 I think your Google result may be personalized.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:39.300
 There's another thing which is 2 square kilometers in size, which is the largest building

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.540
 in the world, which is in China.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:49.180
 This single shopping centre is 1.76 million square meters, and that is the total area of

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.180
 Monaco basically.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.180
 Wow.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.660
 Because they say that a lot of the biggest buildings are aircraft hangers, aren't they?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.660
 Oh yeah.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.220
 It's amazing seeing aircraft factories and how big they are as well, because those are the

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.740
 same as, you know, they're really, really, really massive aircraft hangers, you know.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.620
 I was watching a video of, this is really off topic, but I was watching a video of a German

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.460
 factory that makes houses, basically like, entire houses of the flat back.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.260
 And the whole factory is sort of this big white sterile place, and nothing touches the floor.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.980
 Everything is suspended from the ceiling.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.980
 Wow.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980
 Yeah.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.980
 Why is that?

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.860
 Just in the interest of kind of tidiness and cleanliness and, you know, you can't lose anything.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.460
 Everything sort of, everything, all the bits are always kind of hanging and going from

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.460
 rails and stuff.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.460
 Oh, that is a weird thing.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.460
 Really, I've got some DIY to do this weekend at my place.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.980
 Is that why they call it a aircraft hanger, because they hang clothes?

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.980
 No.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.980
 It's hangar, isn't it?

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.980
 Yeah.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.980
 Isn't it?

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.980
 What on earth is that?

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.980
 That's not a word.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.980
 No, but it's like a coat hanger.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.980
 But it's not a coat hanger.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.180
 I actually have a coat hanger, which is for all my coats.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.420
 I've just got all so many millions of coats.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:14:01.300
 Because it's such a loser.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.180
 Actually, speaking of planes, so your fact is about all the cars not fitting on the road.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.100
 Is the same true for all the planes fitting in the sky?

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100
 No.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.100
 Yes.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.100
 No, the opposite.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.100
 I know what you're going to say.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.100
 All the planes fitting on the ground.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.100
 Yeah.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.100
 I have heard that.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.620
 That's why there's always planes in the air because they wouldn't fit all fit in the

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.620
 air pots.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.620
 And they used to say during the millennium when the millennium was coming, everyone said,

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.620
 "Oh, gosh.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.620
 What are we going to do?

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.620
 We're going to have to ground all the planes, but they weren't fitting the airports."

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.220
 But I've slightly looked into it and it's definitely not true.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.260
 I think the only thing is they wouldn't all be able to fit in an airport whilst being connected

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.220
 to an airport, so passengers could board them.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.700
 Because I mean, airports are huge, airplanes only take up about a 20th of them.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.980
 The rest is just tarmac.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.980
 So I think they could all fit.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:48.380
 I mean, again, if you're a pilot or a millipede, do write in if you think that's not right.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.500
 It would be an act of confidence to build and deliver it under capacity in all the airports

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.900
 in the world, like Ryanair booking more people onto a flight than actually some people

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.900
 won't turn up.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:04.540
 So they probably built the airports and then made more planes, rather than thought, "Well,

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.620
 this is the maximum number of planes we're ever going to build."

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.580
 Now let's start on the airport.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.380
 So your fact is about lots of people going out and doing something at the same time.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.980
 Yes, it is.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.740
 So I was looking at a couple of things all humans could do at the same time that might make

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.620
 a big difference to the world.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:27.500
 So Carton Driver magazine worked out in the course of a really quite long article, a lot

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:33.420
 of maths, that if everyone in the world got in their cars at once and put their foot on

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.420
 the accelerator all at once, pointing in the same direction, then the opposing force that

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:46.940
 would create from the earth would cause the rotation of the earth to speed up by 0.1 miles

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.940
 per hour.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.900
 Which means you make the day longer, so you get there faster.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.500
 Yeah, it's a perfect way to stop itself being late.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.340
 But the traffic would be really bad because everyone is out on the road.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.500
 It's a good point.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.180
 It's a flawed plan, again.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:03.580
 So Monaco is famous for its grompries, and this fact is about Monaco and Cars.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.780
 Actually the second ever grompry was held in Monaco.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.940
 The race was mowed after a large pile-up on the first lap when an enormous wave from the

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.580
 half of flooded the course.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.580
 Oh my god.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.580
 I know.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.580
 Is that amazing?

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.300
 So were they all just going in and then they all just left there, covered in seaweed?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.300
 That would be amazing.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.300
 That would be amazing.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.100
 And by making a squid in the car next to them.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.460
 It's very like wacky races, isn't it?

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.460
 Was that the one?

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.340
 So there was a guy called William Grover Williams who was the winner of the first Monaco

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.340
 grompry.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.340
 Was it in 1929?

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.700
 Or, anyway, I think the first Monaco grompry was in 1929 and the winner was this guy called

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.540
 William Grover Williams.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.580
 And he went on to become a spy because I think he was employed for the French resistance

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.900
 in World War II as a driver and it turned out he had quite a lot of other talents.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.900
 What was his name?

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.900
 William Grover Williams?

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:57.260
 It feels like he's a spy and they've got what's your name and he goes William Williams?

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:03.500
 It sounds also, it's exactly the same as Bond James Bond, so to be fair, you know.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500
 Oh, you're right.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500
 The name's William.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.500
 Grover Williams.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:14.500
 Anyway, apparently so he was allegedly the Nazis claimed captured and executed but there

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.660
 were a lot of sightings of him afterwards and Rumor had it that he became a grocer in

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.660
 sorry.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.940
 It's William Grover Williams.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:31.020
 Just going back to the Monaco grompry in 2004 when Oceans 12 came out, they did a publicity

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.260
 stunt where the Jaguar cars in the race were fitted with a new nose cone, each of which

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:43.100
 had a diamond worth in excess of $300,000 inside the nose cone.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:48.780
 During the first lap, Jaguar driver Christian Klein crashed his diamond encrusted car.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.140
 They weren't allowed to go straight to kind of sort out the car because they had to do it

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.380
 after the race finished and by the time they got there, they couldn't find the diamond.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.980
 And no one knows where the diamond is to this day.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.620
 I bet one person knows.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:12.940
 OK, time for fact number three and that is my facts.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:18.260
 My fact this week is at the town of Centrelia in Pennsylvania has been on fire since 1962.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.740
 So people aren't entirely sure how the fire started, but it's thought that people were burning

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.740
 trash.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:31.820
 So there's just a heap of trash or garbage in Centrelia and they set fire to it.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.500
 And the thing about Centrelia is they had a huge network of mines sort of underneath it

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.780
 and largely towards the outskirts of it.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.860
 And the fire kind of fell down into one of the mines and their coal mines.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.420
 And so obviously coal sets fire quite easily.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.420
 Pretty quite well.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.860
 And so the coal does caught fire and it's been going ever since.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.180
 And they keep trying to put it out or they kept trying to put it out up until the 80s and

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.980
 then they just gave up.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.380
 And yeah, you have a population of over a thousand and now its population is 11 I think.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.380
 Oh, I've heard seven.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.380
 Has it gone down?

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.380
 2010, there were tens.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.340
 I can't find somebody moved there.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:13.660
 Come to Centrelia, it's on fire.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.180
 It's an incredible story.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.180
 It's so weird.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.860
 There's not unusual these things across America.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.020
 There are hundreds of all across the world in fact.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.940
 So I think there are over 200 other mine fires in America.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.140
 There are thousands in China where there are lots of coal mines obviously.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:34.100
 Apparently in total, these coal fires account for 3% of the world's CO2 emissions, which

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.100
 just is insane.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.540
 And so they're not all people chucking stuff down.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.740
 I think sometimes it's natural and there are all sorts of other occurrences of underground

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.340
 fires made, but many coal produced at CO2, three percent.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.660
 I read that the ones in China alone are 1% of the world's CO2.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.660
 Yeah.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.100
 A couple years ago, the Chinese government said that they'd been putting them out and they

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.100
 were just lying.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.940
 And all these kind of things went wrong saying, I can still see the fire down there.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.620
 But the main one is the one in Australia.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.100
 You guys must have all seen that one right?

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.100
 Yeah.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.420
 Burning mountain, which has been going for 5,500 years.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.420
 Yeah, it's mountain.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.900
 I don't think you can blame that on us.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.900
 That wasn't trash burning.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:17.500
 Well, I read about the ex-possible explanations for Burning Mountain and apparently scientists

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.380
 think it may have been caused by a lightning strike or spontaneous combustion, which is very

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.180
 much science-speak for, we don't know.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:30.260
 Also in Pennsylvania and Texas and some other places, you can get flammable water.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.260
 So...

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.260
 petrol.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.260
 Yeah.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:39.500
 Now what means some of that flammable water for my power?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.500
 It's water.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.660
 It can even be drinking water that's just got high levels of methane trapped inside it.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.740
 And if you put a match to it, it will go in flames of it.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.740
 Really?

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.020
 And if you've got sort of level water, you can sort of set fire to the surface of it, a bit

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.540
 like when you set fire to brandy on your Christmas pudding.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.740
 And there are videos online you can watch this woman just lighting, setting fire to the

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.740
 water coming out of her kitchen taps.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.740
 I do watch them on the internet.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.740
 Do you watch them on the internet?

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.740
 Do you watch them on the internet?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.740
 Do you watch them on the video?

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.460
 It must be really dangerous, though, because surely if the fire travels along the pipe.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.460
 It never really catches that much because there's not enough methane in the water.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.460
 Okay.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.460
 And there's water as well, so.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.460
 Oh, yeah, true.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.660
 Here's the thing about coal fires.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.700
 When the Titanic set sail out of Southampton, she was on fire in the coal bunker because that

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.100
 was what the Titanic's fuel was, huge, huge bunkers of coal.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.640
 There was a fire in there which had been burning, possibly since the 2nd April, which was eight

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640
 days before.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.140
 A fire that wasn't supposed to be burning that wasn't being used to fuel the...

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.140
 Exactly.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.100
 Yeah, yeah, just in the coal bunkers there was a fire happening and the crew took a day

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.100
 to put it out.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.860
 I can't believe they didn't spot it for a week.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.660
 The whole thinking thing is dying to make sense.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.660
 It was very slam-past.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.660
 It was negligent crews.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:50.220
 Maybe what they were thinking is what we need as an enormous amount of very, very cold water.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.380
 Be careful what you wish for, Frank.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.020
 Fire is a really important in nature, aren't they?

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.420
 Especially in America, some of their big trees like the Sequoias.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.300
 They rely on forest fires to kind of keep them healthy and keep them regrowing.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:12.460
 Not because in America, everywhere, really, they have this kind of anti-forest fire thing,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.900
 which is essentially to stop people from throwing cigarette butts around, but actually kind

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.980
 of says that all fire is bad.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.940
 Whenever there's a fire, they try and put it out really, really quickly, which actually

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.740
 can be quite bad for the ecosystem because you do need these fires for things like sequoias

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.740
 to grow.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.100
 Yeah, you do, because they have pine cones, isn't it?

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.100
 There are certain pine cones which are held together really tightly by resin that relies

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.140
 on fire to get hot enough that it, the resin melts and it seeds, so...

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.980
 I'm not saying we should set fire to every forest, but you know, the odd little fire is

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.980
 quite important.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.780
 Occasional tree wouldn't hurt, guys.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.380
 Other forests where they have managed fires, sometimes.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.380
 Yes.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.380
 They burn sometimes.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.420
 It's amazing that they need fires.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.940
 The idea that there's a type of pine cone that has fire as part of its natural habitat.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.940
 I find it incredible.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.940
 But yeah.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.940
 But there are controlled fires.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.940
 You see them a lot.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.940
 I can't remember where.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.940
 I think you see them in Spain.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.460
 But I think it's often to prevent other fires from actually happening, is to pre-empt

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.460
 the fire.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.460
 To that fire.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.460
 It is literally fighting fire with fires.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:12.060
 I've got one more thing about fire, which is the record for the longest distance run while

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:17.900
 on fire, which is 200 metres, which is pretty good.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.300
 How on fire was this person?

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.420
 At the beginning, he is so on fire.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.820
 I mean, he's really, really, really aflame.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.100
 By the end of it, it's just his back, which is on fire, because I think a lot of it is put

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:33.780
 out over the course of the run, but he's an Austrian stuntman called Joe Tudling.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.540
 And he already had the record for the longest time on fire.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.140
 And then he broke this one.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.740
 And then they said, "What are you going to do next?"

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.500
 And he said, "Well, I've got three more records to break, which is the furthest distance

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.820
 being pulled by a horse while on fire."

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.180
 And then the furthest distance being pulled by a quad bike while on fire.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.700
 And then a small motor vehicle while on fire.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.700
 So he's found his knee.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.460
 I've had some time off, get married while on fire.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:06.460
 Maybe retired, just from gardening while on fire.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:12.260
 OK, time for our final fact, and that is Alex.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.500
 My fact this week is that the first recorded traffic casualty was a Roman pig who was run

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.900
 over by a chariot carrying an ornamental phallus.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.340
 OK, let's start with the chariot.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.380
 Why was it carrying a massive phallus?

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:32.140
 Well, because it was probably part of the Dionysic Festival, which was basically just this

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.900
 big festival where they had loads of phalluses, it was also due with fertility and generally

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.580
 being a bit raucous.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.020
 So we're sure it wasn't a metaphor, and then it wasn't just being driven by the Roman

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.580
 Pears Morgan.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.900
 This fact is from the pig's Delhi of Odessa, which is basically a headstone, a tombstone,

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.540
 which has an old poem on it in Greek.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.060
 It was Roman, but it was written in Greek, and also an engraving, a picture of the pig being

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.700
 run over by a cart which has a huge dick on it.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.700
 And it's basically a sort of satirical, slightly funny headstone, because it's eulogising

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.980
 a pig rather than a person.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.660
 But the pig was supposedly on his way on the Veeer Ignatia, which is the road he was on,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.100
 and was kind of all very excited about having a great life, and then got run over by a chariot.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.100
 It's very sad.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:22.860
 And pigs are worse symbols of fertility, I think, as well at the time, everything is

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.860
 symbol of fertility.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:29.660
 I want to know in ancient Greece, I think, ancient Greeks wore oaths over the testicles

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.060
 of pigs, because I don't know why they would do that actually, just because it's a symbol

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.060
 of fertility.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060
 It was a lot of the time.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.060
 Yeah.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.060
 Is that right?

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.780
 They always say that the word testimony comes from putting your hands over your genitals,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.020
 which I'm pretty sure isn't true.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.020
 Yeah, I think that's right.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.700
 But it'd be nice if instead it was the pig testicles where it came from.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.700
 It would.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.700
 It's not true either, is it?

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.700
 No.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.700
 It would be nice.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.260
 I was kind of just looking at generally Roman pigs and what they got up to.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.420
 There's accounts of the migarians, apparently, dipping pigs in oil, and setting fires to them,

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.300
 and then driving towards elephants, and then the elephants would trample them and get

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.540
 very scared and trample everyone, and there would just be general chaos.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.180
 I was going to ask about that, because I remember half-remember reading a thing about setting

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.660
 fire to pigs and thinking they were dragons or something, because they're screaming and

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660
 there was fire and stuff like that.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.220
 I think it's the noise that made them so scary, so it definitely hurts.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.220
 Yeah.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.220
 And then the enemy elephants trample their own people to death, don't they?

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.220
 Yeah.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.300
 But you have the elephants at the front of your army, is that the idea?

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.660
 So when they see the pigs coming, they turn around and trample the enemy army.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.660
 Yeah.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:35.220
 This is something really, really 100% completely not related at all.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.900
 But I was reading this yesterday in Covent Garden and around here, they had some riots

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:45.260
 when they changed the prices of theatres, and they called the op riots, and people shouted

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.700
 op, op, and op meant old price, or it could have been OP or op.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.380
 But one of the things that they did was, as soon as their play had started, everyone would

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.780
 turn the backs to their play, and then start doing these chants and stuff like this.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.860
 And another thing apparently they did was kind of prod pigs to make them squeal, like in

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.740
 opportune times, to put off the actors.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.140
 And just like the idea of, I don't know, kind of sneaking a pig into the pig.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.140
 Do you dress it up?

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.140
 I was like, oh, wait.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:17.140
 I like the idea that it wouldn't be distracting enough for an actor if just a person in the

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.140
 audience started shrieking.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.660
 Yeah, I tend to go to the trouble of smuggling a pig in.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.820
 Someone else who prodded pigs was Louis XI.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.620
 I think went apparently when he was depressed, he liked to get pigs dressed up and have

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.420
 them poked so they'd dance for him, and he constantly kept with him a dancing troop of pigs

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.420
 to entertain him.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.620
 Is that Louis XI, King of France?

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.620
 Yes.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.620
 Okay, cool.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.620
 Just checking.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.620
 Yes.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.620
 I think there's such a thing as too much power.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.620
 Are you doing that for entertainment?

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.260
 Yeah, you'd think you would sit back at one point and go, oh my gosh, what have I become?

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.260
 I'm not doing my life.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.100
 But on the other hand, look at these great pigs.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.660
 You know we've talked about cat pianos on QI.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.420
 So you have like 12 different cats, and they all make a different tone.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.540
 And you press a key and it hits the cat and they squeal at a different tone.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.500
 And it was invented by a guy called Anastasius Kietcher, or something.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.500
 Yes.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:16.100
 There is also a Pigginino, there was a Pigginino, which is the Pig equivalent.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:21.660
 Oh, I thought it was a sandwich with a Pig in it, but just one sandwich, mate.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.660
 It wasn't.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.700
 It was a piano with a Pig in it.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.700
 It was a musical instrument.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.260
 I think this might have been conceived by Louis XI as well, of France, because he liked

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.820
 the idea of torturing pigs for his own entertainment.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.820
 And the idea was conceived.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.780
 I'm not sure if they ever made one, but he challenged someone to make one.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.660
 And the idea is that, yeah, you pull a high load of pigs in a piano and then you bash them

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.540
 with keys, which is a pretty big piano, so grand.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.540
 Yeah.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.580
 I mean, it depends on the size of the keyboard, as if it's an 88 key piano, then yeah, massively.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.580
 Does it hit them?

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.580
 Or does it pull the tails?

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.580
 I just make them squeal.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.140
 However, where you want to make them squeal is the idea.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.140
 I don't know.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.380
 You could do a number of things, I guess.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.380
 There's a Pig Olympics.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.380
 Yeah.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.380
 There's Pig Olympics.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.100
 It's organised by the Sport Pig Federation.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.860
 And there's Pig Running, Pig Swimming, Pig Hurdles, Pig Jumping.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.860
 Pig Hurdles!

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860
 Pig Football.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.860
 I'd rather watch Pig Hurdles.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.860
 Yeah.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.860
 Yeah, no.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.860
 It's just, you know, Pig Jumping with little hurdles.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.860
 I think none of these sports, you watch them, and it's actually just pigs running around,

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.860
 you know, thing.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.100
 The football works, but they cover the football in fish oil, so they run around looking at them.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.380
 I've seen pigs playing football.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.580
 Are you not supposed to give pigs balls and stuff to play with because they get bored

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.580
 otherwise?

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.580
 Yes, you law.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.580
 You have to give...

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.580
 Farmers have to stimulate pigs.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.340
 Farmers have to give pigs stimulation.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.340
 Yeah.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:42.820
 I've done a bit of research on penis festivals, of course you have, to go on from ornamental

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.820
 palaces.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.420
 So, there are some which still exist all over the world today.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.220
 Where's the closest one to here, do you think?

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.220
 Well, the closest one to here is...

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.220
 Is in 10 minutes time.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.220
 Is it?

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.220
 It's got us.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.220
 I think that's in Greece.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.220
 OK.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.540
 In a place called Tinevos, but in the Japanese city of Kawasaki, they have an annual festival

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.540
 of the steel phallus.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.540
 Do they?

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.900
 And they parade an enormous pink statue of a penis through the streets, and you can ride

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.540
 a battering ram which is shaped like a penis.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.020
 You can buy sweets which are shaped like penises.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.340
 You can dress as penises.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:21.740
 I mean, just take any normal activity and replace the main noun with a penis.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.940
 You can dress as penis while on fire.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:30.580
 Also, the massive effigy that they carry through the streets is called Elizabeth, for no discernible

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.100
 reason.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.100
 In 2003, cabinet magazine held a world's most phallic building competition.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.540
 The point was the Yipsilanti Water Tower in Michigan, which is nicknamed the Brick Dick.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:46.020
 A lot of contenders for that prize, like every skyscraper.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.020
 Yeah.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.220
 So, just about phallic looking buildings, do you remember seeing that picture on Google

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.820
 Earth of a church that looked like a penis?

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.820
 No.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:31:01.420
 It was in Dixon, Illinois, and it kind of did the rounds a few years ago.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.660
 And it really does, you know, you can see where they're coming from, really.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:10.620
 But a spokesman for the church said, "The church was not designed to be seen from above."

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.340
 You hang on, when they say the building wasn't designed to be seen from above, all buildings

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.100
 have architectural plans, which you will be able to see.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.100
 That's so true.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.100
 That's a really good point.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:27.660
 One more thing on penises. I found a cabaret event that was held in March of this year, which

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.460
 was specifically for men with small penises.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.020
 It was established by a fellow called Ant Smith, who says he has a small penis.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.860
 I'm going to be very glad you named Jackson, I'm shocked.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.500
 But he was in all the papers at the time, I mean, he was trying to publicise this.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.940
 He was trying to get the word out there, saying, "This is something that really worries

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.620
 a lot of men, and just come to terms with it, and it was to help men come to terms with

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.620
 it."

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.500
 And the entry fee was that you had to pay 50p per inch of declared penis.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.580
 That's really good, I'm glad he's doing that.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:04.380
 And it is kind of ridiculous that we make fun of that and keep on stoking this ridiculous

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.380
 fire.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.380
 I think we're celebrating it.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.380
 Small penises.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.860
 Well, this kind of event.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.060
 Yeah, I think we're all saying, "Well done, Ant Smith."

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.060
 Definitely.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.100
 But if I got along, I would have had to pay six quid.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:21.420
 No, I'd have paid £1.50.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.660
 I'll just round it down.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.740
 OK, that's all of our facts for this week.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.740
 Thanks very much for listening.
