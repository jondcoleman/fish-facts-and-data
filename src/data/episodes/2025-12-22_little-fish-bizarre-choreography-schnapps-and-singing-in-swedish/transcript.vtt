00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.080
 Ho ho ho!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.400
 Hey everyone, welcome to this episode of Little Fish.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.480
 Before we get into it,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.280
 there is just a little announcement that I would like to make.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.920
 Christmas is only a few days away,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.360
 and if you were looking to get a present

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.240
 for someone in your life who loves fish,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.480
 I would love it if you would be able to come

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.240
 to my new tour that I'm gonna be doing

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.920
 around the UK as of March next year.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.760
 - What?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.800
 - Yeah, I'm so sorry, this is a terrible way for you to find out.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.160
 - What are you going on tour?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.200
 - You're not, unfortunately, Dan!

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.560
 - You can come, I don't have a stitch to wear.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.120
 You can come and watch, I can do my act.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.400
 - No one wants to see that, man.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.360
 - I'm practicing, I can do it without injuring any

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.480
 of the audience by now, I really can.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.400
 - Oh, Dan, I'm so excited.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.240
 Where are we going?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.080
 Where are we going?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.720
 - Okay, well, this show is called "This Changes Everything,"

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.200
 and we should clarify, it's just Dan, it's not me,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.640
 I'm just being a silly banana.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.760
 - You could come along, I would be very handy

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.120
 if you'd have a front row with pom-poms every night, Dan.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.520
 It's gonna be Dan on tour, where are you going?

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000
 So, on the 15th of March, I'm gonna be in Warwick,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.800
 and then I'm gonna be in Salford, I'm gonna be in Brighton,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.160
 I'm gonna be in Edinburgh, Nottingham,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.400
 and then I'm gonna be playing

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 the Royal Geographical Society in London.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 Yeah, this is gonna be a great evening of mysteries,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.640
 amazing fact, mind-blowing stories from history.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.000
 I've put together the best of the best of stuff

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.440
 that I've been digging up over the last 10 years.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.280
 If you've read my book, The Theory of Everything Else,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 you'll know the kind of tone of it.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 It's all the stuff that has led to the world we live in today,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.720
 but it's all the bits of history

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.320
 that have been swept under the carpet,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.280
 'cause people would rather you didn't know about it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.600
 So, if you like mystery adventure and jokes,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 please come along to "This Changes Everything."

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.800
 So, if you're looking to buy tickets for yourself

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.160
 or someone else, just put "Dantriber, This Changes Everything,"

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.480
 tour into Google.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.000
 You'll find a link you can also find it on my Instagram,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.960
 @Triberland, it'll be in the bio.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.360
 Please come along, it's gonna be an awesome night,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.160
 and I'll be there, and Andy will be there.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.440
 I mean, just come to Justicey Andy.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.040
 Sure.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.720
 Sit and watch Andy watching me.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.360
 We've got another little fish for you now.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 These are your facts, here we go.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.200
 On with the show.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 On with the bug-gast.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.600
 Thank you for doing that.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.800
 I didn't have a choice.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.200
 Now, please, please, then, put the call through

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.480
 and release my family.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:43.880
 Hello, and welcome to Little Fish,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.120
 the show where we look at the great facts

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.440
 that you guys have been sending in over the past seven days.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.360
 Andy has gone through the inbox as bulging as it was

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.280
 and taken out the very, very best sent them to me

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.840
 and to Dan and kept some for himself,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.760
 and we're gonna read through them today

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.640
 and maybe chat a little bit more about them.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.960
 So, without further ado, who's gonna read the first one?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.800
 Maybe Dan.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.880
 Yeah, okay.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.400
 I got a fact here, which is from Eli Jones,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.160
 who says that jungle gyms were invented in Japan

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.120
 in the 1880s by a British polygamist

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.360
 with the goal of training a generation of children

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.320
 intrinsically comprehend the fourth dimension.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.080
 So, jungle gyms, I think, is what I would have called softplay

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.480
 when I was younger.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.320
 Right.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.600
 So, me, a jungle gym is the metallic bars

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.920
 that are in a sort of a crescent shape

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.120
 from the ground that you would climb around.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.960
 Oh, interesting.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.160
 An adventure playground?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.920
 Yeah, that's a jungle gym to me,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.000
 but do we know what this guy invented?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.200
 Well, this sounds like a hard play.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.400
 Yeah, that sounds like a hard play.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.240
 Hard play.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.080
 Well, here's a story.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.160
 While living with one of his families in Japan,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.760
 a British mathematician called Charles Howard Hinton,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.400
 tried to instill a fundamental understanding

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.800
 of the fourth-dimensional geometry into his children.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.080
 What is the fourth dimension?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.560
 Sorry to throw you an easy one so early.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.400
 Yeah, well, I know.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.880
 Imagine you take a square and you turn it into a cube.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.080
 You're adding a third dimension.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.680
 Now imagine you turn that into the next level up.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 That's the fourth dimension.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.400
 I've just got another cube on top of a cube in my head.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.720
 That would be a hyper cube.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.200
 It's really hard to explain.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.160
 Yeah, I thought the fourth dimension was time,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.120
 but that's clearly not what we thought about here.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.880
 No, this is a fourth spatial dimension.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.720
 Oh, right.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.440
 Oh, boy.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.960
 OK, well, it sounds like

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.120
 soft play might not have been enough to do it.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.960
 I'd say.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.760
 I suppose was he trying to teach children spatial awareness

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.160
 because they're moving through a 3D space.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.680
 Yeah.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.960
 And they're becoming, I think,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.920
 other children, the fourth dimension?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.840
 He said he wanted to help them with the understanding

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.920
 that we typically move in two dimensions,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.000
 walking around cardinal directions, as we said.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.160
 Yeah, so you walk flat on the earth.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.880
 We're not flying like a bird is in three dimensions

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.480
 because it can go up and down as well,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.960
 but normally we're on the ground.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.960
 If someone stops me and asks the directions,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.400
 I very rarely include the third dimension in my answer.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.040
 I'd say take the second left down here.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.400
 And I'd never say you'll need to rise about three meters.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.920
 And then go into the fourth dimension.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.280
 So to us, you'll still appear like you're in the same place,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.640
 but actually you'll be in a different position

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.240
 in that other dimension.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.040
 It's very simple stuff, guys.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.400
 So he wanted to do this by creating a bamboo grid

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.880
 and running drills with his kids,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.480
 where he would shout coordinates at them

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.000
 and it would scramble through the grid

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.960
 to get the coordination right.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.480
 Yeah.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.240
 So that was his plan.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.640
 It was to invent a device that allowed for them to do that.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.080
 A byproduct of it was the invention of the jungle gym.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.440
 Yeah, I've seen a picture of it.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.120
 And a jungle gym you're talking about is like a climbing frame

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.040
 but made of lots of boxes.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040
 OK.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.000
 If that makes sense.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.880
 What was the other thing that maybe it was soft play

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.760
 that was invented by a guy in Manchester

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.320
 who saw the people were playing in burnt out cars

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.360
 and decided that maybe we should give them something else to play in?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.600
 Was it bombsites as well?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.360
 Yeah, I think so.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.680
 It was a lot of precarious sort of concrete and rusty metal,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.120
 strewn patches and kids were playing on them

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.160
 because it was a kind of free space for them to play.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.560
 And it never did them any harm.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.840
 He definitely came up with some kind of playground.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, remember that.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.040
 Yeah, well, great fact.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.920
 Indeed, Andy, what about another one?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.120
 All right, here's one from Andy Walker

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.040
 who's sending his favorite film fact.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.760
 The UK actor Richard Todd was a D-Day veteran.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760
 And I really like this.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.160
 He was in a film called The Longest Day,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.240
 which is a really, really famous second mobile film.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.680
 It's about three hours long.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.760
 It recreates large chunks of D-Day, basically.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.680
 He was in the film The Longest Day,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.600
 playing his real life commanding officer.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.680
 So he had been at D-Day himself as a young man.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.760
 20 years later, he gets cast in this film,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.360
 playing the guy who was in charge of him on D-Day.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.040
 And there's someone else in the film,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.080
 playing him as a younger man.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.920
 Really? Yeah.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.160
 And I'd never heard of Richard Todd, really.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.080
 I hadn't seen this film.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.520
 And he was incredibly popular in the '60s and '50s.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.240
 And he was a matinee idol.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.440
 And he was there at Pegasus Bridge in D-Day,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.760
 which he had to capture and sort of hold off

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.160
 really fierce German attacks to try and retake it

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.960
 'cause they were trying to shut the whole thing down.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.200
 And yeah, he ended up in this film later on

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.480
 with a load of, I mean, it's a huge film

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.400
 with a lot of incredibly famous actors in it,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.040
 many of whom had been there on the actual D-Day.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.880
 That must be crazy.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.040
 It must have been so surreal, yeah, exactly.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.040
 And he had enough of an impact

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.200
 that he was a character in that movie.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.680
 Yeah, that's pretty wild, isn't it?

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really cool.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040
 I guess, small regiments,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.800
 you would know the names of everyone,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.440
 you know, that you were talking about.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.040
 He was one of the first people on the ground.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.400
 He landed at 40 minutes after midnight on D-Day.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.840
 He was absolutely one of the first people on D-Day.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.640
 Did it happen? Did it start at midnight?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.560
 That was maybe that's when the parachutes in Dog's landed.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.520
 I think it was when the parachute just landed.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.240
 I think we said in an early episode

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.640
 that that's what came in first.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.920
 He was one of the first two-legged mammals on the ground.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.840
 I'm not sure I would start at midnight

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.000
 'cause I think that's when they'd be expecting it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.840
 Good point.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.640
 I'd start like 17 minutes past something.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.240
 Well, that's why I was such a terrible failure

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.920
 'cause they didn't listen to you.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.320
 (laughing)

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.480
 No, that's fair enough.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.240
 I don't know if it was dead on.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.640
 But I did a little more reading about him in his life

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.720
 and it was a very interesting life.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.960
 One of his other superior officers on D-Day,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.440
 this is just an amazing name I've tracked down.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.680
 He was a guy called Jeffrey Pine Coffin.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.640
 That was his surname.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.400
 (laughing)

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.240
 That was very good.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240
 It was a double barrel name.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.840
 The Pine and the Coffin families

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.400
 had got married to each other at surgery before.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.360
 And they call themselves Pine Coffin.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.200
 You don't get names like that anymore.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.200
 It's a brilliant name.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.040
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.480
 Okay, here's one from me by Dario Persecino.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.360
 Thank you very much for writing Dario

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.280
 with this incredible fact

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.080
 that it would take just over 1,418 years

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.840
 to eat a full Jesus.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.160
 (laughing)

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.520
 So what Dario has done here is assumed

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.040
 that when you're eating a communion wafer,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.160
 which is the body of Christ,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.040
 that that is actually Jesus.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.480
 And he's worked out all the stuff.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.440
 He's sent us all the working out

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.360
 and I can promise you that it's all great.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.000
 And he worked out that you would need

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.760
 74,000 communion wafers to eat a complete Jesus.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.840
 And assuming you receive communion once a week,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.720
 it would take approximately 1,418 years

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.920
 to eat a full Jesus.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.800
 He says this does not take into account any philosophical

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.560
 issues of transubstantiation

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.960
 and that it hasn't taken into account

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960
 the weight of Jesus' foreskin,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.400
 which he said he knows would be a point of interest to me,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.120
 because that's why it was excommunicated.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.000
 But he said he figured it would only make

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.680
 a one small wafer difference.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.920
 Yeah.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.880
 I get a friend of the podcast, Jesus' foreskin.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880
 Absolutely.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.920
 But Dario are honestly absolutely stunning bits of maths.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.920
 I wonder how many bottles of wine it would take

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.640
 to drink or the blood of Christ?

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.640
 Dario, get on it.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.840
 That's in true Hawkins style, that fact, isn't it?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.040
 I read a recent article about communion wafer,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.760
 which had got the blood of Christ on it.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.680
 And they've found red stains on the communion wafer

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.360
 and thought that's what had happened.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.160
 In actual fact, it was caused by a fungus

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.120
 and three different types of bacteria,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.800
 all of which are commonly found on human hands.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.720
 Oh.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.560
 Now, there is a theory that Jesus was a mushroom.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:49.120
 So he could have been reforming on that wafer.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.720
 Right.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.560
 Could be.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.040
 Could be.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.320
 That's brilliant.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.200
 That's really good.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.960
 You've all taken your tinful hats off, it's going on.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.640
 Shall I do one?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.440
 Yeah, go for it.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.680
 OK, this is from Anton Guillenberg, who writes,

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.280
 fact, the Vatican Apostolic Library

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.120
 holds shelf after shelf of self-help hiccup remedies.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.960
 Do they have the figure up the anus?

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.080
 Which is--

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.520
 I believe the only medically certain way to cure it.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.400
 You're right.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:19.880
 You're right.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.680
 Wow.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.120
 It's a total rectal massage.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.640
 Yeah.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.360
 Is that what the Sistine Chapel is?

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.360
 Is God's finger coming to a stop?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.560
 Adam, have you got hiccups?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.800
 OK, so this is Pope Pius XII, who reported a statement.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.000
 Oh, end of the podcast.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.200
 Huge friend.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.280
 Give me--

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.800
 Give me one.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.240
 He was the guy who said that anyone who mentions Jesus

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.120
 is fast and gets it.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.520
 It's going to be a fake death.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.840
 He was embalming, went incredibly wrong.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.680
 Yeah, the whole sum of us.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.440
 Who had that crazy doctor?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.480
 He was a proper friend of the podcast.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.800
 Well, welcome back, Pope Pius.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.120
 So yeah, he suffered from chronic hiccups.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.240
 So over the years, people from all around the world

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.120
 would send him all kind of remedies

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.480
 from charming suggestions like being startled

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.560
 to the more vulgar ideas that we have mentioned on our show.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.400
 I'm assuming--

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400
 Oh, there we go.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.800
 Finger up the bum, bum.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.240
 So as correspondence addressed to the Pope,

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.280
 God's representative on Earth, these submissions

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.240
 could not be discarded and were preserved

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.160
 according to standard Vatican archival procedures.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
 So they are all there.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.440
 So there's many unusual items including all of these remedies

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.600
 that are now part of the collection that are maintained

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.920
 by the Holy See.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.760
 Yeah.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.320
 There's a P.S. to this email, by the way, from Anton,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.320
 who is in Helsinki in Finland, just to add that.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.600
 P.S., I have actually come to possess

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.680
 the only foolproof method to cure hiccups.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.880
 As it involves bizarre choreography,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.160
 snaps, and singing in Swedish, it's rather difficult

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.240
 to explain and writing.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.320
 But if we ever meet in person, I would

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.800
 be delighted to share it with you.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.000
 OK, let's book that gig and Helsinki straight away.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.360
 Absolutely.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.840
 The only-- I have come into possess the only foolproof method.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.680
 It's quite strong.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.200
 Isn't it?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.240
 It's got choreography involved?

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.920
 Yeah.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.760
 I think this is--

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.280
 I imagine what it is is everyone gets some snaps,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.720
 stands in a circle.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.800
 Does this sort of really amazing dance

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.040
 with your arms going one way, your legs

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.440
 going the other way, all that kind of stuff?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.920
 Then we all say something like some ancient riddle

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920
 in Swedish.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.040
 And then we all put our fingers on each other's buns.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.640
 I've got one.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.240
 Yeah.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.240
 This is from Emma Wood, and I find it quite fascinating.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.440
 So she sends a couple of facts.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.200
 I'll just do the second one if that's the right Emma.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.720
 It's a bit anecdotal, but she says,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.000
 I personally found this quite a cursed piece of trivia years

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.240
 ago on a tour of a famous commercial radio station.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.840
 I was told for their breakfast show

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.240
 that they use a specific voice filter

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.680
 to make the hosts sound more artificially happy

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.200
 in the mornings.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200
 Yeah.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.160
 Is there any knowledge about--

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.320
 Is this person British?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:01.840
 Do you think?

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.480
 I don't know.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.200
 She says, "I, in my research, unfortunately,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.720
 cannot find anything documented to back this up.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.800
 Is this a radio-wide conspiracy?

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.600
 Have I blown this shit wide open?"

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.200
 Well, we can say because we know Zoe Ball,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.360
 and we've all been on her breakfast show,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.280
 that she is genuinely that happy all the time.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.800
 Yeah.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.720
 But we had a filter to our show.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.320
 This show we've got lots of filters on her.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.400
 Oh, yeah, just remind me what they are again.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.720
 Well, we put on one which makes us sound a bit cleverer.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.720
 Tantios has been broken for a while, actually.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.000
 I know.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.320
 I've been meaning to get that looked at.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.040
 I have the cruelness built on the mind of us.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.760
 You've got that set too strong today, I see.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.320
 Anna, believe it or not, we've turned down her sarcasm filter.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.120
 Yeah, that's why she hasn't been on for three months.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.960
 Yes.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:57.080
 OK, so here is another fact.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.560
 This one is from Gudrun Ulfaz. here.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.680
 She says that Taurus in Iceland have been tagging the place name

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.680
 Giel Skulder in hundreds of photos on social media recently.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.320
 The weird thing is that these photos

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.440
 seem to be taken in lots of different places

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.840
 around the country.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.320
 The reason is because Giel Skulder in Icelandic

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.160
 means parking fees apply.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.520
 Lovely.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.760
 Lovely.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.760
 And apparently lots of parking lots.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.720
 People have been putting up this sign

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.320
 to make sure that people pay.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.080
 But then people have just seen it.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.760
 In fairness, it looks like it could be a name of a place

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.840
 in Iceland for sure.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.440
 Brilliant.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.720
 But of course, it reminds me of the pravo-yasty thing

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.960
 a few years going to Ireland where loads of traffic

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.080
 infringements had been given to this single person

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.040
 called pravo-yasty.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.920
 But it turned out the pravo-yasty was

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.720
 Polish for driving license.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.720
 That's a good phrase.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.560
 I left that one.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.320
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.200
 Should I do one more?

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.120
 This one is such a fish-guired fact.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.040
 You have to know an in-joke in order to like this one.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.400
 I think Caleb Groen has sent this in.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.320
 I'm a longtime fan of the podcast.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.560
 As a US law student, I recently came across a fact

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.720
 that might be of interest to you.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.800
 Judging by word count, the constitution

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.360
 of the US state of Alabama sources vary.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.040
 But 373,000 words is probably the best estimate.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.800
 Wow.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:34.640
 Is longer than Anna Karenina, which is around 364,000,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.520
 as the highest estimate.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.120
 Wow.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.160
 That's the fact.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.000
 How much verbiage does it take to run Alabama effectively?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Probably there's a lot of stuff about farming

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.280
 in the Alabama constitution.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.440
 Like there is an Anna Karenina.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:47.960
 Yeah.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.600
 I think Caleb basically wanted to let us know that

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.240
 because he said spoilers about the Alabama Constitution

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.160
 will probably be less violating to our listeners

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.720
 than spoilers about Anna Karenina.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.880
 That's really brilliant.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.200
 Andy, go ahead and give us one more.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.320
 All right, here's a fun one.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.200
 This is very exciting.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.960
 This is from Jana Row.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:10.960
 And Jana is working on a sub-antarctic sub-antarctic.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.680
 It's not whether that sees lived.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.240
 It's the entrance to the hall over.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.080
 Sorry.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.800
 I think this must mean just above the Antarctic, rather than just

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.960
 below the South Pole.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.520
 An island called Marion Island off the coast of South Africa.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.960
 And Jana and 19 others are living there for 15 months

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.920
 doing scientific research.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.640
 Wow.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.200
 Your podcast keeps me highly entertained

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.800
 and puts a smile on my face in the field

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.440
 while we hike hundreds of kilometers in shitty weather.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.000
 And Jana is a seabird researcher working closely

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.960
 with wandering albatross.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.640
 So cool.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.480
 So cool.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.160
 And just sends a few brilliant facts about the wandering albatross.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.320
 So I don't think we've mentioned them very much.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.600
 And they're basically--

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.080
 They've got the longest wingspan any bird.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.400
 It's two and a half meters roughly.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.080
 And I really like this.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.600
 They've got this elbow locking mechanism.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.680
 They can keep their wings open for as long as they want

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.960
 without activating their muscles.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.680
 And basically, they can fly several hundred miles

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.240
 in one go without flapping their wings once.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.400
 I just didn't really clock how far they can fly.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.920
 Imagine several hundred miles from wherever you are.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920
 Yeah.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920
 It's a long way away.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920
 From London to Bolton.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
 Without flapping.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920
 Yeah.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.920
 Well.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.600
 Last time I drove, I was flapping the whole way.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.920
 Right.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.120
 And so they lock their elbows so that it just--

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120
 Basically, it's the wind.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.320
 And I looked at what's going on on Marion Island

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.280
 from where Jana is riding.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.480
 And it's where they're trying to wipe out the mice,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.000
 which have for years been absolutely demolishing the albatrosses.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.520
 It's been a real catastrophe.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.240
 It's half the worlds wandering albatrosses

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.560
 are bred on this island and the island next door.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.520
 So it's a really important base for them.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.400
 They shouldn't be called the wandering albatross.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.440
 Should they consider them have such a small--

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.200
 They're all from here.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.440
 Well, they do wander.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.720
 They can fly--

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.600
 some of them have been seen flying 75,000 miles in one year.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.560
 So they do wander.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.880
 Just a couple of flaps together.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.640
 Basically, yeah.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.520
 And basically, this island introduced five cats

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.320
 to the island in 1949 to control the mice,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.120
 which were already causing a huge problem.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.720
 Guess what they didn't do to the cats?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.240
 New to them.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.520
 They didn't do to them.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.120
 So then they had hundreds of cats

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.760
 praying on the albatrosses because it's easier

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.560
 to catch the mice.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.400
 Did they consider dogs after that?

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.240
 Yeah, it was very much the old woman

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.600
 who introduced a non-neutral cat to the Marion Island.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.440
 Basically, they finally have got rid of the cats

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.520
 about 30 years ago.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.840
 And now they're going after the mice.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.080
 And if they can do it, if they can do full elimination,

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.480
 this will be a huge boom to the albatrosses, which

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.080
 have really suffered their populations.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.880
 So that might be what your hand is working on.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.640
 Very exciting.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.160
 Very cool.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.720
 It's very cool.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.480
 Yeah, very, very good.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.720
 OK, one more fact.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.480
 Do you want one that's also about birds,

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.240
 or one that's also from an expert in the field?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.000
 Also expert in the field.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.080
 Yeah, expert in the field.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.560
 OK, bad news to Kirsty Blackman and her penguin fat.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.400
 We are going to--

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.000
 No!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.880
 Sorry, Kirsty.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.400
 It's all right.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.080
 It was just penguin's cat taste fruit.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.080
 That's all I got.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.120
 Well, that's what Kirsty said.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.960
 Why would they ever want to taste fruit?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.160
 They're in a fruit-free environment.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.360
 I have all the information, but we're not going to go into it today.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.720
 We're going to instead have the fact from Ralph Derroa Mercado Misquita,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.440
 who writes that if elephants were to walk on the moon,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.040
 their limbs would need to be about 10 meters long

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.800
 to maintain normal gate mechanics.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800
 What?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.400
 So this is Ralph is a biomechanist and researcher in locomotion.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.520
 And his team wrote a paper about what elephants would have to do

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.120
 if they were on the moon.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.320
 I basically will just crazy this.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.200
 Basically, if they wanted to keep walking in the way that they walk on earth,

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.960
 they would need very, very long legs based on the gravity and the leg length and all that kind of stuff.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.200
 That is an astonishing fact in that I just assumed you could transport any animal to the moon

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.920
 and they would be able to moonwalk up there like they do down here.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.680
 Like when you say moonwalk, you don't mean walk backwards like Michael Jackson.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.320
 I think that's the agreed way of how you want to walk on the moon.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.160
 Is it not?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.120
 No, it's true.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.760
 But obviously if humans walk on the moon,

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.840
 then we bouncing rather than walking really, aren't we?

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.840
 So yeah, the elephants would have to have certain changes as well.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.600
 Ralph and his team will be presenting the projects at the Society of Biomechanics

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.080
 in Marseille in two weeks from the moment he sent that email.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.840
 So probably if you're in Marseille, you might have missed it.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.560
 Yeah, yeah, I think so, I'm afraid.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.720
 What are they hoping to achieve with this study?

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.040
 It's just fun, Andy.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.160
 Oh, I'm sorry. That's what I missed it.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.880
 Against people interested in locomotion and gait and biomechanics and stuff like that.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.600
 I don't think they're intending to actually send elephants up to the moon.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.000
 But I think that's what I think you're right, super interesting.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.960
 And if someone did, let's say, fantasise the idea of a moon zoo,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.000
 how would animals function on the moon?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.080
 If they were living there, there was probably so many interesting different ways

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.120
 that you would have to adapt an animal to be out there.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.320
 The space suit for the elephant is going to be a big ask, isn't it?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.160
 Where does the oxygen go in the nose, in the trunk?

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.800
 They don't need it, they don't need to help it.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.920
 They do, they just have a little thing on the end of their trunk, don't they?

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.760
 I think their space suit is doing more than just helping you breathe.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.680
 That's a good point. That's a good point.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.000
 That's a really good point.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.160
 Andy's like, no, I'll go out, I'll just hold my breath.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.320
 I'll go out, I can hold my breath for two minutes.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.280
 I'm going to go out, pick up a few moon rocks, come on.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.600
 I'm having a piss, I don't need, it's fine.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.560
 I don't breathe through my cock.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.400
 Shut up, Houston.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:47.000
 Your last words.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 I've been troubled, I've got three seconds left.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.720
 What can I do, Houston?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.840
 It's actually Houston.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:01.560
 Okay, on that diabolical note, we still have one more thing to do, and that is to tell you

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.640
 the listener.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.400
 If you are a member of the upper tier of Patreon, whether or not this week, you are a

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.880
 new custodian of one of our facts, so who is going to go first with one of those?

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880
 I'll do one.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.680
 This one goes out to Edward Cox.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.680
 Congratulations.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:22.160
 Edward, your fact is one from another great friend of the podcast, Leven Skyder, who came

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.720
 on the show in episode 13, and presented the fact that during the Second World War, the

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.680
 Nazis employed two official Nazi comedians, Tran and Heller.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:35.080
 They made a series of films, didn't they, and maybe they got fired for being a bit too

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.520
 'cause about regulations or maybe committing the cardinal sin of making fun of the regime

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520
 a little bit.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520
 Yeah.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520
 Yeah.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520
 Yeah.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.480
 Great fact, and this was our first moment with Leven on the show.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.080
 We've since had him on multiple times, largely when we do Nurdland, which is his festival

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080
 in Belgium.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.080
 Are we going to do it next year?

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.080
 He's just sent us a message.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.080
 Oh, has he?

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.080
 Okay.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.080
 Well, if the dates work.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080
 Yeah.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080
 Maybe.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080
 Is this an exclusive?

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.080
 That's an exclusive.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080
 It's an exclusive and official response, Leven.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080
 If you're listening.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080
 If the dates work.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.080
 Yes.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.080
 Maybe.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.080
 Great.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.080
 Very cool.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.080
 Okay.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.080
 I'll do one.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.080
 This was my fact from episode 13, and this is for Lin.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.600
 Lin, you are now the custodian of this fact.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.760
 The Philippines Basketball Association is the world's second oldest, and names of its

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:28.000
 ten teams include The Rain and Shine Elasto Painters, San Miguel Beer Men, and Talk and Text,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.200
 Troopang Textors. Great, isn't it? Great, isn't it?

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:39.600
 The long stage when you started, I thought we were going to get all ten teams. I don't remember

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:46.000
 this and the reason is, was I in this episode? No, you're not. No, I don't think I've ever even

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.440
 listened to this episode. Oh, wow, it's a goodie. It's a goodie. Yeah, yeah. Well, um,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.440
 link, congratulations. Yeah. Here is another fact. This one is now under the custodianship

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:04.240
 of Casey McKenzie Johnson. And the fact is that if you get a zebrafish drunk and put him in a tank

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:10.160
 with other zebrafish, the sober ones will follow the drunk one around. Lovely, lovely.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.400
 Anna's fact in episode 13, I feel like she was just hoping that that was what happened with her

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:23.280
 life as well. But no, this is about zebrafish, which are often used in medical trials because they

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.760
 have quite similar nervous system to humans. Yes, something, animals. I think maybe my cousin's

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:35.760
 studies zebrafish. Really? I haven't asked her lately how it's going. I'll have to drop her

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.760
 a line. Very nice. Yeah, that's cool. I didn't know that. Well, as we can, I mean, I barely know it

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:47.920
 clearly as a dude with me saying it. But yeah, should we have another one? Yeah, go with it. All right,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:54.160
 this one goes out to you. Joshua Smith. Joshua, your fact from this day forward for

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.960
 saking all others is that the youngest wooly mammoths are older than the oldest pharaohs. Kampang!

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:06.880
 Yes, Bosch. pharaohs, mammoths. There was a time where you could have had a pharaoh riding a

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.280
 woolly mammoth. Yeah. And it's an absolute catastrophe that we didn't make that happen as a species.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.520
 How stupid are we? We didn't know that the woolly mammoth was going to go extinct so quickly.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.760
 We did and we didn't. We also didn't know that the pharaohs were going to die out so quickly as well.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.040
 Yeah, no, you're right. You would have thought they'd both go on happily forever. But,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.520
 yeah, and the last woolly mammoths were living on this place called Wrangle Island, I think.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.320
 And it's just because it was quite remote. And they're all these theories about why they died out.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.480
 It's Siberia, right? Yeah, that's it. The two have ever met. Do we know if...

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.240
 No, absolutely not. No pharaohs in Siberia. No, but I meant ancient Egyptians. Would they have

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:50.160
 traveled at that point? I don't know. They did some seafaring and they did some travels in Africa,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.840
 but there's no way they could have got to Siberia. I'm sorry to say. They wouldn't have had the warm

00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:01.200
 talks for that environment. No, those like two necks and funny hats that they were. Absolutely not.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.480
 They would not be good in Siberia. Absolutely not. That's so sad. Yeah. Don't give us another.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.880
 This one is for Rachel Gilbert. Congratulations. You now own a James Harkin fact, which is that the CEO

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:18.560
 of Levi's hasn't washed his jeans in more than a year. Maybe 11 years at the folk.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:27.200
 The Seagull. No, I do remember this one. I remember it being quite controversial in the office,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.880
 because I think Anna said she had never washed her jeans ever. Was the idea you put it in the fridge?

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.160
 That was the freezer. That was one way to do it, but basically they said that they just don't need

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.240
 washing. And I just straight up disagree. Still, after all this time, I think washing clothes,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.120
 I mean, call me a rebel. Call me a maverick, but I think washing your clothes is a good thing.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.800
 It's not a jeans and not the kind of clothes that need washing every day. I try and get a new pair

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.760
 of pants on every day, and I don't mind sharing that on the show. But jeans, they can go a while.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.640
 Because if you spill something very urgent on them, then that's that you need to change them.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.440
 I think I agree if you shit yourself, you should change them.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.480
 Well, yeah, if you shit yourself badly, you should change them.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.160
 It's case by case. Oh, I've said too much. This is what I try and keep quiet about my personal life.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:29.280
 Okay. Let me do one more. This fact is going to Devon Perentstein.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.560
 Appears that Perent is this person's middle name.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:40.320
 And Devon, you are so lucky. You are really getting your money's worth with this fact,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.240
 because it's a Dunstribe fact. Wow, this is log. Is this how I said it on the day?

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.280
 Surely not. I read audiobooks that are short of this fact. The thing is, we just hadn't

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.520
 got the hang of delivering a crisp fact yet. Oh my god, the Alabama Constitution is sure

00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:02.000
 of this fact. Devon, your fact is the first successful transatlantic flight in 1919 was made by

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.600
 Alcock and Brown. At one point, they got lost in a cloud. And when they came out, they were only

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:14.720
 60 feet above the water and flying at 90 degrees to water. A double water in there

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.400
 as well. Yeah, I don't think I would have double watered it. Okay. Okay, mate.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.320
 Maybe I typed it up wrong. Maybe you actually said something that was only five words long,

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.720
 and I just got carried away when typing up the episode. I think I would have said the first bit

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.640
 as the fact and then quickly came in underneath it with a call with the case. But that's not an

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.720
 interesting fact that Alcock and Brown were the first people to cross the Atlantic. That's just

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.080
 a bit of trivia. I think Devon would feel absolutely stiff if his fact was that the first transatlantic

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.720
 flight was made by Alcock and Brown. Well, you're welcome then, Devon, because I've included

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.720
 the extra exciting detail. It was pretty amazing. They're getting lost in a cloud and flying out of

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.120
 the cloud at 90 degrees to the water is funny. Yeah. That's funny because you think there would be

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:04.560
 other signs like they're drinks billing. Yeah. Yes. Yes. All them falling out of the plane. Yeah.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.560
 Yeah. That's a terrible thing. I actually trimmed this down a bit before we read it out on

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:15.040
 today's little fish. I genuinely did. Okay. Are we going to do one or two more? Yep. And then what have

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:22.080
 you got for us? All right. This is for Ben Jimen. Not Ben Jamen. Ben Jimen. It's this fact in 2007. A

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:29.360
 woman called Evan Latimer inherited Napoleon's penis from her father. Oh. Oh. And we did a lot

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:38.800
 about the afterlife of Napoleon's pretty corporal. Because it was passed around and inherited and

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.080
 probably won and lost in car games and things like that. And it's had a it's had a busy busy afterlife.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:49.600
 Yeah. I play a lot of poker these days, but I think we are missing the time when you could just

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.560
 shove something on the table and say, let's play for that. Really? It's all chips and it's all like,

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.760
 oh, let's play for a fiver and stuff like that. You know, you don't get people shoving Mussolini's

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.960
 eyeball on the table and saying, I feel like all my stuff would just be rejected. Like that's very

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.440
 cool. Dan that you brought an unboxed Morgan Mindy toy from the 1970s. We actually dispute your

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.720
 assessment of its worth. You may have paid 100 quid for it. That doesn't actually mean it's worth

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.320
 100 quid of tips. Because normally it's like you throw your car keys on the table or your house keys

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:28.480
 or your wedding ring or something for Dan of course. It's a life size cut out of pedals.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.080
 Signed. Signed. You don't understand. Steve Martin briefly owned this tambourine.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:44.240
 But I think the I think the last time a family still own Napoleon's privates today.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.880
 All right. The penis anyway. Very good. So congratulations. Congratulations. Ben Jimin.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.000
 Okay. And let's do one more Dan. Hopefully something nice, short, snappy and not too

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.360
 penisy. Yep. So Karen Jains. You are now the custodian of Andrew Hunter Murray's fact, which is

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:07.600
 to say I don't care about something. A German person has the option of saying it's sausage to me.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.400
 Is this your first ever sausage fact on the show? I think it might be. First of many.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.600
 I realised then that this was a rich seam of stuff. Das ist mir versed. I don't care. That's

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:22.960
 sausage sausage to me. But the Germans love sausage, which is why it's a strange, you know,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.680
 it's a popular national dish. Yeah. Yeah. We actually found that in a recent episode that you

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:34.560
 weren't in, that they also say that's train station Tanai to me. That's quite good because that is

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:39.840
 the sort of thing that you just let pass by you. That's brilliant. Yeah. Oh. The first ever photo shoot

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.800
 that we had with a national newspaper had us sitting down with placards with our favorite facts

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:50.080
 on it. And this was your fact. You had that. I had one about being kicked in the head or something.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.600
 That's right. I remember what Anna's was. And then Dan had a huge billboard next to him with one

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:05.920
 of his facts. There are 30 cricket teams in. Okay. Thank you so much for listening to this episode

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:12.000
 of Little Fish. And congratulations to all the custodians of today's facts. If you have some

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.440
 interesting facts that you want to tell us, then send them over to Andy at podcast@QI.com. He will

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.280
 shuffle through them and send them out to us. And we might mention them next week or the week after

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.840
 or the week after that, or anytime in the next 20 years, until eventually we decide to stop doing

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:33.280
 this. If you would like to get custodian ship of a fact yourself, then go to patreon.com/nosicsthingsafish.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.080
 And you can join the friend of the podcast here to do that. But in the meantime, please enjoy

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:52.960
 the rest of your week and we will see you on Friday for a big old episode of No Six Thingsafish. Bye!
