1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,080
 Ho ho ho!

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,400
 Hey everyone, welcome to this episode of Little Fish.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,480
 Before we get into it,

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,280
 there is just a little announcement that I would like to make.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,920
 Christmas is only a few days away,

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,360
 and if you were looking to get a present

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,240
 for someone in your life who loves fish,

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,480
 I would love it if you would be able to come

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,240
 to my new tour that I'm gonna be doing

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,920
 around the UK as of March next year.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,760
 - What?

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,800
 - Yeah, I'm so sorry, this is a terrible way for you to find out.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,160
 - What are you going on tour?

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,200
 - You're not, unfortunately, Dan!

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,560
 - You can come, I don't have a stitch to wear.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,120
 You can come and watch, I can do my act.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,400
 - No one wants to see that, man.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,360
 - I'm practicing, I can do it without injuring any

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,480
 of the audience by now, I really can.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,400
 - Oh, Dan, I'm so excited.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,240
 Where are we going?

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,080
 Where are we going?

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,720
 - Okay, well, this show is called "This Changes Everything,"

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,200
 and we should clarify, it's just Dan, it's not me,

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,640
 I'm just being a silly banana.

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,760
 - You could come along, I would be very handy

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,120
 if you'd have a front row with pom-poms every night, Dan.

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,520
 It's gonna be Dan on tour, where are you going?

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,000
 So, on the 15th of March, I'm gonna be in Warwick,

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,800
 and then I'm gonna be in Salford, I'm gonna be in Brighton,

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,160
 I'm gonna be in Edinburgh, Nottingham,

33
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,400
 and then I'm gonna be playing

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,040
 the Royal Geographical Society in London.

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,040
 Yeah, this is gonna be a great evening of mysteries,

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,640
 amazing fact, mind-blowing stories from history.

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,000
 I've put together the best of the best of stuff

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
 that I've been digging up over the last 10 years.

39
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,280
 If you've read my book, The Theory of Everything Else,

40
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,880
 you'll know the kind of tone of it.

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,600
 It's all the stuff that has led to the world we live in today,

42
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,720
 but it's all the bits of history

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,320
 that have been swept under the carpet,

44
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,280
 'cause people would rather you didn't know about it.

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,600
 So, if you like mystery adventure and jokes,

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
 please come along to "This Changes Everything."

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,800
 So, if you're looking to buy tickets for yourself

48
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,160
 or someone else, just put "Dantriber, This Changes Everything,"

49
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,480
 tour into Google.

50
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,000
 You'll find a link you can also find it on my Instagram,

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
 @Triberland, it'll be in the bio.

52
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,360
 Please come along, it's gonna be an awesome night,

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,160
 and I'll be there, and Andy will be there.

54
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,440
 I mean, just come to Justicey Andy.

55
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,040
 Sure.

56
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,720
 Sit and watch Andy watching me.

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,360
 We've got another little fish for you now.

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
 These are your facts, here we go.

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
 On with the show.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,680
 On with the bug-gast.

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,600
 Thank you for doing that.

62
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,800
 I didn't have a choice.

63
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,200
 Now, please, please, then, put the call through

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
 and release my family.

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:43,880
 Hello, and welcome to Little Fish,

66
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,120
 the show where we look at the great facts

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,440
 that you guys have been sending in over the past seven days.

68
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,360
 Andy has gone through the inbox as bulging as it was

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,280
 and taken out the very, very best sent them to me

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,840
 and to Dan and kept some for himself,

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
 and we're gonna read through them today

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,640
 and maybe chat a little bit more about them.

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,960
 So, without further ado, who's gonna read the first one?

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
 Maybe Dan.

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
 Yeah, okay.

76
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,400
 I got a fact here, which is from Eli Jones,

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,160
 who says that jungle gyms were invented in Japan

78
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,120
 in the 1880s by a British polygamist

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,360
 with the goal of training a generation of children

80
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,320
 intrinsically comprehend the fourth dimension.

81
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,080
 So, jungle gyms, I think, is what I would have called softplay

82
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
 when I was younger.

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,320
 Right.

84
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,600
 So, me, a jungle gym is the metallic bars

85
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,920
 that are in a sort of a crescent shape

86
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,120
 from the ground that you would climb around.

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
 Oh, interesting.

88
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,160
 An adventure playground?

89
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,920
 Yeah, that's a jungle gym to me,

90
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,000
 but do we know what this guy invented?

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
 Well, this sounds like a hard play.

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
 Yeah, that sounds like a hard play.

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
 Hard play.

94
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,080
 Well, here's a story.

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,160
 While living with one of his families in Japan,

96
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,760
 a British mathematician called Charles Howard Hinton,

97
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,400
 tried to instill a fundamental understanding

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,800
 of the fourth-dimensional geometry into his children.

99
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
 What is the fourth dimension?

100
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,560
 Sorry to throw you an easy one so early.

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
 Yeah, well, I know.

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,880
 Imagine you take a square and you turn it into a cube.

103
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,080
 You're adding a third dimension.

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
 Now imagine you turn that into the next level up.

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 That's the fourth dimension.

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,400
 I've just got another cube on top of a cube in my head.

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,720
 That would be a hyper cube.

108
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,200
 It's really hard to explain.

109
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,160
 Yeah, I thought the fourth dimension was time,

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,120
 but that's clearly not what we thought about here.

111
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,880
 No, this is a fourth spatial dimension.

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
 Oh, right.

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,440
 Oh, boy.

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
 OK, well, it sounds like

115
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
 soft play might not have been enough to do it.

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
 I'd say.

117
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,760
 I suppose was he trying to teach children spatial awareness

118
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,160
 because they're moving through a 3D space.

119
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,680
 Yeah.

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
 And they're becoming, I think,

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,920
 other children, the fourth dimension?

122
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,840
 He said he wanted to help them with the understanding

123
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,920
 that we typically move in two dimensions,

124
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,000
 walking around cardinal directions, as we said.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
 Yeah, so you walk flat on the earth.

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
 We're not flying like a bird is in three dimensions

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
 because it can go up and down as well,

128
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,960
 but normally we're on the ground.

129
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
 If someone stops me and asks the directions,

130
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,400
 I very rarely include the third dimension in my answer.

131
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,040
 I'd say take the second left down here.

132
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,400
 And I'd never say you'll need to rise about three meters.

133
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,360
 [LAUGHTER]

134
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,920
 And then go into the fourth dimension.

135
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,280
 So to us, you'll still appear like you're in the same place,

136
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,640
 but actually you'll be in a different position

137
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
 in that other dimension.

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
 It's very simple stuff, guys.

139
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,400
 So he wanted to do this by creating a bamboo grid

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,880
 and running drills with his kids,

141
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
 where he would shout coordinates at them

142
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,000
 and it would scramble through the grid

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,960
 to get the coordination right.

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,480
 Yeah.

145
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,240
 So that was his plan.

146
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,640
 It was to invent a device that allowed for them to do that.

147
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,080
 A byproduct of it was the invention of the jungle gym.

148
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,440
 Yeah, I've seen a picture of it.

149
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,120
 And a jungle gym you're talking about is like a climbing frame

150
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,040
 but made of lots of boxes.

151
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
 OK.

152
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,000
 If that makes sense.

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,880
 What was the other thing that maybe it was soft play

155
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,760
 that was invented by a guy in Manchester

156
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,320
 who saw the people were playing in burnt out cars

157
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,360
 and decided that maybe we should give them something else to play in?

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
 Was it bombsites as well?

159
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,360
 Yeah, I think so.

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,680
 It was a lot of precarious sort of concrete and rusty metal,

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,120
 strewn patches and kids were playing on them

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
 because it was a kind of free space for them to play.

163
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
 And it never did them any harm.

164
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,840
 He definitely came up with some kind of playground.

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, remember that.

166
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,040
 Yeah, well, great fact.

167
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,920
 Indeed, Andy, what about another one?

168
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,120
 All right, here's one from Andy Walker

169
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,040
 who's sending his favorite film fact.

170
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,760
 The UK actor Richard Todd was a D-Day veteran.

171
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
 And I really like this.

172
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,160
 He was in a film called The Longest Day,

173
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,240
 which is a really, really famous second mobile film.

174
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,680
 It's about three hours long.

175
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,760
 It recreates large chunks of D-Day, basically.

176
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
 He was in the film The Longest Day,

177
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,600
 playing his real life commanding officer.

178
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,680
 So he had been at D-Day himself as a young man.

179
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,760
 20 years later, he gets cast in this film,

180
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,360
 playing the guy who was in charge of him on D-Day.

181
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,040
 And there's someone else in the film,

182
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,080
 playing him as a younger man.

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
 Really? Yeah.

184
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,160
 And I'd never heard of Richard Todd, really.

185
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,080
 I hadn't seen this film.

186
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,520
 And he was incredibly popular in the '60s and '50s.

187
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,240
 And he was a matinee idol.

188
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,440
 And he was there at Pegasus Bridge in D-Day,

189
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,760
 which he had to capture and sort of hold off

190
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,160
 really fierce German attacks to try and retake it

191
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,960
 'cause they were trying to shut the whole thing down.

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,200
 And yeah, he ended up in this film later on

193
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,480
 with a load of, I mean, it's a huge film

194
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,400
 with a lot of incredibly famous actors in it,

195
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,040
 many of whom had been there on the actual D-Day.

196
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
 That must be crazy.

197
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,040
 It must have been so surreal, yeah, exactly.

198
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
 And he had enough of an impact

199
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,200
 that he was a character in that movie.

200
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,680
 Yeah, that's pretty wild, isn't it?

201
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really cool.

202
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 I guess, small regiments,

203
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,800
 you would know the names of everyone,

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,440
 you know, that you were talking about.

205
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,040
 He was one of the first people on the ground.

206
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,400
 He landed at 40 minutes after midnight on D-Day.

207
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
 He was absolutely one of the first people on D-Day.

208
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,640
 Did it happen? Did it start at midnight?

209
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,560
 That was maybe that's when the parachutes in Dog's landed.

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,520
 I think it was when the parachute just landed.

211
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,240
 I think we said in an early episode

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,640
 that that's what came in first.

213
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,920
 He was one of the first two-legged mammals on the ground.

215
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,840
 I'm not sure I would start at midnight

216
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,000
 'cause I think that's when they'd be expecting it.

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,840
 Good point.

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,640
 I'd start like 17 minutes past something.

219
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,240
 Well, that's why I was such a terrible failure

220
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,920
 'cause they didn't listen to you.

221
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,320
 (laughing)

222
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
 No, that's fair enough.

223
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,240
 I don't know if it was dead on.

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,640
 But I did a little more reading about him in his life

225
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,720
 and it was a very interesting life.

226
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
 One of his other superior officers on D-Day,

227
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,440
 this is just an amazing name I've tracked down.

228
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,680
 He was a guy called Jeffrey Pine Coffin.

229
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,640
 That was his surname.

230
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,400
 (laughing)

231
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,240
 That was very good.

232
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 It was a double barrel name.

233
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,840
 The Pine and the Coffin families

234
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,400
 had got married to each other at surgery before.

235
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,360
 And they call themselves Pine Coffin.

236
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
 You don't get names like that anymore.

237
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
 It's a brilliant name.

238
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

239
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
 Okay, here's one from me by Dario Persecino.

240
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,360
 Thank you very much for writing Dario

241
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,280
 with this incredible fact

242
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,080
 that it would take just over 1,418 years

243
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,840
 to eat a full Jesus.

244
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,160
 (laughing)

245
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,520
 So what Dario has done here is assumed

246
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,040
 that when you're eating a communion wafer,

247
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,160
 which is the body of Christ,

248
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,040
 that that is actually Jesus.

249
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
 And he's worked out all the stuff.

250
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,440
 He's sent us all the working out

251
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,360
 and I can promise you that it's all great.

252
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,000
 And he worked out that you would need

253
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,760
 74,000 communion wafers to eat a complete Jesus.

254
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,840
 And assuming you receive communion once a week,

255
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,720
 it would take approximately 1,418 years

256
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,920
 to eat a full Jesus.

257
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,800
 He says this does not take into account any philosophical

258
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,560
 issues of transubstantiation

259
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,960
 and that it hasn't taken into account

260
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
 the weight of Jesus' foreskin,

261
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,400
 which he said he knows would be a point of interest to me,

262
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,120
 because that's why it was excommunicated.

263
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,000
 But he said he figured it would only make

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,680
 a one small wafer difference.

265
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,920
 Yeah.

266
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,880
 I get a friend of the podcast, Jesus' foreskin.

267
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
 Absolutely.

268
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,920
 But Dario are honestly absolutely stunning bits of maths.

269
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
 I wonder how many bottles of wine it would take

270
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,640
 to drink or the blood of Christ?

271
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
 Dario, get on it.

272
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,840
 That's in true Hawkins style, that fact, isn't it?

273
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,040
 I read a recent article about communion wafer,

274
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,760
 which had got the blood of Christ on it.

275
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,680
 And they've found red stains on the communion wafer

276
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,360
 and thought that's what had happened.

277
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,160
 In actual fact, it was caused by a fungus

278
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,120
 and three different types of bacteria,

279
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,800
 all of which are commonly found on human hands.

280
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720
 Oh.

281
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,560
 Now, there is a theory that Jesus was a mushroom.

282
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,120
 So he could have been reforming on that wafer.

283
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,720
 Right.

284
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,560
 Could be.

285
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,040
 Could be.

286
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,320
 That's brilliant.

287
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,200
 That's really good.

288
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,960
 You've all taken your tinful hats off, it's going on.

289
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,640
 Shall I do one?

290
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,440
 Yeah, go for it.

291
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,680
 OK, this is from Anton Guillenberg, who writes,

292
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,280
 fact, the Vatican Apostolic Library

293
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,120
 holds shelf after shelf of self-help hiccup remedies.

294
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,960
 Do they have the figure up the anus?

295
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,080
 Which is--

296
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,520
 I believe the only medically certain way to cure it.

297
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,400
 You're right.

298
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,880
 You're right.

299
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
 Wow.

300
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,120
 It's a total rectal massage.

301
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,640
 Yeah.

302
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,360
 Is that what the Sistine Chapel is?

303
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,360
 Is God's finger coming to a stop?

304
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,560
 Adam, have you got hiccups?

305
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
 [LAUGHTER]

306
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,800
 OK, so this is Pope Pius XII, who reported a statement.

307
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
 Oh, end of the podcast.

308
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
 Huge friend.

309
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,280
 Give me--

310
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,800
 Give me one.

311
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,240
 He was the guy who said that anyone who mentions Jesus

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,120
 is fast and gets it.

313
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,520
 It's going to be a fake death.

314
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,840
 He was embalming, went incredibly wrong.

315
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,680
 Yeah, the whole sum of us.

316
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,440
 Who had that crazy doctor?

317
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,480
 He was a proper friend of the podcast.

318
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

319
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,800
 Well, welcome back, Pope Pius.

320
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,120
 So yeah, he suffered from chronic hiccups.

321
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,240
 So over the years, people from all around the world

322
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,120
 would send him all kind of remedies

323
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,480
 from charming suggestions like being startled

324
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,560
 to the more vulgar ideas that we have mentioned on our show.

325
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,400
 I'm assuming--

326
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 Oh, there we go.

327
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,800
 Finger up the bum, bum.

328
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,240
 So as correspondence addressed to the Pope,

329
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,280
 God's representative on Earth, these submissions

330
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,240
 could not be discarded and were preserved

331
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,160
 according to standard Vatican archival procedures.

332
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
 So they are all there.

333
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
 So there's many unusual items including all of these remedies

334
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
 that are now part of the collection that are maintained

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,920
 by the Holy See.

336
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,760
 Yeah.

337
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
 There's a P.S. to this email, by the way, from Anton,

338
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 who is in Helsinki in Finland, just to add that.

339
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,600
 P.S., I have actually come to possess

340
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
 the only foolproof method to cure hiccups.

341
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,880
 As it involves bizarre choreography,

342
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,160
 snaps, and singing in Swedish, it's rather difficult

343
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,240
 to explain and writing.

344
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
 But if we ever meet in person, I would

345
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
 be delighted to share it with you.

346
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,000
 OK, let's book that gig and Helsinki straight away.

347
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,360
 Absolutely.

348
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,840
 The only-- I have come into possess the only foolproof method.

349
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,680
 It's quite strong.

350
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,200
 Isn't it?

351
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,240
 It's got choreography involved?

352
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,920
 Yeah.

353
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,760
 I think this is--

354
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,280
 I imagine what it is is everyone gets some snaps,

355
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
 stands in a circle.

356
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,800
 Does this sort of really amazing dance

357
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,040
 with your arms going one way, your legs

358
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
 going the other way, all that kind of stuff?

359
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,920
 Then we all say something like some ancient riddle

360
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
 in Swedish.

361
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,040
 And then we all put our fingers on each other's buns.

362
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,800
 [LAUGHTER]

363
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,640
 I've got one.

364
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,240
 Yeah.

365
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,240
 This is from Emma Wood, and I find it quite fascinating.

366
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,440
 So she sends a couple of facts.

367
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,200
 I'll just do the second one if that's the right Emma.

368
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
 It's a bit anecdotal, but she says,

369
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
 I personally found this quite a cursed piece of trivia years

370
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,240
 ago on a tour of a famous commercial radio station.

371
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,840
 I was told for their breakfast show

372
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,240
 that they use a specific voice filter

373
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,680
 to make the hosts sound more artificially happy

374
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,200
 in the mornings.

375
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 Yeah.

376
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,160
 Is there any knowledge about--

377
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,320
 Is this person British?

378
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,840
 Do you think?

379
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,480
 I don't know.

380
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,200
 She says, "I, in my research, unfortunately,

381
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,720
 cannot find anything documented to back this up.

382
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
 Is this a radio-wide conspiracy?

383
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,600
 Have I blown this shit wide open?"

384
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,200
 Well, we can say because we know Zoe Ball,

385
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,360
 and we've all been on her breakfast show,

386
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,280
 that she is genuinely that happy all the time.

387
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,800
 Yeah.

388
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,720
 But we had a filter to our show.

389
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
 This show we've got lots of filters on her.

390
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,400
 Oh, yeah, just remind me what they are again.

391
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,720
 Well, we put on one which makes us sound a bit cleverer.

392
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 Oh, yeah.

393
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 Tantios has been broken for a while, actually.

394
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,000
 I know.

395
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,320
 I've been meaning to get that looked at.

396
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,040
 I have the cruelness built on the mind of us.

397
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,760
 You've got that set too strong today, I see.

398
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,320
 Anna, believe it or not, we've turned down her sarcasm filter.

399
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,120
 Yeah, that's why she hasn't been on for three months.

400
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
 Yes.

401
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:57,080
 OK, so here is another fact.

402
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,560
 This one is from Gudrun Ulfaz. here.

403
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,680
 She says that Taurus in Iceland have been tagging the place name

404
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,680
 Giel Skulder in hundreds of photos on social media recently.

405
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,320
 The weird thing is that these photos

406
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,440
 seem to be taken in lots of different places

407
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,840
 around the country.

408
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,320
 The reason is because Giel Skulder in Icelandic

409
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
 means parking fees apply.

410
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,520
 Lovely.

411
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,760
 Lovely.

412
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
 And apparently lots of parking lots.

413
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,720
 People have been putting up this sign

414
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
 to make sure that people pay.

415
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,080
 But then people have just seen it.

416
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,760
 In fairness, it looks like it could be a name of a place

417
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,840
 in Iceland for sure.

418
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,440
 Brilliant.

419
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,720
 But of course, it reminds me of the pravo-yasty thing

420
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,960
 a few years going to Ireland where loads of traffic

421
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,080
 infringements had been given to this single person

422
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,040
 called pravo-yasty.

423
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,920
 But it turned out the pravo-yasty was

424
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,720
 Polish for driving license.

425
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
 That's a good phrase.

426
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,560
 I left that one.

427
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

428
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
 Should I do one more?

429
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,720
 Yeah, yeah.

430
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,120
 This one is such a fish-guired fact.

431
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,040
 You have to know an in-joke in order to like this one.

432
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,400
 I think Caleb Groen has sent this in.

433
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,320
 I'm a longtime fan of the podcast.

434
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,560
 As a US law student, I recently came across a fact

435
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,720
 that might be of interest to you.

436
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,800
 Judging by word count, the constitution

437
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,360
 of the US state of Alabama sources vary.

438
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,040
 But 373,000 words is probably the best estimate.

439
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,800
 Wow.

440
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,640
 Is longer than Anna Karenina, which is around 364,000,

441
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,520
 as the highest estimate.

442
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,120
 Wow.

443
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,160
 That's the fact.

444
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,000
 How much verbiage does it take to run Alabama effectively?

445
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Probably there's a lot of stuff about farming

446
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,280
 in the Alabama constitution.

447
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,440
 Like there is an Anna Karenina.

448
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,960
 Yeah.

449
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,600
 I think Caleb basically wanted to let us know that

450
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,240
 because he said spoilers about the Alabama Constitution

451
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,160
 will probably be less violating to our listeners

452
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,720
 than spoilers about Anna Karenina.

453
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,880
 That's really brilliant.

454
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,200
 Andy, go ahead and give us one more.

455
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
 All right, here's a fun one.

456
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,200
 This is very exciting.

457
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,960
 This is from Jana Row.

458
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,960
 And Jana is working on a sub-antarctic sub-antarctic.

459
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,680
 It's not whether that sees lived.

460
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,240
 It's the entrance to the hall over.

461
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,080
 Sorry.

462
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,800
 I think this must mean just above the Antarctic, rather than just

463
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,960
 below the South Pole.

464
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,520
 An island called Marion Island off the coast of South Africa.

465
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,960
 And Jana and 19 others are living there for 15 months

466
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,920
 doing scientific research.

467
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,640
 Wow.

468
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,200
 Your podcast keeps me highly entertained

469
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,800
 and puts a smile on my face in the field

470
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,440
 while we hike hundreds of kilometers in shitty weather.

471
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,000
 And Jana is a seabird researcher working closely

472
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,960
 with wandering albatross.

473
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,640
 So cool.

474
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,480
 So cool.

475
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,160
 And just sends a few brilliant facts about the wandering albatross.

476
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,320
 So I don't think we've mentioned them very much.

477
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,600
 And they're basically--

478
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,080
 They've got the longest wingspan any bird.

479
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,400
 It's two and a half meters roughly.

480
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,080
 And I really like this.

481
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,600
 They've got this elbow locking mechanism.

482
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,680
 They can keep their wings open for as long as they want

483
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,960
 without activating their muscles.

484
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,680
 And basically, they can fly several hundred miles

485
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,240
 in one go without flapping their wings once.

486
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,400
 I just didn't really clock how far they can fly.

487
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,920
 Imagine several hundred miles from wherever you are.

488
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
 Yeah.

489
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
 It's a long way away.

490
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 From London to Bolton.

491
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
 Without flapping.

492
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
 Yeah.

493
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
 Well.

494
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,600
 Last time I drove, I was flapping the whole way.

495
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,920
 Right.

496
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,120
 And so they lock their elbows so that it just--

497
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
 Basically, it's the wind.

498
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
 Yeah, exactly.

499
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,320
 And I looked at what's going on on Marion Island

500
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,280
 from where Jana is riding.

501
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,480
 And it's where they're trying to wipe out the mice,

502
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,000
 which have for years been absolutely demolishing the albatrosses.

503
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,520
 It's been a real catastrophe.

504
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,240
 It's half the worlds wandering albatrosses

505
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,560
 are bred on this island and the island next door.

506
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,520
 So it's a really important base for them.

507
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,400
 They shouldn't be called the wandering albatross.

508
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,440
 Should they consider them have such a small--

509
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,200
 They're all from here.

510
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,240
 [LAUGHTER]

511
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
 Well, they do wander.

512
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
 They can fly--

513
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,600
 some of them have been seen flying 75,000 miles in one year.

514
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,560
 So they do wander.

515
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,880
 Just a couple of flaps together.

516
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,640
 Basically, yeah.

517
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
 And basically, this island introduced five cats

518
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,320
 to the island in 1949 to control the mice,

519
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,120
 which were already causing a huge problem.

520
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,720
 Guess what they didn't do to the cats?

521
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,240
 New to them.

522
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
 They didn't do to them.

523
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,120
 So then they had hundreds of cats

524
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,760
 praying on the albatrosses because it's easier

525
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,560
 to catch the mice.

526
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,400
 Did they consider dogs after that?

527
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
 Yeah, it was very much the old woman

528
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,600
 who introduced a non-neutral cat to the Marion Island.

529
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,440
 Basically, they finally have got rid of the cats

530
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,520
 about 30 years ago.

531
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,840
 And now they're going after the mice.

532
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,080
 And if they can do it, if they can do full elimination,

533
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,480
 this will be a huge boom to the albatrosses, which

534
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,080
 have really suffered their populations.

535
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,880
 So that might be what your hand is working on.

536
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,640
 Very exciting.

537
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,160
 Very cool.

538
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,720
 It's very cool.

539
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,480
 Yeah, very, very good.

540
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,720
 OK, one more fact.

541
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,480
 Do you want one that's also about birds,

542
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,240
 or one that's also from an expert in the field?

543
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,000
 Also expert in the field.

544
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,080
 Yeah, expert in the field.

545
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,560
 OK, bad news to Kirsty Blackman and her penguin fat.

546
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,400
 We are going to--

547
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,000
 No!

548
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,880
 Sorry, Kirsty.

549
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,400
 It's all right.

550
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,080
 It was just penguin's cat taste fruit.

551
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
 That's all I got.

552
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,120
 Well, that's what Kirsty said.

553
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
 Why would they ever want to taste fruit?

554
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,160
 They're in a fruit-free environment.

555
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,360
 I have all the information, but we're not going to go into it today.

556
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,720
 We're going to instead have the fact from Ralph Derroa Mercado Misquita,

557
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,440
 who writes that if elephants were to walk on the moon,

558
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,040
 their limbs would need to be about 10 meters long

559
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,800
 to maintain normal gate mechanics.

560
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 What?

561
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,400
 So this is Ralph is a biomechanist and researcher in locomotion.

562
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,520
 And his team wrote a paper about what elephants would have to do

563
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
 if they were on the moon.

564
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,320
 I basically will just crazy this.

565
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,200
 Basically, if they wanted to keep walking in the way that they walk on earth,

566
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,960
 they would need very, very long legs based on the gravity and the leg length and all that kind of stuff.

567
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,200
 That is an astonishing fact in that I just assumed you could transport any animal to the moon

568
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,920
 and they would be able to moonwalk up there like they do down here.

569
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,680
 Like when you say moonwalk, you don't mean walk backwards like Michael Jackson.

570
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,320
 I think that's the agreed way of how you want to walk on the moon.

571
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,160
 Is it not?

572
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,120
 No, it's true.

573
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,760
 But obviously if humans walk on the moon,

574
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,840
 then we bouncing rather than walking really, aren't we?

575
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
 So yeah, the elephants would have to have certain changes as well.

576
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,600
 Ralph and his team will be presenting the projects at the Society of Biomechanics

577
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,080
 in Marseille in two weeks from the moment he sent that email.

578
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,840
 So probably if you're in Marseille, you might have missed it.

579
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,560
 Yeah, yeah, I think so, I'm afraid.

580
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,720
 What are they hoping to achieve with this study?

581
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
 It's just fun, Andy.

582
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,160
 Oh, I'm sorry. That's what I missed it.

583
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,880
 Against people interested in locomotion and gait and biomechanics and stuff like that.

584
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,600
 I don't think they're intending to actually send elephants up to the moon.

585
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,000
 But I think that's what I think you're right, super interesting.

586
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,960
 And if someone did, let's say, fantasise the idea of a moon zoo,

587
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,000
 how would animals function on the moon?

588
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,080
 If they were living there, there was probably so many interesting different ways

589
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,120
 that you would have to adapt an animal to be out there.

590
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,320
 The space suit for the elephant is going to be a big ask, isn't it?

591
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,160
 Where does the oxygen go in the nose, in the trunk?

592
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,800
 They don't need it, they don't need to help it.

593
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,920
 They do, they just have a little thing on the end of their trunk, don't they?

594
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,760
 I think their space suit is doing more than just helping you breathe.

595
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,680
 That's a good point. That's a good point.

596
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,000
 That's a really good point.

597
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,160
 Andy's like, no, I'll go out, I'll just hold my breath.

598
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,320
 I'll go out, I can hold my breath for two minutes.

599
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,280
 I'm going to go out, pick up a few moon rocks, come on.

600
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,600
 I'm having a piss, I don't need, it's fine.

601
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,560
 I don't breathe through my cock.

602
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,400
 Shut up, Houston.

603
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,000
 Your last words.

604
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I've been troubled, I've got three seconds left.

605
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,720
 What can I do, Houston?

606
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,840
 It's actually Houston.

607
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:01,560
 Okay, on that diabolical note, we still have one more thing to do, and that is to tell you

608
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,640
 the listener.

609
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,400
 If you are a member of the upper tier of Patreon, whether or not this week, you are a

610
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,880
 new custodian of one of our facts, so who is going to go first with one of those?

611
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
 I'll do one.

612
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,680
 This one goes out to Edward Cox.

613
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
 Congratulations.

614
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:22,160
 Edward, your fact is one from another great friend of the podcast, Leven Skyder, who came

615
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,720
 on the show in episode 13, and presented the fact that during the Second World War, the

616
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,680
 Nazis employed two official Nazi comedians, Tran and Heller.

617
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,080
 They made a series of films, didn't they, and maybe they got fired for being a bit too

618
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,520
 'cause about regulations or maybe committing the cardinal sin of making fun of the regime

619
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
 a little bit.

620
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
 Yeah.

621
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
 Yeah.

622
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
 Yeah.

623
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,480
 Great fact, and this was our first moment with Leven on the show.

624
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,080
 We've since had him on multiple times, largely when we do Nurdland, which is his festival

625
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
 in Belgium.

626
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
 Are we going to do it next year?

627
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
 He's just sent us a message.

628
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
 Oh, has he?

629
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
 Okay.

630
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
 Well, if the dates work.

631
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
 Yeah.

632
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
 Maybe.

633
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 Is this an exclusive?

634
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
 That's an exclusive.

635
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
 It's an exclusive and official response, Leven.

636
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
 If you're listening.

637
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
 If the dates work.

638
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
 Yes.

639
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 Maybe.

640
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
 Great.

641
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
 Very cool.

642
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
 Okay.

643
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 I'll do one.

644
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
 This was my fact from episode 13, and this is for Lin.

645
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,600
 Lin, you are now the custodian of this fact.

646
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,760
 The Philippines Basketball Association is the world's second oldest, and names of its

647
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:28,000
 ten teams include The Rain and Shine Elasto Painters, San Miguel Beer Men, and Talk and Text,

648
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,200
 Troopang Textors. Great, isn't it? Great, isn't it?

649
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:39,600
 The long stage when you started, I thought we were going to get all ten teams. I don't remember

650
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,000
 this and the reason is, was I in this episode? No, you're not. No, I don't think I've ever even

651
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,440
 listened to this episode. Oh, wow, it's a goodie. It's a goodie. Yeah, yeah. Well, um,

652
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,440
 link, congratulations. Yeah. Here is another fact. This one is now under the custodianship

653
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,240
 of Casey McKenzie Johnson. And the fact is that if you get a zebrafish drunk and put him in a tank

654
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,160
 with other zebrafish, the sober ones will follow the drunk one around. Lovely, lovely.

655
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,400
 Anna's fact in episode 13, I feel like she was just hoping that that was what happened with her

656
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,280
 life as well. But no, this is about zebrafish, which are often used in medical trials because they

657
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,760
 have quite similar nervous system to humans. Yes, something, animals. I think maybe my cousin's

658
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,760
 studies zebrafish. Really? I haven't asked her lately how it's going. I'll have to drop her

659
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,760
 a line. Very nice. Yeah, that's cool. I didn't know that. Well, as we can, I mean, I barely know it

660
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,920
 clearly as a dude with me saying it. But yeah, should we have another one? Yeah, go with it. All right,

661
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,160
 this one goes out to you. Joshua Smith. Joshua, your fact from this day forward for

662
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,960
 saking all others is that the youngest wooly mammoths are older than the oldest pharaohs. Kampang!

663
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,880
 Yes, Bosch. pharaohs, mammoths. There was a time where you could have had a pharaoh riding a

664
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,280
 woolly mammoth. Yeah. And it's an absolute catastrophe that we didn't make that happen as a species.

665
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,520
 How stupid are we? We didn't know that the woolly mammoth was going to go extinct so quickly.

666
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,760
 We did and we didn't. We also didn't know that the pharaohs were going to die out so quickly as well.

667
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,040
 Yeah, no, you're right. You would have thought they'd both go on happily forever. But,

668
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,520
 yeah, and the last woolly mammoths were living on this place called Wrangle Island, I think.

669
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,320
 And it's just because it was quite remote. And they're all these theories about why they died out.

670
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,480
 It's Siberia, right? Yeah, that's it. The two have ever met. Do we know if...

671
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,240
 No, absolutely not. No pharaohs in Siberia. No, but I meant ancient Egyptians. Would they have

672
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,160
 traveled at that point? I don't know. They did some seafaring and they did some travels in Africa,

673
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,840
 but there's no way they could have got to Siberia. I'm sorry to say. They wouldn't have had the warm

674
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:01,200
 talks for that environment. No, those like two necks and funny hats that they were. Absolutely not.

675
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,480
 They would not be good in Siberia. Absolutely not. That's so sad. Yeah. Don't give us another.

676
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,880
 This one is for Rachel Gilbert. Congratulations. You now own a James Harkin fact, which is that the CEO

677
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,560
 of Levi's hasn't washed his jeans in more than a year. Maybe 11 years at the folk.

678
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,200
 The Seagull. No, I do remember this one. I remember it being quite controversial in the office,

679
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,880
 because I think Anna said she had never washed her jeans ever. Was the idea you put it in the fridge?

680
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,160
 That was the freezer. That was one way to do it, but basically they said that they just don't need

681
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,240
 washing. And I just straight up disagree. Still, after all this time, I think washing clothes,

682
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,120
 I mean, call me a rebel. Call me a maverick, but I think washing your clothes is a good thing.

683
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,800
 It's not a jeans and not the kind of clothes that need washing every day. I try and get a new pair

684
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,760
 of pants on every day, and I don't mind sharing that on the show. But jeans, they can go a while.

685
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,640
 Because if you spill something very urgent on them, then that's that you need to change them.

686
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,440
 I think I agree if you shit yourself, you should change them.

687
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,480
 Well, yeah, if you shit yourself badly, you should change them.

688
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,160
 It's case by case. Oh, I've said too much. This is what I try and keep quiet about my personal life.

689
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:29,280
 Okay. Let me do one more. This fact is going to Devon Perentstein.

690
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,560
 Appears that Perent is this person's middle name.

691
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:40,320
 And Devon, you are so lucky. You are really getting your money's worth with this fact,

692
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,240
 because it's a Dunstribe fact. Wow, this is log. Is this how I said it on the day?

693
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,280
 Surely not. I read audiobooks that are short of this fact. The thing is, we just hadn't

694
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,520
 got the hang of delivering a crisp fact yet. Oh my god, the Alabama Constitution is sure

695
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:02,000
 of this fact. Devon, your fact is the first successful transatlantic flight in 1919 was made by

696
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,600
 Alcock and Brown. At one point, they got lost in a cloud. And when they came out, they were only

697
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,720
 60 feet above the water and flying at 90 degrees to water. A double water in there

698
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,400
 as well. Yeah, I don't think I would have double watered it. Okay. Okay, mate.

699
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,320
 Maybe I typed it up wrong. Maybe you actually said something that was only five words long,

700
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,720
 and I just got carried away when typing up the episode. I think I would have said the first bit

701
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,640
 as the fact and then quickly came in underneath it with a call with the case. But that's not an

702
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,720
 interesting fact that Alcock and Brown were the first people to cross the Atlantic. That's just

703
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,080
 a bit of trivia. I think Devon would feel absolutely stiff if his fact was that the first transatlantic

704
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,720
 flight was made by Alcock and Brown. Well, you're welcome then, Devon, because I've included

705
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 the extra exciting detail. It was pretty amazing. They're getting lost in a cloud and flying out of

706
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,120
 the cloud at 90 degrees to the water is funny. Yeah. That's funny because you think there would be

707
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:04,560
 other signs like they're drinks billing. Yeah. Yes. Yes. All them falling out of the plane. Yeah.

708
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,560
 Yeah. That's a terrible thing. I actually trimmed this down a bit before we read it out on

709
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:15,040
 today's little fish. I genuinely did. Okay. Are we going to do one or two more? Yep. And then what have

710
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,080
 you got for us? All right. This is for Ben Jimen. Not Ben Jamen. Ben Jimen. It's this fact in 2007. A

711
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,360
 woman called Evan Latimer inherited Napoleon's penis from her father. Oh. Oh. And we did a lot

712
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:38,800
 about the afterlife of Napoleon's pretty corporal. Because it was passed around and inherited and

713
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,080
 probably won and lost in car games and things like that. And it's had a it's had a busy busy afterlife.

714
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,600
 Yeah. I play a lot of poker these days, but I think we are missing the time when you could just

715
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,560
 shove something on the table and say, let's play for that. Really? It's all chips and it's all like,

716
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,760
 oh, let's play for a fiver and stuff like that. You know, you don't get people shoving Mussolini's

717
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,960
 eyeball on the table and saying, I feel like all my stuff would just be rejected. Like that's very

718
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,440
 cool. Dan that you brought an unboxed Morgan Mindy toy from the 1970s. We actually dispute your

719
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,720
 assessment of its worth. You may have paid 100 quid for it. That doesn't actually mean it's worth

720
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,320
 100 quid of tips. Because normally it's like you throw your car keys on the table or your house keys

721
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,480
 or your wedding ring or something for Dan of course. It's a life size cut out of pedals.

722
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,080
 Signed. Signed. You don't understand. Steve Martin briefly owned this tambourine.

723
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:44,240
 But I think the I think the last time a family still own Napoleon's privates today.

724
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,880
 All right. The penis anyway. Very good. So congratulations. Congratulations. Ben Jimin.

725
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,000
 Okay. And let's do one more Dan. Hopefully something nice, short, snappy and not too

726
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,360
 penisy. Yep. So Karen Jains. You are now the custodian of Andrew Hunter Murray's fact, which is

727
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,600
 to say I don't care about something. A German person has the option of saying it's sausage to me.

728
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,400
 Is this your first ever sausage fact on the show? I think it might be. First of many.

729
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,600
 I realised then that this was a rich seam of stuff. Das ist mir versed. I don't care. That's

730
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,960
 sausage sausage to me. But the Germans love sausage, which is why it's a strange, you know,

731
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,680
 it's a popular national dish. Yeah. Yeah. We actually found that in a recent episode that you

732
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:34,560
 weren't in, that they also say that's train station Tanai to me. That's quite good because that is

733
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,840
 the sort of thing that you just let pass by you. That's brilliant. Yeah. Oh. The first ever photo shoot

734
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,800
 that we had with a national newspaper had us sitting down with placards with our favorite facts

735
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,080
 on it. And this was your fact. You had that. I had one about being kicked in the head or something.

736
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,600
 That's right. I remember what Anna's was. And then Dan had a huge billboard next to him with one

737
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:05,920
 of his facts. There are 30 cricket teams in. Okay. Thank you so much for listening to this episode

738
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:12,000
 of Little Fish. And congratulations to all the custodians of today's facts. If you have some

739
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,440
 interesting facts that you want to tell us, then send them over to Andy at podcast@QI.com. He will

740
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,280
 shuffle through them and send them out to us. And we might mention them next week or the week after

741
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,840
 or the week after that, or anytime in the next 20 years, until eventually we decide to stop doing

742
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:33,280
 this. If you would like to get custodian ship of a fact yourself, then go to patreon.com/nosicsthingsafish.

743
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,080
 And you can join the friend of the podcast here to do that. But in the meantime, please enjoy

744
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:52,960
 the rest of your week and we will see you on Friday for a big old episode of No Six Thingsafish. Bye!
