00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,720
 Hey everyone, Dan here. Welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Before we get

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,360
 going I just have a quick personal announcement that I want to make, which is to tell you that my

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,400
 first ever non-fiction kids book is out today. You can get it in shots now, it's called "Impossible

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,520
 Things, Unbelievable Answers to the World's Weirdest Questions" and in it I have gone on 10

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,720
 adventures to try and answer some of the big questions that kids often ask us about the mysteries

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,920
 of the universe. Oh my god, get out of here James. Is time travel possible? Will we ever talk

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,440
 to animals? Do ghosts exist? Can imaginary friends come to life? Are we all actually living in a

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,800
 giant video game simulation? Using these questions as starting points, I've written something that

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,960
 combines really interesting facts with great spooky tales and along the way I managed to get a 2500

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,800
 year old Babylonian ghost at Guinness World Record and also sit down with a psychic spy. It's the

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,680
 perfect summary for your kid. For any of those questions, if they've ever wanted to know why we

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,080
 haven't been taken over by zombies, why in 1991 there were over 60,000 jellyfish in space, and how

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,400
 to throw their own time traveler party, well then this is the book for them. So guys, I'd really

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,560
 appreciate it if you could buy it. So hard for authors these days to sell their books, but we

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,160
 rely on people like you, our fish club, to help us do that and I'd really appreciate the support.

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,240
 So if you can do it, it's out there now. Impossible things in all good bookshops.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,320
 Thank you so much and on with the show. Also buy my book. No, next week. Buy his next week. On with the show.

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,440
 from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,000
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,920
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go.

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,000
 Starting with fact number one, that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that Yves Saint Laurent's

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,800
 gardener used hair clippers to keep his cactuses perfectly trimmed. That is, that is care.

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,480
 And hair clippers are those ones that men use to keep their hair really short, right? Yeah.

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,600
 So you set them to a setting and you go... Or you may use it for your beard. Right. So yes,

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,920
 that's what hair clippers are. Cactuses are succulent plants and Yves Saint Laurent was a

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,920
 fashion designer. Any more announcements in this one, maybe explain it. I didn't think that cactuses,

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,680
 I've never seen a shaggy cactus. Do you know what I mean? Well, the thing is, there's lots of

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,200
 different types of cactus. And Yves Saint Laurent loved cactuses. He had a garden in Marrakesh called

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,640
 the Jardin Marjorelle. Actually, it was started by another artist called Jacques Marjorelle.

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,080
 But Yves Saint Laurent bought it when it was going into disrepair and he looked after these

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
 cactuses. And it's a really beautiful garden. It's a place that I've been quite recently,

33
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,200
 where I saw this fact. There was a video of his gardener who was going around with these hair

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,840
 clippers making them all perfect. The only thing I can imagine you could do with hair clippers

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,720
 on a cactus is to trim the spines. Is that what he's doing? Is he blunting them so they don't

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,920
 prick anyone? No, it wasn't. It was just to make them all look perfect because I don't think it's

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,680
 controversial to say that Yves Saint Laurent was something of an Yves Thiet. Yeah. I don't

38
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,480
 understand when, because I don't know much about fashion, but when I read about Yves Saint Laurent

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,920
 and his achievements, his concrete accomplishments, they're all quite, you know, he took risks by

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,480
 turning a trench coat into haute couture. Yeah. What does that mean? I don't understand. This is

41
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,200
 the character of Dior. He is taken on the mantle of one of the biggest fashion houses ever. And

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,640
 he's looking at trends that are going on out in bits of America and bits of France. And he's saying

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,320
 this is seen as low rent. I'm putting it back into there. That's a risk. It's basically me not

44
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,160
 understanding the plot of the film The Devil Ways Prada. It's basically what I came to understand.

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,840
 Oh, right. That's right. But yeah. The thing I guess that I found interesting was his personality,

46
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
 because I agree. It's hard to get a grip on fashion if you don't know fashion, but it is striking

47
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,440
 that he was so young when he took over at Christian Dior, right? He was 21. And he was, for someone who

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,080
 was kind of famous for being a strong character, maybe not that likable a character later on,

49
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
 he was probably incredibly shy and like couldn't even look anyone in the eye. He was just new at

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,040
 Christian Dior and Christian Dior died suddenly. And I think there were these four women who worked

51
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,760
 there and the company was left to him to basically take charge this weird shy boy who couldn't look

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,600
 anyone in the eye. It's an amazing story because he moved to Paris when he was 1718 and he entered

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,440
 a competition where he just did some designs. He then took it to Dior. Dior saw it. It really was

54
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,600
 so similar to what he was working on at that point that he just on the spot said, you're now my second

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,680
 in command. You're my assistant. What's nice is this little competition, you know, sometimes you

56
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,920
 hear about a school where it's like seven comic book writers were there at the same time. Carl

57
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,240
 Largefeld came second in that competition. That he won. That eventually got him his job at Dior.

58
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
 Dan, was this the competition of the international wool secretariat?

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Yes. Yeah, I think we'll say that. Yeah. Did you have to make everything out of wool?

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,480
 Yeah, they gave you a big pile of wool and 20 minutes. 20 minutes. I'm joking. I'm joking.

61
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,440
 I think it was just the design. Do you know this is off topic now, but I was reading about wool

62
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,760
 this morning and in, let's say, when was it? Probably about the 15th century, there was a wool

63
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,600
 guild and a knitter's guild. And if you wanted to be a knitter and sell your knitting, you had to

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,840
 be part of this guild. And in order to be part of it, you had to study for six years and then do a

65
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,320
 knitting exam at the end of it. And the knitting exam would take like a day where you showed off

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 everything you've learned over the six years. And if you didn't pass that exam, you couldn't be

67
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,480
 like a professional knitter. Could you take the exam again? Good question. It's an all or nothing.

68
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,040
 You know what? I didn't go into all the admin yet. But you will because you're applying, aren't you?

69
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,880
 Dior. Yeah. So he obviously became very famous colossus of the industry, all of this. He was

70
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,080
 responsible for, I think, the most French thing that has ever happened, right? Okay. It's a 1998.

71
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,960
 Yeah. We're in Paris. Yeah. What's going on? 1998, Diana died the year before. That's right. It was

72
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,600
 the one year anniversary. Was it the World Cup? It was the World Cup. Yeah. So France was hosting.

73
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,440
 Yeah. And they won it. And they won it, as in Zidane and all that. Bloody hell, Andy. I do contain

74
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:53,280
 multitudes. It's on the paper in front of them. Before the final of the World Cup on the pitch

75
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,520
 in the big stadium was an Yves Saint Laurent retrospective show with 300 models celebrating

76
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,680
 40 years of Yves Saint Laurent. I just think that's so French. Like, we will have the football,

77
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,840
 but first fashion. They do take it seriously. The way that Yves Saint Laurent's career is reported

78
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,840
 on sometimes when it talks about the absolute scandal. What was the scandal? The scandal,

79
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,560
 so it was 1971 and it was this show called Carrant, which was a reference to the fact that it was

80
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,200
 an imitation of 1940s fashion and it was put on in Paris this show. Of course, it was early 1940s

81
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,240
 fashion. Now, as you may or may not know listening at home, the early 1940s was a difficult time for

82
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,040
 the people of France. And the fashion was meant to imitate kind of occupied France and sort of

83
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,240
 not only that, but the costumes that he recreated sort of imitate people who were doing quite well

84
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,320
 in occupied Paris. We're talking collaborationists. Are we talking like René Artois from Allo Allo?

85
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,440
 It was one for the younger listeners.

86
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:01,600
 Good morning to you. You're listening. Yves Saint Laurent's cameo in Allo Allo was so weird,

87
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,360
 wasn't it? Yes, it was all Allo Allo and, you know, Dad's army based fashion.

88
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,280
 No, but it's Vichy France, right? It was Vichy, it had a lot of nods to Vichy France and it was

89
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,960
 quite extreme. The press were very offended saying, you know, it's in a very sensitive reminder of

90
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,560
 the Nazi days. It's an insult to fashion. But this was obviously good for him because any

91
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,800
 publicity is good publicity. So it was things like it. I think people had to wear practical clothes

92
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,480
 because they didn't have many materials. So it was lots of tiny mini skirts and platform shoes.

93
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:38,320
 Actually, this is like Allo Allo. When was this? '71.

94
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,280
 Okay. Wow. So that was when he was an Yves Saint Laurent designer, not a Dior designer, right?

95
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,920
 Yeah, he was himself. Because he was Dior and he did all this stuff where he was taking stuff off

96
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,080
 the streets, like Dan said, but then they basically kicked him out, didn't they? Or rather, he got

97
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,880
 conscripted to the army and the fashion house could have said, well, no, he's so important to us

98
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,440
 that he can't go to the army, but they didn't say it, they just let him go. Yeah, interesting.

99
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,920
 And he's so stuck with a nervous breakdown, didn't he? Yeah, well, he didn't go to war

100
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,320
 because he had a breakdown in the incident. Did he even make, because he was going to be sent to,

101
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,760
 it was Algeria, wasn't it, the Algerian front? He didn't even make it to Algeria.

102
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,160
 He didn't even make it to Algeria. But the thing is that while he was doing his induction before

103
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,960
 he collapsed, they replaced him with someone else. And they really shouldn't have done that.

104
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,600
 Like they should have kept his job open for when he came back. And so they sued Dior and

105
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,000
 they got some money from Dior and that's when they set up their own fashion house Yves Saint Laurent.

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,480
 Right. And when you say they, you mean him and his partner, lover, best friend in the world,

107
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,240
 soulmate guy, right? With whom actually he bought this cactus garden in Marrakesh.

108
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,880
 Just to bring it back to that. And of course, while we're in North Africa, Zinedine Zidane

109
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,720
 himself of Algerian stock. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if Yves Saint Laurent had made it to the war,

110
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 he might have met Zidane's family, you know. What have you done with Andrew Hunter Murray?

111
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,360
 I feel like you've just recently read the encyclopedia entry on Zed and you're not

112
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,360
 desperate to smuggle in. It's the last football I paid any attention to because I was 11 at the time.

113
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,640
 I'm so impressed. Yeah, Berger was an interesting guy and seemed to run Yves Saint Laurent's life

114
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,440
 because Yves Saint Laurent was a very vulnerable person, wasn't he? And Pierre Berger just was

115
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,600
 the organiser. So he was his lover from 58 to 76 and then they were very good friends. And

116
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,640
 he had a weird introduction to Paris as well. So he moved to Paris from an island and he was 18

117
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,680
 years old, moved there on his own. And on the day he moved, he was walking down the Champs-Élysées

118
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,840
 and a famous poet called Jacques Prévert fell from the sky above him and landed at his feet.

119
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:54,160
 Wow, but not on him, like right in front of him. No, he says, I always remember my first day in

120
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,480
 Paris as a day a famous poet landed on my head, but he didn't. In his actual description, he

121
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,920
 fell out of a French window a few stories on. Oh, right. They're all French windows, if we're embarrassed.

122
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,160
 All these people are so young at the time when they sort of move their formative experiences. So

123
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:18,720
 when Saint Laurent was, when he got the job, when Dior died, did we say he was 21? 21. And at that

124
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,760
 point he went home and again, this is the story, he drew a thousand designs in a fortnight.

125
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
 I can't imagine, once you've drawn like five different pairs of trousers.

126
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,720
 Oh my god. There are only five. I know that this is ridiculous. How many pairs of trousers could

127
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,320
 there possibly be out there? There's skinny, there's straight and there's fles. I think all of that

128
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,000
 football knowledge has pushed out all of the fashion knowledge. Do you remember only having

129
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,600
 any fashion knowledge if you've passed your mind back over the last 10 years? And then they moved

130
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,040
 to Marrakech, didn't they? Because it was the cool place to be in those days. It was where all the

131
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,400
 hippies went. And there had actually been an international zone in Tangier, which was like

132
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,120
 not owned by anyone really. It was just like a trading port and it was very, very low tax. And

133
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,280
 there weren't many rules compared to other places in North Africa and loads and loads of hippies went

134
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,880
 there. But eventually Morocco took over it and then they decided actually Marrakech is a better

135
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,880
 place to go. And it was set up this kind of hippie group in Marrakech by Talifa Getty, who was a wife

136
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,200
 of John Paul Getty, of the Getty millionaires. And he was like a playboy and he had this partner

137
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,120
 who was just absolutely crazy. And she had all the best parties and Keith Richards said she had the

138
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,520
 best friends and the best opium. And she and John Paul Getty named the son Tara Gabriel Galaxy

139
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:50,000
 Gramophone Getty. Which is a name. Gramophone. We've got options when you grow up. If you want

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,800
 to be a bit kooky, you can take on gramophones. True. I actually think they took the other option

141
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,440
 of removing their middle names as they all did. Have a gramophone related fact. Brilliant. Which

142
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,400
 brings it in a big circle because cactuses are incredibly useful in the world of gramophones.

143
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:14,640
 The needles. The needles. No. Yeah. It's so cool. I did not know about this. But in the 1920s when

144
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,080
 people had wind-up gramophones, 1920s and 1930s, cactus spines or prickly pears were really,

145
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,120
 really popular and they were thought to produce a much higher quality sound than the actual steel

146
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
 needles. It's amazing. Yeah. And you could sculpt them because they're a bit softer than the steel.

147
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,160
 So you could sculpt them so they don't miss. And it wouldn't break the record.

148
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,240
 Wouldn't break the record. Yeah. And just this one company found the niche in the market. Some

149
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,440
 cactus names. Yeah. Big nipple cactus. Lovely. Woolly nipple cactus. Bonker hedgehog cactus.

150
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,040
 Sorry, is that bonk a hedgehog? It bonks a hedgehog? No, it's bonker hedgehog and it's named

151
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,320
 after Frances Bonker. She was a cactus expert and she also wrote a book called The Mad Dictator,

152
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,760
 which was a novel about Hitler's life. The prohibition cactus because it likes its home

153
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,200
 place dry, likes a dry area. Clever. Applies to a lot of them, doesn't it? It does actually,

154
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,480
 doesn't it? And there's a lot named after nipples. But I think that's because the part of a cactus

155
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,680
 where the spines come out of is called the areola. It is. Yeah. Because they are kind of a little

156
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,200
 bump, aren't they? This is so weird. I have a related nipple cactus nipple fact. Perfect.

157
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,920
 Yeah. Which is that scientists, this is a very recent discovery, there are 100 species of cactus

158
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,440
 which act as breasts for ants. Okay. In other words, so they have these tiny nipples in their

159
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,920
 flesh, not I think where the spines are, but they produce this tiny supply of sweet nectar

160
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,640
 and the ants go crazy for the nectar and then the ants protect the mother udder against insects

161
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,640
 and they clean bacteria and they fertilize the soil, they spread the seeds to new sites.

162
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,720
 So that is... That's not what babies do though, when they're drinking from breasts. I mean,

163
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,680
 they do a lot of fertilizing, but not necessarily... They do very little protective work. You're

164
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,160
 all right. I didn't realize the threat to cactus, so the climate is one thing because it is obviously

165
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,080
 they're living in an extreme environment already, you know, and if it gets much off for a dryer

166
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,520
 then they're in trouble. But the other risk to them is cactus smuggling. Good. It's one of the,

167
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,920
 it's one of the... I had 10 cactuses down my underpants when I went abroad last time.

168
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,840
 Can I go take the cocaine next time, please? I can't fit another one up there. There is a cactus

169
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:35,200
 called the dildo cactus. It doesn't look very usable, does it? No, I'm not actually sure why

170
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,040
 it's got that. I try to find out why it's called the dildo cactus. I think because it's slightly

171
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,760
 felicin-shaped, but obviously... Right, but so many of them are. And in fact, if any of the cacti

172
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,680
 that I have seen, that one could do with pruning. It's a very furry and spiky-ish.

173
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,480
 Well, people like different things. Yeah. Do you guys know about... So we're recording this

174
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,680
 on the 4th of July, big election day, and I found a nice little political connection to cactus,

175
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,520
 which is Nick Clegg, the former head of the Liberal Democrats. Do you know that he was

176
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:12,640
 arrested in Germany or certainly was taken... Got in trouble in Germany because of arson,

177
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,680
 because he was lighting cactus up. Do you remember that? Was he smoking them for a drug?

178
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,240
 No, he was just drunk, and he was just setting fire to cacti, you know. And he admitted this.

179
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:34,000
 You're a prick. You're a prick. Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

180
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,400
 My fact this week is that in the early 1400s, China had ships four times larger than anything else

181
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,040
 in Europe. By the 1500s, it had deliberately destroyed them.

182
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,280
 European ships tiny, Chinese ships massive, basically. European ships perfectly acceptable.

183
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,320
 Chinese ships unbelievable. I just think more people should just know about this fleet,

184
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,240
 because it is an amazing period in Chinese history. It was called the treasure fleet,

185
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 and they seem to have now proven how big they were, because the claims were that these ships were

186
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,040
 up to 140 meters long. And I think no one really believed it. And no one believed it. No, it was

187
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,680
 like, come on, that's not possible, genuinely. I mean, the ship that Columbus sailed on was 20 meters,

188
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,960
 and that was what was huge. That's almost the same size as the world's largest

189
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,720
 foosball table. It's not credible. It's not possible. It doesn't make any sense.

190
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,880
 Unbelievable. Yeah. Thank you, James. So yes, ships as long as a particularly large football table,

191
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,040
 and there were tons of them as well. There were 3,500 of them. So for comparison,

192
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,080
 you know, our pathetic Navy today is 66 ships. And even. There have been some cuts lately,

193
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,320
 but we had a lot more in 1945. Because it's not necessarily something we need.

194
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
 Russia and China, though, they have the largest navies in the world, and they're in the 700.

195
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,840
 So this is, you know, much bigger than any of those. Almost 30,000 sailors went on just one of the

196
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,400
 voyages. So the whole scale of it is mad. Over 300 ships would sail out at once. And they went an

197
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,000
 incredibly long way. And they're mostly to just show off, weren't they? Well, it's kind of was.

198
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
 Yes, basically, yes. Yeah, it was a cultural sort of just say, hey, have you heard of China?

199
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,600
 It's like kimchi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's about last week. Exactly. It wasn't really plundering.

200
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,800
 They did bring back some treasure, but it wasn't when I read about it, I thought, oh, well,

201
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,480
 they'll be going off finding treasure, bringing it back. And that wasn't really. No, no, not really.

202
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,160
 It was more showing off their treasure. There was it was destroying pirate fleets,

203
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,760
 occasionally, for a bit of fun. But imagine if you're a pirate. I mean, it's not a pair, is it?

204
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,520
 Like just doing your thing, getting a little bit of plunder here and there,

205
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,160
 and then suddenly 300 foosball table sized. You've gotten to stop using that comparison.

206
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,440
 But so the Wikipedia on the treasure fleets is great because it does acknowledge there are a

207
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,480
 couple of gaps, right? So listen to this, there is still much debate regarding issues such as the

208
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,280
 purpose of the voyages, the size of the ships, the magnitude of the fleet, the routes taken,

209
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,360
 the charts employed, the countries visited, and the cargo carried. Basically, we don't know who

210
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,640
 was going or where or why or what they were on or who they were with or how. Well, I think what we

211
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,840
 have is that's very good in our time on it, actually. What we have is very detailed records

212
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,920
 from China. So we do know a lot about it. It's just we don't necessarily know the negative things

213
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,240
 that might have been how many ships sunk. I mean, we have no evidence that any of them sunk, but it's

214
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,440
 implausible, surely. And we genuinely thought it was impossible to make ships out of wood this big.

215
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,080
 They're the biggest wooden ships that have ever existed by a long way. And one thing was discovered

216
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,760
 not too long ago, which was an 11 meter long rudder. And that's one of the most concrete bits

217
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,400
 of evidence we have for the size of these ships. If I was a 15th century Chinese emperor, I would

218
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,640
 just make a massive rudder to mess with future historians. I think you almost understand their

219
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,760
 ambitions. They're not trying to impress us. The thing I find most amazing about this whole saga,

220
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,160
 this whole sort of journey that these fleets went on, is the leader of it. So this was a guy

221
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,000
 called Zhang He, who was basically he was he was a young kid whose father was killed in a war.

222
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,960
 He got taken as prisoner, brought to the emperor's palace in China, made into a eunuch,

223
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,400
 and just showed amazing skills in the world of warfare. Britannica says he was six foot five,

224
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,720
 others say he was seven feet tall. And this is a guy, imagine a ship's come in and this seven foot

225
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,480
 giant... So the ships look like small. They were hitting his head. They said his voice was as loud

226
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,600
 as a bell. He was by all accounts an extraordinary character. He's got a tiny dinner bell in our

227
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:39,040
 house. It's just going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. I'm sorry. He paused the show. Oh, I knew

228
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,880
 this had to come out eventually. Is that because your gong is at the repair shop or is it?

229
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,880
 That's a good point because I have been thinking he's going to have this deep booming voice,

230
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,160
 but I've completely forgot he was a eunuch. One of the reasons they think that he was chosen

231
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,920
 is because he was also a Muslim. And they were going, yeah, and they were sailing part of where

232
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,280
 they got to was the Gulf. And so he was going to be in lots of Islamic territory. And so the

233
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,600
 idea is it's a diplomatic mission to go and make contact with these places and basically say,

234
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,040
 will you acknowledge that China is the best country in the world? And if you do that,

235
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,160
 we sort of won't take over you. And it was lots of Muslim countries. So, you know,

236
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,040
 he would have been able to go and be like, hey, I get you and my dad went to Mecca.

237
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,120
 Is China the best? Yes, great. Right. He sounds amazingly impressive,

238
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,680
 Chang He. And I'm interested also in why their voyages ended, because there's lots of debate

239
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,720
 about what brought them to an end. One theory is that they're worried about Mongolian invasions,

240
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,880
 and obviously, Mongolians have paid over land. But another reason they were discontinued,

241
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,680
 potentially, is that there was a conflict between the Confucians and the eunuchs.

242
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,400
 Yeah. There's this big eunuch power base in the court. And there was a eunuch establishment,

243
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,680
 partly because it was thought, oh, well, if eunuchs can't have children,

244
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,280
 then they're not going to be seizing power and starting a dynasty.

245
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,160
 That's why they were chosen. That's why they were the court assistants, really, wasn't it?

246
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,920
 That's what I mean. Yeah, yeah. But for some reason, obviously, that builds up into a powerful

247
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,080
 bureaucracy. It feels like the movie franchise we're all waiting for, the bureaucrats versus the

248
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,520
 eunuchs. I mean, it's weird, isn't it? There being this court of eunuchs and then this court of

249
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,440
 Confucian bureaucrats, and there's war between them. I'm joking for position.

250
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,200
 When Zhong He died, basically, he was the main eunuch. When he died, there was kind of a vacuum

251
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,440
 in the eunuch world, and it meant that the Confucianists could jump him.

252
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,400
 In addition to the obvious vacuum in the eunuch world, of course.

253
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:35,440
 And it was a new emperor as well. So Zhong He's emperor, who took him on, had died. A new emperor

254
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,960
 came on. He became part of the expansion of the Great Wall of China. There were lots of different

255
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,480
 projects going on. He talked him into one final adventure going out, and Zhong He died on the

256
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,720
 way back. So then that was kind of it. I think that's it. Kind of like you can't spend all your

257
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,920
 money making a massive wall to stop the Mongolians coming in, and you can't spend the same money

258
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,600
 making massive ships to go to the Muslim lands. You have to choose one or the other.

259
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,840
 We'll tell that to the Labour Party, who apparently aren't even going to raise taxes, James. No, I

260
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:10,080
 guess. Wow. I can see why you've got a denabel and not a satire bell in your home.

261
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
 So yeah, I think the main thing was you say the Confucian bureaucrats, and mostly the bureaucrats

262
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,560
 complained whether it was thick and expensive. And there was one claim that it cost half of the

263
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,880
 tax revenue of a whole year to send them out, which is mad, and probably an exaggeration.

264
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,080
 But also, there's one other theory that they just done what they wanted to do.

265
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,480
 I mean, they got, as far as the East African coast, they got to Somalia. They've shown everyone

266
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,840
 how good they are. Everyone has said, "Yeah, you're the best." Yeah, they've gone, "Cool. Job done."

267
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:45,120
 Zhong He supposedly named the durian fruit. Yeah. Supposedly, he ate it when he was on one of

268
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,120
 his journeys, and he was so delicious, he forgot where he was, and he stayed there for three days,

269
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,480
 and then realized, "Oh, wait a minute. I'm supposed to be doing this three days."

270
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,880
 And so he went back again, and the name durian means to linger and forget to return.

271
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,040
 Supposedly named by him. And also, he supposedly invented the queenfish.

272
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,960
 So the queenfish is like a fish which has got like five spots on it. And the theory goes that

273
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,360
 there was a big storm. There's a hole in his boat. He prays to God, and the storm dissipates,

274
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,600
 and they realize that they haven't sunk because there's a fish in the hole in the boat.

275
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,240
 Brilliant. Okay. And it's this queenfish. He takes it out. His five fingerprints go onto the fish

276
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,760
 and forever are on this fish. And for that reason, Chinese people in Malaysia don't eat queenfish,

277
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,360
 although some skeptics point out the fact that it is quite poisonous.

278
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,320
 Just the second best reason not to eat it. Obviously, the Shanghai thing is the main reason

279
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,280
 we don't eat it. There's another thing about these giant ships. They had rigging that was

280
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,640
 decorated with yellow flags. The sails were dyed red with henna. The hulls were painted with huge

281
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,880
 elaborate birds, and on the front were large eyes painted onto the bow. So as it was coming towards

282
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,080
 you, just the sense of a big face heading towards you. I mean, that's what an image. What a striking

283
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,880
 thing. And a seven foot giant walks off the ship, be like, "Avatar, have we been invaded? Is it aliens?"

284
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,520
 Here's a last legacy of the treasure fleets. This is a New York Times report from 1999, right?

285
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,640
 What? One year after the most French thing that has ever happened.

286
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,400
 Two years after the death of Diana. They had a reporter called Nicholas Kristof, right? And he

287
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,960
 went to this tiny island off the coast of Kenya, which was called, I think it's called Pate, P-A-T-E.

288
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,720
 It might be Pate, it might be Pate. I think it's Pate. It's called Pate. It's pretty squishy ground.

289
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,800
 And he found there a number of elderly men, and they claimed to be Chinese, right? Now they looked

290
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,640
 like they might have Asian ancestry, East Asian ancestry, and they claimed they'd been there for

291
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,680
 600 years. Well, they claimed that their ancestors had got there 600 years ago. They claimed that

292
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,480
 they were descended from the sailors of the treasure fleet who'd been shipwrecked on Pate

293
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,120
 600 years ago. And supposedly they had some very ancient porcelain in their home, some

294
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,320
 which is incredible. It's true, that is unbelievable. I mean, you know, big tongs on that one, but it

295
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,200
 does sound. But you would have thought you could tell when you go somewhere if someone's, because

296
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,520
 they can't have shacked much outside if they've only been there. Can't we take a swab or something?

297
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,360
 Like, we've got technology now. It might have been pre-swab. I don't know. If anyone listening is

298
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,840
 in Pate, can you write it and tell us? In return, we'll send you some very small bits of toast.

299
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,160
 Vikings had big ships. Oh, yeah. Famously. I mean, not by comparison.

300
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,920
 But they were also quite decorated, like the ones we were talking about. Yeah, yeah.

301
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,360
 You should always realize. But it turns out they had woolen sails. I was just saying that I was

302
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,120
 reading about wool today. That's why I bring this up. And there's a traditional handicraft expert

303
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:04,400
 called Amy Lightfoot who decided to try and make a sail like a Viking woolen sail. And she and her

304
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:12,400
 colleagues had to spin 188,000 meters of yarn to make the sail. It took them three years to complete

305
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,360
 and it used the equivalent of a year's production of wool from 2000 sheep.

306
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,520
 Wow. To make a single sail. That's insane.

307
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,760
 So how did the Vikings manage to make all these sails? Is there an answer that you can tell us?

308
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,960
 Okay, okay, okay. We can get this. Did they tie together their clothes and make a sort of amusing

309
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,400
 like... Like they're trying to escape from a building. How would they do it?

310
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,320
 They had 2000 sheep. They had lots of sheep. They had lots of sheep as half of the answer.

311
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,680
 Okay. And lots of people and lots of time. No telling. Yeah, that's basically all of it. The only

312
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,120
 missing bit is that obviously there were lots of them going on sailing missions. So they didn't

313
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,400
 really have time to make the sails. Did they knit as the... So who made the sails? Did they knit as

314
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,880
 they sailed? Let you row and then you knit a little bit. I guess the winds that could make them,

315
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,400
 they settled. Precisely. It was all the women, basically. All the women would live near the coast

316
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,160
 and they would make all of their sails for the ships. I feel like we were really working our way

317
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,600
 towards a good wrong answer there. I know. I was so more ruined by like... So sorry. Reminding you,

318
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,640
 women were also existing in times. Actually, just on what you were saying and on women,

319
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,840
 I was reading about wool earlier today. Oh, gosh. And you know the herring girls, do you remember

320
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,520
 them? Yeah. They were like gut herring and they would start in the north of Scotland because

321
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,960
 the herring shoals would come down the coast of England and they would follow the coast because

322
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,200
 they would follow the herring. So as the year went on, they would just like get further and

323
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,280
 further down the coast until they ended up in Great Yarmouth and they would stop off at the

324
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,080
 gutting centres. But as they went, because they were walking this whole way, they would knit as

325
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,880
 they went and then they would sell their goods as they were walking down. So they would do walking

326
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,880
 and knitting, walking and knitting, sell their stuff and then do your gutting and then do walking,

327
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,320
 knitting, walking, knitting. Do you think it was right? You know when you see someone on their

328
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
 phone walking down the street and you're like, "Oh, for God's sake, just put it away." Do you think

329
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,880
 people thought that when they saw them? Yeah. Just admire the scenery for a minute. Do you remember

330
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,400
 we talked about the drovers? Yeah, yeah. Similar. With their magic dogs. Do you remember they walked

331
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,520
 long knitting as well, didn't they? Well, they had woolen socks for their pigs, didn't they?

332
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,520
 Yeah, it's quite romantic. The idea of, you know, a drover and a herring girl meeting.

333
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,240
 Yeah, they wouldn't ever meet as close. That's quite a long distance between shoreline

334
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,960
 and... Yeah, but if you're drovering in from the coast, maybe, I don't know. Maybe you do, yeah.

335
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,160
 Romantic like they accidentally swap balls of yarn and then, "Oh, no." And then they got to get

336
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,120
 back to each other. I just think it's like... I don't know, it's the same ball of yarn and it's

337
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,880
 like in Lady and the Tramp. It's reverse Lady and the Tramp. They're getting further apart,

338
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,880
 but connected by the same yarn. James, you're shaking your head. It's the default. It's a break-up

339
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,320
 story. There's a screenplay in this somewhere. He was a drover. She gutted herring for a living.

340
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,000
 Can I make it any more obvious? Let's not imply any historical consultants

341
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,360
 when they get this far. No, no, no. Or geographical ones.

342
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:16,480
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is that the largest

343
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,000
 kettle in Hamburg is called Caroline. This is about a very large kettle called Caroline. Caroline

344
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,360
 with a K. Does she get offended if you misspell it? You were quite specific about that.

345
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,760
 So this is because there's a lot of renewable energy being built in Europe at the moment,

346
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,040
 mostly wind and solar. And it's pretty cheap, especially during sunny or windy hours, basically.

347
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,560
 Prices drop massively. It just gets really, really cheap because there's so much access

348
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,320
 being produced. And in some cases, the prices get negative because the power has to go

349
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,880
 somewhere. And so it's kind of not totally ideal because you want to put power to good use,

350
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,240
 basically, when you're generating it. You just see what I mean. This is all from an article

351
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,720
 in The Economist. And you need to use the power a bit better. You need to link to other countries

352
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,600
 which don't have a surplus at that moment, maybe, or you shift demand. So like everyone charges

353
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,280
 out their cars in hours where there's lots of power on the grid, whatever. And another option

354
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,720
 is to boil up the largest kettle in Hamburg, Caroline. Just tease all around. Just tease

355
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,600
 everyone in Hamburg whether they want one or not is getting a cup of tea. This is a giant

356
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,960
 electric kettle, basically. And it turns surplus wind energy into heat. It heats up water using

357
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,600
 the electricity. And it gets used in, I think, a district heating network, which is like where

358
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,480
 everyone's hot water comes from Caroline. And sort of 20,000 houses, I think, are on this system.

359
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,680
 So yeah, and that's Caroline. Good honor. I know. And she doesn't look like, you know,

360
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,840
 she doesn't whistle and she doesn't have a spout and a handle, right? She looks like a big tank,

361
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,440
 presumably. Basically, a big container of hot water is what I have chosen a kettle is.

362
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,720
 Yeah, fair enough. That's fine. I think that's fine. It heats up to very, very hot. And yeah, nice.

363
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:02,160
 Renewable energy. Well, I think it's amazing because we're at a point now in history where

364
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,360
 we're literally looking at everything around us going, how do we turn this renewable? How can

365
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,920
 we do using this to be? I was reading the other day that there's, in toilets now, there's a thing

366
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,080
 that they're trialing whereby, how do you create renewable energy off the back of toilets? Oh,

367
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,320
 what if you put in the equivalent of a wind turbine into the pipe for your farts?

368
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:29,200
 You lean over a fart at the little windmill. Yeah, yeah. That's good. No, it's using the

369
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,440
 idea of the water. It's using the water. Do you mean a watermill? More like a watermill.

370
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,000
 Sorry, I forgot about that. I'm trying to talk to the kids. Sorry,

371
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,800
 I haven't got allo-lo references to this, but it's basically your flush and it spins and it creates

372
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,520
 energy. Do you have a great idea? I actually came up with this idea quite a few years ago of putting

373
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,440
 many sort of water wheels in everyone's gutters. That's why I thought, I thought it was a brilliant

374
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,520
 idea that no one had thought of. Right, yeah. And then I never pursued it. And it seems like

375
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,080
 it's actually going to become reality. It's not none of these. We should go back over all the

376
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,200
 things quirky renewable energy ideas we've mentioned over the years and look at how many of

377
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:18,560
 them have come to giant fruition. Big aisle. Sorry, I must clarify here. I am incredibly pro

378
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,240
 investing huge amounts of money in the big scale ones, but quite a lot of these little

379
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,920
 ideas are so nice, aren't they? But they can't scale up and you can't like fix them into the

380
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,080
 end. But I reckon they're like a good science fiction idea. They're worth saying out loud

381
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,760
 as much as possible because someone listening out there somewhere will go, that's a great idea.

382
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,000
 Actually, I could do this with that and turn that into I just think as much as it pumped out.

383
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,480
 What happens when a poo gets stuck in the water wheel again? Again, every day, every day.

384
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,080
 Millions of engineers are going to be called out. Yeah. Unaccountably, there's a poo in the water

385
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,320
 wheel again. Here's the thing about kettles. This is crazy. It comes from a book I read recently.

386
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,200
 I think I may have mentioned it before. It's called Power Up. It's a great book.

387
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,920
 This is about the world's first ever coal powered public power station, right? Right.

388
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,840
 So it was called the Edison Electric Light Station. It was built in London in 1882

389
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,920
 and it generated enough electricity power 30 modern kettles. Wow. That is partly it was a

390
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,200
 small power station. It's also partly British kettles are world leading. They're just so powerful.

391
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,480
 Sounds actually like the dream would be that your kettle didn't use that much power in order to do

392
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,040
 the same thing. Yes. No, no, no, no. You want tea now. That's the point. Did they call this power place

393
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,680
 Electric Eels? No, they didn't. It was the Edison Electric Light Station. They should have done.

394
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:43,360
 They should have done, but they didn't. And it generated 93 kilowatts of electricity at one time,

395
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,040
 which was for lights in the local area. Yeah. But basically it's partly a function of just

396
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,240
 British kettles being absolutely punishingly powerful. That's the thing we should say to foreign

397
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,280
 listeners, especially Americans, what a kettle is, right? Yeah. Americans don't have kettles.

398
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,720
 It's like a saucepan with a lid. Yeah. If you want to make tea with water that's

399
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,920
 more than 40 degrees in temperature and that's Celsius, not your Fahrenheit system.

400
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,960
 You know what? I think if we start a battle with the Americans over tea, then we're only going to lose.

401
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,520
 What do you think? Oh, I see. It's a funny reference. It's a reference to the Boston Tea

402
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,840
 Party. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very nice. Very lovely. Don't rig that satire bell again.

403
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,160
 Another China fact for this section, the world's largest hydroelectric plant is in China,

404
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,400
 unsurprisingly. Yeah. Like the world's largest, most things. And it's the Three Gorgeous Dam,

405
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,880
 which you've probably heard of, and it's obviously massive and... Gorgeous, sorry.

406
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,240
 Sorry? I heard gorgeous. The Three Gorgeous Dam. Well, it is gorgeous. I think it is gorgeous. Yeah, yeah.

407
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,080
 Do you think it's gorgeous, the displacement of over a million people? I don't know.

408
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,520
 They would say what about the people living downstream of the Three Gorgeous Dam?

409
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:56,080
 Andy, oh, I dropped you in that one, mate. Do you think it's gorgeous, the submerged villages?

410
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,360
 Do you think it's complicated and they have to be trade-offs, Anna?

411
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,480
 Yeah, I look at them with you, and obviously produces a huge amount of power. But it does

412
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,640
 slow the earth down. What? Oh, yeah. Really? I think it was NASA who verified this in the end,

413
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,960
 because there are rumors that it slowed down the rotation of the earth and lengthened our day a

414
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,400
 little bit. So, if it's 459 and you're at work looking at your watch right now,

415
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,040
 you can blame the Three Gorgeous Dam. Yeah. Yeah, it's the dam's fault. Dam it.

416
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:37,040
 Anyway, it's quite... In fact, kind of everything does that when you move mass around,

417
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,520
 but it does it to a measurable extent. And so, it's because it's... This huge amount of water

418
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,560
 is being held. It's 39 trillion kilograms of water is held 175 meters high above sea level

419
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,920
 in this dam. So, that's a huge amount of water that's being held quite a big distance from the

420
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,960
 centre of the earth. Imagine you're spinning round on a chair, right? You're spinning round at a steady

421
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,320
 speed, and then you get a huge water balloon, and you hold it in your right hand at arm's length.

422
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
 It's going to slow you down a little bit. And it actually... That is crazy.

423
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,760
 Has slowed us down by 0.06 microseconds, a microsecond being a millionth of a second.

424
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,400
 So, where does that matter most? Like, what business? The Olympics, you know? So,

425
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,920
 Usain Bolt has always just missed out smashing the 100 meters.

426
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,920
 That would be good, wouldn't it, if you could just let the water out at the same time.

427
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,880
 You are all running in the same direction in the 100 meters, I suppose.

428
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
 Yes, it's true. There will be a use, I'm sure.

429
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,160
 The next Chinese Olympics, they're taking notes. I can imagine them doing that sort of thing.

430
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,080
 But you know that got proposed in 1919.

431
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,920
 Well, they drain the dam just to help someone win 100 meters of sprint.

432
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,960
 The building of the dam was proposed by Sun Yat-sen, first president of China.

433
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,240
 Really? Yeah. And it took... It was partly because they got insane floods about once every decade,

434
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,400
 that were just totally destructive. So, it was partly that and partly for electricity.

435
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,880
 And the water that they store up there gets dropped through tubes and turned a turbine,

436
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,520
 much like Dan's toilet idea. But it drops 185 meters, which is two statues of liberty in height.

437
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,440
 Like, it really is... And it generates so much power. It's just extraordinary. I think it's 20%

438
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,320
 of China's electricity. It's a lot. It comes from hydro power.

439
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,560
 And China's big. And China's big.

440
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,840
 And they had... Also, the construction of it, they had to divert the entire Yangtze River

441
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,320
 while they built the dam. Imagine. It's just... It's stunning.

442
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,560
 Yeah, it's good. I can see who the propaganda is working on, Andy.

443
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,880
 Is China the best country?

444
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,840
 For this? Yes. So, there's another heating plan operating at the moment, because waste heat is

445
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,320
 like massive. Like, waste heat, if it can be used, would be an enormous resource.

446
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,520
 So, there is currently a project going on. You know, when you're somewhere cold and you get those

447
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,680
 little hand warmers where you snap a coin. Yes, I do know those.

448
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,840
 And it heats up. So, yeah, it's like this jelly...

449
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,960
 Use them on the golf course.

450
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
 Yeah, it's got like stored heat and you snap the coin, this little metal thing in it.

451
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,160
 I always thought it's like two little chemicals sort of mixed together.

452
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,480
 And then that heats, it's an exothermic reaction.

453
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,360
 That's exactly it. And then you can put the heat back in. Like, you can reheat it.

454
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,560
 And it's sort of...

455
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,120
 Oh, that's amazing.

456
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,960
 Those things only last about, like, 40 times, right, those little hand warmers.

457
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,200
 But there is a system currently being worked on to charge thermal batteries from...

458
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,840
 Like, places where they burn rubbish, for example.

459
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,240
 And then transport the heat back into the centre of London

460
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
 and use the heat there where it's needed.

461
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,560
 Right.

462
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,480
 Like, really creative things that are being proposed to deal with energy loss.

463
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,920
 Using burning rubbish, basically.

464
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,640
 Well, that's already used. For example, maybe you'd only generate a bit of electricity from that.

465
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,800
 But it gives off a lot of waste heat in the process.

466
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,440
 That's amazing.

467
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,480
 Catch that. Well, similarly, if you swim in redditch in the Abbey Stadium Leisure Centre,

468
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,760
 anyone who's ever done that, you are being heated by dead bodies from the crematorium.

469
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,120
 And they came up with the idea in...

470
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,840
 I think it was 2012 that they started implementing it.

471
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,520
 And it saves 40% on the Leisure Centre's energy bills.

472
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
 Because it's so much cheaper.

473
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,760
 And, you know, what a useful thing to contribute in your last moments on this earth.

474
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,640
 They're doing this system in Sweden, by the way, as well.

475
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,400
 But it's actually crematoriums that are using it to heat their own crematoriums.

476
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,960
 So if you're waiting in a crematorium, yeah, yeah.

477
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,520
 You don't need that. I mean, having been into a crematorium,

478
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,280
 it's like a room. How much heat do you need?

479
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,440
 Oh, there's a waiting room. There's the front desk.

480
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,720
 You've got a person gone off this.

481
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,920
 You've got a whole system there.

482
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,720
 What country is this in?

483
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,640
 Sweden. Sweden gets very cold then.

484
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,400
 Does get colder there, yeah, fair enough.

485
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,800
 Yeah.

486
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,000
 So they're using that.

487
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,800
 I love, just by the way, Andy, that thing you said with the coin that you snapped.

488
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,960
 That technology is going wild at the moment.

489
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,080
 I was at an arcade down the road from where I live.

490
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,040
 And my son had enough tickets to win a prize.

491
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,120
 And he got an inflatable hammer.

492
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,480
 And instead of having to blow it up,

493
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,880
 you just snap a thing inside it now and inflate.

494
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,160
 Yeah, okay.

495
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,120
 I was not on board with this anecdote until I heard the end of it.

496
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,320
 And I'm so on board with it.

497
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,280
 And somebody's had to blow up lots of inflates in the last year or so.

498
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,160
 Yeah, this giant hammer that you don't do anything to,

499
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,080
 other than snapping a thing in the middle.

500
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,880
 I asked the guy behind the counter and he was like, I don't know, mate.

501
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,840
 I didn't actually construct everything you see.

502
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,520
 I'm not Wallace for Wallace and Gromit.

503
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,840
 That's the first thing I do.

504
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,600
 I'd be like, hello, how do these hammers inflate?

505
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,880
 I really do just operate the till and I open up and close the shop at night.

506
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,200
 Can I do a quick facts on Caroline before we move on?

507
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,760
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

508
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,160
 Because that was the name of this so-called kettle.

509
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,000
 Do you remember a few days ago when England won the Euros?

510
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,200
 And we all sang sweet Caroline.

511
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,520
 Yeah, my Prime Minister Farage came out to shake the hands of the boys.

512
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,160
 We're both recording in the past and in a parallel universe.

513
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,440
 So we recorded this before the Euros.

514
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,360
 But at the time of recording, we had just absolutely battered Slovakia

515
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,000
 to one after extra time.

516
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,720
 And we did sing sweet Caroline, or the England fans did.

517
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,360
 And sweet Caroline is written by Neil Diamond about his wife, Marsha.

518
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,400
 And he called it Caroline because Marsha doesn't scan the tune.

519
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,480
 But what's interesting is that the reason England sings sweet Caroline is there was

520
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,800
 a DJ at Wembley Stadium called Tony Perry, who was supposed to play something else.

521
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,720
 And he played sweet Caroline before the game and it had gone really well.

522
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,680
 And so after England won, this was against Germany.

523
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,120
 He thought, well, I'm going to play it again.

524
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,600
 And he played it again and it really kind of took off.

525
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,880
 And when the women's football team won the Euros, whenever that was a few years ago,

526
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,200
 it was the big sort of song for them.

527
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,920
 And it is the big song for England teams now.

528
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,360
 And this guy, Tony Perry, he's said something really interesting in an interview,

529
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,080
 which is like he's quite important for the team.

530
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:04,080
 Because if you imagine like England played Denmark a few years ago and there were 15 minutes left,

531
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,440
 England are winning.

532
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,520
 They have the halftime of extra time.

533
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
 The fans again, really nervous.

534
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,880
 The nerves of the fans can kind of go to the nerves of the players and it can kind of affect the game.

535
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,920
 But what he can do is he can get the fans going

536
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,760
 and he would play Freeford Desire by whoever that's by.

537
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,600
 It's like a real proper dance anthem.

538
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,360
 The crowd go absolutely mad.

539
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,160
 The crowd are suddenly really, really infused and that helps the team to do the job.

540
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,080
 So actually the DJ who's at the football stadium can affect the game.

541
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,280
 Can alter the game, that's amazing.

542
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
 I didn't know they had DJs in football stadiums.

543
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,480
 Yeah, they do.

544
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,760
 But where do they set up?

545
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,840
 They're going to annoy the people on either side of them, aren't they?

546
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,840
 They're not in decks in the middle of the pitch, they're just in a little booth in there.

547
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,200
 So if England does lose and you want to take out some steam of your own sort of anger.

548
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,320
 You mean in the next world?

549
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,040
 Obviously we won't be able to.

550
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,160
 In the next World Cup, yeah, find the DJ and kick the shit out of them.

551
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,080
 Didn't do his job.

552
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,920
 I thought it was all chanting the referees of anchor and stuff like that.

553
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,120
 Is that gone out these days?

554
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,400
 Well, during halftime, you don't just sit there shouting the referee.

555
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,920
 I mean, the referee's having a cup of tea.

556
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,480
 You can't hear anything, there's no point.

557
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,520
 Okay, that's interesting.

558
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,720
 But then they'll play music.

559
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,000
 They'll play loads of music.

560
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,520
 And there's specific DJs whose job it is to do all these big events.

561
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,360
 And they'll do the Super Bowl and do the World Cup and all that kind of stuff.

562
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,400
 And they make their living by knowing what will get the crowd going.

563
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,120
 That's interesting.

564
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,240
 Do they take requests?

565
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,280
 Can I pop to the booth and say, could you please be a bit quiet?

566
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:40,800
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

567
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,160
 And that is my fact.

568
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,200
 My fact this week is that the classic textbook,

569
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,120
 The Art of Editing, was co-written by Jack Scissors.

570
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,440
 Very good.

571
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,240
 Yeah, that's great.

572
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,920
 It's 432 pages.

573
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,760
 It was 434, though, before Jack got involved.

574
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,760
 Do you know that in the old newspapers, when they were editing,

575
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,720
 is they used to use scissors because big part of making your newspaper

576
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,680
 was you would take all the stories from all the other newspapers

577
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,840
 and you would cut them up and then you would put them on a sheet of paper

578
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,720
 to make sure that they all fit it in the right place.

579
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,960
 And then you would send them to your printer who would then print them.

580
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,120
 Hang on, that implies that to do your newspaper,

581
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,840
 you're just taking other stories from other newspapers.

582
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,200
 What are the first newspapers?

583
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,040
 Well, they borrowed from your edition yesterday.

584
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,000
 That's basically kind of how it works.

585
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 So if you're a national newspaper,

586
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,440
 you would take it from the towns and stuff like that.

587
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,400
 In the really early days, there were things called avici,

588
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,040
 which were like newsletters that were sent round people

589
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,800
 and then they would be all sent to the newspaper

590
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,320
 and they would cut those up.

591
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,920
 But actually, all the newspapers would just copy off each other a lot of the time.

592
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,640
 And obviously, you had to have someone who wrote it originally,

593
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,760
 but there were so many newspapers and so many pages to fill,

594
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,680
 you wouldn't have enough reporters to do all that.

595
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,560
 So you did have to do that.

596
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,440
 And you would usually credit wherever you got it from.

597
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,000
 In the same way that today, it would say this is an associated press report

598
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
 that is in the BBC or whatever.

599
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,000
 And that was really, really common.

600
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,800
 That's amazing because if you got something just completely wrong,

601
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
 usually you'd think as a local newspaper,

602
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,760
 you go, "Well, at least only a couple of thousand people saw that."

603
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,200
 Suddenly, it's global news, literally by the name of it.

604
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,000
 There was the Charlotte News, this was in 1902.

605
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,680
 So towards the end of when they were doing this,

606
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,160
 but they set up a trap saying that there was a gang of anarchists

607
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,160
 in the Vladivostok who were going to kill all of the prominent rulers on the globe.

608
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,840
 And the leader was Count Robgian Ruomoth Lyetsu.

609
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,400
 And if you read that backwards, it says, "We steal from our neighbour."

610
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,440
 Oh, very good.

611
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,120
 That method of cutting out and arranging on the page,

612
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,480
 that survived Private Eye Magazine, where I work, also.

613
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,400
 I took quite recently.

614
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:58,800
 Yeah?

615
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,480
 Oh, is that done now?

616
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,080
 No longer. It has gone out now.

617
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,480
 But it's during my time working there.

618
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,520
 I think that it stopped.

619
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,200
 I one day popped into the office while you were there

620
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,880
 and you showed me how it was laid out.

621
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,600
 It was fascinating.

622
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,560
 And sometimes, if someone picks up one of the finished pages,

623
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,880
 carries it across the room, there is a bow or everyone goes,

624
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,920
 "Oh, just no one coughed to that like it really."

625
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,720
 Yeah.

626
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,160
 So scissors.

627
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,560
 Yeah.

628
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,120
 Scissors.

629
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,760
 Scissors.

630
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,800
 I was looking into a few words around the world

631
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,480
 for what scissors are in different languages.

632
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,920
 Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

633
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,640
 It's quite fun.

634
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,680
 So the Māori for scissors is kāti kāti or kūti kūti.

635
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,880
 German, Andy, you speak German.

636
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,000
 Do you know what scissors are?

637
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,680
 Is something, isn't it shais?

638
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,640
 It's like shia.

639
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,440
 Yeah, shia, yeah.

640
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,880
 So like shearing has a…

641
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,920
 Say it in English, I guess.

642
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,640
 Shias.

643
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,840
 This is the most interesting one.

644
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
 Hungarian word for it is olo.

645
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,640
 Olo.

646
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,360
 Yeah.

647
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,960
 Now, why is that interesting?

648
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,480
 Is it because it looks like a pair of scissors?

649
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,680
 It looks like a pair of scissors.

650
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,160
 Yeah, is that why it's called that or not?

651
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,200
 Well, that's what that's…

652
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,880
 Actually, what you've drawn looks like a penis.

653
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,000
 That's a pair of cheeky testicles on the other side.

654
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,240
 Is that great?

655
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,280
 Yeah, good on them.

656
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,800
 That isn't presumably why it's called that.

657
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,600
 No, I don't think so.

658
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,400
 I think it might.

659
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,080
 I mean, but it's hard to think that that's not why it's called that.

660
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,120
 They're still made in the UK.

661
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,240
 Scissors.

662
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,200
 Scissors aren't.

663
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,360
 Yeah, but lots of manufacturing's gone elsewhere.

664
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,440
 In Sheffield, bingo, there used to be, in Sheffield,

665
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,720
 40,000 workers in the scissors and cutlery trade.

666
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,520
 Mostly cutlery.

667
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,480
 Mostly cutlery.

668
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,600
 But some scissors too.

669
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,680
 And obviously, a lot of them aren't in business anymore,

670
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,000
 but I think there might still be two.

671
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,440
 There's Whiteley, who've been going since 1760, at least,

672
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
 and there's also Ernest Wright and Son.

673
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,720
 They have two, what they're called, master putter-togetherers.

674
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,200
 Is their job literally…

675
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:43,920
 That's the title.

676
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,840
 That is what the title is for anyone who does the job of putting scissors together.

677
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,040
 They'll put her together.

678
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,800
 And they're proper, you know, they're metal,

679
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,480
 all the way, handle, blade, everything.

680
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,520
 They're sort of proper…

681
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,560
 Stay in the steel, I guess.

682
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,040
 Yeah.

683
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,160
 And there was a brilliant video in 2014 showing the trade

684
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,440
 and how it still operated.

685
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,600
 So I don't know if this guy is still working there anymore,

686
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,680
 because he'd been there about 50 years when this was made.

687
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,200
 So he probably isn't still there now.

688
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,360
 But he, one of the two master putter-togetherers,

689
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,760
 was called Eric Stones.

690
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,920
 Now, you would have wet stones in there.

691
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,640
 Yeah, just show them.

692
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,280
 Oh, I was thinking…

693
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,840
 Grind stones.

694
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,280
 I was thinking like, rock, paper, scissors.

695
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,480
 What's another word for rock?

696
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,040
 Oh, I see.

697
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,120
 A stone.

698
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:19,680
 A stone.

699
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:19,840
 A stone.

700
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,680
 Do you, does anyone ever say stone, paper, scissors?

701
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,360
 Yeah, and in other countries.

702
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,000
 There we go.

703
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,720
 I did see a story of someone trying to rob a shoe shop

704
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,360
 with a stone.

705
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,360
 But the person behind the counter…

706
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,880
 That's some paper.

707
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,600
 No, had some scissors.

708
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,400
 Oh, sorry.

709
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,160
 But the story made it into the papers.

710
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,240
 So you've got all three there.

711
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,920
 Anyway, Sheffield, yes, did used to make even more exciting scissors.

712
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,160
 They made the smallest pair of scissors in the world

713
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,360
 in the 19th century.

714
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:43,920
 Did they?

715
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,880
 Yeah, they did.

716
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,360
 So they claimed…

717
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,000
 Was it for cutting something very small, or was it just for fun?

718
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,120
 I think it was just for fun.

719
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,440
 And to entertain the royal family, they went to show them all.

720
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,680
 Britain's chief industry until the mid-20th century

721
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,280
 was just doing things to impress the Queen.

722
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,920
 It was actually the 1820s.

723
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,600
 So it was King George IV.

724
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,560
 And the manufacturer was Joseph Rogers and Sons.

725
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,800
 And they took some tiny scissors to show George IV.

726
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,040
 And according to Sheffield museums,

727
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,240
 they dropped them on its carpet,

728
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,600
 and they were so small that they were never found.

729
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,360
 No, get out.

730
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,360
 They're still there on the floor of Focke and Palace.

731
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,640
 That's a risk, isn't it?

732
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,480
 You know, you don't want to walk around barefoot, do you?

733
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:20,960
 No.

734
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,360
 You want to be in a carpet where you know there's a pair of scissors here somewhere.

735
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,880
 That's why the royals are always wearing shoes.

736
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,320
 From small scissors to large scissors.

737
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,920
 I didn't know this.

738
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,400
 But often, you know those large scissors that you get

739
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,080
 when someone's unvaving something?

740
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
 Oh, yeah, the novelty of cutting a ribbon.

741
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,560
 Ribbon cuts it.

742
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,160
 They don't look very sharp, though.

743
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,040
 I don't think they are.

744
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,360
 No.

745
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,160
 I think… I don't know.

746
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,680
 Oh, they're sharp enough for a ribbon.

747
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,160
 Oh, yeah.

748
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,200
 Ribbons really aren't that hard to cut.

749
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,520
 They can't do micro-surgery or anything like that.

750
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,400
 But why would you want them to?

751
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,160
 But normally, they're…

752
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,880
 Your doctor brought those out during micro-surgery.

753
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,600
 The last thing you see is you're doing the couch for the anesthesia.

754
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,760
 Five, six, what the fuck?

755
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,120
 But normally, you hire them.

756
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,280
 I guess because why on earth would you want to keep a two-foot-long pair of scissors?

757
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,000
 It's just…

758
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,240
 There can't be many in the country.

759
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,440
 There aren't many in the country, James.

760
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,080
 I'm so glad.

761
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,760
 So, in the UK, there's unveiling curtains.co.uk.

762
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,400
 Oh, yeah.

763
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,240
 And they say no unveiling ceremony is complete without a pair of our giant ceremony ribbon

764
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,120
 scissors.

765
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,600
 But in America, there's goldenopenings.com.

766
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,120
 Oh, I saw their website, really great.

767
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,600
 Yeah, and Goldenert, what were you googling when you found that?

768
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,120
 But they are 40 inches long.

769
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,720
 They advertise themselves as the largest working scissors in the world.

770
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,720
 Someone who apparently keeps scissors on them at all times is…

771
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,560
 A hairdresser.

772
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,200
 A hairdresser, yes, in this very specific case, Richard Branson.

773
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,640
 Oh.

774
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,960
 This is such an odd thing that he does.

775
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,200
 He hates when people are a bit too formal.

776
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
 He thinks that businesses should be relaxed.

777
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,760
 He's often asked by CEOs, "How can I make my business more relaxed?"

778
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,120
 If he sees anyone around the table with a tie on, he gets his scissors out.

779
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,880
 He goes over and he cuts their tie off.

780
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,560
 And he says, "Everyone laughs.

781
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,000
 Everyone has a great old time."

782
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,960
 But that's his thing.

783
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,680
 I'm sure they'll continue laughing when he's left the room.

784
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,080
 Yeah, exactly.

785
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,600
 I don't just call him a wanker.

786
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,080
 Yeah.

787
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,240
 I must have said this tie was given to me by my grandfather.

788
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,360
 Does he have special…

789
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,880
 They must be quite sharp scissors.

790
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,680
 I'm sure they are.

791
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,320
 But…

792
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,120
 You know, how strong are you?

793
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,240
 Do you have ties made of wood?

794
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,360
 No, to cut through a tie in a single amusing chief executive gesture.

795
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,000
 It's quite…

796
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,320
 He must have killed thousands of underlings.

797
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,320
 I do have a tie made of wood, like a bow tie made of wood out of cork.

798
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:34,960
 Of course you do.

799
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,600
 But I think if I ever meet Richard Branson, I'm going to wear it

800
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,840
 and see how strong a scissors really is.

801
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,960
 Exactly.

802
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,400
 There's a pair of scissors that I've only ever used three times.

803
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,920
 What are they?

804
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,160
 I know what they are.

805
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,200
 Oh, yeah.

806
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,480
 Unfilical cord scissors.

807
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,680
 I don't own them myself.

808
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,560
 I've only ever used them.

809
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,480
 But yeah, umbilical scissors, which I have used three times

810
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,320
 because I have three kids in hospital.

811
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,520
 Okay, you haven't used the same.

812
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
 It's not like you bought some especially.

813
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,400
 No, they're labelled…

814
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,920
 They're hanging up in the hospital and they're labelled

815
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,960
 "property of defibrillation".

816
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,600
 Do not touch.

817
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,760
 He will be back for another one soon.

818
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,800
 Yeah, I used the ones that were in the hospital.

819
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,960
 I was asked if I'd want to cut the umbilical cord.

820
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,600
 But did you say…

821
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,560
 Did you say yes every time?

822
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,440
 I would say yes because I was like, "Why would I… why?"

823
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,080
 Oh, right.

824
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,360
 Everyone said yes.

825
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,240
 Why would I, though?

826
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,120
 Why would I want to do something that a professional can do?

827
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,080
 Will you offer the chance?

828
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,720
 Yeah, of course.

829
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,680
 I think they always offer the chance.

830
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,600
 I frequently will sneak into hospitals

831
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,840
 and ask if I can pretend to use…

832
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,240
 Like, "Oh, when the time comes, can I do the cutting?"

833
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,040
 You're subbed in.

834
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,160
 You're there on the sidelines.

835
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,560
 Yeah.

836
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,640
 Is it quite thick and so grisly?

837
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,200
 It is.

838
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,760
 It's a bit odd and you're a bit nervous when you're doing it

839
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,360
 because you think, "What if I get this wrong?"

840
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
 Nothing can happen.

841
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,960
 Well, you don't know that in the moment.

842
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,400
 Unless you get really wrong and like,

843
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,760
 "Shop your baby's willy off," or something.

844
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,480
 Yeah.

845
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,480
 That's not the umbilical cord.

846
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,600
 It was a very well endowed baby.

847
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,560
 That's so funny.

848
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,360
 No, but you can…

849
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,400
 I looked online.

850
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,600
 You can buy from Amazon umbilical cord scissors

851
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,040
 to use on your own at home,

852
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,320
 say for home births, right?

853
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:04,640
 No.

854
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,320
 That would be good if you were opening

855
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,880
 a new wing of a maternity ward.

856
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,520
 You could, like, instead of a ribbon,

857
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,280
 you could have an umbilical cord.

858
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,480
 So if you have a newborn baby,

859
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,960
 just slowly pull away from your mother.

860
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,080
 Your mother just after birth.

861
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:18,320
 Sorry.

862
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,200
 Do you mind if we just move you to the ceremony room?

863
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,520
 It's the grand opening.

864
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:23,680
 Yeah.

865
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,240
 But is there anything special about them

866
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,120
 except a gimmick to get money out of people on Amazon?

867
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,680
 These are used.

868
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,480
 These are used.

869
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,320
 Are they any more special then?

870
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,360
 Oh, they're specially shaped.

871
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,560
 They're different types of scissors.

872
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,880
 Yeah, to what you don't use, your classic scissors.

873
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,360
 Oh, I think they're sort of curved.

874
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,160
 I think they're sort of curved.

875
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,040
 I thought they just need to be sharp.

876
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,440
 Really?

877
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,120
 No, I think they're slightly curved

878
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,240
 and, like, half moon-shaped.

879
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,480
 Yes.

880
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,600
 Are they?

881
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,960
 But, yeah, I had a one-star review.

882
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,600
 This main pair that comes up.

883
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,120
 Wait, is it one-star?

884
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,080
 Baby's still attached.

885
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,840
 He's four years old now.

886
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,920
 Yeah, it basically said does not cut well.

887
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,880
 Stiff to use needed several attempts to cut,

888
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,560
 which is a bit terrifying.

889
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,920
 But I was trying to look into them.

890
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,360
 This is a very random tangent,

891
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,880
 but I discovered a guy who said,

892
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,920
 "Hey, when you're in the hospital

893
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,720
 and you are offered to cut the baby's umbilical cord,

894
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,480
 why not suggest biting it off

895
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,320
 instead of using the scissors?"

896
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,440
 And Brian Blessed.

897
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,480
 Like Brian Blessed's style.

898
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:14,880
 That's right.

899
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,400
 He did that in a park.

900
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,600
 Well, he did it when he said that he did.

901
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,400
 He said that he did.

902
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
 But this guy said that he did.

903
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
 He said, "I went in.

904
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,560
 I said to them, 'Is it cool if I do the umbilical cutting?'

905
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,360
 He believed that because I started the baby with my seed,

906
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,440
 this is me ending the process

907
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,280
 by using my mouth to bite into it."

908
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,240
 It's a bit.

909
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,600
 He said it tastes like calamari,

910
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,800
 the rubbery kind of...

911
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,920
 It wouldn't taste like calamari.

912
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,720
 Yes, it tastes like blood.

913
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,000
 Yes, his wife was a squid.

914
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,320
 [LAUGHTER]

915
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,160
 Were you watching My Octopus Keeper

916
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,600
 or whatever that thing is?

917
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,160
 Yeah.

918
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,480
 No, no.

919
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,920
 He said it was basically like blood,

920
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,720
 iron-like, the texture of it was calamari-like.

921
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,000
 And apparently, if you ask, they might say yes.

922
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,840
 So if anyone fancies it...

923
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,480
 Worth asking.

924
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,440
 Worth asking.

925
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,280
 They'll think you're a real weirdo,

926
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,720
 but they might say yes.

927
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,480
 Can I give you a riddle?

928
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:02,800
 Yeah.

929
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,680
 Okay.

930
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,480
 2017.

931
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,440
 Yes.

932
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:05,680
 Right.

933
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,880
 There's a guy in Vietnam.

934
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,400
 He's 54 years old.

935
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,360
 He has a road accident.

936
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,640
 Yeah.

937
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,640
 And there's...

938
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,640
 This is not a good riddle.

939
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,960
 There seems to be something sharp

940
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,080
 inside his stomach.

941
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,800
 Is it scissors?

942
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,080
 I could wait.

943
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,200
 Now I haven't finished the riddle.

944
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,280
 [LAUGHTER]

945
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,600
 He'd recently been to fucking a palace

946
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,960
 and was licking the carpet.

947
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,320
 [LAUGHTER]

948
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,440
 Is that how they get...

949
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,480
 The fucking impan is clean.

950
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:32,800
 Yeah.

951
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,920
 He says, "This happens.

952
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,200
 I have to lick the floors."

953
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,320
 [LAUGHTER]

954
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,360
 Oh, that's the deep clean.

955
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,240
 No, in the second hospital scant him,

956
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,000
 and they found a six-inch pair of scissors

957
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,800
 inside him.

958
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,120
 Okay.

959
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,240
 Which had been there since 1998.

960
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,600
 Oh, did he have an operation?

961
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,080
 The year of the most French thing

962
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,160
 that has ever happened.

963
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,800
 [LAUGHTER]

964
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,080
 The year after Diana died.

965
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,160
 The surgeon said, "Sacre bleu!"

966
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,320
 Because he was actually watching

967
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,760
 the World Cup at the same time.

968
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,160
 No, 19 years.

969
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,040
 This guy had had a six-inch pair of scissors

970
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,920
 inside him and had had a little bit of stomach pain,

971
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,280
 but basically nothing else.

972
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,080
 Isn't that just...

973
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,920
 Six inches is long.

974
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,120
 And is it from having an operation

975
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,000
 and someone dropped it in?

976
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,480
 Yes, it was.

977
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,000
 [LAUGHTER]

978
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,120
 So the riddle is a bad one.

979
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,560
 Please forget the riddle element.

980
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,640
 But I just think that's stunning

981
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,680
 that he'd had a previous road accident in 1998,

982
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,120
 had an operation for it.

983
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,400
 They'd left the scissors in and then,

984
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,120
 and they only found it

985
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,800
 as a result of the second road accident.

986
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,200
 Right.

987
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:29,760
 So that's kind of pleasing.

988
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,360
 I think if you're a surgeon

989
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,440
 and you need to put down the scissors for a second,

990
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,000
 Yeah.

991
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,960
 Put them on a tray.

992
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,360
 Yeah.

993
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:35,840
 Yeah.

994
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,240
 Absolutely.

995
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,280
 Don't put it on someone's spleen.

996
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,720
 [LAUGHTER]

997
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,600
 Well, that was the gross thing.

998
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,280
 They had rusted and they had become stuck

999
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,640
 to his nearby organs

1000
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,360
 because they'd been there so long.

1001
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,720
 Yeah, that's going to make him super sick.

1002
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,400
 He was all right.

1003
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:46,720
 Was he?

1004
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,840
 Yeah, he was fine.

1005
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,080
 It is weird that the body can withstand that size,

1006
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,080
 because it must have really misshapen

1007
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:52,960
 various bits of him,

1008
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,720
 but they obviously just stretch to accommodate them.

1009
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,120
 Yep.

1010
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,120
 Spine went, "Hey, all right, I'll take you."

1011
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,680
 Do you know what knob cutters are used for?

1012
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,320
 Knob cutters?

1013
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:00,480
 Yeah.

1014
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,000
 Is it a type of scissor?

1015
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,120
 Visectomies?

1016
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,520
 No.

1017
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,080
 Unix?

1018
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1019
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,480
 Knob cutters?

1020
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:06,880
 Nobs.

1021
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,760
 Oh, doors.

1022
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:07,920
 Door nobs.

1023
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,480
 Knob doors.

1024
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,760
 The type of cactus.

1025
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,240
 Nobs of butter.

1026
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:10,960
 Closer.

1027
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,920
 Oh.

1028
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,880
 Cactus, have nipples, but what has knobs?

1029
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,120
 Oh.

1030
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,960
 What, a plant with a knob?

1031
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,240
 Yeah, just trees, I guess.

1032
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:18,560
 A tree.

1033
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,200
 A tree.

1034
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,640
 Well, why would you use scissors on a tree?

1035
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,520
 You want to make it nice and smooth,

1036
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,880
 because you work for Yves Saint Laurent,

1037
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,400
 and he's mental.

1038
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,560
 Well, you would use shears

1039
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,400
 or you would use like a chainsaw, right?

1040
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,120
 A tiny tree, then.

1041
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,840
 It's got to be.

1042
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,720
 Bonsai.

1043
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,600
 Bonsai.

1044
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,520
 They are used by Bonsai.

1045
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,640
 So great.

1046
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,040
 That's cool.

1047
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,240
 Gardeners, yeah.

1048
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,480
 They are.

1049
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,560
 The Bonsai scissor world is pretty amazing.

1050
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,200
 Well, they're like, the knob cutters are really cool looking,

1051
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,360
 because the bit which you cut

1052
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,520
 looks like it could be a tiny Sheffield,

1053
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,120
 like the world's smallest scissor.

1054
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:51,200
 Brilliant.

1055
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,280
 But then the handles are normal sized handles.

1056
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,360
 Because obviously you need to sort of--

1057
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,160
 To have your fingers in there.

1058
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,200
 Put your fingers in it,

1059
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,280
 but also you're cutting something really, really small.

1060
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,320
 That makes so much sense.

1061
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,120
 That's good.

1062
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,360
 That's a good thing for like a James Bond super villain

1063
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,240
 to say is like, you know,

1064
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,520
 when Bond's tied to the child or whatever.

1065
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,040
 Bring me the knob cutters.

1066
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,320
 Turn through Bonsai tree.

1067
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,280
 Gives them a little truth.

1068
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,000
 That's brilliant.

1069
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,120
 You would have to set up that Joe Kerrier in the movie.

1070
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,960
 Oh, yeah, I would ensure that I did.

1071
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,200
 Or put some subtitles explaining what they are.

1072
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,640
 Joe Kerrier's like,

1073
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,880
 "I don't know what you mean about the knob cutters."

1074
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,880
 And then Blow Felt's like,

1075
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,200
 "Well, actually, it's the name of, you know,

1076
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,880
 some scissors that use it Bonsai."

1077
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,480
 Now bring in the dildo cactus.

1078
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:45,920
 Okay, that's it.

1079
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,960
 That is all of our facts.

1080
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,480
