00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hey everyone, Dan here. Welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Before we get"
00:00:06,00:00:11,"going I just have a quick personal announcement that I want to make, which is to tell you that my"
00:00:11,00:00:18,"first ever non-fiction kids book is out today. You can get it in shots now, it's called ""Impossible"
00:00:18,00:00:23,"Things, Unbelievable Answers to the World's Weirdest Questions"" and in it I have gone on 10"
00:00:23,00:00:28,adventures to try and answer some of the big questions that kids often ask us about the mysteries
00:00:28,00:00:33,"of the universe. Oh my god, get out of here James. Is time travel possible? Will we ever talk"
00:00:33,00:00:39,to animals? Do ghosts exist? Can imaginary friends come to life? Are we all actually living in a
00:00:39,00:00:44,"giant video game simulation? Using these questions as starting points, I've written something that"
00:00:44,00:00:50,combines really interesting facts with great spooky tales and along the way I managed to get a 2500
00:00:50,00:00:56,year old Babylonian ghost at Guinness World Record and also sit down with a psychic spy. It's the
00:00:56,00:01:01,"perfect summary for your kid. For any of those questions, if they've ever wanted to know why we"
00:01:01,00:01:08,"haven't been taken over by zombies, why in 1991 there were over 60,000 jellyfish in space, and how"
00:01:08,00:01:12,"to throw their own time traveler party, well then this is the book for them. So guys, I'd really"
00:01:12,00:01:16,"appreciate it if you could buy it. So hard for authors these days to sell their books, but we"
00:01:16,00:01:22,"rely on people like you, our fish club, to help us do that and I'd really appreciate the support."
00:01:22,00:01:26,"So if you can do it, it's out there now. Impossible things in all good bookshops."
00:01:26,00:01:34,"Thank you so much and on with the show. Also buy my book. No, next week. Buy his next week. On with the show."
00:01:50,00:01:56,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:56,00:02:01,"from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:01,00:02:06,"Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:06,00:02:11,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:11,00:02:18,"Starting with fact number one, that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that Yves Saint Laurent's"
00:02:18,00:02:24,"gardener used hair clippers to keep his cactuses perfectly trimmed. That is, that is care."
00:02:24,00:02:30,"And hair clippers are those ones that men use to keep their hair really short, right? Yeah."
00:02:30,00:02:35,"So you set them to a setting and you go... Or you may use it for your beard. Right. So yes,"
00:02:35,00:02:39,that's what hair clippers are. Cactuses are succulent plants and Yves Saint Laurent was a
00:02:39,00:02:45,"fashion designer. Any more announcements in this one, maybe explain it. I didn't think that cactuses,"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"I've never seen a shaggy cactus. Do you know what I mean? Well, the thing is, there's lots of"
00:02:49,00:02:57,different types of cactus. And Yves Saint Laurent loved cactuses. He had a garden in Marrakesh called
00:02:57,00:03:02,"the Jardin Marjorelle. Actually, it was started by another artist called Jacques Marjorelle."
00:03:02,00:03:08,But Yves Saint Laurent bought it when it was going into disrepair and he looked after these
00:03:08,00:03:11,"cactuses. And it's a really beautiful garden. It's a place that I've been quite recently,"
00:03:11,00:03:17,where I saw this fact. There was a video of his gardener who was going around with these hair
00:03:17,00:03:21,clippers making them all perfect. The only thing I can imagine you could do with hair clippers
00:03:21,00:03:26,on a cactus is to trim the spines. Is that what he's doing? Is he blunting them so they don't
00:03:26,00:03:31,"prick anyone? No, it wasn't. It was just to make them all look perfect because I don't think it's"
00:03:31,00:03:37,controversial to say that Yves Saint Laurent was something of an Yves Thiet. Yeah. I don't
00:03:37,00:03:42,"understand when, because I don't know much about fashion, but when I read about Yves Saint Laurent"
00:03:42,00:03:47,"and his achievements, his concrete accomplishments, they're all quite, you know, he took risks by"
00:03:47,00:03:52,turning a trench coat into haute couture. Yeah. What does that mean? I don't understand. This is
00:03:52,00:03:57,the character of Dior. He is taken on the mantle of one of the biggest fashion houses ever. And
00:03:57,00:04:02,he's looking at trends that are going on out in bits of America and bits of France. And he's saying
00:04:02,00:04:06,this is seen as low rent. I'm putting it back into there. That's a risk. It's basically me not
00:04:06,00:04:10,understanding the plot of the film The Devil Ways Prada. It's basically what I came to understand.
00:04:10,00:04:15,"Oh, right. That's right. But yeah. The thing I guess that I found interesting was his personality,"
00:04:15,00:04:20,"because I agree. It's hard to get a grip on fashion if you don't know fashion, but it is striking"
00:04:20,00:04:25,"that he was so young when he took over at Christian Dior, right? He was 21. And he was, for someone who"
00:04:25,00:04:30,"was kind of famous for being a strong character, maybe not that likable a character later on,"
00:04:30,00:04:34,he was probably incredibly shy and like couldn't even look anyone in the eye. He was just new at
00:04:34,00:04:39,Christian Dior and Christian Dior died suddenly. And I think there were these four women who worked
00:04:39,00:04:45,there and the company was left to him to basically take charge this weird shy boy who couldn't look
00:04:45,00:04:49,anyone in the eye. It's an amazing story because he moved to Paris when he was 1718 and he entered
00:04:49,00:04:55,a competition where he just did some designs. He then took it to Dior. Dior saw it. It really was
00:04:55,00:04:59,"so similar to what he was working on at that point that he just on the spot said, you're now my second"
00:04:59,00:05:03,"in command. You're my assistant. What's nice is this little competition, you know, sometimes you"
00:05:03,00:05:07,hear about a school where it's like seven comic book writers were there at the same time. Carl
00:05:07,00:05:14,Largefeld came second in that competition. That he won. That eventually got him his job at Dior.
00:05:14,00:05:18,"Dan, was this the competition of the international wool secretariat?"
00:05:18,00:05:22,"Yes. Yeah, I think we'll say that. Yeah. Did you have to make everything out of wool?"
00:05:22,00:05:28,"Yeah, they gave you a big pile of wool and 20 minutes. 20 minutes. I'm joking. I'm joking."
00:05:28,00:05:33,"I think it was just the design. Do you know this is off topic now, but I was reading about wool"
00:05:33,00:05:39,"this morning and in, let's say, when was it? Probably about the 15th century, there was a wool"
00:05:39,00:05:45,"guild and a knitter's guild. And if you wanted to be a knitter and sell your knitting, you had to"
00:05:45,00:05:51,"be part of this guild. And in order to be part of it, you had to study for six years and then do a"
00:05:51,00:05:56,knitting exam at the end of it. And the knitting exam would take like a day where you showed off
00:05:56,00:06:00,"everything you've learned over the six years. And if you didn't pass that exam, you couldn't be"
00:06:00,00:06:06,like a professional knitter. Could you take the exam again? Good question. It's an all or nothing.
00:06:06,00:06:11,"You know what? I didn't go into all the admin yet. But you will because you're applying, aren't you?"
00:06:11,00:06:18,"Dior. Yeah. So he obviously became very famous colossus of the industry, all of this. He was"
00:06:18,00:06:26,"responsible for, I think, the most French thing that has ever happened, right? Okay. It's a 1998."
00:06:26,00:06:32,"Yeah. We're in Paris. Yeah. What's going on? 1998, Diana died the year before. That's right. It was"
00:06:32,00:06:39,the one year anniversary. Was it the World Cup? It was the World Cup. Yeah. So France was hosting.
00:06:39,00:06:45,"Yeah. And they won it. And they won it, as in Zidane and all that. Bloody hell, Andy. I do contain"
00:06:45,00:06:53,multitudes. It's on the paper in front of them. Before the final of the World Cup on the pitch
00:06:53,00:06:59,in the big stadium was an Yves Saint Laurent retrospective show with 300 models celebrating
00:06:59,00:07:03,"40 years of Yves Saint Laurent. I just think that's so French. Like, we will have the football,"
00:07:03,00:07:09,but first fashion. They do take it seriously. The way that Yves Saint Laurent's career is reported
00:07:09,00:07:13,"on sometimes when it talks about the absolute scandal. What was the scandal? The scandal,"
00:07:13,00:07:18,"so it was 1971 and it was this show called Carrant, which was a reference to the fact that it was"
00:07:18,00:07:25,"an imitation of 1940s fashion and it was put on in Paris this show. Of course, it was early 1940s"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"fashion. Now, as you may or may not know listening at home, the early 1940s was a difficult time for"
00:07:30,00:07:37,the people of France. And the fashion was meant to imitate kind of occupied France and sort of
00:07:37,00:07:42,"not only that, but the costumes that he recreated sort of imitate people who were doing quite well"
00:07:42,00:07:48,in occupied Paris. We're talking collaborationists. Are we talking like René Artois from Allo Allo?
00:07:48,00:07:51,It was one for the younger listeners.
00:07:51,00:08:01,"Good morning to you. You're listening. Yves Saint Laurent's cameo in Allo Allo was so weird,"
00:08:01,00:08:07,"wasn't it? Yes, it was all Allo Allo and, you know, Dad's army based fashion."
00:08:07,00:08:13,"No, but it's Vichy France, right? It was Vichy, it had a lot of nods to Vichy France and it was"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"quite extreme. The press were very offended saying, you know, it's in a very sensitive reminder of"
00:08:16,00:08:20,the Nazi days. It's an insult to fashion. But this was obviously good for him because any
00:08:20,00:08:24,publicity is good publicity. So it was things like it. I think people had to wear practical clothes
00:08:24,00:08:30,because they didn't have many materials. So it was lots of tiny mini skirts and platform shoes.
00:08:30,00:08:38,"Actually, this is like Allo Allo. When was this? '71."
00:08:38,00:08:43,"Okay. Wow. So that was when he was an Yves Saint Laurent designer, not a Dior designer, right?"
00:08:43,00:08:47,"Yeah, he was himself. Because he was Dior and he did all this stuff where he was taking stuff off"
00:08:47,00:08:54,"the streets, like Dan said, but then they basically kicked him out, didn't they? Or rather, he got"
00:08:54,00:08:58,"conscripted to the army and the fashion house could have said, well, no, he's so important to us"
00:08:58,00:09:03,"that he can't go to the army, but they didn't say it, they just let him go. Yeah, interesting."
00:09:03,00:09:07,"And he's so stuck with a nervous breakdown, didn't he? Yeah, well, he didn't go to war"
00:09:07,00:09:12,"because he had a breakdown in the incident. Did he even make, because he was going to be sent to,"
00:09:12,00:09:15,"it was Algeria, wasn't it, the Algerian front? He didn't even make it to Algeria."
00:09:15,00:09:20,He didn't even make it to Algeria. But the thing is that while he was doing his induction before
00:09:20,00:09:24,"he collapsed, they replaced him with someone else. And they really shouldn't have done that."
00:09:24,00:09:29,Like they should have kept his job open for when he came back. And so they sued Dior and
00:09:29,00:09:34,they got some money from Dior and that's when they set up their own fashion house Yves Saint Laurent.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"Right. And when you say they, you mean him and his partner, lover, best friend in the world,"
00:09:38,00:09:44,"soulmate guy, right? With whom actually he bought this cactus garden in Marrakesh."
00:09:44,00:09:48,"Just to bring it back to that. And of course, while we're in North Africa, Zinedine Zidane"
00:09:48,00:09:54,"himself of Algerian stock. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if Yves Saint Laurent had made it to the war,"
00:09:54,00:09:58,"he might have met Zidane's family, you know. What have you done with Andrew Hunter Murray?"
00:09:58,00:10:03,I feel like you've just recently read the encyclopedia entry on Zed and you're not
00:10:03,00:10:09,desperate to smuggle in. It's the last football I paid any attention to because I was 11 at the time.
00:10:09,00:10:14,"I'm so impressed. Yeah, Berger was an interesting guy and seemed to run Yves Saint Laurent's life"
00:10:14,00:10:21,"because Yves Saint Laurent was a very vulnerable person, wasn't he? And Pierre Berger just was"
00:10:21,00:10:27,the organiser. So he was his lover from 58 to 76 and then they were very good friends. And
00:10:28,00:10:34,he had a weird introduction to Paris as well. So he moved to Paris from an island and he was 18
00:10:34,00:10:39,"years old, moved there on his own. And on the day he moved, he was walking down the Champs-Élysées"
00:10:39,00:10:45,and a famous poet called Jacques Prévert fell from the sky above him and landed at his feet.
00:10:45,00:10:54,"Wow, but not on him, like right in front of him. No, he says, I always remember my first day in"
00:10:54,00:10:58,"Paris as a day a famous poet landed on my head, but he didn't. In his actual description, he"
00:10:58,00:11:03,"fell out of a French window a few stories on. Oh, right. They're all French windows, if we're embarrassed."
00:11:03,00:11:10,All these people are so young at the time when they sort of move their formative experiences. So
00:11:10,00:11:18,"when Saint Laurent was, when he got the job, when Dior died, did we say he was 21? 21. And at that"
00:11:18,00:11:23,"point he went home and again, this is the story, he drew a thousand designs in a fortnight."
00:11:24,00:11:27,"I can't imagine, once you've drawn like five different pairs of trousers."
00:11:27,00:11:32,Oh my god. There are only five. I know that this is ridiculous. How many pairs of trousers could
00:11:32,00:11:36,"there possibly be out there? There's skinny, there's straight and there's fles. I think all of that"
00:11:36,00:11:42,football knowledge has pushed out all of the fashion knowledge. Do you remember only having
00:11:42,00:11:47,any fashion knowledge if you've passed your mind back over the last 10 years? And then they moved
00:11:47,00:11:53,"to Marrakech, didn't they? Because it was the cool place to be in those days. It was where all the"
00:11:53,00:11:58,"hippies went. And there had actually been an international zone in Tangier, which was like"
00:11:58,00:12:03,"not owned by anyone really. It was just like a trading port and it was very, very low tax. And"
00:12:03,00:12:07,there weren't many rules compared to other places in North Africa and loads and loads of hippies went
00:12:07,00:12:12,there. But eventually Morocco took over it and then they decided actually Marrakech is a better
00:12:12,00:12:20,"place to go. And it was set up this kind of hippie group in Marrakech by Talifa Getty, who was a wife"
00:12:20,00:12:27,"of John Paul Getty, of the Getty millionaires. And he was like a playboy and he had this partner"
00:12:27,00:12:33,who was just absolutely crazy. And she had all the best parties and Keith Richards said she had the
00:12:33,00:12:41,best friends and the best opium. And she and John Paul Getty named the son Tara Gabriel Galaxy
00:12:41,00:12:50,Gramophone Getty. Which is a name. Gramophone. We've got options when you grow up. If you want
00:12:50,00:12:54,"to be a bit kooky, you can take on gramophones. True. I actually think they took the other option"
00:12:54,00:13:01,of removing their middle names as they all did. Have a gramophone related fact. Brilliant. Which
00:13:01,00:13:06,brings it in a big circle because cactuses are incredibly useful in the world of gramophones.
00:13:06,00:13:14,The needles. The needles. No. Yeah. It's so cool. I did not know about this. But in the 1920s when
00:13:14,00:13:20,"people had wind-up gramophones, 1920s and 1930s, cactus spines or prickly pears were really,"
00:13:20,00:13:25,really popular and they were thought to produce a much higher quality sound than the actual steel
00:13:25,00:13:29,needles. It's amazing. Yeah. And you could sculpt them because they're a bit softer than the steel.
00:13:29,00:13:32,So you could sculpt them so they don't miss. And it wouldn't break the record.
00:13:32,00:13:38,Wouldn't break the record. Yeah. And just this one company found the niche in the market. Some
00:13:38,00:13:45,cactus names. Yeah. Big nipple cactus. Lovely. Woolly nipple cactus. Bonker hedgehog cactus.
00:13:45,00:13:51,"Sorry, is that bonk a hedgehog? It bonks a hedgehog? No, it's bonker hedgehog and it's named"
00:13:51,00:13:58,"after Frances Bonker. She was a cactus expert and she also wrote a book called The Mad Dictator,"
00:13:58,00:14:03,which was a novel about Hitler's life. The prohibition cactus because it likes its home
00:14:03,00:14:09,"place dry, likes a dry area. Clever. Applies to a lot of them, doesn't it? It does actually,"
00:14:09,00:14:14,doesn't it? And there's a lot named after nipples. But I think that's because the part of a cactus
00:14:14,00:14:21,where the spines come out of is called the areola. It is. Yeah. Because they are kind of a little
00:14:21,00:14:27,"bump, aren't they? This is so weird. I have a related nipple cactus nipple fact. Perfect."
00:14:27,00:14:31,"Yeah. Which is that scientists, this is a very recent discovery, there are 100 species of cactus"
00:14:31,00:14:37,"which act as breasts for ants. Okay. In other words, so they have these tiny nipples in their"
00:14:37,00:14:41,"flesh, not I think where the spines are, but they produce this tiny supply of sweet nectar"
00:14:41,00:14:48,and the ants go crazy for the nectar and then the ants protect the mother udder against insects
00:14:48,00:14:52,"and they clean bacteria and they fertilize the soil, they spread the seeds to new sites."
00:14:52,00:14:56,"So that is... That's not what babies do though, when they're drinking from breasts. I mean,"
00:14:56,00:15:01,"they do a lot of fertilizing, but not necessarily... They do very little protective work. You're"
00:15:01,00:15:06,"all right. I didn't realize the threat to cactus, so the climate is one thing because it is obviously"
00:15:06,00:15:10,"they're living in an extreme environment already, you know, and if it gets much off for a dryer"
00:15:10,00:15:15,"then they're in trouble. But the other risk to them is cactus smuggling. Good. It's one of the,"
00:15:15,00:15:19,it's one of the... I had 10 cactuses down my underpants when I went abroad last time.
00:15:20,00:15:27,"Can I go take the cocaine next time, please? I can't fit another one up there. There is a cactus"
00:15:27,00:15:35,"called the dildo cactus. It doesn't look very usable, does it? No, I'm not actually sure why"
00:15:35,00:15:39,it's got that. I try to find out why it's called the dildo cactus. I think because it's slightly
00:15:39,00:15:43,"felicin-shaped, but obviously... Right, but so many of them are. And in fact, if any of the cacti"
00:15:43,00:15:49,"that I have seen, that one could do with pruning. It's a very furry and spiky-ish."
00:15:49,00:15:54,"Well, people like different things. Yeah. Do you guys know about... So we're recording this"
00:15:54,00:15:59,"on the 4th of July, big election day, and I found a nice little political connection to cactus,"
00:15:59,00:16:05,"which is Nick Clegg, the former head of the Liberal Democrats. Do you know that he was"
00:16:05,00:16:12,"arrested in Germany or certainly was taken... Got in trouble in Germany because of arson,"
00:16:12,00:16:17,because he was lighting cactus up. Do you remember that? Was he smoking them for a drug?
00:16:17,00:16:22,"No, he was just drunk, and he was just setting fire to cacti, you know. And he admitted this."
00:16:22,00:16:34,"You're a prick. You're a prick. Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:16:34,00:16:40,"My fact this week is that in the early 1400s, China had ships four times larger than anything else"
00:16:40,00:16:45,"in Europe. By the 1500s, it had deliberately destroyed them."
00:16:45,00:16:49,"European ships tiny, Chinese ships massive, basically. European ships perfectly acceptable."
00:16:49,00:16:54,"Chinese ships unbelievable. I just think more people should just know about this fleet,"
00:16:54,00:16:58,"because it is an amazing period in Chinese history. It was called the treasure fleet,"
00:16:58,00:17:04,"and they seem to have now proven how big they were, because the claims were that these ships were"
00:17:04,00:17:09,"up to 140 meters long. And I think no one really believed it. And no one believed it. No, it was"
00:17:09,00:17:13,"like, come on, that's not possible, genuinely. I mean, the ship that Columbus sailed on was 20 meters,"
00:17:13,00:17:16,and that was what was huge. That's almost the same size as the world's largest
00:17:16,00:17:20,foosball table. It's not credible. It's not possible. It doesn't make any sense.
00:17:20,00:17:26,"Unbelievable. Yeah. Thank you, James. So yes, ships as long as a particularly large football table,"
00:17:26,00:17:31,"and there were tons of them as well. There were 3,500 of them. So for comparison,"
00:17:31,00:17:38,"you know, our pathetic Navy today is 66 ships. And even. There have been some cuts lately,"
00:17:38,00:17:42,but we had a lot more in 1945. Because it's not necessarily something we need.
00:17:42,00:17:46,"Russia and China, though, they have the largest navies in the world, and they're in the 700."
00:17:46,00:17:51,"So this is, you know, much bigger than any of those. Almost 30,000 sailors went on just one of the"
00:17:51,00:17:58,voyages. So the whole scale of it is mad. Over 300 ships would sail out at once. And they went an
00:17:58,00:18:04,"incredibly long way. And they're mostly to just show off, weren't they? Well, it's kind of was."
00:18:04,00:18:07,"Yes, basically, yes. Yeah, it was a cultural sort of just say, hey, have you heard of China?"
00:18:07,00:18:13,It's like kimchi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's about last week. Exactly. It wasn't really plundering.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"They did bring back some treasure, but it wasn't when I read about it, I thought, oh, well,"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"they'll be going off finding treasure, bringing it back. And that wasn't really. No, no, not really."
00:18:20,00:18:24,"It was more showing off their treasure. There was it was destroying pirate fleets,"
00:18:24,00:18:29,"occasionally, for a bit of fun. But imagine if you're a pirate. I mean, it's not a pair, is it?"
00:18:29,00:18:33,"Like just doing your thing, getting a little bit of plunder here and there,"
00:18:33,00:18:40,and then suddenly 300 foosball table sized. You've gotten to stop using that comparison.
00:18:40,00:18:45,But so the Wikipedia on the treasure fleets is great because it does acknowledge there are a
00:18:45,00:18:50,"couple of gaps, right? So listen to this, there is still much debate regarding issues such as the"
00:18:50,00:18:55,"purpose of the voyages, the size of the ships, the magnitude of the fleet, the routes taken,"
00:18:55,00:18:59,"the charts employed, the countries visited, and the cargo carried. Basically, we don't know who"
00:18:59,00:19:04,"was going or where or why or what they were on or who they were with or how. Well, I think what we"
00:19:04,00:19:09,"have is that's very good in our time on it, actually. What we have is very detailed records"
00:19:09,00:19:13,from China. So we do know a lot about it. It's just we don't necessarily know the negative things
00:19:13,00:19:18,"that might have been how many ships sunk. I mean, we have no evidence that any of them sunk, but it's"
00:19:18,00:19:23,"implausible, surely. And we genuinely thought it was impossible to make ships out of wood this big."
00:19:23,00:19:28,They're the biggest wooden ships that have ever existed by a long way. And one thing was discovered
00:19:28,00:19:33,"not too long ago, which was an 11 meter long rudder. And that's one of the most concrete bits"
00:19:33,00:19:38,"of evidence we have for the size of these ships. If I was a 15th century Chinese emperor, I would"
00:19:38,00:19:44,just make a massive rudder to mess with future historians. I think you almost understand their
00:19:44,00:19:51,"ambitions. They're not trying to impress us. The thing I find most amazing about this whole saga,"
00:19:51,00:19:56,"this whole sort of journey that these fleets went on, is the leader of it. So this was a guy"
00:19:56,00:20:02,"called Zhang He, who was basically he was he was a young kid whose father was killed in a war."
00:20:02,00:20:06,"He got taken as prisoner, brought to the emperor's palace in China, made into a eunuch,"
00:20:06,00:20:12,"and just showed amazing skills in the world of warfare. Britannica says he was six foot five,"
00:20:12,00:20:18,"others say he was seven feet tall. And this is a guy, imagine a ship's come in and this seven foot"
00:20:18,00:20:24,giant... So the ships look like small. They were hitting his head. They said his voice was as loud
00:20:24,00:20:31,as a bell. He was by all accounts an extraordinary character. He's got a tiny dinner bell in our
00:20:31,00:20:39,"house. It's just going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. I'm sorry. He paused the show. Oh, I knew"
00:20:39,00:20:42,this had to come out eventually. Is that because your gong is at the repair shop or is it?
00:20:42,00:20:48,"That's a good point because I have been thinking he's going to have this deep booming voice,"
00:20:48,00:20:56,but I've completely forgot he was a eunuch. One of the reasons they think that he was chosen
00:20:56,00:21:01,"is because he was also a Muslim. And they were going, yeah, and they were sailing part of where"
00:21:01,00:21:07,they got to was the Gulf. And so he was going to be in lots of Islamic territory. And so the
00:21:07,00:21:11,"idea is it's a diplomatic mission to go and make contact with these places and basically say,"
00:21:11,00:21:15,"will you acknowledge that China is the best country in the world? And if you do that,"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"we sort of won't take over you. And it was lots of Muslim countries. So, you know,"
00:21:18,00:21:21,"he would have been able to go and be like, hey, I get you and my dad went to Mecca."
00:21:21,00:21:25,"Is China the best? Yes, great. Right. He sounds amazingly impressive,"
00:21:25,00:21:29,"Chang He. And I'm interested also in why their voyages ended, because there's lots of debate"
00:21:29,00:21:34,"about what brought them to an end. One theory is that they're worried about Mongolian invasions,"
00:21:34,00:21:38,"and obviously, Mongolians have paid over land. But another reason they were discontinued,"
00:21:38,00:21:43,"potentially, is that there was a conflict between the Confucians and the eunuchs."
00:21:43,00:21:48,"Yeah. There's this big eunuch power base in the court. And there was a eunuch establishment,"
00:21:48,00:21:51,"partly because it was thought, oh, well, if eunuchs can't have children,"
00:21:51,00:21:55,then they're not going to be seizing power and starting a dynasty.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"That's why they were chosen. That's why they were the court assistants, really, wasn't it?"
00:21:58,00:22:01,"That's what I mean. Yeah, yeah. But for some reason, obviously, that builds up into a powerful"
00:22:01,00:22:06,"bureaucracy. It feels like the movie franchise we're all waiting for, the bureaucrats versus the"
00:22:06,00:22:11,"eunuchs. I mean, it's weird, isn't it? There being this court of eunuchs and then this court of"
00:22:11,00:22:15,"Confucian bureaucrats, and there's war between them. I'm joking for position."
00:22:15,00:22:21,"When Zhong He died, basically, he was the main eunuch. When he died, there was kind of a vacuum"
00:22:21,00:22:25,"in the eunuch world, and it meant that the Confucianists could jump him."
00:22:25,00:22:28,"In addition to the obvious vacuum in the eunuch world, of course."
00:22:28,00:22:35,"And it was a new emperor as well. So Zhong He's emperor, who took him on, had died. A new emperor"
00:22:35,00:22:38,came on. He became part of the expansion of the Great Wall of China. There were lots of different
00:22:38,00:22:44,"projects going on. He talked him into one final adventure going out, and Zhong He died on the"
00:22:44,00:22:48,way back. So then that was kind of it. I think that's it. Kind of like you can't spend all your
00:22:48,00:22:53,"money making a massive wall to stop the Mongolians coming in, and you can't spend the same money"
00:22:53,00:22:57,making massive ships to go to the Muslim lands. You have to choose one or the other.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"We'll tell that to the Labour Party, who apparently aren't even going to raise taxes, James. No, I"
00:23:01,00:23:10,guess. Wow. I can see why you've got a denabel and not a satire bell in your home.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"So yeah, I think the main thing was you say the Confucian bureaucrats, and mostly the bureaucrats"
00:23:13,00:23:18,complained whether it was thick and expensive. And there was one claim that it cost half of the
00:23:18,00:23:22,"tax revenue of a whole year to send them out, which is mad, and probably an exaggeration."
00:23:22,00:23:26,"But also, there's one other theory that they just done what they wanted to do."
00:23:26,00:23:30,"I mean, they got, as far as the East African coast, they got to Somalia. They've shown everyone"
00:23:30,00:23:35,"how good they are. Everyone has said, ""Yeah, you're the best."" Yeah, they've gone, ""Cool. Job done."""
00:23:35,00:23:45,"Zhong He supposedly named the durian fruit. Yeah. Supposedly, he ate it when he was on one of"
00:23:45,00:23:51,"his journeys, and he was so delicious, he forgot where he was, and he stayed there for three days,"
00:23:51,00:23:56,"and then realized, ""Oh, wait a minute. I'm supposed to be doing this three days."""
00:23:56,00:24:00,"And so he went back again, and the name durian means to linger and forget to return."
00:24:00,00:24:07,"Supposedly named by him. And also, he supposedly invented the queenfish."
00:24:07,00:24:14,So the queenfish is like a fish which has got like five spots on it. And the theory goes that
00:24:14,00:24:21,"there was a big storm. There's a hole in his boat. He prays to God, and the storm dissipates,"
00:24:21,00:24:25,and they realize that they haven't sunk because there's a fish in the hole in the boat.
00:24:25,00:24:32,Brilliant. Okay. And it's this queenfish. He takes it out. His five fingerprints go onto the fish
00:24:32,00:24:37,"and forever are on this fish. And for that reason, Chinese people in Malaysia don't eat queenfish,"
00:24:37,00:24:41,although some skeptics point out the fact that it is quite poisonous.
00:24:41,00:24:48,"Just the second best reason not to eat it. Obviously, the Shanghai thing is the main reason"
00:24:48,00:24:53,we don't eat it. There's another thing about these giant ships. They had rigging that was
00:24:53,00:24:58,decorated with yellow flags. The sails were dyed red with henna. The hulls were painted with huge
00:24:58,00:25:04,"elaborate birds, and on the front were large eyes painted onto the bow. So as it was coming towards"
00:25:04,00:25:10,"you, just the sense of a big face heading towards you. I mean, that's what an image. What a striking"
00:25:10,00:25:16,"thing. And a seven foot giant walks off the ship, be like, ""Avatar, have we been invaded? Is it aliens?"""
00:25:18,00:25:25,"Here's a last legacy of the treasure fleets. This is a New York Times report from 1999, right?"
00:25:25,00:25:28,What? One year after the most French thing that has ever happened.
00:25:28,00:25:34,"Two years after the death of Diana. They had a reporter called Nicholas Kristof, right? And he"
00:25:34,00:25:40,"went to this tiny island off the coast of Kenya, which was called, I think it's called Pate, P-A-T-E."
00:25:40,00:25:46,"It might be Pate, it might be Pate. I think it's Pate. It's called Pate. It's pretty squishy ground."
00:25:48,00:25:52,"And he found there a number of elderly men, and they claimed to be Chinese, right? Now they looked"
00:25:52,00:25:56,"like they might have Asian ancestry, East Asian ancestry, and they claimed they'd been there for"
00:25:56,00:26:01,"600 years. Well, they claimed that their ancestors had got there 600 years ago. They claimed that"
00:26:01,00:26:06,they were descended from the sailors of the treasure fleet who'd been shipwrecked on Pate
00:26:06,00:26:11,"600 years ago. And supposedly they had some very ancient porcelain in their home, some"
00:26:13,00:26:18,"which is incredible. It's true, that is unbelievable. I mean, you know, big tongs on that one, but it"
00:26:18,00:26:21,"does sound. But you would have thought you could tell when you go somewhere if someone's, because"
00:26:21,00:26:25,they can't have shacked much outside if they've only been there. Can't we take a swab or something?
00:26:25,00:26:29,"Like, we've got technology now. It might have been pre-swab. I don't know. If anyone listening is"
00:26:29,00:26:35,"in Pate, can you write it and tell us? In return, we'll send you some very small bits of toast."
00:26:35,00:26:42,"Vikings had big ships. Oh, yeah. Famously. I mean, not by comparison."
00:26:42,00:26:45,"But they were also quite decorated, like the ones we were talking about. Yeah, yeah."
00:26:45,00:26:51,You should always realize. But it turns out they had woolen sails. I was just saying that I was
00:26:51,00:26:57,reading about wool today. That's why I bring this up. And there's a traditional handicraft expert
00:26:57,00:27:04,called Amy Lightfoot who decided to try and make a sail like a Viking woolen sail. And she and her
00:27:04,00:27:12,"colleagues had to spin 188,000 meters of yarn to make the sail. It took them three years to complete"
00:27:12,00:27:17,and it used the equivalent of a year's production of wool from 2000 sheep.
00:27:17,00:27:21,Wow. To make a single sail. That's insane.
00:27:21,00:27:27,So how did the Vikings manage to make all these sails? Is there an answer that you can tell us?
00:27:27,00:27:32,"Okay, okay, okay. We can get this. Did they tie together their clothes and make a sort of amusing"
00:27:32,00:27:38,like... Like they're trying to escape from a building. How would they do it?
00:27:38,00:27:42,They had 2000 sheep. They had lots of sheep. They had lots of sheep as half of the answer.
00:27:42,00:27:47,"Okay. And lots of people and lots of time. No telling. Yeah, that's basically all of it. The only"
00:27:47,00:27:53,missing bit is that obviously there were lots of them going on sailing missions. So they didn't
00:27:53,00:27:58,really have time to make the sails. Did they knit as the... So who made the sails? Did they knit as
00:27:58,00:28:02,"they sailed? Let you row and then you knit a little bit. I guess the winds that could make them,"
00:28:02,00:28:08,"they settled. Precisely. It was all the women, basically. All the women would live near the coast"
00:28:08,00:28:12,and they would make all of their sails for the ships. I feel like we were really working our way
00:28:12,00:28:17,"towards a good wrong answer there. I know. I was so more ruined by like... So sorry. Reminding you,"
00:28:17,00:28:22,"women were also existing in times. Actually, just on what you were saying and on women,"
00:28:22,00:28:27,"I was reading about wool earlier today. Oh, gosh. And you know the herring girls, do you remember"
00:28:27,00:28:33,them? Yeah. They were like gut herring and they would start in the north of Scotland because
00:28:33,00:28:38,the herring shoals would come down the coast of England and they would follow the coast because
00:28:38,00:28:43,"they would follow the herring. So as the year went on, they would just like get further and"
00:28:43,00:28:47,further down the coast until they ended up in Great Yarmouth and they would stop off at the
00:28:47,00:28:52,"gutting centres. But as they went, because they were walking this whole way, they would knit as"
00:28:52,00:28:56,they went and then they would sell their goods as they were walking down. So they would do walking
00:28:56,00:29:00,"and knitting, walking and knitting, sell their stuff and then do your gutting and then do walking,"
00:29:00,00:29:04,"knitting, walking, knitting. Do you think it was right? You know when you see someone on their"
00:29:04,00:29:07,"phone walking down the street and you're like, ""Oh, for God's sake, just put it away."" Do you think"
00:29:07,00:29:12,people thought that when they saw them? Yeah. Just admire the scenery for a minute. Do you remember
00:29:12,00:29:18,"we talked about the drovers? Yeah, yeah. Similar. With their magic dogs. Do you remember they walked"
00:29:18,00:29:23,"long knitting as well, didn't they? Well, they had woolen socks for their pigs, didn't they?"
00:29:23,00:29:27,"Yeah, it's quite romantic. The idea of, you know, a drover and a herring girl meeting."
00:29:27,00:29:32,"Yeah, they wouldn't ever meet as close. That's quite a long distance between shoreline"
00:29:32,00:29:36,"and... Yeah, but if you're drovering in from the coast, maybe, I don't know. Maybe you do, yeah."
00:29:36,00:29:40,"Romantic like they accidentally swap balls of yarn and then, ""Oh, no."" And then they got to get"
00:29:40,00:29:43,"back to each other. I just think it's like... I don't know, it's the same ball of yarn and it's"
00:29:43,00:29:46,"like in Lady and the Tramp. It's reverse Lady and the Tramp. They're getting further apart,"
00:29:46,00:29:50,"but connected by the same yarn. James, you're shaking your head. It's the default. It's a break-up"
00:29:50,00:29:56,story. There's a screenplay in this somewhere. He was a drover. She gutted herring for a living.
00:29:56,00:30:02,Can I make it any more obvious? Let's not imply any historical consultants
00:30:02,00:30:05,"when they get this far. No, no, no. Or geographical ones."
00:30:05,00:30:16,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is that the largest"
00:30:16,00:30:22,kettle in Hamburg is called Caroline. This is about a very large kettle called Caroline. Caroline
00:30:22,00:30:27,with a K. Does she get offended if you misspell it? You were quite specific about that.
00:30:27,00:30:33,"So this is because there's a lot of renewable energy being built in Europe at the moment,"
00:30:33,00:30:39,"mostly wind and solar. And it's pretty cheap, especially during sunny or windy hours, basically."
00:30:39,00:30:42,"Prices drop massively. It just gets really, really cheap because there's so much access"
00:30:42,00:30:46,"being produced. And in some cases, the prices get negative because the power has to go"
00:30:46,00:30:50,"somewhere. And so it's kind of not totally ideal because you want to put power to good use,"
00:30:50,00:30:54,"basically, when you're generating it. You just see what I mean. This is all from an article"
00:30:54,00:30:58,in The Economist. And you need to use the power a bit better. You need to link to other countries
00:30:58,00:31:03,"which don't have a surplus at that moment, maybe, or you shift demand. So like everyone charges"
00:31:03,00:31:07,"out their cars in hours where there's lots of power on the grid, whatever. And another option"
00:31:07,00:31:12,"is to boil up the largest kettle in Hamburg, Caroline. Just tease all around. Just tease"
00:31:12,00:31:17,everyone in Hamburg whether they want one or not is getting a cup of tea. This is a giant
00:31:17,00:31:22,"electric kettle, basically. And it turns surplus wind energy into heat. It heats up water using"
00:31:22,00:31:27,"the electricity. And it gets used in, I think, a district heating network, which is like where"
00:31:27,00:31:34,"everyone's hot water comes from Caroline. And sort of 20,000 houses, I think, are on this system."
00:31:34,00:31:39,"So yeah, and that's Caroline. Good honor. I know. And she doesn't look like, you know,"
00:31:39,00:31:43,"she doesn't whistle and she doesn't have a spout and a handle, right? She looks like a big tank,"
00:31:43,00:31:49,"presumably. Basically, a big container of hot water is what I have chosen a kettle is."
00:31:49,00:31:54,"Yeah, fair enough. That's fine. I think that's fine. It heats up to very, very hot. And yeah, nice."
00:31:54,00:32:02,"Renewable energy. Well, I think it's amazing because we're at a point now in history where"
00:32:02,00:32:05,"we're literally looking at everything around us going, how do we turn this renewable? How can"
00:32:05,00:32:09,"we do using this to be? I was reading the other day that there's, in toilets now, there's a thing"
00:32:09,00:32:14,"that they're trialing whereby, how do you create renewable energy off the back of toilets? Oh,"
00:32:14,00:32:18,what if you put in the equivalent of a wind turbine into the pipe for your farts?
00:32:18,00:32:29,"You lean over a fart at the little windmill. Yeah, yeah. That's good. No, it's using the"
00:32:29,00:32:33,idea of the water. It's using the water. Do you mean a watermill? More like a watermill.
00:32:34,00:32:38,"Sorry, I forgot about that. I'm trying to talk to the kids. Sorry,"
00:32:38,00:32:44,"I haven't got allo-lo references to this, but it's basically your flush and it spins and it creates"
00:32:44,00:32:49,energy. Do you have a great idea? I actually came up with this idea quite a few years ago of putting
00:32:49,00:32:55,"many sort of water wheels in everyone's gutters. That's why I thought, I thought it was a brilliant"
00:32:55,00:32:59,"idea that no one had thought of. Right, yeah. And then I never pursued it. And it seems like"
00:32:59,00:33:04,it's actually going to become reality. It's not none of these. We should go back over all the
00:33:04,00:33:09,things quirky renewable energy ideas we've mentioned over the years and look at how many of
00:33:09,00:33:18,"them have come to giant fruition. Big aisle. Sorry, I must clarify here. I am incredibly pro"
00:33:18,00:33:22,"investing huge amounts of money in the big scale ones, but quite a lot of these little"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"ideas are so nice, aren't they? But they can't scale up and you can't like fix them into the"
00:33:25,00:33:30,end. But I reckon they're like a good science fiction idea. They're worth saying out loud
00:33:30,00:33:33,"as much as possible because someone listening out there somewhere will go, that's a great idea."
00:33:33,00:33:38,"Actually, I could do this with that and turn that into I just think as much as it pumped out."
00:33:38,00:33:44,"What happens when a poo gets stuck in the water wheel again? Again, every day, every day."
00:33:44,00:33:48,"Millions of engineers are going to be called out. Yeah. Unaccountably, there's a poo in the water"
00:33:48,00:33:54,wheel again. Here's the thing about kettles. This is crazy. It comes from a book I read recently.
00:33:54,00:33:57,I think I may have mentioned it before. It's called Power Up. It's a great book.
00:33:57,00:34:01,"This is about the world's first ever coal powered public power station, right? Right."
00:34:01,00:34:07,So it was called the Edison Electric Light Station. It was built in London in 1882
00:34:07,00:34:15,and it generated enough electricity power 30 modern kettles. Wow. That is partly it was a
00:34:15,00:34:21,small power station. It's also partly British kettles are world leading. They're just so powerful.
00:34:21,00:34:24,Sounds actually like the dream would be that your kettle didn't use that much power in order to do
00:34:24,00:34:31,"the same thing. Yes. No, no, no, no. You want tea now. That's the point. Did they call this power place"
00:34:31,00:34:37,"Electric Eels? No, they didn't. It was the Edison Electric Light Station. They should have done."
00:34:37,00:34:43,"They should have done, but they didn't. And it generated 93 kilowatts of electricity at one time,"
00:34:43,00:34:47,which was for lights in the local area. Yeah. But basically it's partly a function of just
00:34:47,00:34:52,British kettles being absolutely punishingly powerful. That's the thing we should say to foreign
00:34:52,00:34:57,"listeners, especially Americans, what a kettle is, right? Yeah. Americans don't have kettles."
00:34:57,00:35:00,It's like a saucepan with a lid. Yeah. If you want to make tea with water that's
00:35:00,00:35:05,"more than 40 degrees in temperature and that's Celsius, not your Fahrenheit system."
00:35:05,00:35:10,"You know what? I think if we start a battle with the Americans over tea, then we're only going to lose."
00:35:10,00:35:15,"What do you think? Oh, I see. It's a funny reference. It's a reference to the Boston Tea"
00:35:15,00:35:21,"Party. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very nice. Very lovely. Don't rig that satire bell again."
00:35:22,00:35:28,"Another China fact for this section, the world's largest hydroelectric plant is in China,"
00:35:28,00:35:32,"unsurprisingly. Yeah. Like the world's largest, most things. And it's the Three Gorgeous Dam,"
00:35:32,00:35:36,"which you've probably heard of, and it's obviously massive and... Gorgeous, sorry."
00:35:36,00:35:42,"Sorry? I heard gorgeous. The Three Gorgeous Dam. Well, it is gorgeous. I think it is gorgeous. Yeah, yeah."
00:35:42,00:35:46,"Do you think it's gorgeous, the displacement of over a million people? I don't know."
00:35:46,00:35:49,They would say what about the people living downstream of the Three Gorgeous Dam?
00:35:49,00:35:56,"Andy, oh, I dropped you in that one, mate. Do you think it's gorgeous, the submerged villages?"
00:35:56,00:35:59,"Do you think it's complicated and they have to be trade-offs, Anna?"
00:35:59,00:36:04,"Yeah, I look at them with you, and obviously produces a huge amount of power. But it does"
00:36:04,00:36:10,"slow the earth down. What? Oh, yeah. Really? I think it was NASA who verified this in the end,"
00:36:10,00:36:14,because there are rumors that it slowed down the rotation of the earth and lengthened our day a
00:36:14,00:36:20,"little bit. So, if it's 459 and you're at work looking at your watch right now,"
00:36:20,00:36:27,"you can blame the Three Gorgeous Dam. Yeah. Yeah, it's the dam's fault. Dam it."
00:36:27,00:36:37,"Anyway, it's quite... In fact, kind of everything does that when you move mass around,"
00:36:37,00:36:41,"but it does it to a measurable extent. And so, it's because it's... This huge amount of water"
00:36:41,00:36:48,is being held. It's 39 trillion kilograms of water is held 175 meters high above sea level
00:36:48,00:36:53,"in this dam. So, that's a huge amount of water that's being held quite a big distance from the"
00:36:53,00:36:58,"centre of the earth. Imagine you're spinning round on a chair, right? You're spinning round at a steady"
00:36:58,00:37:04,"speed, and then you get a huge water balloon, and you hold it in your right hand at arm's length."
00:37:04,00:37:07,It's going to slow you down a little bit. And it actually... That is crazy.
00:37:07,00:37:13,"Has slowed us down by 0.06 microseconds, a microsecond being a millionth of a second."
00:37:13,00:37:18,"So, where does that matter most? Like, what business? The Olympics, you know? So,"
00:37:18,00:37:23,Usain Bolt has always just missed out smashing the 100 meters.
00:37:23,00:37:29,"That would be good, wouldn't it, if you could just let the water out at the same time."
00:37:29,00:37:36,"You are all running in the same direction in the 100 meters, I suppose."
00:37:36,00:37:38,"Yes, it's true. There will be a use, I'm sure."
00:37:38,00:37:42,"The next Chinese Olympics, they're taking notes. I can imagine them doing that sort of thing."
00:37:42,00:37:44,But you know that got proposed in 1919.
00:37:44,00:37:47,"Well, they drain the dam just to help someone win 100 meters of sprint."
00:37:47,00:37:52,"The building of the dam was proposed by Sun Yat-sen, first president of China."
00:37:52,00:37:58,"Really? Yeah. And it took... It was partly because they got insane floods about once every decade,"
00:37:58,00:38:02,"that were just totally destructive. So, it was partly that and partly for electricity."
00:38:03,00:38:08,"And the water that they store up there gets dropped through tubes and turned a turbine,"
00:38:08,00:38:15,"much like Dan's toilet idea. But it drops 185 meters, which is two statues of liberty in height."
00:38:15,00:38:21,"Like, it really is... And it generates so much power. It's just extraordinary. I think it's 20%"
00:38:21,00:38:24,of China's electricity. It's a lot. It comes from hydro power.
00:38:24,00:38:26,And China's big. And China's big.
00:38:26,00:38:29,"And they had... Also, the construction of it, they had to divert the entire Yangtze River"
00:38:30,00:38:34,while they built the dam. Imagine. It's just... It's stunning.
00:38:34,00:38:38,"Yeah, it's good. I can see who the propaganda is working on, Andy."
00:38:38,00:38:40,Is China the best country?
00:38:40,00:38:47,"For this? Yes. So, there's another heating plan operating at the moment, because waste heat is"
00:38:47,00:38:52,"like massive. Like, waste heat, if it can be used, would be an enormous resource."
00:38:52,00:38:57,"So, there is currently a project going on. You know, when you're somewhere cold and you get those"
00:38:58,00:39:01,"little hand warmers where you snap a coin. Yes, I do know those."
00:39:01,00:39:03,"And it heats up. So, yeah, it's like this jelly..."
00:39:03,00:39:04,Use them on the golf course.
00:39:04,00:39:08,"Yeah, it's got like stored heat and you snap the coin, this little metal thing in it."
00:39:08,00:39:12,I always thought it's like two little chemicals sort of mixed together.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"And then that heats, it's an exothermic reaction."
00:39:14,00:39:17,"That's exactly it. And then you can put the heat back in. Like, you can reheat it."
00:39:17,00:39:18,And it's sort of...
00:39:18,00:39:19,"Oh, that's amazing."
00:39:19,00:39:22,"Those things only last about, like, 40 times, right, those little hand warmers."
00:39:22,00:39:27,But there is a system currently being worked on to charge thermal batteries from...
00:39:28,00:39:29,"Like, places where they burn rubbish, for example."
00:39:29,00:39:34,And then transport the heat back into the centre of London
00:39:34,00:39:36,and use the heat there where it's needed.
00:39:36,00:39:36,Right.
00:39:36,00:39:40,"Like, really creative things that are being proposed to deal with energy loss."
00:39:40,00:39:41,"Using burning rubbish, basically."
00:39:41,00:39:46,"Well, that's already used. For example, maybe you'd only generate a bit of electricity from that."
00:39:46,00:39:48,But it gives off a lot of waste heat in the process.
00:39:48,00:39:49,That's amazing.
00:39:49,00:39:56,"Catch that. Well, similarly, if you swim in redditch in the Abbey Stadium Leisure Centre,"
00:39:57,00:40:01,"anyone who's ever done that, you are being heated by dead bodies from the crematorium."
00:40:01,00:40:03,And they came up with the idea in...
00:40:03,00:40:05,I think it was 2012 that they started implementing it.
00:40:05,00:40:09,And it saves 40% on the Leisure Centre's energy bills.
00:40:09,00:40:11,Because it's so much cheaper.
00:40:11,00:40:15,"And, you know, what a useful thing to contribute in your last moments on this earth."
00:40:15,00:40:18,"They're doing this system in Sweden, by the way, as well."
00:40:18,00:40:22,But it's actually crematoriums that are using it to heat their own crematoriums.
00:40:22,00:40:24,"So if you're waiting in a crematorium, yeah, yeah."
00:40:24,00:40:27,"You don't need that. I mean, having been into a crematorium,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,it's like a room. How much heat do you need?
00:40:29,00:40:31,"Oh, there's a waiting room. There's the front desk."
00:40:31,00:40:32,You've got a person gone off this.
00:40:32,00:40:33,You've got a whole system there.
00:40:33,00:40:34,What country is this in?
00:40:34,00:40:36,Sweden. Sweden gets very cold then.
00:40:36,00:40:38,"Does get colder there, yeah, fair enough."
00:40:38,00:40:38,Yeah.
00:40:38,00:40:40,So they're using that.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"I love, just by the way, Andy, that thing you said with the coin that you snapped."
00:40:42,00:40:44,That technology is going wild at the moment.
00:40:44,00:40:48,I was at an arcade down the road from where I live.
00:40:48,00:40:51,And my son had enough tickets to win a prize.
00:40:51,00:40:53,And he got an inflatable hammer.
00:40:53,00:40:54,"And instead of having to blow it up,"
00:40:54,00:40:56,you just snap a thing inside it now and inflate.
00:40:56,00:40:58,"Yeah, okay."
00:40:58,00:41:01,I was not on board with this anecdote until I heard the end of it.
00:41:01,00:41:02,And I'm so on board with it.
00:41:02,00:41:05,And somebody's had to blow up lots of inflates in the last year or so.
00:41:05,00:41:08,"Yeah, this giant hammer that you don't do anything to,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,other than snapping a thing in the middle.
00:41:10,00:41:12,"I asked the guy behind the counter and he was like, I don't know, mate."
00:41:12,00:41:19,I didn't actually construct everything you see.
00:41:19,00:41:21,I'm not Wallace for Wallace and Gromit.
00:41:22,00:41:23,That's the first thing I do.
00:41:23,00:41:25,"I'd be like, hello, how do these hammers inflate?"
00:41:25,00:41:28,I really do just operate the till and I open up and close the shop at night.
00:41:28,00:41:33,Can I do a quick facts on Caroline before we move on?
00:41:33,00:41:33,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:41:33,00:41:36,Because that was the name of this so-called kettle.
00:41:36,00:41:42,Do you remember a few days ago when England won the Euros?
00:41:42,00:41:47,And we all sang sweet Caroline.
00:41:47,00:41:51,"Yeah, my Prime Minister Farage came out to shake the hands of the boys."
00:41:51,00:41:54,We're both recording in the past and in a parallel universe.
00:41:54,00:41:57,So we recorded this before the Euros.
00:41:57,00:42:03,"But at the time of recording, we had just absolutely battered Slovakia"
00:42:03,00:42:06,to one after extra time.
00:42:06,00:42:08,"And we did sing sweet Caroline, or the England fans did."
00:42:08,00:42:13,"And sweet Caroline is written by Neil Diamond about his wife, Marsha."
00:42:13,00:42:18,And he called it Caroline because Marsha doesn't scan the tune.
00:42:19,00:42:24,But what's interesting is that the reason England sings sweet Caroline is there was
00:42:24,00:42:28,"a DJ at Wembley Stadium called Tony Perry, who was supposed to play something else."
00:42:28,00:42:32,And he played sweet Caroline before the game and it had gone really well.
00:42:32,00:42:35,"And so after England won, this was against Germany."
00:42:35,00:42:37,"He thought, well, I'm going to play it again."
00:42:37,00:42:39,And he played it again and it really kind of took off.
00:42:39,00:42:44,"And when the women's football team won the Euros, whenever that was a few years ago,"
00:42:44,00:42:47,it was the big sort of song for them.
00:42:47,00:42:49,And it is the big song for England teams now.
00:42:49,00:42:55,"And this guy, Tony Perry, he's said something really interesting in an interview,"
00:42:55,00:42:58,which is like he's quite important for the team.
00:42:58,00:43:04,"Because if you imagine like England played Denmark a few years ago and there were 15 minutes left,"
00:43:04,00:43:05,England are winning.
00:43:05,00:43:07,They have the halftime of extra time.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"The fans again, really nervous."
00:43:09,00:43:14,The nerves of the fans can kind of go to the nerves of the players and it can kind of affect the game.
00:43:14,00:43:17,But what he can do is he can get the fans going
00:43:17,00:43:21,and he would play Freeford Desire by whoever that's by.
00:43:21,00:43:23,It's like a real proper dance anthem.
00:43:23,00:43:25,The crowd go absolutely mad.
00:43:25,00:43:30,"The crowd are suddenly really, really infused and that helps the team to do the job."
00:43:30,00:43:34,So actually the DJ who's at the football stadium can affect the game.
00:43:34,00:43:35,"Can alter the game, that's amazing."
00:43:35,00:43:37,I didn't know they had DJs in football stadiums.
00:43:37,00:43:38,"Yeah, they do."
00:43:38,00:43:39,But where do they set up?
00:43:39,00:43:41,"They're going to annoy the people on either side of them, aren't they?"
00:43:43,00:43:47,"They're not in decks in the middle of the pitch, they're just in a little booth in there."
00:43:47,00:43:53,So if England does lose and you want to take out some steam of your own sort of anger.
00:43:53,00:43:54,You mean in the next world?
00:43:54,00:43:55,Obviously we won't be able to.
00:43:55,00:43:58,"In the next World Cup, yeah, find the DJ and kick the shit out of them."
00:43:58,00:44:00,Didn't do his job.
00:44:00,00:44:03,I thought it was all chanting the referees of anchor and stuff like that.
00:44:03,00:44:05,Is that gone out these days?
00:44:05,00:44:08,"Well, during halftime, you don't just sit there shouting the referee."
00:44:08,00:44:09,"I mean, the referee's having a cup of tea."
00:44:09,00:44:12,"You can't hear anything, there's no point."
00:44:12,00:44:13,"Okay, that's interesting."
00:44:13,00:44:14,But then they'll play music.
00:44:14,00:44:16,They'll play loads of music.
00:44:16,00:44:19,And there's specific DJs whose job it is to do all these big events.
00:44:19,00:44:23,And they'll do the Super Bowl and do the World Cup and all that kind of stuff.
00:44:23,00:44:26,And they make their living by knowing what will get the crowd going.
00:44:26,00:44:27,That's interesting.
00:44:27,00:44:28,Do they take requests?
00:44:28,00:44:31,"Can I pop to the booth and say, could you please be a bit quiet?"
00:44:31,00:44:40,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:44:40,00:44:42,And that is my fact.
00:44:42,00:44:45,"My fact this week is that the classic textbook,"
00:44:45,00:44:49,"The Art of Editing, was co-written by Jack Scissors."
00:44:49,00:44:51,Very good.
00:44:51,00:44:52,"Yeah, that's great."
00:44:52,00:44:53,It's 432 pages.
00:44:53,00:44:57,"It was 434, though, before Jack got involved."
00:44:57,00:45:03,"Do you know that in the old newspapers, when they were editing,"
00:45:03,00:45:08,is they used to use scissors because big part of making your newspaper
00:45:08,00:45:11,was you would take all the stories from all the other newspapers
00:45:11,00:45:15,and you would cut them up and then you would put them on a sheet of paper
00:45:15,00:45:18,to make sure that they all fit it in the right place.
00:45:18,00:45:22,And then you would send them to your printer who would then print them.
00:45:22,00:45:25,"Hang on, that implies that to do your newspaper,"
00:45:25,00:45:27,you're just taking other stories from other newspapers.
00:45:27,00:45:29,What are the first newspapers?
00:45:29,00:45:31,"Well, they borrowed from your edition yesterday."
00:45:31,00:45:34,That's basically kind of how it works.
00:45:34,00:45:36,"So if you're a national newspaper,"
00:45:36,00:45:39,you would take it from the towns and stuff like that.
00:45:39,00:45:42,"In the really early days, there were things called avici,"
00:45:42,00:45:45,which were like newsletters that were sent round people
00:45:45,00:45:46,and then they would be all sent to the newspaper
00:45:46,00:45:48,and they would cut those up.
00:45:48,00:45:51,"But actually, all the newspapers would just copy off each other a lot of the time."
00:45:51,00:45:54,"And obviously, you had to have someone who wrote it originally,"
00:45:54,00:45:57,"but there were so many newspapers and so many pages to fill,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,you wouldn't have enough reporters to do all that.
00:45:59,00:46:00,So you did have to do that.
00:46:00,00:46:03,And you would usually credit wherever you got it from.
00:46:03,00:46:08,"In the same way that today, it would say this is an associated press report"
00:46:08,00:46:10,that is in the BBC or whatever.
00:46:10,00:46:12,"And that was really, really common."
00:46:12,00:46:14,"That's amazing because if you got something just completely wrong,"
00:46:14,00:46:16,"usually you'd think as a local newspaper,"
00:46:16,00:46:19,"you go, ""Well, at least only a couple of thousand people saw that."""
00:46:19,00:46:23,"Suddenly, it's global news, literally by the name of it."
00:46:23,00:46:26,"There was the Charlotte News, this was in 1902."
00:46:26,00:46:27,"So towards the end of when they were doing this,"
00:46:27,00:46:32,but they set up a trap saying that there was a gang of anarchists
00:46:32,00:46:36,in the Vladivostok who were going to kill all of the prominent rulers on the globe.
00:46:36,00:46:41,And the leader was Count Robgian Ruomoth Lyetsu.
00:46:41,00:46:46,"And if you read that backwards, it says, ""We steal from our neighbour."""
00:46:46,00:46:47,"Oh, very good."
00:46:47,00:46:53,"That method of cutting out and arranging on the page,"
00:46:53,00:46:56,"that survived Private Eye Magazine, where I work, also."
00:46:56,00:46:58,I took quite recently.
00:46:58,00:46:58,Yeah?
00:46:58,00:47:00,"Oh, is that done now?"
00:47:00,00:47:02,No longer. It has gone out now.
00:47:02,00:47:04,But it's during my time working there.
00:47:04,00:47:05,I think that it stopped.
00:47:05,00:47:07,I one day popped into the office while you were there
00:47:07,00:47:08,and you showed me how it was laid out.
00:47:08,00:47:09,It was fascinating.
00:47:09,00:47:12,"And sometimes, if someone picks up one of the finished pages,"
00:47:12,00:47:14,"carries it across the room, there is a bow or everyone goes,"
00:47:14,00:47:17,"""Oh, just no one coughed to that like it really."""
00:47:17,00:47:18,Yeah.
00:47:18,00:47:20,So scissors.
00:47:20,00:47:20,Yeah.
00:47:20,00:47:21,Scissors.
00:47:21,00:47:21,Scissors.
00:47:21,00:47:24,I was looking into a few words around the world
00:47:24,00:47:26,for what scissors are in different languages.
00:47:26,00:47:27,"Oh, yeah, that's a good idea."
00:47:27,00:47:28,It's quite fun.
00:47:29,00:47:33,So the Māori for scissors is kāti kāti or kūti kūti.
00:47:33,00:47:34,"German, Andy, you speak German."
00:47:34,00:47:36,Do you know what scissors are?
00:47:36,00:47:37,"Is something, isn't it shais?"
00:47:37,00:47:38,It's like shia.
00:47:38,00:47:39,"Yeah, shia, yeah."
00:47:39,00:47:40,So like shearing has a…
00:47:40,00:47:41,"Say it in English, I guess."
00:47:41,00:47:42,Shias.
00:47:42,00:47:43,This is the most interesting one.
00:47:43,00:47:45,Hungarian word for it is olo.
00:47:45,00:47:46,Olo.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Yeah.
00:47:47,00:47:48,"Now, why is that interesting?"
00:47:48,00:47:50,Is it because it looks like a pair of scissors?
00:47:50,00:47:51,It looks like a pair of scissors.
00:47:51,00:47:54,"Yeah, is that why it's called that or not?"
00:47:54,00:47:55,"Well, that's what that's…"
00:47:55,00:47:56,"Actually, what you've drawn looks like a penis."
00:47:56,00:48:00,That's a pair of cheeky testicles on the other side.
00:48:00,00:48:02,Is that great?
00:48:02,00:48:03,"Yeah, good on them."
00:48:03,00:48:04,That isn't presumably why it's called that.
00:48:04,00:48:05,"No, I don't think so."
00:48:05,00:48:06,I think it might.
00:48:06,00:48:10,"I mean, but it's hard to think that that's not why it's called that."
00:48:10,00:48:11,They're still made in the UK.
00:48:11,00:48:12,Scissors.
00:48:12,00:48:13,Scissors aren't.
00:48:13,00:48:15,"Yeah, but lots of manufacturing's gone elsewhere."
00:48:15,00:48:19,"In Sheffield, bingo, there used to be, in Sheffield,"
00:48:19,00:48:22,"40,000 workers in the scissors and cutlery trade."
00:48:22,00:48:23,Mostly cutlery.
00:48:23,00:48:24,Mostly cutlery.
00:48:24,00:48:25,But some scissors too.
00:48:25,00:48:29,"And obviously, a lot of them aren't in business anymore,"
00:48:29,00:48:32,but I think there might still be two.
00:48:32,00:48:35,"There's Whiteley, who've been going since 1760, at least,"
00:48:35,00:48:37,and there's also Ernest Wright and Son.
00:48:37,00:48:40,"They have two, what they're called, master putter-togetherers."
00:48:40,00:48:43,Is their job literally…
00:48:43,00:48:43,That's the title.
00:48:43,00:48:47,That is what the title is for anyone who does the job of putting scissors together.
00:48:47,00:48:49,They'll put her together.
00:48:49,00:48:50,"And they're proper, you know, they're metal,"
00:48:50,00:48:52,"all the way, handle, blade, everything."
00:48:52,00:48:53,They're sort of proper…
00:48:53,00:48:54,"Stay in the steel, I guess."
00:48:54,00:48:55,Yeah.
00:48:55,00:48:58,And there was a brilliant video in 2014 showing the trade
00:48:58,00:48:59,and how it still operated.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"So I don't know if this guy is still working there anymore,"
00:49:01,00:49:03,because he'd been there about 50 years when this was made.
00:49:03,00:49:05,So he probably isn't still there now.
00:49:05,00:49:07,"But he, one of the two master putter-togetherers,"
00:49:07,00:49:09,was called Eric Stones.
00:49:09,00:49:13,"Now, you would have wet stones in there."
00:49:13,00:49:14,"Yeah, just show them."
00:49:14,00:49:15,"Oh, I was thinking…"
00:49:15,00:49:15,Grind stones.
00:49:15,00:49:17,"I was thinking like, rock, paper, scissors."
00:49:17,00:49:18,What's another word for rock?
00:49:18,00:49:19,"Oh, I see."
00:49:19,00:49:19,A stone.
00:49:19,00:49:19,A stone.
00:49:19,00:49:19,A stone.
00:49:19,00:49:21,"Do you, does anyone ever say stone, paper, scissors?"
00:49:21,00:49:23,"Yeah, and in other countries."
00:49:23,00:49:24,There we go.
00:49:24,00:49:26,I did see a story of someone trying to rob a shoe shop
00:49:26,00:49:27,with a stone.
00:49:27,00:49:29,But the person behind the counter…
00:49:29,00:49:30,That's some paper.
00:49:30,00:49:31,"No, had some scissors."
00:49:31,00:49:32,"Oh, sorry."
00:49:32,00:49:34,But the story made it into the papers.
00:49:34,00:49:36,So you've got all three there.
00:49:36,00:49:39,"Anyway, Sheffield, yes, did used to make even more exciting scissors."
00:49:39,00:49:42,They made the smallest pair of scissors in the world
00:49:42,00:49:43,in the 19th century.
00:49:43,00:49:43,Did they?
00:49:43,00:49:44,"Yeah, they did."
00:49:44,00:49:45,So they claimed…
00:49:45,00:49:48,"Was it for cutting something very small, or was it just for fun?"
00:49:48,00:49:49,I think it was just for fun.
00:49:49,00:49:53,"And to entertain the royal family, they went to show them all."
00:49:53,00:49:55,Britain's chief industry until the mid-20th century
00:49:55,00:49:57,was just doing things to impress the Queen.
00:49:57,00:49:59,It was actually the 1820s.
00:49:59,00:50:01,So it was King George IV.
00:50:01,00:50:04,And the manufacturer was Joseph Rogers and Sons.
00:50:04,00:50:06,And they took some tiny scissors to show George IV.
00:50:06,00:50:09,"And according to Sheffield museums,"
00:50:09,00:50:10,"they dropped them on its carpet,"
00:50:10,00:50:11,and they were so small that they were never found.
00:50:11,00:50:13,"No, get out."
00:50:13,00:50:17,They're still there on the floor of Focke and Palace.
00:50:17,00:50:18,"That's a risk, isn't it?"
00:50:18,00:50:20,"You know, you don't want to walk around barefoot, do you?"
00:50:20,00:50:20,No.
00:50:20,00:50:23,You want to be in a carpet where you know there's a pair of scissors here somewhere.
00:50:23,00:50:24,That's why the royals are always wearing shoes.
00:50:24,00:50:30,From small scissors to large scissors.
00:50:30,00:50:31,I didn't know this.
00:50:31,00:50:34,"But often, you know those large scissors that you get"
00:50:34,00:50:36,when someone's unvaving something?
00:50:36,00:50:38,"Oh, yeah, the novelty of cutting a ribbon."
00:50:38,00:50:38,Ribbon cuts it.
00:50:38,00:50:40,"They don't look very sharp, though."
00:50:40,00:50:41,I don't think they are.
00:50:41,00:50:41,No.
00:50:41,00:50:42,I think… I don't know.
00:50:42,00:50:43,"Oh, they're sharp enough for a ribbon."
00:50:43,00:50:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:50:44,00:50:47,Ribbons really aren't that hard to cut.
00:50:47,00:50:49,They can't do micro-surgery or anything like that.
00:50:49,00:50:50,But why would you want them to?
00:50:50,00:50:52,"But normally, they're…"
00:50:52,00:50:54,Your doctor brought those out during micro-surgery.
00:50:54,00:50:57,The last thing you see is you're doing the couch for the anesthesia.
00:50:57,00:50:59,"Five, six, what the fuck?"
00:50:59,00:51:05,"But normally, you hire them."
00:51:05,00:51:09,I guess because why on earth would you want to keep a two-foot-long pair of scissors?
00:51:09,00:51:10,It's just…
00:51:10,00:51:12,There can't be many in the country.
00:51:12,00:51:13,"There aren't many in the country, James."
00:51:13,00:51:14,I'm so glad.
00:51:14,00:51:17,"So, in the UK, there's unveiling curtains.co.uk."
00:51:17,00:51:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:51:18,00:51:22,And they say no unveiling ceremony is complete without a pair of our giant ceremony ribbon
00:51:22,00:51:23,scissors.
00:51:23,00:51:25,"But in America, there's goldenopenings.com."
00:51:25,00:51:27,"Oh, I saw their website, really great."
00:51:27,00:51:29,"Yeah, and Goldenert, what were you googling when you found that?"
00:51:29,00:51:33,But they are 40 inches long.
00:51:33,00:51:36,They advertise themselves as the largest working scissors in the world.
00:51:36,00:51:40,Someone who apparently keeps scissors on them at all times is…
00:51:40,00:51:42,A hairdresser.
00:51:42,00:51:47,"A hairdresser, yes, in this very specific case, Richard Branson."
00:51:47,00:51:48,Oh.
00:51:48,00:51:50,This is such an odd thing that he does.
00:51:50,00:51:53,He hates when people are a bit too formal.
00:51:53,00:51:55,He thinks that businesses should be relaxed.
00:51:55,00:51:57,"He's often asked by CEOs, ""How can I make my business more relaxed?"""
00:51:57,00:52:01,"If he sees anyone around the table with a tie on, he gets his scissors out."
00:52:01,00:52:02,He goes over and he cuts their tie off.
00:52:02,00:52:04,"And he says, ""Everyone laughs."
00:52:04,00:52:06,"Everyone has a great old time."""
00:52:06,00:52:06,But that's his thing.
00:52:06,00:52:09,I'm sure they'll continue laughing when he's left the room.
00:52:09,00:52:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:52:10,00:52:11,I don't just call him a wanker.
00:52:11,00:52:12,Yeah.
00:52:12,00:52:14,I must have said this tie was given to me by my grandfather.
00:52:16,00:52:17,Does he have special…
00:52:17,00:52:18,They must be quite sharp scissors.
00:52:18,00:52:19,I'm sure they are.
00:52:19,00:52:20,But…
00:52:20,00:52:21,"You know, how strong are you?"
00:52:21,00:52:22,Do you have ties made of wood?
00:52:22,00:52:27,"No, to cut through a tie in a single amusing chief executive gesture."
00:52:27,00:52:28,It's quite…
00:52:28,00:52:30,He must have killed thousands of underlings.
00:52:30,00:52:34,"I do have a tie made of wood, like a bow tie made of wood out of cork."
00:52:34,00:52:34,Of course you do.
00:52:34,00:52:37,"But I think if I ever meet Richard Branson, I'm going to wear it"
00:52:37,00:52:39,and see how strong a scissors really is.
00:52:39,00:52:40,Exactly.
00:52:40,00:52:44,There's a pair of scissors that I've only ever used three times.
00:52:45,00:52:45,What are they?
00:52:45,00:52:48,I know what they are.
00:52:48,00:52:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:52:49,00:52:50,Unfilical cord scissors.
00:52:50,00:52:51,I don't own them myself.
00:52:51,00:52:52,I've only ever used them.
00:52:52,00:52:56,"But yeah, umbilical scissors, which I have used three times"
00:52:56,00:52:58,because I have three kids in hospital.
00:52:58,00:52:59,"Okay, you haven't used the same."
00:52:59,00:53:01,It's not like you bought some especially.
00:53:01,00:53:02,"No, they're labelled…"
00:53:02,00:53:03,They're hanging up in the hospital and they're labelled
00:53:03,00:53:04,"""property of defibrillation""."
00:53:04,00:53:05,Do not touch.
00:53:05,00:53:07,He will be back for another one soon.
00:53:07,00:53:10,"Yeah, I used the ones that were in the hospital."
00:53:10,00:53:12,I was asked if I'd want to cut the umbilical cord.
00:53:12,00:53:13,But did you say…
00:53:13,00:53:14,Did you say yes every time?
00:53:14,00:53:17,"I would say yes because I was like, ""Why would I… why?"""
00:53:17,00:53:18,"Oh, right."
00:53:18,00:53:19,Everyone said yes.
00:53:19,00:53:20,"Why would I, though?"
00:53:20,00:53:23,Why would I want to do something that a professional can do?
00:53:23,00:53:24,Will you offer the chance?
00:53:24,00:53:24,"Yeah, of course."
00:53:24,00:53:25,I think they always offer the chance.
00:53:25,00:53:27,I frequently will sneak into hospitals
00:53:27,00:53:29,and ask if I can pretend to use…
00:53:29,00:53:32,"Like, ""Oh, when the time comes, can I do the cutting?"""
00:53:32,00:53:33,You're subbed in.
00:53:33,00:53:34,You're there on the sidelines.
00:53:34,00:53:34,Yeah.
00:53:34,00:53:36,Is it quite thick and so grisly?
00:53:36,00:53:37,It is.
00:53:37,00:53:39,It's a bit odd and you're a bit nervous when you're doing it
00:53:39,00:53:41,"because you think, ""What if I get this wrong?"""
00:53:41,00:53:43,Nothing can happen.
00:53:43,00:53:44,"Well, you don't know that in the moment."
00:53:44,00:53:46,"Unless you get really wrong and like,"
00:53:46,00:53:47,"""Shop your baby's willy off,"" or something."
00:53:47,00:53:48,Yeah.
00:53:48,00:53:50,That's not the umbilical cord.
00:53:50,00:53:53,It was a very well endowed baby.
00:53:53,00:53:56,That's so funny.
00:53:56,00:53:57,"No, but you can…"
00:53:57,00:53:58,I looked online.
00:53:58,00:54:01,You can buy from Amazon umbilical cord scissors
00:54:01,00:54:03,"to use on your own at home,"
00:54:03,00:54:04,"say for home births, right?"
00:54:04,00:54:04,No.
00:54:04,00:54:06,That would be good if you were opening
00:54:06,00:54:08,a new wing of a maternity ward.
00:54:08,00:54:11,"You could, like, instead of a ribbon,"
00:54:11,00:54:13,you could have an umbilical cord.
00:54:13,00:54:14,"So if you have a newborn baby,"
00:54:14,00:54:16,just slowly pull away from your mother.
00:54:16,00:54:18,Your mother just after birth.
00:54:18,00:54:18,Sorry.
00:54:18,00:54:21,Do you mind if we just move you to the ceremony room?
00:54:21,00:54:23,It's the grand opening.
00:54:23,00:54:23,Yeah.
00:54:23,00:54:26,But is there anything special about them
00:54:26,00:54:29,except a gimmick to get money out of people on Amazon?
00:54:29,00:54:29,These are used.
00:54:29,00:54:30,These are used.
00:54:30,00:54:32,Are they any more special then?
00:54:32,00:54:33,"Oh, they're specially shaped."
00:54:33,00:54:34,They're different types of scissors.
00:54:34,00:54:36,"Yeah, to what you don't use, your classic scissors."
00:54:36,00:54:37,"Oh, I think they're sort of curved."
00:54:37,00:54:38,I think they're sort of curved.
00:54:38,00:54:39,I thought they just need to be sharp.
00:54:39,00:54:39,Really?
00:54:39,00:54:41,"No, I think they're slightly curved"
00:54:41,00:54:42,"and, like, half moon-shaped."
00:54:42,00:54:42,Yes.
00:54:42,00:54:43,Are they?
00:54:43,00:54:44,"But, yeah, I had a one-star review."
00:54:44,00:54:47,This main pair that comes up.
00:54:47,00:54:49,"Wait, is it one-star?"
00:54:49,00:54:50,Baby's still attached.
00:54:50,00:54:51,He's four years old now.
00:54:51,00:54:55,"Yeah, it basically said does not cut well."
00:54:55,00:54:58,"Stiff to use needed several attempts to cut,"
00:54:58,00:55:00,which is a bit terrifying.
00:55:00,00:55:01,But I was trying to look into them.
00:55:01,00:55:03,"This is a very random tangent,"
00:55:03,00:55:04,"but I discovered a guy who said,"
00:55:04,00:55:05,"""Hey, when you're in the hospital"
00:55:05,00:55:08,"and you are offered to cut the baby's umbilical cord,"
00:55:08,00:55:10,why not suggest biting it off
00:55:10,00:55:12,"instead of using the scissors?"""
00:55:12,00:55:13,And Brian Blessed.
00:55:13,00:55:14,Like Brian Blessed's style.
00:55:14,00:55:14,That's right.
00:55:14,00:55:16,He did that in a park.
00:55:16,00:55:17,"Well, he did it when he said that he did."
00:55:17,00:55:18,He said that he did.
00:55:18,00:55:20,But this guy said that he did.
00:55:20,00:55:21,"He said, ""I went in."
00:55:21,00:55:24,"I said to them, 'Is it cool if I do the umbilical cutting?'"
00:55:24,00:55:27,"He believed that because I started the baby with my seed,"
00:55:27,00:55:29,this is me ending the process
00:55:29,00:55:31,"by using my mouth to bite into it."""
00:55:31,00:55:32,It's a bit.
00:55:32,00:55:33,"He said it tastes like calamari,"
00:55:33,00:55:34,the rubbery kind of...
00:55:34,00:55:35,It wouldn't taste like calamari.
00:55:35,00:55:36,"Yes, it tastes like blood."
00:55:36,00:55:38,"Yes, his wife was a squid."
00:55:38,00:55:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:55:42,00:55:44,Were you watching My Octopus Keeper
00:55:44,00:55:45,or whatever that thing is?
00:55:45,00:55:46,Yeah.
00:55:46,00:55:46,"No, no."
00:55:46,00:55:47,"He said it was basically like blood,"
00:55:47,00:55:50,"iron-like, the texture of it was calamari-like."
00:55:50,00:55:54,"And apparently, if you ask, they might say yes."
00:55:54,00:55:55,So if anyone fancies it...
00:55:55,00:55:56,Worth asking.
00:55:56,00:55:57,Worth asking.
00:55:57,00:55:59,"They'll think you're a real weirdo,"
00:55:59,00:56:00,but they might say yes.
00:56:00,00:56:02,Can I give you a riddle?
00:56:02,00:56:02,Yeah.
00:56:02,00:56:03,Okay.
00:56:03,00:56:04,2017.
00:56:04,00:56:05,Yes.
00:56:05,00:56:05,Right.
00:56:05,00:56:06,There's a guy in Vietnam.
00:56:07,00:56:08,He's 54 years old.
00:56:08,00:56:09,He has a road accident.
00:56:09,00:56:10,Yeah.
00:56:10,00:56:12,And there's...
00:56:12,00:56:14,This is not a good riddle.
00:56:14,00:56:16,There seems to be something sharp
00:56:16,00:56:18,inside his stomach.
00:56:18,00:56:18,Is it scissors?
00:56:18,00:56:20,I could wait.
00:56:20,00:56:21,Now I haven't finished the riddle.
00:56:21,00:56:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:23,00:56:25,He'd recently been to fucking a palace
00:56:25,00:56:26,and was licking the carpet.
00:56:26,00:56:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:30,00:56:31,Is that how they get...
00:56:31,00:56:32,The fucking impan is clean.
00:56:32,00:56:32,Yeah.
00:56:32,00:56:33,"He says, ""This happens."
00:56:33,00:56:35,"I have to lick the floors."""
00:56:35,00:56:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:36,00:56:37,"Oh, that's the deep clean."
00:56:37,00:56:40,"No, in the second hospital scant him,"
00:56:40,00:56:42,and they found a six-inch pair of scissors
00:56:42,00:56:42,inside him.
00:56:42,00:56:43,Okay.
00:56:43,00:56:46,Which had been there since 1998.
00:56:46,00:56:47,"Oh, did he have an operation?"
00:56:47,00:56:50,The year of the most French thing
00:56:50,00:56:52,that has ever happened.
00:56:52,00:56:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:52,00:56:54,The year after Diana died.
00:56:54,00:56:56,"The surgeon said, ""Sacre bleu!"""
00:56:56,00:56:58,Because he was actually watching
00:56:58,00:56:59,the World Cup at the same time.
00:56:59,00:57:02,"No, 19 years."
00:57:02,00:57:05,This guy had had a six-inch pair of scissors
00:57:05,00:57:07,"inside him and had had a little bit of stomach pain,"
00:57:07,00:57:09,but basically nothing else.
00:57:09,00:57:10,Isn't that just...
00:57:10,00:57:11,Six inches is long.
00:57:11,00:57:13,And is it from having an operation
00:57:13,00:57:14,and someone dropped it in?
00:57:14,00:57:14,"Yes, it was."
00:57:14,00:57:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:57:16,00:57:17,So the riddle is a bad one.
00:57:17,00:57:18,Please forget the riddle element.
00:57:18,00:57:20,But I just think that's stunning
00:57:20,00:57:23,"that he'd had a previous road accident in 1998,"
00:57:23,00:57:25,had an operation for it.
00:57:25,00:57:26,"They'd left the scissors in and then,"
00:57:26,00:57:27,and they only found it
00:57:27,00:57:28,as a result of the second road accident.
00:57:28,00:57:29,Right.
00:57:29,00:57:29,So that's kind of pleasing.
00:57:29,00:57:31,I think if you're a surgeon
00:57:31,00:57:33,"and you need to put down the scissors for a second,"
00:57:33,00:57:34,Yeah.
00:57:34,00:57:34,Put them on a tray.
00:57:34,00:57:35,Yeah.
00:57:35,00:57:35,Yeah.
00:57:35,00:57:36,Absolutely.
00:57:36,00:57:37,Don't put it on someone's spleen.
00:57:37,00:57:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:57:38,00:57:39,"Well, that was the gross thing."
00:57:39,00:57:41,They had rusted and they had become stuck
00:57:41,00:57:42,to his nearby organs
00:57:42,00:57:43,because they'd been there so long.
00:57:43,00:57:44,"Yeah, that's going to make him super sick."
00:57:44,00:57:46,He was all right.
00:57:46,00:57:46,Was he?
00:57:46,00:57:47,"Yeah, he was fine."
00:57:47,00:57:50,"It is weird that the body can withstand that size,"
00:57:50,00:57:52,because it must have really misshapen
00:57:52,00:57:52,"various bits of him,"
00:57:52,00:57:54,but they obviously just stretch to accommodate them.
00:57:54,00:57:55,Yep.
00:57:55,00:57:57,"Spine went, ""Hey, all right, I'll take you."""
00:57:57,00:57:59,Do you know what knob cutters are used for?
00:57:59,00:58:00,Knob cutters?
00:58:00,00:58:00,Yeah.
00:58:00,00:58:02,Is it a type of scissor?
00:58:02,00:58:03,Visectomies?
00:58:03,00:58:03,No.
00:58:03,00:58:04,Unix?
00:58:04,00:58:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:58:05,00:58:06,Knob cutters?
00:58:06,00:58:06,Nobs.
00:58:06,00:58:07,"Oh, doors."
00:58:07,00:58:07,Door nobs.
00:58:07,00:58:08,Knob doors.
00:58:08,00:58:09,The type of cactus.
00:58:09,00:58:10,Nobs of butter.
00:58:10,00:58:10,Closer.
00:58:10,00:58:11,Oh.
00:58:11,00:58:14,"Cactus, have nipples, but what has knobs?"
00:58:14,00:58:15,Oh.
00:58:15,00:58:16,"What, a plant with a knob?"
00:58:16,00:58:18,"Yeah, just trees, I guess."
00:58:18,00:58:18,A tree.
00:58:18,00:58:19,A tree.
00:58:19,00:58:20,"Well, why would you use scissors on a tree?"
00:58:20,00:58:23,"You want to make it nice and smooth,"
00:58:23,00:58:24,"because you work for Yves Saint Laurent,"
00:58:24,00:58:26,and he's mental.
00:58:26,00:58:28,"Well, you would use shears"
00:58:28,00:58:30,"or you would use like a chainsaw, right?"
00:58:30,00:58:31,"A tiny tree, then."
00:58:31,00:58:31,It's got to be.
00:58:31,00:58:32,Bonsai.
00:58:32,00:58:33,Bonsai.
00:58:33,00:58:37,They are used by Bonsai.
00:58:37,00:58:38,So great.
00:58:38,00:58:39,That's cool.
00:58:39,00:58:40,"Gardeners, yeah."
00:58:40,00:58:40,They are.
00:58:40,00:58:42,The Bonsai scissor world is pretty amazing.
00:58:42,00:58:45,"Well, they're like, the knob cutters are really cool looking,"
00:58:45,00:58:47,because the bit which you cut
00:58:47,00:58:49,"looks like it could be a tiny Sheffield,"
00:58:49,00:58:51,like the world's smallest scissor.
00:58:51,00:58:51,Brilliant.
00:58:51,00:58:53,But then the handles are normal sized handles.
00:58:53,00:58:55,Because obviously you need to sort of--
00:58:55,00:58:56,To have your fingers in there.
00:58:56,00:58:57,"Put your fingers in it,"
00:58:57,00:58:59,"but also you're cutting something really, really small."
00:58:59,00:59:00,That makes so much sense.
00:59:00,00:59:01,That's good.
00:59:01,00:59:03,That's a good thing for like a James Bond super villain
00:59:03,00:59:04,"to say is like, you know,"
00:59:04,00:59:05,when Bond's tied to the child or whatever.
00:59:05,00:59:07,Bring me the knob cutters.
00:59:07,00:59:10,Turn through Bonsai tree.
00:59:10,00:59:11,Gives them a little truth.
00:59:11,00:59:12,That's brilliant.
00:59:12,00:59:15,You would have to set up that Joe Kerrier in the movie.
00:59:15,00:59:16,"Oh, yeah, I would ensure that I did."
00:59:16,00:59:19,Or put some subtitles explaining what they are.
00:59:19,00:59:22,"Joe Kerrier's like,"
00:59:22,00:59:24,"""I don't know what you mean about the knob cutters."""
00:59:24,00:59:26,"And then Blow Felt's like,"
00:59:26,00:59:29,"""Well, actually, it's the name of, you know,"
00:59:29,00:59:30,"some scissors that use it Bonsai."""
00:59:30,00:59:34,Now bring in the dildo cactus.
00:59:34,00:59:45,"Okay, that's it."
00:59:45,00:59:46,That is all of our facts.
