 Hi!
 Hi Andy!
 Hello!
 Hi everybody!
 Hi everyone at home!
 Yeah, alright.
 Sort of my thing to say.
 Yeah, I mean, no, no, no, that's good, yeah.
 I just felt like I was excluding
 7 billion people
 by only saying hi to you.
 That's fair.
 Well, hi to all of you.
 As James said, I don't need to go on
 and say that we're hosting...
 Can I just say my hi as to everyone at home as well?
 I don't want to feel like Anna and I
 suddenly were just saying hi to you guys
 and you've expressed a hello.
 I was.
 Okay, Anna has.
 That's specifically Andy, yeah.
 Okay, well what we're here to do
 is to have a session of Drop as a Line,
 the audience feedback show
 that is now well-established,
 and I don't think really needs any
 OTOs defining.
 You know, screw it.
 It's not been cancelled yet, amazingly.
 Well, it goes to such a small audience
 that really helps.
 It's like, it would be like a small newsletter
 being cancelled.
 You know, it's harder to do.
 If no one sees you being
 cancelable, then it's hard to know.
 But we've had a lot of amazing feedback
 since the last time we recorded one of these.
 Great.
 Some good stuff.
 About this show or the main show?
 Not about this show.
 About the one we're recording now,
 they actually say the beginning is awful.
 Right, here we go.
 Something from...
 Well, this is a great thing to start.
 This is from someone called Brandy Folk.
 A fantastic name.
 Very popular over Christmas, I reckon.
 Get the Brandy Folk round.
 So, I was listening to the episode,
 "There is no such thing as a meat cute."
 Remember that?
 Talked about meat judging.
 Okay.
 And this actually happened.
 My parents met when both of them
 were on meat judging teams.
 Wow.
 My dad at Ohio State,
 my mum at Michigan State,
 they first met each other
 in a meat cooler in Cincinnati, Ohio
 for a meat judging competition.
 Wow.
 They hooked up right after.
 Hooked up.
 Hooked up.
 Brilliant.
 And have now been married for 33 years.
 Isn't that nice?
 That's a wonderful story.
 That's fantastic.
 I know.
 And then Brandy adds another fact,
 because she's from meat stock.
 Yeah.
 Another fact is that there is
 livestock judging at market shows
 where the judge judges the best of the animal
 before it is a carcass
 and then again after it is a carcass.
 Wow.
 That was a competition
 where you do so well in the first half.
 You go to your death thinking,
 "I've got this in the back."
 Yeah.
 Or you do really badly in the first half,
 but you go, "It's all right.
 I'll make it up in the next round."
 A few pittings of wood and corpse.
 Yeah.
 And now it's time for sudden death.
 What?
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, dear.
 So thank you, Brandy.
 Very cool.
 Great start.
 Great anecdote.
 Craig Baker writes,
 "I was just listening to your recent
 episode of Fish One.
 I heard you guys discussing pond creation."
 Oh, yeah.
 "I was surprised."
 I love it.
 "I was surprised."
 Andy's looking directly at it.
 "My parents both met."
 Taking a pond.
 "I was surprised
 not to hear a word about wild boar."
 Oh, okay.
 "There are 2,600 wild boar living in the UK
 and they've been documented by many,
 including me."
 That's Craig, not me.
 Yeah.
 "Using their elongated nose bones
 to dig out little ponds or wallows."
 These wallows are built by the boar
 to create places to wash and cool down,
 but they also allow habitat and breeding sites
 for countless insects and amphibians.
 Do you know what?
 I didn't know there were so many wild boar in there.
 Don't mean either.
 I knew they were on the continent,
 but I didn't know here.
 I'm very skeptical.
 I've never seen one.
 Except I think I once saw a wild boar carcass.
 Again, I don't know what it would have scored
 in the context.
 Really good though.
 But I couldn't tell if it was a badger or a wild boar.
 It was either a badger whose hair had all come off
 or a boar, and that's the only time.
 Those two things are very different sizes.
 Actually, when something's been kind of mangled
 by various cars running over it,
 it's quite hard, I think, to distinguish.
 So many of your anecdotes are about,
 "I saw these..."
 Do you remember?
 I saw 50 squashed frogs once.
 I saw these moles hanging up dead on a fence, and it's...
 Yeah, I remember.
 Well, they're quite striking anecdotes, aren't they?
 They lead a very sort of primal, earthy life, I think.
 Yeah, I come from sort of medieval...
 All my stories are about cocktail bars I've been in,
 and witnesses of my might have traded.
 But they were all when you were living in Stoke Newington,
 weren't they?
 That's true, yeah.
 Okay, here's another one.
 This is a new section I've inaugurated,
 which is called, "You Said It Wrong."
 Oh, no.
 Oh, God, pronunciation stuff.
 And it's from someone called Don Anthony.
 He doesn't specify whether his name is Donald
 or whether he's in the mafia.
 So...
 "Being born raised and still living on the island of..."
 Sicily.
 Yeah, I was most displeased to hear.
 No, Newfoundland, right?
 Oh, Newfoundland.
 And I don't even know how I'm saying it.
 I'm always chuffed to hear reference to my home
 or one of my favorite podcasts,
 which all happen to be British.
 So every time I hear it pronounced,
 I respond with the correct pronunciation
 as though you could hear me.
 The primary issue is that it is pronounced
 "Newfoundland" with the emphasis on the land.
 Think "Understand" or "Disneyland."
 I'm pretty sure that's Newfoundland.
 Newfoundland is about you're not stressing the land.
 Newfoundland.
 I really have to land on the land.
 Yeah, but Don says...
 Newfoundland.
 Don't feel bad about it.
 Half of Canada says it wrong.
 There's a pleasing thought of Don Anthony
 wandering around Newfoundland saying out loud,
 "Newfoundland!" as he goes.
 The second, possibly more pedantic point, incredible,
 is that the province is actually called
 Newfoundland and Labrador.
 Yeah.
 Yes, the two dog breeds.
 Yes.
 The four.
 Yeah, he doesn't specify.
 Newfoundland is the island portion of the province
 while Labrador is located immediately
 to the northwest of the island.
 So there you go.
 Lovely.
 Lovely stuff.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 Next up is a drop-as-a-line spiral
 where it's referring to something
 we said on the last drop-as-a-line.
 Oh, yeah.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Haven't got a good name for this yet,
 but very, very open to suggestions.
 Okay.
 Think about that.
 While you think about that,
 think about Kevin Tate's message.
 You read a message.
 Russian duel,
 like a Russian doll.
 That's good.
 Well done.
 But it's duel for drop-as-a-line.
 Brilliant.
 There we go.
 That's it.
 I'm going to actually make a little note of that.
 You read a message,
 Kevin Tate writes,
 about roller derby fans
 singing the Hot Pockets theme for a player.
 She was called --
 Yes.
 She was called twat rocket.
 Twat or twat rocket.
 Yeah.
 Because we had a long debate
 over the pronunciation of twat
 and what another hot pocket is.
 Well, yeah.
 We've been corrected
 on one of those two issues.
 Okay.
 I think a hot pocket
 was like a pop tart,
 but I think it's slightly different.
 James, you prompted
 an absolute avalanche
 of hot baked goods
 into the inbox.
 I think it's more like a pizza
 that you put between
 two slices of paper.
 Look, I'm not --
 I'm going to read out Kevin's message.
 I can't.
 I'm not going to steal his thunder.
 One correction.
 They are not caps lock on.
 Pop tarts, caps lock off.
 They are microwavable pastries
 with fake meat and cheese
 that, upon your first bite,
 flow out with the searing heat
 and destructive force of hot magma.
 And then make you regret
 having a stomach afterwards.
 I wonder what the fake meat is.
 Like, why not use meat?
 What's a fake meat?
 I think --
 It is actual meat.
 Highly processed.
 Just highly processed.
 It's a fine word for bad meat.
 For multi-meat.
 Yeah.
 Sounds much better.
 What's it called?
 Is it called pink slime or something?
 Yeah, that's it.
 It's the stuff where,
 when you're making processed meat,
 you scrape it off the sides
 of the container.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Turn it into meat.
 Right.
 Which has already been water-blasted
 off the body of the --
 Yeah.
 Anyway, that was the funniest
 of the several messages we got
 correcting us on the nature of --
 I'm sorry.
 It's quite all right.
 You know what?
 I Googled it afterwards
 when I was editing,
 and I knew I'd got it wrong,
 but I thought,
 "Surely, even our listeners
 will be quibbled off."
 I think you got it right.
 Oh, interesting.
 Well, I mean --
 A pop-top has to be sweet in my books.
 Yeah, but it's some goo wrapped up
 in some carbohydrate.
 Like, that's -- and heated.
 I mean, that's what we're basically
 talking about.
 Basic description, yeah.
 Would you say a bagel's the same
 as a doughnut?
 Sorry.
 It's the same analogy.
 I'm saying a lot of our audiences
 in the U.K.
 They might not know what a hot
 pocket is.
 I didn't know what a hot pocket was.
 You know, I don't really know
 what a pop-top is, to be honest,
 but I can clean up a bit closer
 to that.
 You just go into the shop
 and say,
 "Do you have any carbohydrates
 which are completely surrounding
 some kind of goop?"
 Yeah.
 But I'll let the goop
 be made of grouse, please.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Long-time listener,
 Thomas Kenney,
 writes,
 "Wanting to nerd out on a joke
 as we're having at the end of
 the episode when discussing
 cake-o the whale."
 Oh, yeah.
 Free Willy.
 Y'all.
 It's funny when you hear cake-o,
 because obviously when we were
 researching it, it was written
 down, and you obviously see it
 as K-E-I-K-O, but when you hear
 it, I thought we must be doing
 a baked goods section, and it
 was some cake, you know,
 superhero cake-o to the rescue.
 How does he or she rescue
 people?
 By putting, it's people who
 are throwing themselves off
 buildings, and you always slide
 sponge cake underneath.
 Lovely.
 What, so they can just produce
 sponge cake from, like,
 Spider-Man's web?
 Which RFS does it come from?
 So, cake-o's the superhero.
 Yeah, cake-o's the superhero.
 Oh, sorry, the superhero fan.
 Yeah, sponge cake comes out of
 all their skin pores.
 Oh, okay, so it's a mutation
 rather than like a Batman
 situation where it's just like
 he's rich.
 Yeah, he doesn't bring loads
 of expensive cake.
 Okay.
 He's like an X-man,
 but also a flower man,
 also a butter man.
 Yeah.
 Jesus.
 Do you think cake-o might save
 more lives, rather than just
 putting bits of cake at the
 bottom of buildings where people
 have fallen off, then to sort of,
 like, I don't know, base himself
 in a third-world country and just
 feed people with a constant
 supply of food.
 Oh, with catastrophic sugar
 overload.
 Just at least just to give them
 like...
 I mean, yeah, it's kind of...
 You can have sugar-free cakes.
 We'd actually...
 I should have asked.
 Sorry for not asking.
 Can cake-o produce...
 Can he turn up or down the dial
 of the nutritious quality of the
 cake?
 Yeah.
 I was thinking he was more on the
 bagel side of the donut in its
 terms of sugar content.
 It's...
 Well, the thing about cake-o is
 much like the...
 Is it the Hulk who doesn't
 can't really control when he
 turns?
 Can't control the kind of cake
 that comes out.
 So whatever is needed in the
 moment, he produces.
 I think so.
 Produces.
 And now it is not to question
 how he decides to use it.
 So if he's feeding our hungry
 people, I'm sure his body would
 reduce the sugar content and all
 the bad stuff.
 Yeah.
 I think it's Thomas' email.
 That's about whales.
 I hear the whale.
 Yeah.
 I hesitate to pause and
 otherwise promising franchises
 in his tracks.
 Okay.
 You all cracked up at Dan for
 mentioning cake-o wouldn't be
 used to that salted water pool's
 altitude, making jokes about the
 sea level being the same.
 You uno-reversed yourselves.
 Amazing.
 I learned on your podcast, I'm
 pretty sure, because you're the
 only fact podcast I listen to,
 that sea level isn't the same
 everywhere on earth.
 K-O.
 K-E-I.
 Brilliant.
 I don't have an answer for that.
 I guess that is kind of true.
 But the difference isn't enough.
 Yeah.
 Unless you're very sensitive.
 You've got a very sensitive
 stomach.
 But no, it's a fair point.
 Yeah.
 Thank you, Thomas.
 Thank you.
 As you can see, we're all
 grappling to come up with a good
 answer for it.
 We don't.
 The real problem is that we can't
 think of a good answer for it.
 And if we don't answer it
 correctly, then we can't use any
 of the K-Kos stuff.
 Yes.
 I think we can answer it
 correctly by saying you're
 absolutely right, Thomas.
 Good point.
 And thank you for only listening
 to our podcast.
 Continue not to listen to any
 others.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And also, you owe no
 proprietary rights to cake-o.
 No, absolutely not.
 OK.
 We come on to the thorny
 matter of Chicago.
 OK.
 BJ Woodstein writes, someone,
 Anna, I think, referred to
 Chicago being the windy city
 because of the weather.
 It's true that it's on Lake
 Michigan and it can be quite
 cold and windy.
 Can I just interject now?
 No, I don't think.
 No, I'm actually doubting you
 can.
 Can I just?
 I'm going to steamroll
 forward for a little bit.
 Can I just say that the hand
 gestures right now around the
 table are something.
 I'm talking to the hand.
 Don't be mad at me.
 I need to capture this.
 Absolutely.
 OK.
 We come on to the thorny
 matter of Chicago.
 OK.
 Can you capture this?
 As a Chicagoan.
 As a Chicagoan, it's not called
 the windy city because of the
 wind.
 It's called it because of the
 politicians.
 Look, as if QI didn't invent
 that fact about series A.
 Hand is still up.
 Everybody's hand is still up.
 But I don't think that's what
 you said, though, Anna.
 You said it was because of the
 wind.
 The thing is, it's a
 misconception because Chicago
 is very windy, famously.
 So people think it must be
 called the windy city because
 of the wind.
 OK.
 Whereas it's because of the
 politicians.
 I'd be amazed if I said it was
 because of the wind.
 I'm pretty sure you did.
 Well, call me amazed.
 And thank you for the correction.
 Well, it's...
 Sorry.
 Read the email.
 They'll explain it more
 politely than I have.
 B.J. Woodstein has made
 exactly those points.
 She does also add, actually, in
 something that provoked as much
 roiling in the inbox as hot
 pockets, "Incidentally, as a
 woman from Chicago, I don't have
 large feet."
 Oh, I never said that she did.
 I just said that they were famous
 in the 19th century for having
 big feet.
 I know.
 Elaine Wiseman, she writes, "I'm
 not sure who's reading emails
 this week.
 It's me, Elaine, as every week.
 But please let James know that
 in my 28 years of living in and
 around Chicago, women with big
 feet have never been a thing."
 No.
 Was she around in the 19th
 century?
 28 years, can't be.
 She's barely around in the
 20th century.
 So what has happened to the
 women of Chicago?
 Well, no.
 Their feet have shrunk.
 Can I add a third email from
 Ms. Crisley, who writes, "I'm
 sick of these jokes about my
 giant feet."
 I'm 190 years old.
 I grew up near Chicago, and my
 whole family has huge feet.
 Yes.
 I mean, I actually think this is
 genuinely interesting, because I
 think, like we said on the time,
 it's very clear that people in
 Chicago won't have above-average
 feet, but they did have this
 reputation, and if you look in
 the newspaper archives, it's all
 in there.
 But it sounds like they've
 migrated to just outside of the
 main Chicago area.
 Yeah.
 Just follow the footprints.
 You'll find them.
 I was staggered that you didn't
 make a Bigfoot joke at the time,
 Dan.
 Okay.
 Are you writing a letter in?
 No.
 I wouldn't have time to read it.
 Dan doesn't joke about Bigfoot.
 No.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Just a quick observation about
 BJ is that I've only ever heard
 people use that as the first two
 the way of saying their name in
 America.
 I can't think of any other -- I
 know quite like BJ Novak, the
 writer.
 Boris Johnson has never been
 known as BJ.
 No.
 It's a good observation.
 I'd love to know if there's any
 BJs outside of America.
 Okay.
 Well, if you'd like to --
 Dan, Dan, making a call out for
 BJs there on the podcast.
 You heard it here first.
 We're getting closer to that
 cancellation line, aren't we?
 Mark Tween writes --
 That's a fantastic name.
 He wrote some young adult novels
 about the American South, don't
 you?
 Yeah.
 He's from Cornwall.
 He's a big fan of the show.
 Club Fish member.
 So, hello, Mark, if you're
 listening.
 I'm writing to you about a point
 raised by James in episode 503
 in reference to Walk in
 Freezers.
 I feel like I'm getting a lot
 of --
 This is positive.
 There's no pushback at all.
 It's not a criticism, Mark
 writes.
 It's not spicy meat.
 People say that a lot when
 they're about to criticize you,
 don't they?
 That's true.
 But it was shit.
 No, sorry.
 Just some friendly advice that
 may help anyone that finds
 themselves trapped in a freezer.
 Okay.
 I am a calibration engineer.
 A nerdy job in itself.
 And one of the things I
 often calibrate is a walk-in
 freezer.
 As James correctly stated,
 these do have a button on the
 inside for opening the door.
 In the episode, James recalls a
 story from a butcher who said a
 large black pudding is the best
 thing to use as a battering
 ram.
 Yes.
 My boss once got trapped in a
 walk-in freezer and the emergency
 button failed.
 Uh-oh.
 He didn't have large pieces of
 frozen meat to hand.
 What about a large Swiss roll?
 I'll give it to him by Keiko.
 Where's he produced that from?
 No, it's a family-friendly
 comment.
 Is it?
 Okay.
 It is, yeah.
 Well, I love this.
 So instead, my boss wrapped his
 hands around the freezer
 temperature sensor.
 Most industrial freezers have
 an alarm that will sound when
 the temperature gets too high.
 His hands warmed the sensor
 enough to raise the alarm and
 someone came to the freezer and
 opened the door.
 That is quite amazing.
 That's brilliant, isn't it?
 Another tip, because your hands
 might get too cold.
 It might not work.
 Try internal, because your
 internal temperature will stay
 high longer than your hand
 temperature.
 Sorry, what do you mean?
 Like, sort of climb nude on top
 of the temperature sensor?
 I haven't worked out all the
 details.
 But if...
 Yeah.
 Or if you like fish one of your
 organs out and plant it on top
 of it.
 But that's a great fact.
 That is unbelievable.
 Really good.
 Really like that.
 So thank you, Mark.
 Dr Alexander Mayer, associate
 professor of classical studies
 at the University of Western
 Ontario.
 Does it listen?
 It has blocked your
 non-listener of the week.
 I'm a long-time listener of
 the podcast.
 I think I've heard all 506
 episodes.
 Right.
 And a professor of classical
 studies in Canada.
 For 20 years, I've been
 involved in excavations and
 research at Vindolanda Roman
 Fort on Hadrian's Wall.
 Oh!
 In June of 2022, you mentioned
 we had found a stone on the
 site that had an enormous
 carved phallus.
 Oh, yeah.
 And the inscription's
 secondenous cacor.
 Oh, yes.
 It was the poor or the shitter
 or something.
 Anyway, yeah.
 Yeah.
 In the process, you mentioned
 the researchers who published
 the press release about it.
 Well, as it happens, I am one
 of those researchers.
 And therefore, you came just
 two words from fulfilling a
 dream of mine, namely being
 mentioned on your show.
 Oh.
 Turns out, you now have
 another chance.
 The print version of the full
 article that my colleagues,
 Alex Mullen and Eunice Van
 Halle, and I wrote about it,
 just came out in a recent
 volume of the Journal of
 Britannia.
 I thought you might like to
 follow up.
 Just mentioned my name this
 time, eh?
 [LAUGHTER]
 What was that person?
 Actually, never mind.
 I've said it before.
 [LAUGHTER]
 That was an incredible person
 to write in.
 Very excited.
 I feel a bit starstruck.
 We get the great and the good
 in the inbox.
 We do.
 We do.
 I've got one more thing for
 you.
 Oh, yeah.
 Do you remember we had this
 story about the cost of beans
 in 1996 being minus 2p?
 Oh, yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So Fraser Johnson writes,
 "This isn't really a factor
 search, but I wanted to share
 a story from a few years back.
 I had a part-time job at
 Sainsbury's when I was in
 college, 2000 and 2001.
 I, along with numerous other
 colleagues, cottoned on to a
 glitch within the checkout
 system, where if an item was
 part of a multi-buy deal, but
 was also reduced due to its
 shelf life, the item's full
 price would be deducted from
 your shopping bill.
 So if a $1.99 pizza was on
 Buy, 1, Get, 1, Free, and then
 reduced to 1.50, you could buy
 2 for 99p because the till
 would add 2.98 to the bill, but
 still deduct 1.99, basically.
 So, right.
 There's a good loophole there.
 Sainsbury were not really
 concerned because the offers
 were funded by the suppliers
 anyway.
 I'd be amazed if they could
 make a massive loss based on
 the quite limited selection of
 stuff.
 Well, listen on, Anna.
 No, I'm not captivated then.
 Obviously, this resulted in
 some epic bargains, but none
 better than when on New Year's
 Eve 2000, I discovered that, as
 the store was closed the
 following day, a large quantity
 of avocados had been reduced to
 just 10p each, and they were
 Buy, 1, Get, 1, Free.
 They were originally 69p.
 I walked out at the end of my
 shift, fully armed for New Year's
 Festivities with a bottle of
 vodka, some party poppers, 20
 Marlborough, some king-size
 Risler, and various nibbles, as
 well as 104 avocados.
 For the princely sum of 9p,
 what?
 That's so good.
 Isn't that great?
 Was that on New Year's Eve 2000?
 I wonder if that was New Year's
 Eve without the Millennium.
 That was it.
 That was how you spent the
 Millennium.
 Isn't that great?
 Imagine ending the thousand
 years of mankind with that.
 Incredible.
 So thank you, Fraser.
 What a great bargain.
 You're all skeptical when I said
 I've got a good story about a
 bargain.
 Best story I've ever heard.
 Can I quickly, because we were
 talking about beans, so that
 episode Anne Miller was on, so
 Anne messaged me because she's
 gotten a few droppers of lines
 herself about that episode, and
 she said there were three sizes
 of Heinz beans containers.
 She was a bean expert, and we
 went into quite a lot of detail
 about the number of sizes of
 beans, but apparently she'd
 missed a fourth size of bean.
 And yeah, she's been getting
 messages about that.
 Apparently there were four sizes
 of Heinz beans containers.
 There are two smaller tins around
 here in various supermarkets,
 plus the big size, plus the
 snack pots, says someone to Anne
 by text message, which she sent
 me.
 So she would like to, she's not
 here to defend herself, she would
 like to apologize to any bean
 aficionados out there who were
 offended by her lack of bean
 knowledge.
 Did you talk about flicking beans
 on the episode?
 Yeah, but I only in the very literal
 sense.
 We did get an email from a satchel
 saying, "Sorry, can I just explain,
 oh Dad, you should explain what
 happened."
 Yeah, I was, and I know what this
 is going to be, and I have a
 response prepared written for me.
 Why is everyone pre-delivering
 their responses?
 No, I didn't know you were going
 to bring this up.
 It's someone, someone wrote to me
 about it.
 So I met Greg Wallace, who's the
 master chef guy, he's one of the
 guys on there, and he randomly
 walked up to me and just said,
 "Do you want to hear a bean fact?"
 I just didn't know who I was.
 I thought he must have known I was
 on fish.
 Nothing.
 And then he said that there's a
 laser at the factories where if
 they see that there's an abnormal
 bean, they'll shoot a laser at it
 and flick the bean off.
 That is the story.
 And so Greg Wallace was like,
 "They have a literal bean flicker."
 Yeah.
 And there's, I believe, a rude
 meaning to that phrase.
 Yeah.
 Sasha writes, "Sitting here, having
 just finished the episode, in stunned
 amazement, that in a piece where the
 phrases 'flick the bean' and 'bean
 flicker' were used, nobody commented
 on the generally accepted usage of
 those phrases.
 It feels like there's no such thing
 as official equivalent of Ronaldo
 not scoring an open goal."
 You guys need a new segment and
 drop us a line.
 Mr. Sitter.
 I think perhaps it was more like
 Ronaldo got to the goal.
 He thought, "You know what?
 I've shown that I can do this."
 Yeah.
 Probably don't.
 We're already winning 5-0.
 Yeah.
 Sometimes when we say something
 that's so obviously rude and we're
 saying it, a look goes around and
 we continue the chat because we
 think, "Who's going to go there?
 Do we need to go there?
 No, let's just keep going on."
 Yeah.
 You can't see our eyes.
 At that point, there was a look
 where it was, "No, it's too
 smarty.
 Let's just carry on."
 Fair enough.
 Too smarty.
 We're flattering ourselves there.
 The truth is...
 No, just sometimes.
 No, it's not that it's too smarty.
 We've never ever rejected anything
 because it's too smarty.
 Be honest with ourselves.
 It's because we can't think of the
 funny thing to say.
 It's like seeing the open goal and
 tripping over the ball.
 Sometimes something's so obvious.
 You're like, "Oh, I can't make it
 funnier than that phrase."
 This is Anna's internal process.
 It doesn't apply to all of us,
 we should say.
 I thought it was funny enough as it
 was.
 I didn't need it.
 Having listened to it, I agree.
 That's what I mean.
 It's like you're going to derail the
 conversation to make some kind of...
 There is a possibility.
 Oh, we would never derail a
 conversation.
 Not always.
 We have to hold our bags.
 Who's that out of the window?
 It's Keiko.
 I think we could possibly in the
 future invent something where we
 get like eyeballs and you can have
 them in your room while you're
 listening to the podcast, but they're
 attached to our own eyeballs.
 So the eyeballs in your room move in
 the same way that our eyeballs are
 actually moving when we're doing the
 show.
 Interesting.
 So it gives you an extra experience.
 And you can see us.
 You can see just the eyeballs, not the
 rest of the face.
 They knew.
 They knew.
 The thing we've been doing when we
 filmed clips of this show, you'd like
 us to really focus in on just our
 eyes.
 Well, I was reading the other day that
 John Dalton, who named Daltonism,
 which is colourblindness, he gave his
 eyes to the Museum of Science and
 Industry, and they are there.
 You can just see the eyes.
 James is offering to donate his own
 eyes to one lucky listener who wants
 to have nightmares for the rest of
 their lives.
 Thanks, everybody.
 Please keep writing in to
 podcast@qi.com with your emails.
 You've been hearing other people's
 emails, unless you were featured in
 this show, but send in your own.
 Can I just say something quickly?
 So just to talk about the elephant in
 the room, if you only ever came to
 Club Fish because you didn't like the
 adverts, you can now go to BBC Sounds
 and get the podcast with no adverts
 for free.
 You are allowed to do that.
 That would be absolutely fine.
 But you would miss this absolute
 gold dust of bonus material.
 Yeah.
 You want to miss this outro to a
 show?
 I don't think so.
 Can I do the BBC Sounds version
 rather than come here every week?
 Yeah.
 No, we love it.
 No, we love you guys being here.
 And thank you so much for subscribing
 to Club Fish.
 It really means a lot to us to have
 this community, but we just want to
 say, yeah, that option is open to
 you.
 Yeah.
 But don't take it.
 Don't do it.
 But you can.
 But don't.
 We'll see you.
 Wherever you are.
 Brilliant.
 Bye.
