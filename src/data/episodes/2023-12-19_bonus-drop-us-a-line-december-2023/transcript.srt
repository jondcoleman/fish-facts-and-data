00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Hi!

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Hi Andy!

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Hello!

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Hi everybody!

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Hi everyone at home!

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Yeah, alright.

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Sort of my thing to say.

13
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Yeah, I mean, no, no, no, that's good, yeah.

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 I just felt like I was excluding

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 7 billion people

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 by only saying hi to you.

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 That's fair.

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Well, hi to all of you.

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 As James said, I don't need to go on

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 and say that we're hosting...

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Can I just say my hi as to everyone at home as well?

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I don't want to feel like Anna and I

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 suddenly were just saying hi to you guys

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 and you've expressed a hello.

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I was.

26
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Okay, Anna has.

27
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 That's specifically Andy, yeah.

28
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Okay, well what we're here to do

29
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 is to have a session of Drop as a Line,

30
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 the audience feedback show

31
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 that is now well-established,

32
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 and I don't think really needs any

33
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 OTOs defining.

34
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 You know, screw it.

35
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 It's not been cancelled yet, amazingly.

36
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Well, it goes to such a small audience

37
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 that really helps.

38
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 It's like, it would be like a small newsletter

39
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 being cancelled.

40
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 You know, it's harder to do.

41
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 If no one sees you being

42
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 cancelable, then it's hard to know.

43
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 But we've had a lot of amazing feedback

44
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 since the last time we recorded one of these.

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Great.

46
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Some good stuff.

47
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 About this show or the main show?

48
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Not about this show.

49
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 About the one we're recording now,

50
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 they actually say the beginning is awful.

51
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Right, here we go.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Something from...

53
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Well, this is a great thing to start.

54
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 This is from someone called Brandy Folk.

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 A fantastic name.

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Very popular over Christmas, I reckon.

57
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Get the Brandy Folk round.

58
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So, I was listening to the episode,

59
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 "There is no such thing as a meat cute."

60
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Remember that?

61
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Talked about meat judging.

62
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Okay.

63
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And this actually happened.

64
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 My parents met when both of them

65
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 were on meat judging teams.

66
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Wow.

67
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 My dad at Ohio State,

68
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 my mum at Michigan State,

69
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 they first met each other

70
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 in a meat cooler in Cincinnati, Ohio

71
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 for a meat judging competition.

72
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Wow.

73
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 They hooked up right after.

74
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Hooked up.

75
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Hooked up.

76
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Brilliant.

77
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And have now been married for 33 years.

78
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Isn't that nice?

79
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 That's a wonderful story.

80
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 That's fantastic.

81
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I know.

82
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And then Brandy adds another fact,

83
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 because she's from meat stock.

84
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Yeah.

85
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Another fact is that there is

86
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 livestock judging at market shows

87
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 where the judge judges the best of the animal

88
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 before it is a carcass

89
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 and then again after it is a carcass.

90
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Wow.

91
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 That was a competition

92
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 where you do so well in the first half.

93
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 You go to your death thinking,

94
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 "I've got this in the back."

95
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Yeah.

96
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Or you do really badly in the first half,

97
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 but you go, "It's all right.

98
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I'll make it up in the next round."

99
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 A few pittings of wood and corpse.

100
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Yeah.

101
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And now it's time for sudden death.

102
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 What?

103
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Oh, my God.

104
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Oh, dear.

105
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So thank you, Brandy.

106
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Very cool.

107
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Great start.

108
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Great anecdote.

109
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Craig Baker writes,

110
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 "I was just listening to your recent

111
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 episode of Fish One.

112
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I heard you guys discussing pond creation."

113
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Oh, yeah.

114
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 "I was surprised."

115
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I love it.

116
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 "I was surprised."

117
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Andy's looking directly at it.

118
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 "My parents both met."

119
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Taking a pond.

120
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 "I was surprised

121
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 not to hear a word about wild boar."

122
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Oh, okay.

123
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 "There are 2,600 wild boar living in the UK

124
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 and they've been documented by many,

125
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 including me."

126
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 That's Craig, not me.

127
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Yeah.

128
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 "Using their elongated nose bones

129
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 to dig out little ponds or wallows."

130
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 These wallows are built by the boar

131
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 to create places to wash and cool down,

132
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 but they also allow habitat and breeding sites

133
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 for countless insects and amphibians.

134
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Do you know what?

135
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I didn't know there were so many wild boar in there.

136
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Don't mean either.

137
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I knew they were on the continent,

138
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 but I didn't know here.

139
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I'm very skeptical.

140
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I've never seen one.

141
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Except I think I once saw a wild boar carcass.

142
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Again, I don't know what it would have scored

143
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 in the context.

144
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Really good though.

145
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But I couldn't tell if it was a badger or a wild boar.

146
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It was either a badger whose hair had all come off

147
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 or a boar, and that's the only time.

148
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Those two things are very different sizes.

149
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Actually, when something's been kind of mangled

150
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 by various cars running over it,

151
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 it's quite hard, I think, to distinguish.

152
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 So many of your anecdotes are about,

153
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 "I saw these..."

154
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Do you remember?

155
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I saw 50 squashed frogs once.

156
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I saw these moles hanging up dead on a fence, and it's...

157
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Yeah, I remember.

158
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Well, they're quite striking anecdotes, aren't they?

159
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 They lead a very sort of primal, earthy life, I think.

160
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Yeah, I come from sort of medieval...

161
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 All my stories are about cocktail bars I've been in,

162
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 and witnesses of my might have traded.

163
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But they were all when you were living in Stoke Newington,

164
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 weren't they?

165
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 That's true, yeah.

166
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Okay, here's another one.

167
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 This is a new section I've inaugurated,

168
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 which is called, "You Said It Wrong."

169
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Oh, no.

170
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Oh, God, pronunciation stuff.

171
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And it's from someone called Don Anthony.

172
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 He doesn't specify whether his name is Donald

173
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 or whether he's in the mafia.

174
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 So...

175
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 "Being born raised and still living on the island of..."

176
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Sicily.

177
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Yeah, I was most displeased to hear.

178
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 No, Newfoundland, right?

179
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Oh, Newfoundland.

180
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And I don't even know how I'm saying it.

181
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I'm always chuffed to hear reference to my home

182
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 or one of my favorite podcasts,

183
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 which all happen to be British.

184
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 So every time I hear it pronounced,

185
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I respond with the correct pronunciation

186
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 as though you could hear me.

187
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 The primary issue is that it is pronounced

188
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 "Newfoundland" with the emphasis on the land.

189
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Think "Understand" or "Disneyland."

190
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I'm pretty sure that's Newfoundland.

191
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Newfoundland is about you're not stressing the land.

192
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Newfoundland.

193
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I really have to land on the land.

194
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Yeah, but Don says...

195
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Newfoundland.

196
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Don't feel bad about it.

197
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Half of Canada says it wrong.

198
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 There's a pleasing thought of Don Anthony

199
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 wandering around Newfoundland saying out loud,

200
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 "Newfoundland!" as he goes.

201
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 The second, possibly more pedantic point, incredible,

202
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 is that the province is actually called

203
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Newfoundland and Labrador.

204
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Yeah.

205
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Yes, the two dog breeds.

206
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Yes.

207
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 The four.

208
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Yeah, he doesn't specify.

209
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Newfoundland is the island portion of the province

210
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 while Labrador is located immediately

211
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 to the northwest of the island.

212
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So there you go.

213
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Lovely.

214
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Lovely stuff.

215
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Thank you.

216
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Okay.

217
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Next up is a drop-as-a-line spiral

218
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 where it's referring to something

219
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 we said on the last drop-as-a-line.

220
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Oh, yeah.

221
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Okay.

222
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Yeah.

223
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Haven't got a good name for this yet,

224
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 but very, very open to suggestions.

225
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Okay.

226
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Think about that.

227
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 While you think about that,

228
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 think about Kevin Tate's message.

229
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 You read a message.

230
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Russian duel,

231
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 like a Russian doll.

232
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 That's good.

233
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Well done.

234
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But it's duel for drop-as-a-line.

235
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Brilliant.

236
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 There we go.

237
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 That's it.

238
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I'm going to actually make a little note of that.

239
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 You read a message,

240
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Kevin Tate writes,

241
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 about roller derby fans

242
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 singing the Hot Pockets theme for a player.

243
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 She was called --

244
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yes.

245
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 She was called twat rocket.

246
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Twat or twat rocket.

247
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Yeah.

248
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Because we had a long debate

249
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 over the pronunciation of twat

250
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 and what another hot pocket is.

251
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Well, yeah.

252
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 We've been corrected

253
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 on one of those two issues.

254
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Okay.

255
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I think a hot pocket

256
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 was like a pop tart,

257
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 but I think it's slightly different.

258
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 James, you prompted

259
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 an absolute avalanche

260
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 of hot baked goods

261
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 into the inbox.

262
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I think it's more like a pizza

263
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 that you put between

264
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 two slices of paper.

265
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Look, I'm not --

266
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I'm going to read out Kevin's message.

267
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I can't.

268
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I'm not going to steal his thunder.

269
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 One correction.

270
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 They are not caps lock on.

271
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Pop tarts, caps lock off.

272
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They are microwavable pastries

273
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 with fake meat and cheese

274
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 that, upon your first bite,

275
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 flow out with the searing heat

276
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 and destructive force of hot magma.

277
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And then make you regret

278
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 having a stomach afterwards.

279
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 I wonder what the fake meat is.

280
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Like, why not use meat?

281
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 What's a fake meat?

282
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I think --

283
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It is actual meat.

284
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Highly processed.

285
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Just highly processed.

286
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 It's a fine word for bad meat.

287
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 For multi-meat.

288
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Yeah.

289
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Sounds much better.

290
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What's it called?

291
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Is it called pink slime or something?

292
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Yeah, that's it.

293
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 It's the stuff where,

294
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 when you're making processed meat,

295
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 you scrape it off the sides

296
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 of the container.

297
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Okay.

298
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Yeah.

299
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Turn it into meat.

300
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Right.

301
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Which has already been water-blasted

302
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 off the body of the --

303
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Yeah.

304
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Anyway, that was the funniest

305
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 of the several messages we got

306
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 correcting us on the nature of --

307
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I'm sorry.

308
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 It's quite all right.

309
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You know what?

310
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I Googled it afterwards

311
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 when I was editing,

312
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 and I knew I'd got it wrong,

313
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 but I thought,

314
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 "Surely, even our listeners

315
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 will be quibbled off."

316
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I think you got it right.

317
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Oh, interesting.

318
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Well, I mean --

319
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 A pop-top has to be sweet in my books.

320
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yeah, but it's some goo wrapped up

321
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 in some carbohydrate.

322
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Like, that's -- and heated.

323
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I mean, that's what we're basically

324
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 talking about.

325
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Basic description, yeah.

326
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Would you say a bagel's the same

327
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 as a doughnut?

328
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Sorry.

329
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It's the same analogy.

330
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I'm saying a lot of our audiences

331
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 in the U.K.

332
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 They might not know what a hot

333
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 pocket is.

334
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I didn't know what a hot pocket was.

335
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 You know, I don't really know

336
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 what a pop-top is, to be honest,

337
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 but I can clean up a bit closer

338
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 to that.

339
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 You just go into the shop

340
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 and say,

341
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 "Do you have any carbohydrates

342
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 which are completely surrounding

343
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 some kind of goop?"

344
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Yeah.

345
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 But I'll let the goop

346
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 be made of grouse, please.

347
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Long-time listener,

349
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Thomas Kenney,

350
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 writes,

351
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 "Wanting to nerd out on a joke

352
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 as we're having at the end of

353
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 the episode when discussing

354
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 cake-o the whale."

355
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Oh, yeah.

356
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Free Willy.

357
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Y'all.

358
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 It's funny when you hear cake-o,

359
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 because obviously when we were

360
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 researching it, it was written

361
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 down, and you obviously see it

362
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 as K-E-I-K-O, but when you hear

363
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 it, I thought we must be doing

364
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 a baked goods section, and it

365
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 was some cake, you know,

366
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 superhero cake-o to the rescue.

367
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 How does he or she rescue

368
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 people?

369
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 By putting, it's people who

370
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 are throwing themselves off

371
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 buildings, and you always slide

372
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 sponge cake underneath.

373
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Lovely.

374
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 What, so they can just produce

375
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 sponge cake from, like,

376
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Spider-Man's web?

377
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Which RFS does it come from?

378
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So, cake-o's the superhero.

379
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Yeah, cake-o's the superhero.

380
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Oh, sorry, the superhero fan.

381
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Yeah, sponge cake comes out of

382
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 all their skin pores.

383
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Oh, okay, so it's a mutation

384
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 rather than like a Batman

385
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 situation where it's just like

386
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 he's rich.

387
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Yeah, he doesn't bring loads

388
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 of expensive cake.

389
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Okay.

390
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He's like an X-man,

391
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 but also a flower man,

392
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 also a butter man.

393
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Yeah.

394
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Jesus.

395
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Do you think cake-o might save

396
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 more lives, rather than just

397
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 putting bits of cake at the

398
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 bottom of buildings where people

399
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 have fallen off, then to sort of,

400
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 like, I don't know, base himself

401
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 in a third-world country and just

402
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 feed people with a constant

403
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 supply of food.

404
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Oh, with catastrophic sugar

405
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 overload.

406
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Just at least just to give them

407
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 like...

408
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I mean, yeah, it's kind of...

409
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 You can have sugar-free cakes.

410
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 We'd actually...

411
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I should have asked.

412
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Sorry for not asking.

413
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Can cake-o produce...

414
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Can he turn up or down the dial

415
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 of the nutritious quality of the

416
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 cake?

417
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Yeah.

418
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I was thinking he was more on the

419
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 bagel side of the donut in its

420
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 terms of sugar content.

421
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's...

422
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Well, the thing about cake-o is

423
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 much like the...

424
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Is it the Hulk who doesn't

425
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 can't really control when he

426
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 turns?

427
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Can't control the kind of cake

428
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 that comes out.

429
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So whatever is needed in the

430
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 moment, he produces.

431
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I think so.

432
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Produces.

433
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And now it is not to question

434
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 how he decides to use it.

435
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So if he's feeding our hungry

436
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 people, I'm sure his body would

437
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 reduce the sugar content and all

438
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 the bad stuff.

439
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Yeah.

440
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I think it's Thomas' email.

441
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 That's about whales.

442
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I hear the whale.

443
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Yeah.

444
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I hesitate to pause and

445
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 otherwise promising franchises

446
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 in his tracks.

447
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Okay.

448
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 You all cracked up at Dan for

449
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 mentioning cake-o wouldn't be

450
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 used to that salted water pool's

451
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 altitude, making jokes about the

452
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 sea level being the same.

453
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 You uno-reversed yourselves.

454
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Amazing.

455
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I learned on your podcast, I'm

456
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 pretty sure, because you're the

457
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 only fact podcast I listen to,

458
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 that sea level isn't the same

459
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 everywhere on earth.

460
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 K-O.

461
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 K-E-I.

462
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Brilliant.

463
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I don't have an answer for that.

464
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I guess that is kind of true.

465
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But the difference isn't enough.

466
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Yeah.

467
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Unless you're very sensitive.

468
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 You've got a very sensitive

469
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 stomach.

470
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 But no, it's a fair point.

471
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Yeah.

472
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Thank you, Thomas.

473
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Thank you.

474
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 As you can see, we're all

475
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 grappling to come up with a good

476
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 answer for it.

477
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 We don't.

478
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The real problem is that we can't

479
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 think of a good answer for it.

480
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And if we don't answer it

481
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 correctly, then we can't use any

482
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 of the K-Kos stuff.

483
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Yes.

484
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I think we can answer it

485
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 correctly by saying you're

486
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 absolutely right, Thomas.

487
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Good point.

488
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And thank you for only listening

489
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 to our podcast.

490
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Continue not to listen to any

491
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 others.

492
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Yes.

493
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Yes.

494
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And also, you owe no

495
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 proprietary rights to cake-o.

496
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 No, absolutely not.

497
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 OK.

498
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 We come on to the thorny

499
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 matter of Chicago.

500
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 OK.

501
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 BJ Woodstein writes, someone,

502
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Anna, I think, referred to

503
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Chicago being the windy city

504
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 because of the weather.

505
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's true that it's on Lake

506
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Michigan and it can be quite

507
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 cold and windy.

508
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Can I just interject now?

509
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 No, I don't think.

510
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 No, I'm actually doubting you

511
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 can.

512
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Can I just?

513
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I'm going to steamroll

514
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 forward for a little bit.

515
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Can I just say that the hand

516
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 gestures right now around the

517
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 table are something.

518
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I'm talking to the hand.

519
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Don't be mad at me.

520
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I need to capture this.

521
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Absolutely.

522
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 OK.

523
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 We come on to the thorny

524
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 matter of Chicago.

525
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 OK.

526
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Can you capture this?

527
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 As a Chicagoan.

528
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 As a Chicagoan, it's not called

529
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 the windy city because of the

530
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 wind.

531
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It's called it because of the

532
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 politicians.

533
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Look, as if QI didn't invent

534
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 that fact about series A.

535
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Hand is still up.

536
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Everybody's hand is still up.

537
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But I don't think that's what

538
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 you said, though, Anna.

539
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 You said it was because of the

540
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 wind.

541
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 The thing is, it's a

542
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 misconception because Chicago

543
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 is very windy, famously.

544
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So people think it must be

545
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 called the windy city because

546
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 of the wind.

547
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 OK.

548
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Whereas it's because of the

549
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 politicians.

550
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I'd be amazed if I said it was

551
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 because of the wind.

552
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I'm pretty sure you did.

553
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Well, call me amazed.

554
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And thank you for the correction.

555
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Well, it's...

556
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Sorry.

557
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Read the email.

558
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 They'll explain it more

559
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 politely than I have.

560
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 B.J. Woodstein has made

561
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 exactly those points.

562
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 She does also add, actually, in

563
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 something that provoked as much

564
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 roiling in the inbox as hot

565
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 pockets, "Incidentally, as a

566
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 woman from Chicago, I don't have

567
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 large feet."

568
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Oh, I never said that she did.

569
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I just said that they were famous

570
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 in the 19th century for having

571
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 big feet.

572
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I know.

573
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Elaine Wiseman, she writes, "I'm

574
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 not sure who's reading emails

575
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 this week.

576
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 It's me, Elaine, as every week.

577
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 But please let James know that

578
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 in my 28 years of living in and

579
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 around Chicago, women with big

580
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 feet have never been a thing."

581
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 No.

582
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Was she around in the 19th

583
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 century?

584
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 28 years, can't be.

585
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 She's barely around in the

586
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 20th century.

587
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 So what has happened to the

588
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 women of Chicago?

589
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Well, no.

590
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Their feet have shrunk.

591
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Can I add a third email from

592
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Ms. Crisley, who writes, "I'm

593
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 sick of these jokes about my

594
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 giant feet."

595
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I'm 190 years old.

596
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I grew up near Chicago, and my

597
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 whole family has huge feet.

598
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Yes.

599
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I mean, I actually think this is

600
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 genuinely interesting, because I

601
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 think, like we said on the time,

602
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 it's very clear that people in

603
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Chicago won't have above-average

604
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 feet, but they did have this

605
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 reputation, and if you look in

606
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 the newspaper archives, it's all

607
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 in there.

608
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But it sounds like they've

609
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 migrated to just outside of the

610
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 main Chicago area.

611
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Yeah.

612
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Just follow the footprints.

613
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 You'll find them.

614
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 I was staggered that you didn't

615
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 make a Bigfoot joke at the time,

616
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Dan.

617
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Okay.

618
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Are you writing a letter in?

619
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 No.

620
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I wouldn't have time to read it.

621
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Dan doesn't joke about Bigfoot.

622
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 No.

623
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Sorry.

624
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Sorry.

625
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Just a quick observation about

626
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 BJ is that I've only ever heard

627
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 people use that as the first two

628
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 the way of saying their name in

629
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 America.

630
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I can't think of any other -- I

631
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 know quite like BJ Novak, the

632
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 writer.

633
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Boris Johnson has never been

634
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 known as BJ.

635
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 No.

636
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It's a good observation.

637
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I'd love to know if there's any

638
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 BJs outside of America.

639
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Okay.

640
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Well, if you'd like to --

641
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Dan, Dan, making a call out for

642
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 BJs there on the podcast.

643
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 You heard it here first.

644
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 We're getting closer to that

645
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 cancellation line, aren't we?

646
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Mark Tween writes --

647
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 That's a fantastic name.

648
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 He wrote some young adult novels

649
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 about the American South, don't

650
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 you?

651
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Yeah.

652
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 He's from Cornwall.

653
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 He's a big fan of the show.

654
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Club Fish member.

655
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 So, hello, Mark, if you're

656
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 listening.

657
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I'm writing to you about a point

658
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 raised by James in episode 503

659
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 in reference to Walk in

660
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Freezers.

661
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I feel like I'm getting a lot

662
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 of --

663
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 This is positive.

664
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 There's no pushback at all.

665
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It's not a criticism, Mark

666
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 writes.

667
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It's not spicy meat.

668
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 People say that a lot when

669
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 they're about to criticize you,

670
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 don't they?

671
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 That's true.

672
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 But it was shit.

673
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 No, sorry.

674
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Just some friendly advice that

675
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 may help anyone that finds

676
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 themselves trapped in a freezer.

677
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Okay.

678
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I am a calibration engineer.

679
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 A nerdy job in itself.

680
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And one of the things I

681
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 often calibrate is a walk-in

682
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 freezer.

683
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 As James correctly stated,

684
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 these do have a button on the

685
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 inside for opening the door.

686
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 In the episode, James recalls a

687
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 story from a butcher who said a

688
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 large black pudding is the best

689
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 thing to use as a battering

690
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 ram.

691
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Yes.

692
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 My boss once got trapped in a

693
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 walk-in freezer and the emergency

694
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 button failed.

695
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Uh-oh.

696
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He didn't have large pieces of

697
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 frozen meat to hand.

698
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 What about a large Swiss roll?

699
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I'll give it to him by Keiko.

700
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Where's he produced that from?

701
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 No, it's a family-friendly

702
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 comment.

703
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Is it?

704
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Okay.

705
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It is, yeah.

706
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Well, I love this.

707
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So instead, my boss wrapped his

708
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 hands around the freezer

709
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 temperature sensor.

710
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Most industrial freezers have

711
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 an alarm that will sound when

712
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 the temperature gets too high.

713
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 His hands warmed the sensor

714
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 enough to raise the alarm and

715
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 someone came to the freezer and

716
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 opened the door.

717
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 That is quite amazing.

718
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That's brilliant, isn't it?

719
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Another tip, because your hands

720
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 might get too cold.

721
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It might not work.

722
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Try internal, because your

723
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 internal temperature will stay

724
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 high longer than your hand

725
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 temperature.

726
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Sorry, what do you mean?

727
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Like, sort of climb nude on top

728
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 of the temperature sensor?

729
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I haven't worked out all the

730
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 details.

731
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 But if...

732
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Yeah.

733
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Or if you like fish one of your

734
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 organs out and plant it on top

735
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 of it.

736
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 But that's a great fact.

737
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That is unbelievable.

738
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Really good.

739
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Really like that.

740
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So thank you, Mark.

741
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Dr Alexander Mayer, associate

742
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 professor of classical studies

743
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 at the University of Western

744
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Ontario.

745
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Does it listen?

746
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 It has blocked your

747
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 non-listener of the week.

748
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I'm a long-time listener of

749
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 the podcast.

750
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I think I've heard all 506

751
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 episodes.

752
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Right.

753
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And a professor of classical

754
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 studies in Canada.

755
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 For 20 years, I've been

756
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 involved in excavations and

757
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 research at Vindolanda Roman

758
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Fort on Hadrian's Wall.

759
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Oh!

760
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 In June of 2022, you mentioned

761
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 we had found a stone on the

762
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 site that had an enormous

763
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 carved phallus.

764
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Oh, yeah.

765
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And the inscription's

766
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 secondenous cacor.

767
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Oh, yes.

768
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 It was the poor or the shitter

769
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 or something.

770
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Anyway, yeah.

771
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Yeah.

772
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 In the process, you mentioned

773
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 the researchers who published

774
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 the press release about it.

775
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Well, as it happens, I am one

776
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 of those researchers.

777
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And therefore, you came just

778
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 two words from fulfilling a

779
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 dream of mine, namely being

780
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 mentioned on your show.

781
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Oh.

782
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Turns out, you now have

783
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 another chance.

784
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 The print version of the full

785
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 article that my colleagues,

786
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Alex Mullen and Eunice Van

787
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Halle, and I wrote about it,

788
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 just came out in a recent

789
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 volume of the Journal of

790
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Britannia.

791
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I thought you might like to

792
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 follow up.

793
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Just mentioned my name this

794
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 time, eh?

795
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 [LAUGHTER]

796
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 What was that person?

797
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Actually, never mind.

798
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I've said it before.

799
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 [LAUGHTER]

800
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 That was an incredible person

801
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 to write in.

802
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Very excited.

803
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I feel a bit starstruck.

804
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 We get the great and the good

805
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 in the inbox.

806
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 We do.

807
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 We do.

808
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I've got one more thing for

809
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 you.

810
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Oh, yeah.

811
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Do you remember we had this

812
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 story about the cost of beans

813
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 in 1996 being minus 2p?

814
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Oh, yes.

815
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Yeah.

816
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Yeah.

817
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 So Fraser Johnson writes,

818
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 "This isn't really a factor

819
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 search, but I wanted to share

820
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 a story from a few years back.

821
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I had a part-time job at

822
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Sainsbury's when I was in

823
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 college, 2000 and 2001.

824
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I, along with numerous other

825
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 colleagues, cottoned on to a

826
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 glitch within the checkout

827
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 system, where if an item was

828
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 part of a multi-buy deal, but

829
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 was also reduced due to its

830
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 shelf life, the item's full

831
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 price would be deducted from

832
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 your shopping bill.

833
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 So if a $1.99 pizza was on

834
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Buy, 1, Get, 1, Free, and then

835
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 reduced to 1.50, you could buy

836
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 2 for 99p because the till

837
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 would add 2.98 to the bill, but

838
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 still deduct 1.99, basically.

839
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 So, right.

840
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 There's a good loophole there.

841
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Sainsbury were not really

842
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 concerned because the offers

843
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 were funded by the suppliers

844
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 anyway.

845
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I'd be amazed if they could

846
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 make a massive loss based on

847
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 the quite limited selection of

848
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 stuff.

849
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Well, listen on, Anna.

850
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 No, I'm not captivated then.

851
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Obviously, this resulted in

852
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 some epic bargains, but none

853
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 better than when on New Year's

854
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Eve 2000, I discovered that, as

855
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 the store was closed the

856
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 following day, a large quantity

857
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 of avocados had been reduced to

858
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 just 10p each, and they were

859
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Buy, 1, Get, 1, Free.

860
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 They were originally 69p.

861
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I walked out at the end of my

862
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 shift, fully armed for New Year's

863
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Festivities with a bottle of

864
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 vodka, some party poppers, 20

865
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Marlborough, some king-size

866
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Risler, and various nibbles, as

867
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 well as 104 avocados.

868
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 For the princely sum of 9p,

869
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 what?

870
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 That's so good.

871
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Isn't that great?

872
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Was that on New Year's Eve 2000?

873
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I wonder if that was New Year's

874
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Eve without the Millennium.

875
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 That was it.

876
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That was how you spent the

877
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Millennium.

878
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Isn't that great?

879
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Imagine ending the thousand

880
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 years of mankind with that.

881
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Incredible.

882
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 So thank you, Fraser.

883
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 What a great bargain.

884
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 You're all skeptical when I said

885
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I've got a good story about a

886
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 bargain.

887
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Best story I've ever heard.

888
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Can I quickly, because we were

889
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 talking about beans, so that

890
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 episode Anne Miller was on, so

891
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Anne messaged me because she's

892
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 gotten a few droppers of lines

893
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 herself about that episode, and

894
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 she said there were three sizes

895
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 of Heinz beans containers.

896
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 She was a bean expert, and we

897
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 went into quite a lot of detail

898
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 about the number of sizes of

899
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 beans, but apparently she'd

900
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 missed a fourth size of bean.

901
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And yeah, she's been getting

902
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 messages about that.

903
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Apparently there were four sizes

904
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 of Heinz beans containers.

905
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 There are two smaller tins around

906
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 here in various supermarkets,

907
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 plus the big size, plus the

908
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 snack pots, says someone to Anne

909
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 by text message, which she sent

910
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 me.

911
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So she would like to, she's not

912
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 here to defend herself, she would

913
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 like to apologize to any bean

914
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 aficionados out there who were

915
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 offended by her lack of bean

916
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 knowledge.

917
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Did you talk about flicking beans

918
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 on the episode?

919
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Yeah, but I only in the very literal

920
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 sense.

921
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 We did get an email from a satchel

922
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 saying, "Sorry, can I just explain,

923
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 oh Dad, you should explain what

924
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 happened."

925
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Yeah, I was, and I know what this

926
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 is going to be, and I have a

927
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 response prepared written for me.

928
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Why is everyone pre-delivering

929
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 their responses?

930
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 No, I didn't know you were going

931
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 to bring this up.

932
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 It's someone, someone wrote to me

933
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 about it.

934
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So I met Greg Wallace, who's the

935
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 master chef guy, he's one of the

936
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 guys on there, and he randomly

937
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 walked up to me and just said,

938
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 "Do you want to hear a bean fact?"

939
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I just didn't know who I was.

940
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 I thought he must have known I was

941
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 on fish.

942
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Nothing.

943
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And then he said that there's a

944
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 laser at the factories where if

945
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 they see that there's an abnormal

946
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 bean, they'll shoot a laser at it

947
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 and flick the bean off.

948
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 That is the story.

949
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And so Greg Wallace was like,

950
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 "They have a literal bean flicker."

951
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Yeah.

952
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 And there's, I believe, a rude

953
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 meaning to that phrase.

954
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Yeah.

955
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Sasha writes, "Sitting here, having

956
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 just finished the episode, in stunned

957
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 amazement, that in a piece where the

958
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 phrases 'flick the bean' and 'bean

959
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 flicker' were used, nobody commented

960
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 on the generally accepted usage of

961
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 those phrases.

962
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It feels like there's no such thing

963
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 as official equivalent of Ronaldo

964
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 not scoring an open goal."

965
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 You guys need a new segment and

966
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 drop us a line.

967
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Mr. Sitter.

968
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I think perhaps it was more like

969
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Ronaldo got to the goal.

970
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 He thought, "You know what?

971
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I've shown that I can do this."

972
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Yeah.

973
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Probably don't.

974
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 We're already winning 5-0.

975
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Yeah.

976
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Sometimes when we say something

977
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 that's so obviously rude and we're

978
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 saying it, a look goes around and

979
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 we continue the chat because we

980
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 think, "Who's going to go there?

981
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Do we need to go there?

982
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 No, let's just keep going on."

983
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Yeah.

984
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 You can't see our eyes.

985
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 At that point, there was a look

986
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 where it was, "No, it's too

987
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 smarty.

988
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Let's just carry on."

989
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Fair enough.

990
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Too smarty.

991
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 We're flattering ourselves there.

992
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 The truth is...

993
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 No, just sometimes.

994
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 No, it's not that it's too smarty.

995
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 We've never ever rejected anything

996
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 because it's too smarty.

997
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Be honest with ourselves.

998
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It's because we can't think of the

999
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 funny thing to say.

1000
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 It's like seeing the open goal and

1001
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 tripping over the ball.

1002
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Sometimes something's so obvious.

1003
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 You're like, "Oh, I can't make it

1004
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 funnier than that phrase."

1005
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 This is Anna's internal process.

1006
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It doesn't apply to all of us,

1007
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 we should say.

1008
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 I thought it was funny enough as it

1009
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 was.

1010
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I didn't need it.

1011
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Having listened to it, I agree.

1012
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 That's what I mean.

1013
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 It's like you're going to derail the

1014
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 conversation to make some kind of...

1015
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 There is a possibility.

1016
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Oh, we would never derail a

1017
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 conversation.

1018
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Not always.

1019
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 We have to hold our bags.

1020
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Who's that out of the window?

1021
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 It's Keiko.

1022
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I think we could possibly in the

1023
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 future invent something where we

1024
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 get like eyeballs and you can have

1025
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 them in your room while you're

1026
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 listening to the podcast, but they're

1027
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 attached to our own eyeballs.

1028
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 So the eyeballs in your room move in

1029
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 the same way that our eyeballs are

1030
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 actually moving when we're doing the

1031
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 show.

1032
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Interesting.

1033
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So it gives you an extra experience.

1034
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And you can see us.

1035
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 You can see just the eyeballs, not the

1036
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 rest of the face.

1037
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 They knew.

1038
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 They knew.

1039
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 The thing we've been doing when we

1040
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 filmed clips of this show, you'd like

1041
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 us to really focus in on just our

1042
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 eyes.

1043
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Well, I was reading the other day that

1044
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 John Dalton, who named Daltonism,

1045
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 which is colourblindness, he gave his

1046
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 eyes to the Museum of Science and

1047
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Industry, and they are there.

1048
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 You can just see the eyes.

1049
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 James is offering to donate his own

1050
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 eyes to one lucky listener who wants

1051
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 to have nightmares for the rest of

1052
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 their lives.

1053
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Thanks, everybody.

1054
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Please keep writing in to

1055
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 podcast@qi.com with your emails.

1056
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 You've been hearing other people's

1057
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 emails, unless you were featured in

1058
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 this show, but send in your own.

1059
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Can I just say something quickly?

1060
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So just to talk about the elephant in

1061
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 the room, if you only ever came to

1062
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Club Fish because you didn't like the

1063
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 adverts, you can now go to BBC Sounds

1064
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 and get the podcast with no adverts

1065
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 for free.

1066
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You are allowed to do that.

1067
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 That would be absolutely fine.

1068
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 But you would miss this absolute

1069
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 gold dust of bonus material.

1070
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Yeah.

1071
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 You want to miss this outro to a

1072
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 show?

1073
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I don't think so.

1074
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Can I do the BBC Sounds version

1075
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 rather than come here every week?

1076
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Yeah.

1077
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 No, we love it.

1078
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 No, we love you guys being here.

1079
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And thank you so much for subscribing

1080
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 to Club Fish.

1081
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 It really means a lot to us to have

1082
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 this community, but we just want to

1083
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 say, yeah, that option is open to

1084
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 you.

1085
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Yeah.

1086
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 But don't take it.

1087
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Don't do it.

1088
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 But you can.

1089
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 But don't.

1090
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 We'll see you.

1091
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Wherever you are.

1092
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Brilliant.

1093
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Bye.
