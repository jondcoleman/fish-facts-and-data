00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hi!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Hi Andy!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Hello!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Hi everybody!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hi everyone at home!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Yeah, alright.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Sort of my thing to say.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Yeah, I mean, no, no, no, that's good, yeah.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 I just felt like I was excluding

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 7 billion people

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 by only saying hi to you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 That's fair.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Well, hi to all of you.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 As James said, I don't need to go on

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and say that we're hosting...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Can I just say my hi as to everyone at home as well?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 I don't want to feel like Anna and I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 suddenly were just saying hi to you guys

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 and you've expressed a hello.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 I was.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Okay, Anna has.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 That's specifically Andy, yeah.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Okay, well what we're here to do

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 is to have a session of Drop as a Line,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 the audience feedback show

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 that is now well-established,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 and I don't think really needs any

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 OTOs defining.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 You know, screw it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 It's not been cancelled yet, amazingly.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Well, it goes to such a small audience

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 that really helps.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 It's like, it would be like a small newsletter

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 being cancelled.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 You know, it's harder to do.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 If no one sees you being

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 cancelable, then it's hard to know.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 But we've had a lot of amazing feedback

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 since the last time we recorded one of these.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Great.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Some good stuff.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 About this show or the main show?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Not about this show.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 About the one we're recording now,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 they actually say the beginning is awful.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Right, here we go.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Something from...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Well, this is a great thing to start.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 This is from someone called Brandy Folk.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 A fantastic name.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Very popular over Christmas, I reckon.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Get the Brandy Folk round.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 So, I was listening to the episode,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 "There is no such thing as a meat cute."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Remember that?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Talked about meat judging.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Okay.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And this actually happened.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 My parents met when both of them

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 were on meat judging teams.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Wow.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 My dad at Ohio State,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 my mum at Michigan State,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 they first met each other

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 in a meat cooler in Cincinnati, Ohio

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 for a meat judging competition.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Wow.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 They hooked up right after.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Hooked up.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Hooked up.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Brilliant.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And have now been married for 33 years.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Isn't that nice?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 That's a wonderful story.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 That's fantastic.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 I know.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 And then Brandy adds another fact,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 because she's from meat stock.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Yeah.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Another fact is that there is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 livestock judging at market shows

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 where the judge judges the best of the animal

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 before it is a carcass

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 and then again after it is a carcass.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Wow.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 That was a competition

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 where you do so well in the first half.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 You go to your death thinking,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 "I've got this in the back."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Yeah.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Or you do really badly in the first half,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 but you go, "It's all right.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 I'll make it up in the next round."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 A few pittings of wood and corpse.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Yeah.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And now it's time for sudden death.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 What?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Oh, my God.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Oh, dear.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 So thank you, Brandy.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Very cool.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Great start.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Great anecdote.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Craig Baker writes,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 "I was just listening to your recent

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 episode of Fish One.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 I heard you guys discussing pond creation."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 "I was surprised."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 I love it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 "I was surprised."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Andy's looking directly at it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 "My parents both met."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Taking a pond.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 "I was surprised

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 not to hear a word about wild boar."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Oh, okay.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 "There are 2,600 wild boar living in the UK

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 and they've been documented by many,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 including me."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 That's Craig, not me.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Yeah.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 "Using their elongated nose bones

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 to dig out little ponds or wallows."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 These wallows are built by the boar

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 to create places to wash and cool down,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 but they also allow habitat and breeding sites

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 for countless insects and amphibians.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Do you know what?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 I didn't know there were so many wild boar in there.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Don't mean either.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 I knew they were on the continent,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 but I didn't know here.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 I'm very skeptical.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 I've never seen one.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Except I think I once saw a wild boar carcass.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Again, I don't know what it would have scored

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 in the context.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Really good though.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 But I couldn't tell if it was a badger or a wild boar.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 It was either a badger whose hair had all come off

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 or a boar, and that's the only time.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Those two things are very different sizes.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Actually, when something's been kind of mangled

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 by various cars running over it,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 it's quite hard, I think, to distinguish.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 So many of your anecdotes are about,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 "I saw these..."

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Do you remember?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 I saw 50 squashed frogs once.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 I saw these moles hanging up dead on a fence, and it's...

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Yeah, I remember.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Well, they're quite striking anecdotes, aren't they?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 They lead a very sort of primal, earthy life, I think.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Yeah, I come from sort of medieval...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 All my stories are about cocktail bars I've been in,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 and witnesses of my might have traded.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 But they were all when you were living in Stoke Newington,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 weren't they?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 That's true, yeah.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Okay, here's another one.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 This is a new section I've inaugurated,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 which is called, "You Said It Wrong."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Oh, no.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Oh, God, pronunciation stuff.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And it's from someone called Don Anthony.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 He doesn't specify whether his name is Donald

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 or whether he's in the mafia.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 So...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 "Being born raised and still living on the island of..."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Sicily.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Yeah, I was most displeased to hear.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 No, Newfoundland, right?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Oh, Newfoundland.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And I don't even know how I'm saying it.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 I'm always chuffed to hear reference to my home

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 or one of my favorite podcasts,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 which all happen to be British.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 So every time I hear it pronounced,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 I respond with the correct pronunciation

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 as though you could hear me.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 The primary issue is that it is pronounced

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 "Newfoundland" with the emphasis on the land.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Think "Understand" or "Disneyland."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 I'm pretty sure that's Newfoundland.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Newfoundland is about you're not stressing the land.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Newfoundland.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 I really have to land on the land.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Yeah, but Don says...

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Newfoundland.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Don't feel bad about it.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Half of Canada says it wrong.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 There's a pleasing thought of Don Anthony

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 wandering around Newfoundland saying out loud,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 "Newfoundland!" as he goes.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 The second, possibly more pedantic point, incredible,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 is that the province is actually called

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Newfoundland and Labrador.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Yeah.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Yes, the two dog breeds.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Yes.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 The four.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Yeah, he doesn't specify.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Newfoundland is the island portion of the province

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 while Labrador is located immediately

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 to the northwest of the island.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 So there you go.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Lovely.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Lovely stuff.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Thank you.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Okay.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Next up is a drop-as-a-line spiral

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 where it's referring to something

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 we said on the last drop-as-a-line.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Okay.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Yeah.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Haven't got a good name for this yet,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 but very, very open to suggestions.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Okay.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Think about that.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 While you think about that,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 think about Kevin Tate's message.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 You read a message.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Russian duel,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 like a Russian doll.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 That's good.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Well done.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 But it's duel for drop-as-a-line.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Brilliant.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 There we go.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 That's it.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 I'm going to actually make a little note of that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 You read a message,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Kevin Tate writes,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 about roller derby fans

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 singing the Hot Pockets theme for a player.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 She was called --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Yes.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 She was called twat rocket.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Twat or twat rocket.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Yeah.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Because we had a long debate

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 over the pronunciation of twat

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 and what another hot pocket is.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Well, yeah.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 We've been corrected

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 on one of those two issues.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Okay.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 I think a hot pocket

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 was like a pop tart,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 but I think it's slightly different.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 James, you prompted

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 an absolute avalanche

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 of hot baked goods

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 into the inbox.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 I think it's more like a pizza

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 that you put between

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 two slices of paper.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Look, I'm not --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 I'm going to read out Kevin's message.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I can't.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 I'm not going to steal his thunder.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 One correction.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 They are not caps lock on.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Pop tarts, caps lock off.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 They are microwavable pastries

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 with fake meat and cheese

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 that, upon your first bite,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 flow out with the searing heat

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 and destructive force of hot magma.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 And then make you regret

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 having a stomach afterwards.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 I wonder what the fake meat is.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Like, why not use meat?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 What's a fake meat?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 I think --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 It is actual meat.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Highly processed.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Just highly processed.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 It's a fine word for bad meat.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 For multi-meat.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Yeah.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Sounds much better.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 What's it called?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Is it called pink slime or something?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Yeah, that's it.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 It's the stuff where,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 when you're making processed meat,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 you scrape it off the sides

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 of the container.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Okay.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Yeah.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Turn it into meat.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Right.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Which has already been water-blasted

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 off the body of the --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Yeah.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Anyway, that was the funniest

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 of the several messages we got

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 correcting us on the nature of --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 I'm sorry.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It's quite all right.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 You know what?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I Googled it afterwards

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 when I was editing,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 and I knew I'd got it wrong,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 but I thought,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 "Surely, even our listeners

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 will be quibbled off."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 I think you got it right.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Oh, interesting.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Well, I mean --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 A pop-top has to be sweet in my books.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Yeah, but it's some goo wrapped up

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 in some carbohydrate.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Like, that's -- and heated.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 I mean, that's what we're basically

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 talking about.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Basic description, yeah.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Would you say a bagel's the same

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 as a doughnut?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Sorry.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 It's the same analogy.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 I'm saying a lot of our audiences

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 in the U.K.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 They might not know what a hot

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 pocket is.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 I didn't know what a hot pocket was.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 You know, I don't really know

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 what a pop-top is, to be honest,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 but I can clean up a bit closer

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 to that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 You just go into the shop

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 and say,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 "Do you have any carbohydrates

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 which are completely surrounding

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 some kind of goop?"

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Yeah.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 But I'll let the goop

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 be made of grouse, please.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Long-time listener,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Thomas Kenney,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 writes,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 "Wanting to nerd out on a joke

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 as we're having at the end of

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 the episode when discussing

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 cake-o the whale."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Free Willy.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Y'all.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 It's funny when you hear cake-o,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 because obviously when we were

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 researching it, it was written

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 down, and you obviously see it

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 as K-E-I-K-O, but when you hear

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 it, I thought we must be doing

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 a baked goods section, and it

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 was some cake, you know,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 superhero cake-o to the rescue.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 How does he or she rescue

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 people?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 By putting, it's people who

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 are throwing themselves off

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 buildings, and you always slide

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 sponge cake underneath.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Lovely.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 What, so they can just produce

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 sponge cake from, like,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Spider-Man's web?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Which RFS does it come from?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 So, cake-o's the superhero.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Yeah, cake-o's the superhero.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Oh, sorry, the superhero fan.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Yeah, sponge cake comes out of

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 all their skin pores.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Oh, okay, so it's a mutation

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 rather than like a Batman

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 situation where it's just like

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 he's rich.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Yeah, he doesn't bring loads

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 of expensive cake.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Okay.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 He's like an X-man,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 but also a flower man,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 also a butter man.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Yeah.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Jesus.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Do you think cake-o might save

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 more lives, rather than just

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 putting bits of cake at the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 bottom of buildings where people

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 have fallen off, then to sort of,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 like, I don't know, base himself

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 in a third-world country and just

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 feed people with a constant

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 supply of food.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Oh, with catastrophic sugar

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 overload.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Just at least just to give them

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 like...

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 I mean, yeah, it's kind of...

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 You can have sugar-free cakes.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 We'd actually...

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 I should have asked.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Sorry for not asking.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Can cake-o produce...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Can he turn up or down the dial

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 of the nutritious quality of the

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 cake?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Yeah.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 I was thinking he was more on the

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 bagel side of the donut in its

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 terms of sugar content.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 It's...

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Well, the thing about cake-o is

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 much like the...

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Is it the Hulk who doesn't

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 can't really control when he

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 turns?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Can't control the kind of cake

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 that comes out.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 So whatever is needed in the

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 moment, he produces.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 I think so.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Produces.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 And now it is not to question

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 how he decides to use it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 So if he's feeding our hungry

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 people, I'm sure his body would

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 reduce the sugar content and all

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 the bad stuff.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Yeah.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 I think it's Thomas' email.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 That's about whales.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 I hear the whale.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Yeah.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 I hesitate to pause and

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 otherwise promising franchises

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 in his tracks.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Okay.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 You all cracked up at Dan for

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 mentioning cake-o wouldn't be

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 used to that salted water pool's

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 altitude, making jokes about the

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 sea level being the same.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 You uno-reversed yourselves.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Amazing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 I learned on your podcast, I'm

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 pretty sure, because you're the

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 only fact podcast I listen to,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 that sea level isn't the same

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 everywhere on earth.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 K-O.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 K-E-I.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Brilliant.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 I don't have an answer for that.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 I guess that is kind of true.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 But the difference isn't enough.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Yeah.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Unless you're very sensitive.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 You've got a very sensitive

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 stomach.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 But no, it's a fair point.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Yeah.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Thank you, Thomas.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Thank you.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 As you can see, we're all

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 grappling to come up with a good

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 answer for it.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 We don't.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 The real problem is that we can't

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 think of a good answer for it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 And if we don't answer it

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 correctly, then we can't use any

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 of the K-Kos stuff.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Yes.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 I think we can answer it

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 correctly by saying you're

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 absolutely right, Thomas.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Good point.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 And thank you for only listening

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 to our podcast.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Continue not to listen to any

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 others.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Yes.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Yes.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And also, you owe no

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 proprietary rights to cake-o.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 No, absolutely not.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 OK.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 We come on to the thorny

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 matter of Chicago.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 OK.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 BJ Woodstein writes, someone,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Anna, I think, referred to

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Chicago being the windy city

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 because of the weather.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It's true that it's on Lake

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Michigan and it can be quite

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 cold and windy.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Can I just interject now?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 No, I don't think.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 No, I'm actually doubting you

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 can.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Can I just?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 I'm going to steamroll

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 forward for a little bit.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Can I just say that the hand

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 gestures right now around the

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 table are something.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 I'm talking to the hand.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Don't be mad at me.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 I need to capture this.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Absolutely.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 OK.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 We come on to the thorny

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 matter of Chicago.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 OK.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Can you capture this?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 As a Chicagoan.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 As a Chicagoan, it's not called

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 the windy city because of the

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 wind.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 It's called it because of the

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 politicians.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Look, as if QI didn't invent

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 that fact about series A.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Hand is still up.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Everybody's hand is still up.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 But I don't think that's what

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 you said, though, Anna.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 You said it was because of the

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 wind.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 The thing is, it's a

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 misconception because Chicago

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 is very windy, famously.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 So people think it must be

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 called the windy city because

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 of the wind.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 OK.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Whereas it's because of the

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 politicians.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 I'd be amazed if I said it was

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 because of the wind.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 I'm pretty sure you did.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Well, call me amazed.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 And thank you for the correction.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Well, it's...

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Sorry.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Read the email.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 They'll explain it more

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 politely than I have.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 B.J. Woodstein has made

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 exactly those points.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 She does also add, actually, in

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 something that provoked as much

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 roiling in the inbox as hot

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 pockets, "Incidentally, as a

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 woman from Chicago, I don't have

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 large feet."

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Oh, I never said that she did.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 I just said that they were famous

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 in the 19th century for having

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 big feet.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 I know.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Elaine Wiseman, she writes, "I'm

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 not sure who's reading emails

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 this week.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 It's me, Elaine, as every week.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 But please let James know that

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 in my 28 years of living in and

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 around Chicago, women with big

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 feet have never been a thing."

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 No.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Was she around in the 19th

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 century?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 28 years, can't be.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 She's barely around in the

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 20th century.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 So what has happened to the

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 women of Chicago?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Well, no.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Their feet have shrunk.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Can I add a third email from

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Ms. Crisley, who writes, "I'm

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 sick of these jokes about my

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 giant feet."

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 I'm 190 years old.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 I grew up near Chicago, and my

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 whole family has huge feet.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Yes.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 I mean, I actually think this is

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 genuinely interesting, because I

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 think, like we said on the time,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 it's very clear that people in

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Chicago won't have above-average

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 feet, but they did have this

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 reputation, and if you look in

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 the newspaper archives, it's all

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 in there.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 But it sounds like they've

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 migrated to just outside of the

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 main Chicago area.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Yeah.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 Just follow the footprints.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 You'll find them.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 I was staggered that you didn't

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 make a Bigfoot joke at the time,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Dan.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Okay.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Are you writing a letter in?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 No.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 I wouldn't have time to read it.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Dan doesn't joke about Bigfoot.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 No.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Sorry.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Sorry.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Just a quick observation about

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 BJ is that I've only ever heard

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 people use that as the first two

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 the way of saying their name in

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 America.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 I can't think of any other -- I

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 know quite like BJ Novak, the

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 writer.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Boris Johnson has never been

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 known as BJ.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 No.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 It's a good observation.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 I'd love to know if there's any

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 BJs outside of America.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Okay.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Well, if you'd like to --

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Dan, Dan, making a call out for

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 BJs there on the podcast.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 You heard it here first.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 We're getting closer to that

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 cancellation line, aren't we?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Mark Tween writes --

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 That's a fantastic name.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 He wrote some young adult novels

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 about the American South, don't

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 you?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Yeah.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 He's from Cornwall.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 He's a big fan of the show.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Club Fish member.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 So, hello, Mark, if you're

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 listening.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 I'm writing to you about a point

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 raised by James in episode 503

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 in reference to Walk in

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Freezers.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 I feel like I'm getting a lot

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 of --

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 This is positive.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 There's no pushback at all.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 It's not a criticism, Mark

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 writes.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 It's not spicy meat.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 People say that a lot when

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 they're about to criticize you,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 don't they?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 That's true.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 But it was shit.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 No, sorry.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Just some friendly advice that

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 may help anyone that finds

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 themselves trapped in a freezer.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Okay.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 I am a calibration engineer.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 A nerdy job in itself.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And one of the things I

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 often calibrate is a walk-in

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 freezer.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 As James correctly stated,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 these do have a button on the

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 inside for opening the door.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 In the episode, James recalls a

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 story from a butcher who said a

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 large black pudding is the best

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 thing to use as a battering

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 ram.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Yes.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 My boss once got trapped in a

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 walk-in freezer and the emergency

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 button failed.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Uh-oh.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 He didn't have large pieces of

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 frozen meat to hand.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 What about a large Swiss roll?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 I'll give it to him by Keiko.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Where's he produced that from?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 No, it's a family-friendly

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 comment.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Is it?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Okay.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 It is, yeah.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Well, I love this.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 So instead, my boss wrapped his

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 hands around the freezer

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 temperature sensor.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Most industrial freezers have

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 an alarm that will sound when

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 the temperature gets too high.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 His hands warmed the sensor

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 enough to raise the alarm and

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 someone came to the freezer and

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 opened the door.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 That is quite amazing.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 That's brilliant, isn't it?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Another tip, because your hands

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 might get too cold.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 It might not work.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Try internal, because your

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 internal temperature will stay

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 high longer than your hand

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 temperature.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Sorry, what do you mean?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Like, sort of climb nude on top

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 of the temperature sensor?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 I haven't worked out all the

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 details.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 But if...

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Yeah.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Or if you like fish one of your

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 organs out and plant it on top

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 of it.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 But that's a great fact.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 That is unbelievable.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Really good.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Really like that.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 So thank you, Mark.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Dr Alexander Mayer, associate

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 professor of classical studies

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 at the University of Western

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Ontario.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Does it listen?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 It has blocked your

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 non-listener of the week.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I'm a long-time listener of

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 the podcast.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 I think I've heard all 506

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 episodes.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Right.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 And a professor of classical

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 studies in Canada.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 For 20 years, I've been

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 involved in excavations and

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 research at Vindolanda Roman

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Fort on Hadrian's Wall.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Oh!

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 In June of 2022, you mentioned

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 we had found a stone on the

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 site that had an enormous

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 carved phallus.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 And the inscription's

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 secondenous cacor.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Oh, yes.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 It was the poor or the shitter

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 or something.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Anyway, yeah.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Yeah.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 In the process, you mentioned

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 the researchers who published

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 the press release about it.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Well, as it happens, I am one

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 of those researchers.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And therefore, you came just

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 two words from fulfilling a

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 dream of mine, namely being

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 mentioned on your show.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Oh.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Turns out, you now have

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 another chance.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 The print version of the full

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 article that my colleagues,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Alex Mullen and Eunice Van

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Halle, and I wrote about it,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 just came out in a recent

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 volume of the Journal of

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Britannia.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 I thought you might like to

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 follow up.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Just mentioned my name this

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 time, eh?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 What was that person?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Actually, never mind.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 I've said it before.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 That was an incredible person

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 to write in.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Very excited.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 I feel a bit starstruck.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 We get the great and the good

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 in the inbox.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 We do.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 We do.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 I've got one more thing for

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 you.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Do you remember we had this

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 story about the cost of beans

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 in 1996 being minus 2p?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Oh, yes.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Yeah.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Yeah.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 So Fraser Johnson writes,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 "This isn't really a factor

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 search, but I wanted to share

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 a story from a few years back.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 I had a part-time job at

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Sainsbury's when I was in

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 college, 2000 and 2001.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 I, along with numerous other

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 colleagues, cottoned on to a

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 glitch within the checkout

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 system, where if an item was

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 part of a multi-buy deal, but

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 was also reduced due to its

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 shelf life, the item's full

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 price would be deducted from

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 your shopping bill.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 So if a $1.99 pizza was on

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Buy, 1, Get, 1, Free, and then

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 reduced to 1.50, you could buy

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 2 for 99p because the till

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 would add 2.98 to the bill, but

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 still deduct 1.99, basically.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 So, right.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 There's a good loophole there.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Sainsbury were not really

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 concerned because the offers

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 were funded by the suppliers

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 anyway.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I'd be amazed if they could

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 make a massive loss based on

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 the quite limited selection of

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 stuff.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Well, listen on, Anna.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 No, I'm not captivated then.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Obviously, this resulted in

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 some epic bargains, but none

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 better than when on New Year's

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Eve 2000, I discovered that, as

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 the store was closed the

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 following day, a large quantity

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 of avocados had been reduced to

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 just 10p each, and they were

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Buy, 1, Get, 1, Free.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 They were originally 69p.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 I walked out at the end of my

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 shift, fully armed for New Year's

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Festivities with a bottle of

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 vodka, some party poppers, 20

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Marlborough, some king-size

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Risler, and various nibbles, as

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 well as 104 avocados.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 For the princely sum of 9p,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 what?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 That's so good.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Isn't that great?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Was that on New Year's Eve 2000?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 I wonder if that was New Year's

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Eve without the Millennium.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 That was it.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 That was how you spent the

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Millennium.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Isn't that great?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Imagine ending the thousand

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 years of mankind with that.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Incredible.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 So thank you, Fraser.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 What a great bargain.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 You're all skeptical when I said

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 I've got a good story about a

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 bargain.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Best story I've ever heard.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Can I quickly, because we were

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 talking about beans, so that

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 episode Anne Miller was on, so

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Anne messaged me because she's

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 gotten a few droppers of lines

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 herself about that episode, and

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 she said there were three sizes

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 of Heinz beans containers.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 She was a bean expert, and we

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 went into quite a lot of detail

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 about the number of sizes of

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 beans, but apparently she'd

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 missed a fourth size of bean.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And yeah, she's been getting

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 messages about that.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Apparently there were four sizes

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 of Heinz beans containers.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 There are two smaller tins around

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 here in various supermarkets,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 plus the big size, plus the

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 snack pots, says someone to Anne

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 by text message, which she sent

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 me.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 So she would like to, she's not

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 here to defend herself, she would

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 like to apologize to any bean

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 aficionados out there who were

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 offended by her lack of bean

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 knowledge.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 Did you talk about flicking beans

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 on the episode?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Yeah, but I only in the very literal

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 sense.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 We did get an email from a satchel

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 saying, "Sorry, can I just explain,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 oh Dad, you should explain what

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 happened."

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Yeah, I was, and I know what this

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 is going to be, and I have a

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 response prepared written for me.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Why is everyone pre-delivering

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 their responses?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 No, I didn't know you were going

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 to bring this up.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 It's someone, someone wrote to me

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 about it.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 So I met Greg Wallace, who's the

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 master chef guy, he's one of the

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 guys on there, and he randomly

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 walked up to me and just said,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 "Do you want to hear a bean fact?"

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 I just didn't know who I was.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 I thought he must have known I was

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 on fish.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Nothing.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And then he said that there's a

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 laser at the factories where if

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 they see that there's an abnormal

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 bean, they'll shoot a laser at it

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 and flick the bean off.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 That is the story.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And so Greg Wallace was like,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 "They have a literal bean flicker."

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Yeah.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 And there's, I believe, a rude

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 meaning to that phrase.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Yeah.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Sasha writes, "Sitting here, having

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 just finished the episode, in stunned

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 amazement, that in a piece where the

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 phrases 'flick the bean' and 'bean

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 flicker' were used, nobody commented

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 on the generally accepted usage of

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 those phrases.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 It feels like there's no such thing

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 as official equivalent of Ronaldo

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 not scoring an open goal."

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 You guys need a new segment and

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 drop us a line.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Mr. Sitter.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 I think perhaps it was more like

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Ronaldo got to the goal.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 He thought, "You know what?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 I've shown that I can do this."

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Yeah.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Probably don't.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 We're already winning 5-0.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Yeah.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Sometimes when we say something

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 that's so obviously rude and we're

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 saying it, a look goes around and

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 we continue the chat because we

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 think, "Who's going to go there?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Do we need to go there?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 No, let's just keep going on."

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Yeah.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 You can't see our eyes.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 At that point, there was a look

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 where it was, "No, it's too

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 smarty.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Let's just carry on."

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Fair enough.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Too smarty.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 We're flattering ourselves there.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 The truth is...

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 No, just sometimes.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 No, it's not that it's too smarty.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 We've never ever rejected anything

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 because it's too smarty.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Be honest with ourselves.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 It's because we can't think of the

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 funny thing to say.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 It's like seeing the open goal and

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 tripping over the ball.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Sometimes something's so obvious.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 You're like, "Oh, I can't make it

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 funnier than that phrase."

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 This is Anna's internal process.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 It doesn't apply to all of us,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 we should say.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 I thought it was funny enough as it

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 was.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 I didn't need it.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Having listened to it, I agree.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 That's what I mean.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 It's like you're going to derail the

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 conversation to make some kind of...

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 There is a possibility.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Oh, we would never derail a

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 conversation.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Not always.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 We have to hold our bags.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 Who's that out of the window?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 It's Keiko.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 I think we could possibly in the

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 future invent something where we

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 get like eyeballs and you can have

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 them in your room while you're

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 listening to the podcast, but they're

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 attached to our own eyeballs.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 So the eyeballs in your room move in

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 the same way that our eyeballs are

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 actually moving when we're doing the

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 show.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Interesting.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 So it gives you an extra experience.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 And you can see us.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 You can see just the eyeballs, not the

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 rest of the face.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 They knew.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 They knew.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 The thing we've been doing when we

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 filmed clips of this show, you'd like

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 us to really focus in on just our

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 eyes.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Well, I was reading the other day that

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 John Dalton, who named Daltonism,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 which is colourblindness, he gave his

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 eyes to the Museum of Science and

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Industry, and they are there.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 You can just see the eyes.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 James is offering to donate his own

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 eyes to one lucky listener who wants

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 to have nightmares for the rest of

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 their lives.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Thanks, everybody.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Please keep writing in to

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 podcast@qi.com with your emails.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 You've been hearing other people's

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 emails, unless you were featured in

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 this show, but send in your own.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Can I just say something quickly?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 So just to talk about the elephant in

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 the room, if you only ever came to

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Club Fish because you didn't like the

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 adverts, you can now go to BBC Sounds

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 and get the podcast with no adverts

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 for free.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 You are allowed to do that.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 That would be absolutely fine.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 But you would miss this absolute

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 gold dust of bonus material.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Yeah.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 You want to miss this outro to a

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 show?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 I don't think so.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Can I do the BBC Sounds version

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 rather than come here every week?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Yeah.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 No, we love it.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 No, we love you guys being here.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And thank you so much for subscribing

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 to Club Fish.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 It really means a lot to us to have

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 this community, but we just want to

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 say, yeah, that option is open to

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 you.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Yeah.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 But don't take it.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Don't do it.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 But you can.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 But don't.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 We'll see you.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Wherever you are.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Brilliant.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Bye.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 [Music]

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
