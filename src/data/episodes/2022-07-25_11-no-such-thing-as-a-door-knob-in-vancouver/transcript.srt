1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,200
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 It's kind of a nice, such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,680
 It says it, "Ride that first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:25,720
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,920
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Colbert Garden.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,080
 My name is Dan Schriver.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,280
 I'm sitting here with the regular 3Ls, James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Anna Chazinski.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,960
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our favorite facts from the week,

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,640
 and we're about to go over them in no particular order.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,320
 Here we go.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,400
 Starting with back number one.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,000
 And that is Andy's.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,520
 Yeah.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,560
 My fact this week is that the words "tory" and "prime minister" both started out as being insults.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,480
 Wait, so what was a prime minister called prior to a prime minister?

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 Well, a prime minister was originally not called that.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,520
 He was called the First Lord of the Treasury.

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,840
 And the term "prime minister" was thought to be an insult,

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,280
 because it was as though the First Lord of the Treasury was putting himself above other ministers

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,520
 and marking himself out of this in some way better.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,360
 So the one we call the first prime minister, Robert Walpole,

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
 didn't actually call himself prime minister ever in lifetime.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,120
 And it took a very long time.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,320
 I think it was 1905 before the phrase was actually officially recognised.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,360
 So I really like that a lot.

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,880
 Yeah.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,600
 And a "tory" used to be a word for a brigand or an outlaw in Ireland

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,760
 who noted for outrageous and savage cruelty.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,800
 Well, that's quite a change of meaning, isn't it?

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 Yeah, most of them are not Irish anymore.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,000
 But it was, yeah, "tory" is older than conservative,

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
 which I always thought was strange, because "tory" sounds like the slang term for the conservative.

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,520
 Wick was also an insult, I think, wasn't it?

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,040
 What's that?

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,800
 Yeah, Wick meant a cattle driver.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,600
 So it seems like all the names that we give to our politicians

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,280
 and political parties are actually negative, have negative connotations.

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,760
 But this got me onto unparliamentary language.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,280
 Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
 What you can and can't get away with in the House of Commons.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,880
 So M.P. should not call other members liars,

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,880
 suggest they have false motives, misrepresent what another person has said,

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,480
 use abusive or insulting language, or describe another member as drunk.

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,080
 You can't do that.

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,560
 But you can't get away with loads of stuff.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,760
 So Tony Banks, Labour MP, said that Margaret Attractor acted

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,840
 with the sensitivity of a sex-starved bower constrictor.

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,280
 He also described Tory MP Terry Dix as "living proof that a pig's bladder

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,480
 on the end of a stick can be elected to parliament."

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,240
 LAUGHTER

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,600
 Which is pretty rude, not to be called up on it.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,200
 So was the famous one, was it Dennis Skinner said that half of Tory MPs,

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
 thieves and criminals, and he was told to take it back.

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,400
 And he said, "All right, then half of Tory MPs are not thieves and criminals."

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,800
 Oh, that's such a good one.

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,640
 I don't know when we don't have more fun political.

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,400
 I guess we have the Monster Raving Looney party, although I don't know what's happened to that.

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,680
 But are the countries have some super fun political parties?

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,360
 Like the Polish beer lovers party?

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,880
 Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,880
 Poland actually has some really good parties.

65
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,240
 But yeah, which one three percent of the vote in 1991?

66
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,520
 Could you accuse that party of being drunk?

67
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
 In parliament?

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,440
 I guess that was the best thing.

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,080
 I do like it when, just to take it away from politics for a second,

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,920
 of taking a word that was meant as an insult and suddenly it becomes the main thing.

71
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,320
 And famously, that's what happened with Fred Hoyl when he was told about the theory

72
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,720
 about how the universe began from an explosion of a singularity and so on.

73
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,440
 And he coined the term "big bang."

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,120
 But he said it in a sort of, "Oh, I guess it was some sort of big bang."

75
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,000
 And he didn't agree with the theory, but everyone went, "Big bang, I'm going to write that down."

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,360
 Got down to the press and it not only helped give it a name,

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,320
 but it actually popularized it as a theory generally because it was such a lovely term.

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,920
 So the newspaper has picked up on it.

79
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
 And I've got his obituary up here.

80
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
 He died in 2001.

81
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,200
 He's a BBC news.

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
 This is the opening paragraph.

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,480
 The English astronomer who coined the term "big bang" to describe the academic theory.

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,640
 So immediately, it's the top line of his life.

85
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,360
 There's one thing that he didn't want anything to do with.

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,920
 Do you think our insults have got worse over the century?

87
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,160
 I think when you look back over Shakespearean insults and age-all insults.

88
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,920
 We're less proficient and beautiful.

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,680
 Yes, less interesting, less imaginative.

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,000
 What's the thick of it?

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,120
 I mean, there's always been a market for people who are really good at coming up with insults.

92
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,840
 Actually, that's a good point.

93
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,280
 There's a Dutch insult, I can't pronounce it.

94
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,160
 Volga Shit and Palinville, which translates as a shit-filled eel skin,

95
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
 which means a skinny person.

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,240
 It's such an elaborate way of calling such a skinny.

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,680
 I think we're slightly running low on insults at the moment,

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,920
 because we're all becoming quite aware of how actually insulting we are.

99
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,040
 I got loads here.

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
 All right.

101
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,440
 All right, then.

102
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,520
 Top three insults, you found.

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,280
 Oh, blind me.

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
 All right.

105
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,720
 The Micronesian island of Yapp, and in Yappi's language,

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
 only about 6,000 people speak it.

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280
 One of the most serious insults you can dish out is saying,

108
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
 "You have no foreskin."

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,320
 They have very big stones, don't they, in Yapp?

110
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
 But do they?

111
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,960
 Yeah, they're famous for, instead of currency,

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,400
 they have these massive, massive, round millstones,

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,240
 and you can buy a house with them or whatever.

114
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,240
 And they never move, because there's too big and heavy to move,

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
 but the ownership of the stone just transfers from one person to another.

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
 Yeah, the cool thing about these stones as well,

117
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
 they're absolutely massive.

118
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,000
 We'll put a picture up on the website.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,880
 It's not always the biggest one that is most valuable.

120
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,960
 It's the one which was the most difficult to get.

121
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
 So if someone died when they were trying to get this stone,

122
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,040
 no matter how big it was, it would be worth more than a massive one,

123
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,800
 which was easily got--

124
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,560
 Wow.

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,520
 Size doesn't matter.

126
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,760
 So, and the second--

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,720
 OK, so, yeah, first one, Micronesian island of Yappi,

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
 you have no foreskin.

129
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,640
 Second one, I do like the Farsi curse,

130
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,440
 which translates as "may a fart be on your beard."

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,920
 [LAUGHS]

132
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,680
 So--

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,600
 That's great.

134
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
 That's brilliant.

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
 So graphic.

136
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,800
 And last one, OK, they can have a tie for the last one.

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,480
 Oh, yes.

138
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,440
 Either the Hungarian insult, La Faz as Segued Bay,

139
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,520
 which translates as "may a horse's penis make its way into your bottom."

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,440
 [LAUGHS]

141
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,800
 Or-- and this is one of the very worst insults in Argentinian Spanish,

142
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,240
 which equates to calling someone's mother a prostitute 16 million times over.

143
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,840
 Wow.

144
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,080
 It translates as, "Your mother, who gave birth to you twice,

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,800
 was a whore 2,000 times over squared."

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,520
 So it's--

147
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,200
 Well, it's a mathematical insult.

148
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,680
 I always think that learning insults in a language

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,440
 would be a good way of starting to learn.

151
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,920
 Yes.

152
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,520
 I have this theory of learning languages as in learning the vocabulary,

153
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,480
 which is, first of all, you go for the insults,

154
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,360
 because that's the one that everyone wants to learn.

155
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,280
 As soon as you know what your mother is a whore in a language,

156
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
 you want to use it all the time.

157
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,680
 The next one is you learn words that sound slightly rude in English,

158
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,840
 because you're going to remember those all the time.

159
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
 And then you go from there.

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,760
 And I think that's a really good way of learning vocabulary in languages.

161
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,920
 It's a very good way of learning.

162
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,080
 It's not the most appropriate way of starting a conversation in your stages.

163
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
 That's why the guidebook's begin with, like, where is the bag?

164
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,360
 Yes.

165
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,000
 Hello.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
 Nice to meet you.

167
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,080
 It's not your mother had sex with 2,000 squared.

168
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
 Yeah.

169
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:35,040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

170
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,640
 OK.

171
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,520
 Time for fact number two, Anna.

172
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,440
 My fact this week is that in a 2005 questionnaire about substance abuse,

173
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,440
 almost one in five respondents admitted to taking a drug that doesn't exist.

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,200
 That's brilliant.

175
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,800
 Taking drugs will do that to you.

176
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,600
 Yeah.

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,360
 So it's this drug called Derbyssel, which is a fake drug.

178
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
 It's existed since 1974.

179
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,400
 And it's basically inserted into surveys to test if respondents are lying.

180
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 But it's kind of interesting, because it suggests

181
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,880
 that people who are like students who are responding to questionnaires about how many drugs

182
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,480
 they take, just love to claim that they take all the drugs, constantly taking drugs, even

183
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 fake ones.

184
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,280
 I'm not sure it's they take all of them, because I saw that it said like 5.6% of people in

185
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,440
 one of the surveys I saw took this Derbyssel drug, but only 3.6% used heroin, so it's more popular

186
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
 than heroin.

187
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
 Yeah.

188
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
 Well, I guess that's because heroin is more dangerous.

189
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
 Yeah.

190
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,920
 Well, much more dangerous than something that doesn't exist.

191
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 Yeah.

192
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
 In fact, Derbyssel is probably one of the safest drugs you can take.

193
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
 Anyway, yeah.

194
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
 It's been in questionnaires for, like, 40 years, more than 40 years.

195
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,040
 Because people noticed that there were some fairly implausible results coming through and kids

196
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,280
 seem to be taking loads of drugs, and they didn't see the effects of those drugs in school.

197
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,680
 They were working perfectly okay.

198
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,600
 They seem kind of compasementous, but they claim to be taking heroin six times a day.

199
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,320
 So they suspect it's something Dodgy was going on.

200
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
 And so they inserted this drug to see if kids were just lying about what they were.

201
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 Yeah.

202
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 That's very, very funny.

203
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,240
 So has anyone actually made the drug, what's it called again?

204
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
 Derbyssel.

205
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
 Derbyssel into an actual drug now?

206
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
 Yeah.

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,880
 Because it's obviously quite a nice open market, isn't it?

208
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,360
 They've had free advertising already.

209
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 Yeah.

210
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
 In all these surveys.

211
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
 Yeah.

212
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,400
 It could be anything, because what's annoying about drugs is that you're only going to get

213
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
 like one brand of effects, aren't you?

214
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,120
 It's a stimulant or a hallucinogenic, but this could be all of them, whatever you wanted

215
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
 it to be.

216
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,800
 As used by 5.6% of American teenagers.

217
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
 Yeah.

218
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 Yeah.

219
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,400
 There is something that's not to be confused with Derbyssel, which is a wound cleaning spray

220
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,840
 for pigs and sheep that dissolves pus.

221
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,560
 You don't want to get those two mixed up.

222
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,800
 Yeah, but I imagine that would get you really high.

223
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
 Yeah.

224
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,640
 At the only other explanation for this drug, I should say, for the people who are ticking

225
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,280
 the Derbyssel box.

226
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,640
 In South Korea, Derbyssel is one of the trade names for a drug which is used to treat eczema

227
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,960
 psoriasis skin diseases.

228
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,440
 So maybe all the people at this school just had some serious skin problems and were Korean,

229
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,640
 but it was in Texas.

230
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,840
 I guess it's hard to do surveys because people just lie all the time, don't they?

231
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
 Yeah.

232
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,040
 Self-reporting is a massive problem.

233
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,800
 And especially all kinds of slightly noughtier things like drugs or sex or drinking or whatever

234
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 it is.

235
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 People misreport wildly.

236
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 Yeah.

237
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,320
 I remember reading a survey of how many sexual partners people have had.

238
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,160
 And apparently, the average man has had something like 30 sexual partners and the average

239
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,800
 woman has had only seven, which means either everyone's lying or there's one very promiscuous

240
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 woman.

241
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
 Carl Sagan was a pothead.

242
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
 What he said he was.

243
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,200
 Julian, his widow who made the latest Cosmos series, is the head of a movement to get it legalized

244
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 in the States.

245
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,440
 Does that mean everything he's told us is just a drug-induced fantasy?

246
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,200
 I'm going to have to scratch some of my QI facts.

247
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,800
 The same sort of thing, Winston Churchill had the image of him always having a tumbler

248
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,440
 of whiskey with him, but I think a lot of people reported that it was very, very watered

249
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
 down.

250
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
 There was so much ice in it.

251
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,760
 He drank it so slowly that he might as well not have been having whiskey at all, basically.

252
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,040
 That supposedly was the same as Dean Martin.

253
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,480
 His whole stage persona was to be this quite drunk, slightly slurry kind of character, but

254
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,880
 apparently Apple Juice was what he wanted to say.

255
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
 Really?

256
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,080
 When we're talking about how it's difficult to do surveys and stuff like that, something

257
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
 came into my head.

258
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,640
 I don't even know if it's related, but Andy, do you remember the thing where people had

259
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,840
 to do a survey about how they'd react if they were in terrible danger, and they were on

260
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,640
 an aeroplane and they were told the aeroplane was going to crash.

261
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,560
 I'm sure you researched it, what was that?

263
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,240
 It was to test the response to stress, I think.

264
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
 A lot of soldiers were loaded into a plane which climbed to 5,000 feet and then stayed level

265
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,760
 for a few minutes and then just shook the passengers around, lots, and then told everyone

266
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,000
 that they were going to die, that they was injured and failure, and that they had to fill

267
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,360
 out forms for any member of their family to get any benefits after they died.

268
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,360
 And so they did their best, but they then compared the forms to ones that they had filled

269
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,280
 out on the ground when they didn't think they were going to die.

270
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,960
 And we don't really know what they were using this data for.

271
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,160
 Some of them got wise to it and they wrote messages on the Essexness bags saying, "Don't

272
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
 be afraid.

273
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
 This is an experiment.

274
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
 You're not going to die."

275
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,960
 What are the other people on the plane saying?

276
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,800
 I reckon if I got into an easy jet flight and I looked at the sick bag and it said, "Don't

277
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
 be afraid.

278
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 This is an experiment.

279
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
 You're not going to die."

280
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,560
 I'd probably be more worried than if I hadn't seen that message.

281
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:38,880
 Okay, so I'm going to move on to fact number three, this is my fact.

282
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,200
 I stole this fact actually from James Harkin who's writing the new QI book I saw it over

283
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
 his shoulder.

284
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,720
 Let's see how those have a secret pocket in their armpit which they like to keep their

285
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 favourite stones in.

286
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,480
 It's going to be a secret pocket, because they lack the capacity to tell anyone.

287
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,200
 Yeah, it's not the speed of the arch.

288
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,160
 Yeah, so the stone's thing is really interesting because they use them.

289
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,560
 It's an actual tool to smash stuff open.

290
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,760
 They eat tons of different kinds of foods, but there's some shellfish-y style foods where

291
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,960
 they need to smash it open, which I think isn't that quite rare?

292
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
 Yeah, not many animals use tools.

293
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
 Let's think who uses tools.

294
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,600
 Oh, Croz and Jack Doz have been tested and they definitely use them.

295
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,360
 Is it a tool to use the ground?

296
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,240
 I don't know, because there's a bird called Alamagaya which lifts up tortoises into the

297
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,040
 air and drops them onto the ground.

298
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
 Oh yeah.

299
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
 That's a riskless, isn't it?

300
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680
 Yeah, onto a particular patch of rocky, stony ground.

301
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,080
 So I don't know if that's using tools.

302
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
 Yeah, I would say so.

303
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
 Arguably.

304
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
 You said a name just then.

305
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
 That was the philosopher who died.

306
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,200
 So did he genuinely die from a-

307
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,040
 Well, we don't know exactly how he died, but the only evidence that we have is that someone

308
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,000
 wrote that that's how he died.

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,040
 Nobody, he did supposedly die that way, didn't he?

310
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
 Yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
 Is that the only case in history of that having happened?

312
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
 To my knowledge.

313
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
 So, yeah.

314
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,200
 There was a different case of an asteroid killing a dog in Egypt in 1912, but that's completely

315
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 different.

316
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,880
 The only link is something falling on someone's face.

317
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,000
 There were always rumors that you could die from effluent flushed out of airplanes.

318
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 That's not true, is it?

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Frozen effluent.

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 It's not true.

321
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,080
 No, it can't happen in case anyone was scared.

322
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,440
 Well, what happens is that people who live under flight paths will sometimes find blocks

323
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,920
 of ice, and it's slightly miscolored, and they think it's going to be frozen urine.

324
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,240
 But what it usually is, is the airplanes have been flying very high.

325
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,320
 They get ice on the wings, and then when they come down the ice melts, and it falls.

326
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
 Okay.

327
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 Basically, yeah.

328
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,200
 Does mate you wonder if you've got terrible food poisoning on a plane if they have to

329
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,760
 on a long haul flight, if they have to make an emergency landing halfway there to unload?

330
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,760
 Do you see that thing where a hundred children had vomiting and diarrhea, sickness on a flight

331
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
 the other day?

332
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
 It wasn't a hundred.

333
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
 Was it not?

334
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 No.

335
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,560
 I think the choir was 60, but I think a lot of them did go down with it.

336
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
 It was all of them.

337
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,640
 They dispatched about four ambulance teams in parallel, but imagine being on that flight.

338
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 I know.

339
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,400
 I'd probably conflate in it with another fact, which is there was a Baltimore food safety

340
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,800
 conference a couple of weeks ago, and a hundred people who went to that got food poisoning.

341
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 Brilliant.

342
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 Wow.

343
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,400
 So let's talk about otters.

344
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
 Otters.

345
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 Shall we?

346
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
 Hold hands.

347
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
 So they know.

348
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
 They hold hands, yeah, so they don't float away.

349
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
 Well, they sleep.

350
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,200
 Yeah, let's put that up on the website, because everyone loves that video, don't they?

351
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 That's really cute.

352
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,400
 Not so cute is that they peel the skin off poisonous toads in one piece before eating

353
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,800
 the flesh so they don't get poisoned from the skin.

354
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,480
 But that is as a party trick.

355
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,800
 It's like I can peel an orange with one hand.

356
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,600
 Here's a thing.

357
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,520
 If you get an orange and put it in a bowl of water, it'll float.

358
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,840
 If you peel it and put it in a bowl of water, it'll sink.

359
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
 Wow.

360
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
 What baby otters can't dive?

361
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
 They're too buoyant.

362
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Really?

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Yeah.

364
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,200
 That's a thing that comes with age that they can suddenly dive.

365
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,520
 There's been a bit of anti-otter propaganda on the internet recently.

366
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 I was reading.

367
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 What's that meant?

368
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,520
 There was a magazine article on an online magazine called Vox, and it was entitled The

369
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,520
 Case Against Otters, Necrophiliac serial killing fur monsters of the sea.

370
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,960
 It was written by a guy called Dylan Matthews, and he said that otters are jerks.

371
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,200
 He's missed the chance of calling them rotters.

372
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,880
 They kill baby otters.

373
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:22,280
 They have attacked people, monkeys, and alligators, and they sometimes copulate with dead otters.

374
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 Attacked alligators?

375
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
 How did that go for them?

376
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
 That's very cool.

377
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,160
 OK, this is very interesting if he says that, because the ancient Greeks had a theory

378
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,240
 or a belief that otters killed crocodiles by scampering into their mouths and then eating

379
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,640
 all of their entrails and then running out again when the crocodile was dead.

380
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
 Isn't that great?

381
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,880
 That's a brilliant idea, but it's definitely not true.

382
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
 Yeah.

383
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,640
 I was reading about Wombats, and Wombats have a pouch, so similar to a kangaroo.

384
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 OK.

385
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,480
 But Wombats dig through the ground, and so their pouches are upside down.

386
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 What?

387
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
 They don't get any of the stuff into their pouches.

388
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
 Will the baby just fall out?

389
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,680
 No, because unlike a kangaroo, they're not vertical.

390
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
 Oh, yeah.

391
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,120
 The one Wombat fact I remember is that they have cubic feces.

392
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,920
 They do have cubic feces.

393
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,440
 They also have incredible butts.

394
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,520
 Like their asses are insanely hard.

395
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,240
 No, no, they're very interesting though, they're very interesting because if they're chased

396
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
 by a predator, they run into their burrow, their hole, but they purposefully leave their

397
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,640
 butt out, and nothing can penetrate it.

398
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,160
 Yeah, Chris Clement, who's a biologist from Australia, came on the museum of curiosity last

399
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,080
 year, and I'm sure he mentioned this.

400
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
 He did.

401
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 This is where I first have it.

402
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
 They have a reinforced rump.

403
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,240
 When a predator attacks a Wombat, it runs into its burrow and uses its tough cartilage

404
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,120
 filled bum to block the hole.

405
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,440
 I've also found that apparently the further is very coarse and white, so it would feel

406
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,280
 like bristles to eat, which must be pleasant for a predator.

407
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
 So try and buy it.

408
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
 Yeah.

409
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 I take it all back.

410
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
 Yeah, super butts.

411
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
 Yeah.

412
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,520
 Just speaking of butts, I read that turtles breathe through those butts.

413
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,000
 Not all turtles, but a lot.

414
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Yeah, some of them do.

415
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Did they urinate through their mouth?

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 They do.

417
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,760
 The whole system has gone haywire there.

418
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,160
 Are you sure you just weren't holding the turtle the wrong way around?

419
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,240
 Animals collecting stuff, um, power birds.

420
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
 You guys have many with power birds.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
 Power birds build these amazing structures, like these homes for their, um, potential mate,

422
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,360
 and then they collect shiny objects or like nice looking objects, and they adorn it,

423
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
 and it's amazing.

424
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,840
 So you see them trying to seduce ladies, and they'll bring them like anything they can

425
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
 find.

426
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,760
 There's one, I think there's a video of one, keeps bringing this lady like a shiny stone

427
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,160
 or a bit of sandwich or a bit of cloth, and the lady keeps rejecting them.

428
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,000
 And then eventually he brings her a ring, and she goes, "Oh yeah, right, then.

429
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Go for it.

430
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,240
 Yeah, I'll put that on the website."

431
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,760
 That sounds very familiar.

432
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
 Yeah.

433
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:02,000
 The number of times when I was carting my wife, bringing her a little bit of sandwich.

434
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,760
 Okay, and now it's time for a final fact of the show, and that's your fact, James.

435
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,280
 Yep, my fact is very simple this week.

436
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,880
 Nops have been made illegal in Vancouver.

437
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:23,600
 Just going for the cheap laugh, and illegal is the slight stretch.

438
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:30,120
 It's, when you make a new house in Vancouver now, it's illegal to put a dawn up on rather

439
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,880
 than a dawn handle, and that's to make it more accessible.

440
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,760
 Which I think is quite interesting, like, is it going to be the first place, is it going

441
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
 to be the rest of the world?

442
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,680
 Are we going to be losing the dawn ups?

443
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,200
 No one will know what a dawn up is in 500 years.

444
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
 Yeah.

445
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,560
 So that's weird of how recent dawn ups are, I mean, Victoria and Abraham Lincoln, who

446
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,320
 would not have known what a dawn up was.

447
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 Really?

448
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
 Yeah, dawn ups only came in in the late 1800s.

449
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
 Oh, the latches weren't there, things like that.

450
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,040
 So if this works in Vancouver, it could be that there was only a 150-year period in the

452
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,880
 whole of history where people had dawn up.

453
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,800
 Yeah, we think we were lucky enough to live in that area.

454
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 And blessed.

455
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,720
 That's your theory about landlines, isn't it, James?

456
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
 Yeah.

457
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,080
 The idea of having a telephone in your house was it didn't happen until the mid-20

458
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,520
 century, then hardly anyone had it until the 70s and 80s.

459
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,480
 And then everyone had it for a few decades.

460
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,400
 And now everyone just has mobile phones, no one has landlines.

461
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,280
 And so in 100 years, they'll look back at only a 20-year period where everyone had phone

462
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
 lines.

463
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
 And it's going to look really weird.

464
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
 Yeah.

465
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,840
 And they're still going to ask in 200 years, why are they still putting this on surface?

466
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,360
 Please insert your landline.

467
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,040
 Stop putting that there.

468
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,880
 So that's, I mean, that's a really good point.

469
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,400
 More knobs are effectively going to be a blip.

470
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,280
 It's a bit like, so that legislation reminds me of, it's like Shabbat elevators, isn't it?

471
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,040
 And Israel now, all new builds have to have Shabbat elevators.

472
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,520
 What is one of those?

473
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,240
 Because under Jewish law, you're not allowed to operate electronics on the Sabbath.

474
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
 They're lifts that go automatically.

475
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
 They also have Shindler's lifts, which they can use as well.

476
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,400
 That's one of the most three biggest lift managers.

477
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 Yeah, really?

478
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
 Shindler's lifts.

479
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
 Yeah.

480
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 That is, I can't believe I didn't know that.

481
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
 That's amazing.

482
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:18,280
 I read from the ignoble reporters that supposedly lift music, if you have a cold, it's a great cure

483
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
 for the common cold.

484
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
 Lift music is a scientific report.

485
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,480
 First of all, we don't have any cure for the common cold.

486
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,200
 Second of all, lift music.

487
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 Yeah.

488
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,080
 I'm only reporting science guys, people, people who listened to lift music got better in

489
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
 two weeks.

490
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,280
 People who didn't took as long as 14 days, like also recovered.

491
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,720
 On the hand, on the door knobs thing.

492
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,440
 I found a quote from someone who was hostile to the idea, because the reason they did it

493
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
 was for the elderly and an aging population.

494
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,240
 A lot of people have arthritis and the sort of the twisting action of turning one of the

495
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
 tools.

496
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,440
 Yeah, 67 million adult Americans will have arthritis by 2030, according to one survey.

497
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
 Yeah, yeah.

498
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
 So that's very interesting.

499
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,440
 And I found someone opposing it saying, "Bairs will be very appreciative of this change,

500
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,000
 as an unlocked lever door is an invitation in the snack time, those round knobs are tricky

501
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,560
 with tools, which kind of compares people who suffer from arthritis to bears."

502
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,720
 I was reading this in the economist and one of the censuses they had was, "The rules have

503
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:21,760
 provoked grumbling about the nanny state, much of it from dawn of manufacturers."

504
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,080
 I found another guy who was objecting who was the president of the antique dawn knob collectors

505
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
 of America.

506
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
 Oh, yeah.

507
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
 But presumably he should be happy because more of them will be antiques.

508
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
 Yeah, exactly.

509
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
 Yeah.

510
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,360
 It's an election all the more valuable.

511
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 Yeah.

512
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,520
 Literally everything will be an antique.

513
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,800
 I was looking at weird laws.

514
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 Oh, yeah.

515
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,680
 And it's quite hard to find weird laws that are actually laws rather than internet myths,

516
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
 obviously.

517
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,480
 But I do like the fact that in Denmark, it actually is a legal requirement to check under

518
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,240
 your car for sleeping people or for people before you start driving it.

519
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
 Really?

520
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,760
 And if you do run somebody over because they were sleeping under your car when you started,

521
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,040
 then you're going to be in trouble for it with insurance.

522
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
 Wow.

523
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,960
 I don't know if this is a common habit in Denmark, if people fall asleep on the cars all

524
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
 the time.

525
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
 That's very interesting.

526
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,480
 But it's a thing.

527
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
 And the other thing is that there's actually a legal in Thailand to go out in public without

528
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
 worrying underwear.

529
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
 That's a thing.

530
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
 Wow.

531
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,080
 And I also like places where it's illegal to die, which it isn't in the houses of parliament,

532
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,280
 although a lot of people think that it is.

533
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,120
 It's not illegal to die in the houses of parliament.

534
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
 No.

535
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
 Wow.

536
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,200
 You are free to go there and do that.

537
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
 But it is.

538
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,520
 You know, just if you want to.

539
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
 Yeah.

540
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:35,200
 Is illegal to die in Longyear Bayon, which is in Norway, yeah, it's in Svalbard.

541
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
 Yes.

542
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,320
 When you say it's illegal to die there, what are the ramifications for you?

543
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 I think it--

544
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 Once you've done the act.

545
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 I think ramifications for your family.

546
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
 Oh, OK.

547
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,840
 So it's a little bit like that aeroplane moment.

548
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,080
 How much do you really care about the family who are going to be punished after your death?

549
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,400
 It's because they found out that bodies don't decompose there.

550
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,880
 Corpus is a preserved by permafrost, which I think James might know more about this

551
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 is just to do with their climate.

552
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
 Yes.

553
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
 Really, really cold.

554
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 Yeah.

555
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
 Because it's about as far off as you can get.

556
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
 Right.

557
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,240
 So basically they're like cryogenically frozen, if you will.

558
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,800
 Do you think Mount Everest is our permanent sort of the most likely spot that future civilizations

559
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,720
 will find people of our time?

560
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 Because they're frozen.

561
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,960
 They're fully-- like when they found Mallory, this whole body was there.

562
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
 Yeah.

563
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
 Well, honestly.

564
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
 Yeah.

565
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,360
 The look does as well in a run, I think, maybe it gets so hot that things won't decompose

566
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
 there.

567
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
 Maybe I might go up.

568
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
 That's amazing, though.

569
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,840
 Because you often think, obviously, in cold things won't decompose.

570
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,920
 But of course, like microbes are going to not be able to live at a certain temperature,

571
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
 certainly.

572
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,880
 Well, I was reading a guide to what to do after civilization ends yesterday.

573
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,840
 And it recommended plastic bottles to, you know, the phrase sunlight is the best disinfectant

574
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
 talking about openness.

575
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,520
 It turns out the sunlight also acts as a disinfectant by killing microbes.

576
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,320
 So if you want to have cleaner drinking water, put it in plastic bottles.

577
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,640
 Let the light shine quite fiercely on it and the light and all the heat.

578
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
 I'm not sure.

579
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
 We'll kill when it grows.

580
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
 Knowledge.

581
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
 That's good, eh?

582
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
 That is good.

583
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
 Why are you doing that?

584
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
 We're having a rough day yesterday, Andy.

585
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,040
 I'm just finishing my plans.

586
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,680
 Speaking of survivals, if we don't have Donob's anymore, then there are some things that

587
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,880
 they've been useful for in the past that we won't have anymore.

588
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:25,160
 So after the tsunami, the famous one in Southeast Asia, there was a guy called Rizal Shah-Putra,

589
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,480
 and he got lost at sea, as many people did.

590
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,800
 But he survived because he ate coconuts which he cracked open with a Donob, which was also

591
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
 floating past.

592
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 So that was a really useful Donob.

593
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 That's great.

594
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
 Oh, yes.

595
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,320
 If only he had a little pouch in which it's still years or a lot, then he wouldn't know that

596
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
 at all.

597
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 Yeah.

598
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,520
 Between 1830 and 1873, over 100 US patents alone were for Donob's.

599
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
 Oh.

600
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,120
 The slight improvements on the Donob's, or...

601
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,280
 I guess they would be like the latch, they would be in the toilets when you do just that

602
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,080
 little turnover, little bar goes over, and I guess they count as Donob's, don't they?

603
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,040
 I think a knob has to be knob-shaped.

604
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
 Yeah.

605
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,640
 God, then that's going to be an exciting afternoon looking to what those payed into.

606
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,840
 There are still a lot of innovations happening though.

607
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,160
 I think they're working on ones in hospitals which dispense hand sanitizer as you go through.

608
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,960
 Although presumably they wouldn't do that every time you open the door, otherwise you

609
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,000
 just have loads of hand sanitizer on the floor and a lot of people slipping and falling.

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,920
 But I think they have developed a way of doing it.

611
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,680
 So you can also give yourself a quick hit of hand sanitizer as you go through from one room

612
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
 to another.

613
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
 Right.

614
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
 It's pretty cool.

615
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,520
 At least when you're falling and bleeding and your wounds are on open, you've got a very

616
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,080
 sanitised surface to London.

617
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
 Yeah.

618
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,080
 In the absence of Derbysol.

619
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,960
 Okay, that's it.

620
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,360
 That's all our facts for this week.

621
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,760

 Anna.

630
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
 What's yours?

631
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
