00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"And which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"It's kind of a nice, such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:10,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:10,00:00:12,"It says it, ""Ride that first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."""
00:00:12,00:00:25,"Hello, and welcome to another edition of ""No Such Thing as a Fish,"""
00:00:25,00:00:29,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Colbert Garden.
00:00:29,00:00:31,My name is Dan Schriver.
00:00:31,00:00:36,"I'm sitting here with the regular 3Ls, James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Anna Chazinski."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our favorite facts from the week,"
00:00:39,00:00:42,and we're about to go over them in no particular order.
00:00:42,00:00:43,Here we go.
00:00:43,00:00:46,Starting with back number one.
00:00:46,00:00:49,And that is Andy's.
00:00:49,00:00:49,Yeah.
00:00:49,00:00:56,"My fact this week is that the words ""tory"" and ""prime minister"" both started out as being insults."
00:00:56,00:01:00,"Wait, so what was a prime minister called prior to a prime minister?"
00:01:00,00:01:03,"Well, a prime minister was originally not called that."
00:01:03,00:01:06,He was called the First Lord of the Treasury.
00:01:06,00:01:08,"And the term ""prime minister"" was thought to be an insult,"
00:01:08,00:01:15,because it was as though the First Lord of the Treasury was putting himself above other ministers
00:01:15,00:01:18,and marking himself out of this in some way better.
00:01:18,00:01:21,"So the one we call the first prime minister, Robert Walpole,"
00:01:21,00:01:24,didn't actually call himself prime minister ever in lifetime.
00:01:24,00:01:26,And it took a very long time.
00:01:26,00:01:31,I think it was 1905 before the phrase was actually officially recognised.
00:01:31,00:01:33,So I really like that a lot.
00:01:33,00:01:33,Yeah.
00:01:33,00:01:37,"And a ""tory"" used to be a word for a brigand or an outlaw in Ireland"
00:01:37,00:01:40,who noted for outrageous and savage cruelty.
00:01:40,00:01:43,"Well, that's quite a change of meaning, isn't it?"
00:01:43,00:01:46,"Yeah, most of them are not Irish anymore."
00:01:46,00:01:50,"But it was, yeah, ""tory"" is older than conservative,"
00:01:50,00:01:54,"which I always thought was strange, because ""tory"" sounds like the slang term for the conservative."
00:01:54,00:01:56,"Wick was also an insult, I think, wasn't it?"
00:01:56,00:01:57,What's that?
00:01:57,00:01:59,"Yeah, Wick meant a cattle driver."
00:01:59,00:02:02,So it seems like all the names that we give to our politicians
00:02:02,00:02:06,"and political parties are actually negative, have negative connotations."
00:02:06,00:02:08,But this got me onto unparliamentary language.
00:02:08,00:02:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:09,00:02:11,What you can and can't get away with in the House of Commons.
00:02:11,00:02:14,"So M.P. should not call other members liars,"
00:02:14,00:02:19,"suggest they have false motives, misrepresent what another person has said,"
00:02:19,00:02:24,"use abusive or insulting language, or describe another member as drunk."
00:02:24,00:02:27,You can't do that.
00:02:27,00:02:28,But you can't get away with loads of stuff.
00:02:28,00:02:32,"So Tony Banks, Labour MP, said that Margaret Attractor acted"
00:02:32,00:02:35,with the sensitivity of a sex-starved bower constrictor.
00:02:35,00:02:40,"He also described Tory MP Terry Dix as ""living proof that a pig's bladder"
00:02:40,00:02:42,"on the end of a stick can be elected to parliament."""
00:02:42,00:02:44,LAUGHTER
00:02:44,00:02:47,"Which is pretty rude, not to be called up on it."
00:02:47,00:02:53,"So was the famous one, was it Dennis Skinner said that half of Tory MPs,"
00:02:53,00:02:56,"thieves and criminals, and he was told to take it back."
00:02:56,00:02:59,"And he said, ""All right, then half of Tory MPs are not thieves and criminals."""
00:02:59,00:03:01,"Oh, that's such a good one."
00:03:01,00:03:03,I don't know when we don't have more fun political.
00:03:03,00:03:06,"I guess we have the Monster Raving Looney party, although I don't know what's happened to that."
00:03:06,00:03:08,But are the countries have some super fun political parties?
00:03:08,00:03:10,Like the Polish beer lovers party?
00:03:10,00:03:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:10,00:03:12,Poland actually has some really good parties.
00:03:12,00:03:15,"But yeah, which one three percent of the vote in 1991?"
00:03:15,00:03:17,Could you accuse that party of being drunk?
00:03:17,00:03:18,In parliament?
00:03:18,00:03:21,I guess that was the best thing.
00:03:21,00:03:26,"I do like it when, just to take it away from politics for a second,"
00:03:26,00:03:31,of taking a word that was meant as an insult and suddenly it becomes the main thing.
00:03:31,00:03:37,"And famously, that's what happened with Fred Hoyl when he was told about the theory"
00:03:37,00:03:41,about how the universe began from an explosion of a singularity and so on.
00:03:41,00:03:44,"And he coined the term ""big bang."""
00:03:44,00:03:48,"But he said it in a sort of, ""Oh, I guess it was some sort of big bang."""
00:03:48,00:03:52,"And he didn't agree with the theory, but everyone went, ""Big bang, I'm going to write that down."""
00:03:52,00:03:56,"Got down to the press and it not only helped give it a name,"
00:03:56,00:04:01,but it actually popularized it as a theory generally because it was such a lovely term.
00:04:01,00:04:02,So the newspaper has picked up on it.
00:04:02,00:04:04,And I've got his obituary up here.
00:04:04,00:04:06,He died in 2001.
00:04:06,00:04:07,He's a BBC news.
00:04:07,00:04:08,This is the opening paragraph.
00:04:08,00:04:12,"The English astronomer who coined the term ""big bang"" to describe the academic theory."
00:04:12,00:04:15,"So immediately, it's the top line of his life."
00:04:15,00:04:18,There's one thing that he didn't want anything to do with.
00:04:18,00:04:20,Do you think our insults have got worse over the century?
00:04:20,00:04:24,I think when you look back over Shakespearean insults and age-all insults.
00:04:24,00:04:25,We're less proficient and beautiful.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"Yes, less interesting, less imaginative."
00:04:27,00:04:29,What's the thick of it?
00:04:29,00:04:32,"I mean, there's always been a market for people who are really good at coming up with insults."
00:04:32,00:04:33,"Actually, that's a good point."
00:04:33,00:04:37,"There's a Dutch insult, I can't pronounce it."
00:04:37,00:04:42,"Volga Shit and Palinville, which translates as a shit-filled eel skin,"
00:04:42,00:04:44,which means a skinny person.
00:04:44,00:04:48,It's such an elaborate way of calling such a skinny.
00:04:48,00:04:51,"I think we're slightly running low on insults at the moment,"
00:04:51,00:04:55,because we're all becoming quite aware of how actually insulting we are.
00:04:55,00:04:57,I got loads here.
00:04:57,00:04:57,All right.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"All right, then."
00:04:58,00:05:00,"Top three insults, you found."
00:05:00,00:05:01,"Oh, blind me."
00:05:01,00:05:02,All right.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"The Micronesian island of Yapp, and in Yappi's language,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"only about 6,000 people speak it."
00:05:06,00:05:09,"One of the most serious insults you can dish out is saying,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,"""You have no foreskin."""
00:05:11,00:05:14,"They have very big stones, don't they, in Yapp?"
00:05:14,00:05:15,But do they?
00:05:15,00:05:17,"Yeah, they're famous for, instead of currency,"
00:05:17,00:05:21,"they have these massive, massive, round millstones,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,and you can buy a house with them or whatever.
00:05:23,00:05:26,"And they never move, because there's too big and heavy to move,"
00:05:26,00:05:30,but the ownership of the stone just transfers from one person to another.
00:05:30,00:05:32,"Yeah, the cool thing about these stones as well,"
00:05:32,00:05:33,they're absolutely massive.
00:05:33,00:05:35,We'll put a picture up on the website.
00:05:35,00:05:37,It's not always the biggest one that is most valuable.
00:05:37,00:05:40,It's the one which was the most difficult to get.
00:05:40,00:05:44,"So if someone died when they were trying to get this stone,"
00:05:44,00:05:47,"no matter how big it was, it would be worth more than a massive one,"
00:05:47,00:05:48,which was easily got--
00:05:48,00:05:49,Wow.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Size doesn't matter.
00:05:50,00:05:51,"So, and the second--"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"OK, so, yeah, first one, Micronesian island of Yappi,"
00:05:54,00:05:55,you have no foreskin.
00:05:55,00:06:00,"Second one, I do like the Farsi curse,"
00:06:00,00:06:03,"which translates as ""may a fart be on your beard."""
00:06:03,00:06:05,[LAUGHS]
00:06:05,00:06:06,So--
00:06:06,00:06:07,That's great.
00:06:07,00:06:08,That's brilliant.
00:06:08,00:06:09,So graphic.
00:06:09,00:06:12,"And last one, OK, they can have a tie for the last one."
00:06:12,00:06:13,"Oh, yes."
00:06:13,00:06:17,"Either the Hungarian insult, La Faz as Segued Bay,"
00:06:17,00:06:20,"which translates as ""may a horse's penis make its way into your bottom."""
00:06:20,00:06:22,[LAUGHS]
00:06:22,00:06:25,"Or-- and this is one of the very worst insults in Argentinian Spanish,"
00:06:25,00:06:30,which equates to calling someone's mother a prostitute 16 million times over.
00:06:30,00:06:30,Wow.
00:06:30,00:06:34,"It translates as, ""Your mother, who gave birth to you twice,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,"was a whore 2,000 times over squared."""
00:06:36,00:06:38,So it's--
00:06:38,00:06:40,"Well, it's a mathematical insult."
00:06:40,00:06:41,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:41,00:06:44,I always think that learning insults in a language
00:06:44,00:06:47,would be a good way of starting to learn.
00:06:47,00:06:47,Yes.
00:06:47,00:06:52,"I have this theory of learning languages as in learning the vocabulary,"
00:06:52,00:06:54,"which is, first of all, you go for the insults,"
00:06:54,00:06:56,because that's the one that everyone wants to learn.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"As soon as you know what your mother is a whore in a language,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,you want to use it all the time.
00:07:00,00:07:04,"The next one is you learn words that sound slightly rude in English,"
00:07:04,00:07:06,because you're going to remember those all the time.
00:07:06,00:07:07,And then you go from there.
00:07:07,00:07:10,And I think that's a really good way of learning vocabulary in languages.
00:07:10,00:07:11,It's a very good way of learning.
00:07:11,00:07:16,It's not the most appropriate way of starting a conversation in your stages.
00:07:16,00:07:18,"That's why the guidebook's begin with, like, where is the bag?"
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yes.
00:07:19,00:07:20,Hello.
00:07:20,00:07:22,Nice to meet you.
00:07:22,00:07:25,"It's not your mother had sex with 2,000 squared."
00:07:25,00:07:26,Yeah.
00:07:26,00:07:35,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:07:35,00:07:35,OK.
00:07:35,00:07:37,"Time for fact number two, Anna."
00:07:37,00:07:42,"My fact this week is that in a 2005 questionnaire about substance abuse,"
00:07:42,00:07:46,almost one in five respondents admitted to taking a drug that doesn't exist.
00:07:46,00:07:47,That's brilliant.
00:07:47,00:07:48,Taking drugs will do that to you.
00:07:48,00:07:50,Yeah.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"So it's this drug called Derbyssel, which is a fake drug."
00:07:53,00:07:55,It's existed since 1974.
00:07:55,00:08:00,And it's basically inserted into surveys to test if respondents are lying.
00:08:00,00:08:02,"But it's kind of interesting, because it suggests"
00:08:02,00:08:05,that people who are like students who are responding to questionnaires about how many drugs
00:08:05,00:08:11,"they take, just love to claim that they take all the drugs, constantly taking drugs, even"
00:08:11,00:08:12,fake ones.
00:08:12,00:08:17,"I'm not sure it's they take all of them, because I saw that it said like 5.6% of people in"
00:08:17,00:08:23,"one of the surveys I saw took this Derbyssel drug, but only 3.6% used heroin, so it's more popular"
00:08:23,00:08:24,than heroin.
00:08:24,00:08:25,Yeah.
00:08:25,00:08:26,"Well, I guess that's because heroin is more dangerous."
00:08:26,00:08:27,Yeah.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"Well, much more dangerous than something that doesn't exist."
00:08:28,00:08:29,Yeah.
00:08:29,00:08:31,"In fact, Derbyssel is probably one of the safest drugs you can take."
00:08:31,00:08:32,"Anyway, yeah."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"It's been in questionnaires for, like, 40 years, more than 40 years."
00:08:34,00:08:40,Because people noticed that there were some fairly implausible results coming through and kids
00:08:40,00:08:45,"seem to be taking loads of drugs, and they didn't see the effects of those drugs in school."
00:08:45,00:08:46,They were working perfectly okay.
00:08:46,00:08:50,"They seem kind of compasementous, but they claim to be taking heroin six times a day."
00:08:50,00:08:52,So they suspect it's something Dodgy was going on.
00:08:52,00:08:55,And so they inserted this drug to see if kids were just lying about what they were.
00:08:55,00:08:56,Yeah.
00:08:56,00:08:57,"That's very, very funny."
00:08:57,00:09:01,"So has anyone actually made the drug, what's it called again?"
00:09:01,00:09:02,Derbyssel.
00:09:02,00:09:03,Derbyssel into an actual drug now?
00:09:03,00:09:04,Yeah.
00:09:04,00:09:05,"Because it's obviously quite a nice open market, isn't it?"
00:09:05,00:09:07,They've had free advertising already.
00:09:07,00:09:08,Yeah.
00:09:08,00:09:09,In all these surveys.
00:09:09,00:09:10,Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"It could be anything, because what's annoying about drugs is that you're only going to get"
00:09:12,00:09:13,"like one brand of effects, aren't you?"
00:09:13,00:09:17,"It's a stimulant or a hallucinogenic, but this could be all of them, whatever you wanted"
00:09:17,00:09:18,it to be.
00:09:18,00:09:20,As used by 5.6% of American teenagers.
00:09:20,00:09:21,Yeah.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Yeah.
00:09:22,00:09:25,"There is something that's not to be confused with Derbyssel, which is a wound cleaning spray"
00:09:25,00:09:27,for pigs and sheep that dissolves pus.
00:09:27,00:09:29,You don't want to get those two mixed up.
00:09:29,00:09:31,"Yeah, but I imagine that would get you really high."
00:09:31,00:09:32,Yeah.
00:09:32,00:09:36,"At the only other explanation for this drug, I should say, for the people who are ticking"
00:09:36,00:09:38,the Derbyssel box.
00:09:38,00:09:43,"In South Korea, Derbyssel is one of the trade names for a drug which is used to treat eczema"
00:09:43,00:09:44,psoriasis skin diseases.
00:09:44,00:09:50,"So maybe all the people at this school just had some serious skin problems and were Korean,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,but it was in Texas.
00:09:52,00:09:56,"I guess it's hard to do surveys because people just lie all the time, don't they?"
00:09:56,00:09:57,Yeah.
00:09:57,00:09:59,Self-reporting is a massive problem.
00:09:59,00:10:03,And especially all kinds of slightly noughtier things like drugs or sex or drinking or whatever
00:10:03,00:10:04,it is.
00:10:04,00:10:05,People misreport wildly.
00:10:05,00:10:06,Yeah.
00:10:06,00:10:11,I remember reading a survey of how many sexual partners people have had.
00:10:11,00:10:15,"And apparently, the average man has had something like 30 sexual partners and the average"
00:10:15,00:10:21,"woman has had only seven, which means either everyone's lying or there's one very promiscuous"
00:10:21,00:10:24,woman.
00:10:24,00:10:26,Carl Sagan was a pothead.
00:10:26,00:10:27,What he said he was.
00:10:27,00:10:33,"Julian, his widow who made the latest Cosmos series, is the head of a movement to get it legalized"
00:10:33,00:10:34,in the States.
00:10:34,00:10:37,Does that mean everything he's told us is just a drug-induced fantasy?
00:10:37,00:10:41,I'm going to have to scratch some of my QI facts.
00:10:41,00:10:47,"The same sort of thing, Winston Churchill had the image of him always having a tumbler"
00:10:47,00:10:52,"of whiskey with him, but I think a lot of people reported that it was very, very watered"
00:10:52,00:10:53,down.
00:10:53,00:10:54,There was so much ice in it.
00:10:54,00:10:58,"He drank it so slowly that he might as well not have been having whiskey at all, basically."
00:10:58,00:11:01,That supposedly was the same as Dean Martin.
00:11:01,00:11:06,"His whole stage persona was to be this quite drunk, slightly slurry kind of character, but"
00:11:06,00:11:08,apparently Apple Juice was what he wanted to say.
00:11:08,00:11:09,Really?
00:11:09,00:11:15,"When we're talking about how it's difficult to do surveys and stuff like that, something"
00:11:15,00:11:16,came into my head.
00:11:16,00:11:19,"I don't even know if it's related, but Andy, do you remember the thing where people had"
00:11:19,00:11:25,"to do a survey about how they'd react if they were in terrible danger, and they were on"
00:11:25,00:11:28,an aeroplane and they were told the aeroplane was going to crash.
00:11:28,00:11:29,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:29,00:11:31,"I'm sure you researched it, what was that?"
00:11:31,00:11:36,"It was to test the response to stress, I think."
00:11:36,00:11:41,"A lot of soldiers were loaded into a plane which climbed to 5,000 feet and then stayed level"
00:11:41,00:11:47,"for a few minutes and then just shook the passengers around, lots, and then told everyone"
00:11:47,00:11:52,"that they were going to die, that they was injured and failure, and that they had to fill"
00:11:52,00:11:56,out forms for any member of their family to get any benefits after they died.
00:11:56,00:12:00,"And so they did their best, but they then compared the forms to ones that they had filled"
00:12:00,00:12:03,out on the ground when they didn't think they were going to die.
00:12:03,00:12:06,And we don't really know what they were using this data for.
00:12:06,00:12:12,"Some of them got wise to it and they wrote messages on the Essexness bags saying, ""Don't"
00:12:12,00:12:13,be afraid.
00:12:13,00:12:14,This is an experiment.
00:12:14,00:12:15,"You're not going to die."""
00:12:15,00:12:17,What are the other people on the plane saying?
00:12:17,00:12:21,"I reckon if I got into an easy jet flight and I looked at the sick bag and it said, ""Don't"
00:12:21,00:12:22,be afraid.
00:12:22,00:12:23,This is an experiment.
00:12:23,00:12:24,"You're not going to die."""
00:12:24,00:12:29,I'd probably be more worried than if I hadn't seen that message.
00:12:29,00:12:38,"Okay, so I'm going to move on to fact number three, this is my fact."
00:12:38,00:12:43,I stole this fact actually from James Harkin who's writing the new QI book I saw it over
00:12:43,00:12:44,his shoulder.
00:12:44,00:12:47,Let's see how those have a secret pocket in their armpit which they like to keep their
00:12:47,00:12:48,favourite stones in.
00:12:48,00:12:54,"It's going to be a secret pocket, because they lack the capacity to tell anyone."
00:12:54,00:12:57,"Yeah, it's not the speed of the arch."
00:12:57,00:13:01,"Yeah, so the stone's thing is really interesting because they use them."
00:13:01,00:13:04,It's an actual tool to smash stuff open.
00:13:04,00:13:08,"They eat tons of different kinds of foods, but there's some shellfish-y style foods where"
00:13:08,00:13:11,"they need to smash it open, which I think isn't that quite rare?"
00:13:11,00:13:14,"Yeah, not many animals use tools."
00:13:14,00:13:16,Let's think who uses tools.
00:13:16,00:13:20,"Oh, Croz and Jack Doz have been tested and they definitely use them."
00:13:20,00:13:23,Is it a tool to use the ground?
00:13:23,00:13:28,"I don't know, because there's a bird called Alamagaya which lifts up tortoises into the"
00:13:28,00:13:31,air and drops them onto the ground.
00:13:31,00:13:32,Oh yeah.
00:13:32,00:13:33,"That's a riskless, isn't it?"
00:13:33,00:13:35,"Yeah, onto a particular patch of rocky, stony ground."
00:13:35,00:13:37,So I don't know if that's using tools.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"Yeah, I would say so."
00:13:38,00:13:39,Arguably.
00:13:39,00:13:40,You said a name just then.
00:13:40,00:13:41,That was the philosopher who died.
00:13:41,00:13:43,So did he genuinely die from a-
00:13:43,00:13:47,"Well, we don't know exactly how he died, but the only evidence that we have is that someone"
00:13:47,00:13:49,wrote that that's how he died.
00:13:49,00:13:51,"Nobody, he did supposedly die that way, didn't he?"
00:13:51,00:13:52,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:52,00:13:54,Is that the only case in history of that having happened?
00:13:54,00:13:55,To my knowledge.
00:13:55,00:13:56,"So, yeah."
00:13:56,00:14:01,"There was a different case of an asteroid killing a dog in Egypt in 1912, but that's completely"
00:14:01,00:14:02,different.
00:14:02,00:14:04,The only link is something falling on someone's face.
00:14:04,00:14:11,There were always rumors that you could die from effluent flushed out of airplanes.
00:14:11,00:14:12,"That's not true, is it?"
00:14:12,00:14:13,Frozen effluent.
00:14:13,00:14:14,It's not true.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"No, it can't happen in case anyone was scared."
00:14:16,00:14:21,"Well, what happens is that people who live under flight paths will sometimes find blocks"
00:14:21,00:14:25,"of ice, and it's slightly miscolored, and they think it's going to be frozen urine."
00:14:25,00:14:29,"But what it usually is, is the airplanes have been flying very high."
00:14:29,00:14:32,"They get ice on the wings, and then when they come down the ice melts, and it falls."
00:14:32,00:14:33,Okay.
00:14:33,00:14:34,"Basically, yeah."
00:14:34,00:14:36,Does mate you wonder if you've got terrible food poisoning on a plane if they have to
00:14:36,00:14:39,"on a long haul flight, if they have to make an emergency landing halfway there to unload?"
00:14:39,00:14:44,"Do you see that thing where a hundred children had vomiting and diarrhea, sickness on a flight"
00:14:44,00:14:45,the other day?
00:14:45,00:14:46,It wasn't a hundred.
00:14:46,00:14:47,Was it not?
00:14:47,00:14:48,No.
00:14:48,00:14:51,"I think the choir was 60, but I think a lot of them did go down with it."
00:14:51,00:14:52,It was all of them.
00:14:52,00:14:57,"They dispatched about four ambulance teams in parallel, but imagine being on that flight."
00:14:57,00:14:58,I know.
00:14:58,00:15:03,"I'd probably conflate in it with another fact, which is there was a Baltimore food safety"
00:15:03,00:15:07,"conference a couple of weeks ago, and a hundred people who went to that got food poisoning."
00:15:07,00:15:08,Brilliant.
00:15:08,00:15:09,Wow.
00:15:09,00:15:11,So let's talk about otters.
00:15:11,00:15:12,Otters.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Shall we?
00:15:13,00:15:14,Hold hands.
00:15:14,00:15:15,So they know.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"They hold hands, yeah, so they don't float away."
00:15:16,00:15:17,"Well, they sleep."
00:15:17,00:15:20,"Yeah, let's put that up on the website, because everyone loves that video, don't they?"
00:15:20,00:15:21,That's really cute.
00:15:21,00:15:25,Not so cute is that they peel the skin off poisonous toads in one piece before eating
00:15:25,00:15:27,the flesh so they don't get poisoned from the skin.
00:15:27,00:15:29,But that is as a party trick.
00:15:29,00:15:32,It's like I can peel an orange with one hand.
00:15:32,00:15:34,Here's a thing.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"If you get an orange and put it in a bowl of water, it'll float."
00:15:38,00:15:40,"If you peel it and put it in a bowl of water, it'll sink."
00:15:40,00:15:41,Wow.
00:15:41,00:15:42,What baby otters can't dive?
00:15:42,00:15:44,They're too buoyant.
00:15:44,00:15:45,Really?
00:15:45,00:15:46,Yeah.
00:15:46,00:15:48,That's a thing that comes with age that they can suddenly dive.
00:15:48,00:15:52,There's been a bit of anti-otter propaganda on the internet recently.
00:15:52,00:15:53,I was reading.
00:15:53,00:15:54,What's that meant?
00:15:54,00:16:00,"There was a magazine article on an online magazine called Vox, and it was entitled The"
00:16:00,00:16:06,"Case Against Otters, Necrophiliac serial killing fur monsters of the sea."
00:16:06,00:16:10,"It was written by a guy called Dylan Matthews, and he said that otters are jerks."
00:16:10,00:16:14,He's missed the chance of calling them rotters.
00:16:14,00:16:15,They kill baby otters.
00:16:15,00:16:22,"They have attacked people, monkeys, and alligators, and they sometimes copulate with dead otters."
00:16:22,00:16:23,Attacked alligators?
00:16:23,00:16:24,How did that go for them?
00:16:24,00:16:25,That's very cool.
00:16:25,00:16:29,"OK, this is very interesting if he says that, because the ancient Greeks had a theory"
00:16:29,00:16:34,or a belief that otters killed crocodiles by scampering into their mouths and then eating
00:16:34,00:16:38,all of their entrails and then running out again when the crocodile was dead.
00:16:38,00:16:39,Isn't that great?
00:16:39,00:16:42,"That's a brilliant idea, but it's definitely not true."
00:16:42,00:16:43,Yeah.
00:16:43,00:16:49,"I was reading about Wombats, and Wombats have a pouch, so similar to a kangaroo."
00:16:49,00:16:50,OK.
00:16:50,00:16:56,"But Wombats dig through the ground, and so their pouches are upside down."
00:16:56,00:16:57,What?
00:16:57,00:16:59,They don't get any of the stuff into their pouches.
00:16:59,00:17:00,Will the baby just fall out?
00:17:00,00:17:02,"No, because unlike a kangaroo, they're not vertical."
00:17:02,00:17:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:03,00:17:07,The one Wombat fact I remember is that they have cubic feces.
00:17:07,00:17:08,They do have cubic feces.
00:17:08,00:17:12,They also have incredible butts.
00:17:12,00:17:15,Like their asses are insanely hard.
00:17:15,00:17:20,"No, no, they're very interesting though, they're very interesting because if they're chased"
00:17:20,00:17:24,"by a predator, they run into their burrow, their hole, but they purposefully leave their"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"butt out, and nothing can penetrate it."
00:17:29,00:17:35,"Yeah, Chris Clement, who's a biologist from Australia, came on the museum of curiosity last"
00:17:35,00:17:37,"year, and I'm sure he mentioned this."
00:17:37,00:17:38,He did.
00:17:38,00:17:39,This is where I first have it.
00:17:39,00:17:40,They have a reinforced rump.
00:17:40,00:17:44,"When a predator attacks a Wombat, it runs into its burrow and uses its tough cartilage"
00:17:44,00:17:46,filled bum to block the hole.
00:17:46,00:17:51,"I've also found that apparently the further is very coarse and white, so it would feel"
00:17:51,00:17:56,"like bristles to eat, which must be pleasant for a predator."
00:17:56,00:17:57,So try and buy it.
00:17:57,00:17:58,Yeah.
00:17:58,00:17:59,I take it all back.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"Yeah, super butts."
00:18:00,00:18:01,Yeah.
00:18:01,00:18:05,"Just speaking of butts, I read that turtles breathe through those butts."
00:18:05,00:18:07,"Not all turtles, but a lot."
00:18:07,00:18:08,"Yeah, some of them do."
00:18:08,00:18:09,Did they urinate through their mouth?
00:18:09,00:18:10,They do.
00:18:10,00:18:12,The whole system has gone haywire there.
00:18:12,00:18:17,Are you sure you just weren't holding the turtle the wrong way around?
00:18:17,00:18:22,"Animals collecting stuff, um, power birds."
00:18:22,00:18:24,You guys have many with power birds.
00:18:24,00:18:28,"Power birds build these amazing structures, like these homes for their, um, potential mate,"
00:18:28,00:18:32,"and then they collect shiny objects or like nice looking objects, and they adorn it,"
00:18:32,00:18:33,and it's amazing.
00:18:33,00:18:36,"So you see them trying to seduce ladies, and they'll bring them like anything they can"
00:18:36,00:18:37,find.
00:18:37,00:18:41,"There's one, I think there's a video of one, keeps bringing this lady like a shiny stone"
00:18:41,00:18:46,"or a bit of sandwich or a bit of cloth, and the lady keeps rejecting them."
00:18:46,00:18:49,"And then eventually he brings her a ring, and she goes, ""Oh yeah, right, then."
00:18:49,00:18:50,Go for it.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"Yeah, I'll put that on the website."""
00:18:51,00:18:52,That sounds very familiar.
00:18:52,00:18:53,Yeah.
00:18:53,00:19:02,"The number of times when I was carting my wife, bringing her a little bit of sandwich."
00:19:02,00:19:08,"Okay, and now it's time for a final fact of the show, and that's your fact, James."
00:19:08,00:19:11,"Yep, my fact is very simple this week."
00:19:11,00:19:13,Nops have been made illegal in Vancouver.
00:19:13,00:19:23,"Just going for the cheap laugh, and illegal is the slight stretch."
00:19:23,00:19:30,"It's, when you make a new house in Vancouver now, it's illegal to put a dawn up on rather"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"than a dawn handle, and that's to make it more accessible."
00:19:32,00:19:36,"Which I think is quite interesting, like, is it going to be the first place, is it going"
00:19:36,00:19:37,to be the rest of the world?
00:19:37,00:19:39,Are we going to be losing the dawn ups?
00:19:39,00:19:42,No one will know what a dawn up is in 500 years.
00:19:42,00:19:43,Yeah.
00:19:43,00:19:47,"So that's weird of how recent dawn ups are, I mean, Victoria and Abraham Lincoln, who"
00:19:47,00:19:49,would not have known what a dawn up was.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Really?
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Yeah, dawn ups only came in in the late 1800s."
00:19:51,00:19:54,"Oh, the latches weren't there, things like that."
00:19:54,00:19:55,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:55,00:20:00,"So if this works in Vancouver, it could be that there was only a 150-year period in the"
00:20:00,00:20:01,whole of history where people had dawn up.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"Yeah, we think we were lucky enough to live in that area."
00:20:04,00:20:05,And blessed.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"That's your theory about landlines, isn't it, James?"
00:20:07,00:20:08,Yeah.
00:20:08,00:20:13,The idea of having a telephone in your house was it didn't happen until the mid-20
00:20:13,00:20:16,"century, then hardly anyone had it until the 70s and 80s."
00:20:16,00:20:18,And then everyone had it for a few decades.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"And now everyone just has mobile phones, no one has landlines."
00:20:21,00:20:26,"And so in 100 years, they'll look back at only a 20-year period where everyone had phone"
00:20:26,00:20:27,lines.
00:20:27,00:20:28,And it's going to look really weird.
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"And they're still going to ask in 200 years, why are they still putting this on surface?"
00:20:32,00:20:36,Please insert your landline.
00:20:36,00:20:38,Stop putting that there.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"So that's, I mean, that's a really good point."
00:20:39,00:20:43,More knobs are effectively going to be a blip.
00:20:43,00:20:48,"It's a bit like, so that legislation reminds me of, it's like Shabbat elevators, isn't it?"
00:20:48,00:20:51,"And Israel now, all new builds have to have Shabbat elevators."
00:20:51,00:20:52,What is one of those?
00:20:52,00:20:56,"Because under Jewish law, you're not allowed to operate electronics on the Sabbath."
00:20:56,00:20:59,They're lifts that go automatically.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"They also have Shindler's lifts, which they can use as well."
00:21:02,00:21:04,That's one of the most three biggest lift managers.
00:21:04,00:21:05,"Yeah, really?"
00:21:05,00:21:06,Shindler's lifts.
00:21:06,00:21:07,Yeah.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"That is, I can't believe I didn't know that."
00:21:08,00:21:09,That's amazing.
00:21:09,00:21:18,"I read from the ignoble reporters that supposedly lift music, if you have a cold, it's a great cure"
00:21:18,00:21:20,for the common cold.
00:21:20,00:21:22,Lift music is a scientific report.
00:21:22,00:21:24,"First of all, we don't have any cure for the common cold."
00:21:24,00:21:26,"Second of all, lift music."
00:21:26,00:21:27,Yeah.
00:21:27,00:21:31,"I'm only reporting science guys, people, people who listened to lift music got better in"
00:21:31,00:21:32,two weeks.
00:21:32,00:21:35,"People who didn't took as long as 14 days, like also recovered."
00:21:35,00:21:37,"On the hand, on the door knobs thing."
00:21:37,00:21:41,"I found a quote from someone who was hostile to the idea, because the reason they did it"
00:21:41,00:21:44,was for the elderly and an aging population.
00:21:44,00:21:48,A lot of people have arthritis and the sort of the twisting action of turning one of the
00:21:48,00:21:49,tools.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"Yeah, 67 million adult Americans will have arthritis by 2030, according to one survey."
00:21:53,00:21:54,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:54,00:21:55,So that's very interesting.
00:21:55,00:22:00,"And I found someone opposing it saying, ""Bairs will be very appreciative of this change,"
00:22:00,00:22:04,"as an unlocked lever door is an invitation in the snack time, those round knobs are tricky"
00:22:04,00:22:09,"with tools, which kind of compares people who suffer from arthritis to bears."""
00:22:09,00:22:13,"I was reading this in the economist and one of the censuses they had was, ""The rules have"
00:22:13,00:22:21,"provoked grumbling about the nanny state, much of it from dawn of manufacturers."""
00:22:21,00:22:26,I found another guy who was objecting who was the president of the antique dawn knob collectors
00:22:26,00:22:27,of America.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:28,00:22:30,But presumably he should be happy because more of them will be antiques.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:31,00:22:32,Yeah.
00:22:32,00:22:34,It's an election all the more valuable.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Yeah.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Literally everything will be an antique.
00:22:36,00:22:39,I was looking at weird laws.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:44,"And it's quite hard to find weird laws that are actually laws rather than internet myths,"
00:22:44,00:22:45,obviously.
00:22:45,00:22:49,"But I do like the fact that in Denmark, it actually is a legal requirement to check under"
00:22:49,00:22:54,your car for sleeping people or for people before you start driving it.
00:22:54,00:22:55,Really?
00:22:55,00:22:57,"And if you do run somebody over because they were sleeping under your car when you started,"
00:22:57,00:23:00,then you're going to be in trouble for it with insurance.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Wow.
00:23:01,00:23:04,"I don't know if this is a common habit in Denmark, if people fall asleep on the cars all"
00:23:04,00:23:05,the time.
00:23:05,00:23:06,That's very interesting.
00:23:06,00:23:08,But it's a thing.
00:23:08,00:23:11,And the other thing is that there's actually a legal in Thailand to go out in public without
00:23:11,00:23:12,worrying underwear.
00:23:12,00:23:13,That's a thing.
00:23:13,00:23:14,Wow.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"And I also like places where it's illegal to die, which it isn't in the houses of parliament,"
00:23:17,00:23:18,although a lot of people think that it is.
00:23:18,00:23:20,It's not illegal to die in the houses of parliament.
00:23:20,00:23:21,No.
00:23:21,00:23:22,Wow.
00:23:22,00:23:24,You are free to go there and do that.
00:23:24,00:23:25,But it is.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"You know, just if you want to."
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:35,"Is illegal to die in Longyear Bayon, which is in Norway, yeah, it's in Svalbard."
00:23:35,00:23:36,Yes.
00:23:36,00:23:40,"When you say it's illegal to die there, what are the ramifications for you?"
00:23:40,00:23:41,I think it--
00:23:41,00:23:42,Once you've done the act.
00:23:42,00:23:43,I think ramifications for your family.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"Oh, OK."
00:23:44,00:23:45,So it's a little bit like that aeroplane moment.
00:23:45,00:23:49,How much do you really care about the family who are going to be punished after your death?
00:23:49,00:23:51,It's because they found out that bodies don't decompose there.
00:23:51,00:23:55,"Corpus is a preserved by permafrost, which I think James might know more about this"
00:23:55,00:23:57,is just to do with their climate.
00:23:57,00:23:58,Yes.
00:23:58,00:23:59,"Really, really cold."
00:23:59,00:24:00,Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:01,Because it's about as far off as you can get.
00:24:01,00:24:02,Right.
00:24:02,00:24:06,"So basically they're like cryogenically frozen, if you will."
00:24:06,00:24:12,Do you think Mount Everest is our permanent sort of the most likely spot that future civilizations
00:24:12,00:24:14,will find people of our time?
00:24:14,00:24:15,Because they're frozen.
00:24:15,00:24:18,"They're fully-- like when they found Mallory, this whole body was there."
00:24:18,00:24:19,Yeah.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"Well, honestly."
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:27,"The look does as well in a run, I think, maybe it gets so hot that things won't decompose"
00:24:27,00:24:28,there.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Maybe I might go up.
00:24:29,00:24:30,"That's amazing, though."
00:24:30,00:24:32,"Because you often think, obviously, in cold things won't decompose."
00:24:32,00:24:36,"But of course, like microbes are going to not be able to live at a certain temperature,"
00:24:36,00:24:37,certainly.
00:24:37,00:24:41,"Well, I was reading a guide to what to do after civilization ends yesterday."
00:24:41,00:24:47,"And it recommended plastic bottles to, you know, the phrase sunlight is the best disinfectant"
00:24:47,00:24:48,talking about openness.
00:24:48,00:24:52,It turns out the sunlight also acts as a disinfectant by killing microbes.
00:24:52,00:24:57,"So if you want to have cleaner drinking water, put it in plastic bottles."
00:24:57,00:25:01,Let the light shine quite fiercely on it and the light and all the heat.
00:25:01,00:25:02,I'm not sure.
00:25:02,00:25:03,We'll kill when it grows.
00:25:03,00:25:04,Knowledge.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"That's good, eh?"
00:25:05,00:25:06,That is good.
00:25:06,00:25:07,Why are you doing that?
00:25:07,00:25:08,"We're having a rough day yesterday, Andy."
00:25:08,00:25:11,I'm just finishing my plans.
00:25:11,00:25:14,"Speaking of survivals, if we don't have Donob's anymore, then there are some things that"
00:25:14,00:25:16,they've been useful for in the past that we won't have anymore.
00:25:16,00:25:25,"So after the tsunami, the famous one in Southeast Asia, there was a guy called Rizal Shah-Putra,"
00:25:25,00:25:29,"and he got lost at sea, as many people did."
00:25:29,00:25:34,"But he survived because he ate coconuts which he cracked open with a Donob, which was also"
00:25:34,00:25:35,floating past.
00:25:35,00:25:36,So that was a really useful Donob.
00:25:36,00:25:37,That's great.
00:25:37,00:25:38,"Oh, yes."
00:25:38,00:25:42,"If only he had a little pouch in which it's still years or a lot, then he wouldn't know that"
00:25:42,00:25:43,at all.
00:25:43,00:25:44,Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:49,"Between 1830 and 1873, over 100 US patents alone were for Donob's."
00:25:49,00:25:50,Oh.
00:25:50,00:25:53,"The slight improvements on the Donob's, or..."
00:25:53,00:25:57,"I guess they would be like the latch, they would be in the toilets when you do just that"
00:25:57,00:26:02,"little turnover, little bar goes over, and I guess they count as Donob's, don't they?"
00:26:02,00:26:04,I think a knob has to be knob-shaped.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"God, then that's going to be an exciting afternoon looking to what those payed into."
00:26:08,00:26:10,There are still a lot of innovations happening though.
00:26:10,00:26:16,I think they're working on ones in hospitals which dispense hand sanitizer as you go through.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"Although presumably they wouldn't do that every time you open the door, otherwise you"
00:26:18,00:26:24,just have loads of hand sanitizer on the floor and a lot of people slipping and falling.
00:26:24,00:26:25,But I think they have developed a way of doing it.
00:26:25,00:26:29,So you can also give yourself a quick hit of hand sanitizer as you go through from one room
00:26:29,00:26:30,to another.
00:26:30,00:26:31,Right.
00:26:31,00:26:32,It's pretty cool.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"At least when you're falling and bleeding and your wounds are on open, you've got a very"
00:26:35,00:26:37,sanitised surface to London.
00:26:37,00:26:38,Yeah.
00:26:38,00:26:42,In the absence of Derbysol.
00:26:42,00:26:49,"Okay, that's it."
00:26:49,00:26:51,That's all our facts for this week.
