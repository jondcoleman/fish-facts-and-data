WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.200
 Yeah.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 It's kind of a nice, such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.680
 It says it, "Ride that first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:25.720
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.920
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Colbert Garden.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.080
 My name is Dan Schriver.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.280
 I'm sitting here with the regular 3Ls, James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Anna Chazinski.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our favorite facts from the week,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.640
 and we're about to go over them in no particular order.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.320
 Here we go.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.400
 Starting with back number one.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000
 And that is Andy's.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.520
 Yeah.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.560
 My fact this week is that the words "tory" and "prime minister" both started out as being insults.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.480
 Wait, so what was a prime minister called prior to a prime minister?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 Well, a prime minister was originally not called that.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.520
 He was called the First Lord of the Treasury.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.840
 And the term "prime minister" was thought to be an insult,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.280
 because it was as though the First Lord of the Treasury was putting himself above other ministers

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.520
 and marking himself out of this in some way better.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.360
 So the one we call the first prime minister, Robert Walpole,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 didn't actually call himself prime minister ever in lifetime.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120
 And it took a very long time.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 I think it was 1905 before the phrase was actually officially recognised.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.360
 So I really like that a lot.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.880
 Yeah.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.600
 And a "tory" used to be a word for a brigand or an outlaw in Ireland

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.760
 who noted for outrageous and savage cruelty.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.800
 Well, that's quite a change of meaning, isn't it?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 Yeah, most of them are not Irish anymore.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.000
 But it was, yeah, "tory" is older than conservative,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.560
 which I always thought was strange, because "tory" sounds like the slang term for the conservative.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.520
 Wick was also an insult, I think, wasn't it?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.040
 What's that?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.800
 Yeah, Wick meant a cattle driver.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.600
 So it seems like all the names that we give to our politicians

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.280
 and political parties are actually negative, have negative connotations.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.760
 But this got me onto unparliamentary language.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.000
 What you can and can't get away with in the House of Commons.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.880
 So M.P. should not call other members liars,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.880
 suggest they have false motives, misrepresent what another person has said,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.480
 use abusive or insulting language, or describe another member as drunk.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.080
 You can't do that.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 But you can't get away with loads of stuff.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.760
 So Tony Banks, Labour MP, said that Margaret Attractor acted

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.840
 with the sensitivity of a sex-starved bower constrictor.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.280
 He also described Tory MP Terry Dix as "living proof that a pig's bladder

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.480
 on the end of a stick can be elected to parliament."

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.240
 LAUGHTER

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.600
 Which is pretty rude, not to be called up on it.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.200
 So was the famous one, was it Dennis Skinner said that half of Tory MPs,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.080
 thieves and criminals, and he was told to take it back.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.400
 And he said, "All right, then half of Tory MPs are not thieves and criminals."

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.800
 Oh, that's such a good one.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.640
 I don't know when we don't have more fun political.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.400
 I guess we have the Monster Raving Looney party, although I don't know what's happened to that.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.680
 But are the countries have some super fun political parties?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.360
 Like the Polish beer lovers party?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 Poland actually has some really good parties.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.240
 But yeah, which one three percent of the vote in 1991?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.520
 Could you accuse that party of being drunk?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.360
 In parliament?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.440
 I guess that was the best thing.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.080
 I do like it when, just to take it away from politics for a second,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.920
 of taking a word that was meant as an insult and suddenly it becomes the main thing.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.320
 And famously, that's what happened with Fred Hoyl when he was told about the theory

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.720
 about how the universe began from an explosion of a singularity and so on.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.440
 And he coined the term "big bang."

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.120
 But he said it in a sort of, "Oh, I guess it was some sort of big bang."

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.000
 And he didn't agree with the theory, but everyone went, "Big bang, I'm going to write that down."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.360
 Got down to the press and it not only helped give it a name,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.320
 but it actually popularized it as a theory generally because it was such a lovely term.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.920
 So the newspaper has picked up on it.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920
 And I've got his obituary up here.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.240
 He died in 2001.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.200
 He's a BBC news.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.640
 This is the opening paragraph.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.480
 The English astronomer who coined the term "big bang" to describe the academic theory.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.640
 So immediately, it's the top line of his life.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.360
 There's one thing that he didn't want anything to do with.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.920
 Do you think our insults have got worse over the century?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.160
 I think when you look back over Shakespearean insults and age-all insults.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.920
 We're less proficient and beautiful.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.680
 Yes, less interesting, less imaginative.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.000
 What's the thick of it?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.120
 I mean, there's always been a market for people who are really good at coming up with insults.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.840
 Actually, that's a good point.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.280
 There's a Dutch insult, I can't pronounce it.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.160
 Volga Shit and Palinville, which translates as a shit-filled eel skin,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.320
 which means a skinny person.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.240
 It's such an elaborate way of calling such a skinny.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.680
 I think we're slightly running low on insults at the moment,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.920
 because we're all becoming quite aware of how actually insulting we are.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.040
 I got loads here.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.920
 All right.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.440
 All right, then.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.520
 Top three insults, you found.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.280
 Oh, blind me.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 All right.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.720
 The Micronesian island of Yapp, and in Yappi's language,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.160
 only about 6,000 people speak it.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.280
 One of the most serious insults you can dish out is saying,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.880
 "You have no foreskin."

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.320
 They have very big stones, don't they, in Yapp?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.320
 But do they?

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.960
 Yeah, they're famous for, instead of currency,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.400
 they have these massive, massive, round millstones,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.240
 and you can buy a house with them or whatever.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 And they never move, because there's too big and heavy to move,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.240
 but the ownership of the stone just transfers from one person to another.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.240
 Yeah, the cool thing about these stones as well,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240
 they're absolutely massive.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.000
 We'll put a picture up on the website.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.880
 It's not always the biggest one that is most valuable.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.960
 It's the one which was the most difficult to get.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.160
 So if someone died when they were trying to get this stone,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.040
 no matter how big it was, it would be worth more than a massive one,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.800
 which was easily got--

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.560
 Wow.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.520
 Size doesn't matter.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.760
 So, and the second--

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.720
 OK, so, yeah, first one, Micronesian island of Yappi,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.960
 you have no foreskin.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.640
 Second one, I do like the Farsi curse,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.440
 which translates as "may a fart be on your beard."

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.920
 [LAUGHS]

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.680
 So--

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.600
 That's great.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.400
 That's brilliant.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.760
 So graphic.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.800
 And last one, OK, they can have a tie for the last one.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.480
 Oh, yes.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.440
 Either the Hungarian insult, La Faz as Segued Bay,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.520
 which translates as "may a horse's penis make its way into your bottom."

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.440
 [LAUGHS]

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.800
 Or-- and this is one of the very worst insults in Argentinian Spanish,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.240
 which equates to calling someone's mother a prostitute 16 million times over.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.840
 Wow.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.080
 It translates as, "Your mother, who gave birth to you twice,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.800
 was a whore 2,000 times over squared."

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.520
 So it's--

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.200
 Well, it's a mathematical insult.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.680
 I always think that learning insults in a language

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.440
 would be a good way of starting to learn.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.920
 Yes.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.520
 I have this theory of learning languages as in learning the vocabulary,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.480
 which is, first of all, you go for the insults,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.360
 because that's the one that everyone wants to learn.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.280
 As soon as you know what your mother is a whore in a language,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.560
 you want to use it all the time.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.680
 The next one is you learn words that sound slightly rude in English,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.840
 because you're going to remember those all the time.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.960
 And then you go from there.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.760
 And I think that's a really good way of learning vocabulary in languages.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.920
 It's a very good way of learning.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.080
 It's not the most appropriate way of starting a conversation in your stages.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.720
 That's why the guidebook's begin with, like, where is the bag?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.360
 Yes.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.000
 Hello.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.080
 Nice to meet you.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.080
 It's not your mother had sex with 2,000 squared.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.080
 Yeah.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:35.040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.640
 OK.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.520
 Time for fact number two, Anna.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.440
 My fact this week is that in a 2005 questionnaire about substance abuse,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.440
 almost one in five respondents admitted to taking a drug that doesn't exist.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.200
 That's brilliant.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.800
 Taking drugs will do that to you.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.600
 Yeah.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.360
 So it's this drug called Derbyssel, which is a fake drug.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.680
 It's existed since 1974.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.400
 And it's basically inserted into surveys to test if respondents are lying.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 But it's kind of interesting, because it suggests

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.880
 that people who are like students who are responding to questionnaires about how many drugs

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.480
 they take, just love to claim that they take all the drugs, constantly taking drugs, even

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480
 fake ones.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.280
 I'm not sure it's they take all of them, because I saw that it said like 5.6% of people in

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.440
 one of the surveys I saw took this Derbyssel drug, but only 3.6% used heroin, so it's more popular

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440
 than heroin.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440
 Yeah.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440
 Well, I guess that's because heroin is more dangerous.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440
 Yeah.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.920
 Well, much more dangerous than something that doesn't exist.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920
 Yeah.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.920
 In fact, Derbyssel is probably one of the safest drugs you can take.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.920
 Anyway, yeah.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.920
 It's been in questionnaires for, like, 40 years, more than 40 years.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.040
 Because people noticed that there were some fairly implausible results coming through and kids

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.280
 seem to be taking loads of drugs, and they didn't see the effects of those drugs in school.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.680
 They were working perfectly okay.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.600
 They seem kind of compasementous, but they claim to be taking heroin six times a day.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.320
 So they suspect it's something Dodgy was going on.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.480
 And so they inserted this drug to see if kids were just lying about what they were.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480
 Yeah.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480
 That's very, very funny.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.240
 So has anyone actually made the drug, what's it called again?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240
 Derbyssel.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240
 Derbyssel into an actual drug now?

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240
 Yeah.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.880
 Because it's obviously quite a nice open market, isn't it?

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.360
 They've had free advertising already.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360
 Yeah.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360
 In all these surveys.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360
 Yeah.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.400
 It could be anything, because what's annoying about drugs is that you're only going to get

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.880
 like one brand of effects, aren't you?

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.120
 It's a stimulant or a hallucinogenic, but this could be all of them, whatever you wanted

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.120
 it to be.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.800
 As used by 5.6% of American teenagers.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800
 Yeah.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800
 Yeah.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.400
 There is something that's not to be confused with Derbyssel, which is a wound cleaning spray

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.840
 for pigs and sheep that dissolves pus.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.560
 You don't want to get those two mixed up.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.800
 Yeah, but I imagine that would get you really high.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800
 Yeah.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.640
 At the only other explanation for this drug, I should say, for the people who are ticking

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.280
 the Derbyssel box.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.640
 In South Korea, Derbyssel is one of the trade names for a drug which is used to treat eczema

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.960
 psoriasis skin diseases.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.440
 So maybe all the people at this school just had some serious skin problems and were Korean,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.640
 but it was in Texas.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.840
 I guess it's hard to do surveys because people just lie all the time, don't they?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.840
 Yeah.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.040
 Self-reporting is a massive problem.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.800
 And especially all kinds of slightly noughtier things like drugs or sex or drinking or whatever

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800
 it is.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.800
 People misreport wildly.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800
 Yeah.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.320
 I remember reading a survey of how many sexual partners people have had.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.160
 And apparently, the average man has had something like 30 sexual partners and the average

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.800
 woman has had only seven, which means either everyone's lying or there's one very promiscuous

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.800
 woman.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.600
 Carl Sagan was a pothead.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600
 What he said he was.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.200
 Julian, his widow who made the latest Cosmos series, is the head of a movement to get it legalized

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200
 in the States.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.440
 Does that mean everything he's told us is just a drug-induced fantasy?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.200
 I'm going to have to scratch some of my QI facts.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.800
 The same sort of thing, Winston Churchill had the image of him always having a tumbler

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.440
 of whiskey with him, but I think a lot of people reported that it was very, very watered

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.440
 down.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.440
 There was so much ice in it.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.760
 He drank it so slowly that he might as well not have been having whiskey at all, basically.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.040
 That supposedly was the same as Dean Martin.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.480
 His whole stage persona was to be this quite drunk, slightly slurry kind of character, but

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.880
 apparently Apple Juice was what he wanted to say.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.880
 Really?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.080
 When we're talking about how it's difficult to do surveys and stuff like that, something

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080
 came into my head.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.640
 I don't even know if it's related, but Andy, do you remember the thing where people had

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.840
 to do a survey about how they'd react if they were in terrible danger, and they were on

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.640
 an aeroplane and they were told the aeroplane was going to crash.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.640
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.560
 I'm sure you researched it, what was that?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.240
 It was to test the response to stress, I think.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.200
 A lot of soldiers were loaded into a plane which climbed to 5,000 feet and then stayed level

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.760
 for a few minutes and then just shook the passengers around, lots, and then told everyone

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.000
 that they were going to die, that they was injured and failure, and that they had to fill

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.360
 out forms for any member of their family to get any benefits after they died.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.360
 And so they did their best, but they then compared the forms to ones that they had filled

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.280
 out on the ground when they didn't think they were going to die.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.960
 And we don't really know what they were using this data for.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.160
 Some of them got wise to it and they wrote messages on the Essexness bags saying, "Don't

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160
 be afraid.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160
 This is an experiment.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160
 You're not going to die."

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.960
 What are the other people on the plane saying?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.800
 I reckon if I got into an easy jet flight and I looked at the sick bag and it said, "Don't

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800
 be afraid.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800
 This is an experiment.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800
 You're not going to die."

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.560
 I'd probably be more worried than if I hadn't seen that message.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:38.880
 Okay, so I'm going to move on to fact number three, this is my fact.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.200
 I stole this fact actually from James Harkin who's writing the new QI book I saw it over

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200
 his shoulder.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.720
 Let's see how those have a secret pocket in their armpit which they like to keep their

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720
 favourite stones in.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.480
 It's going to be a secret pocket, because they lack the capacity to tell anyone.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.200
 Yeah, it's not the speed of the arch.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.160
 Yeah, so the stone's thing is really interesting because they use them.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.560
 It's an actual tool to smash stuff open.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.760
 They eat tons of different kinds of foods, but there's some shellfish-y style foods where

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.960
 they need to smash it open, which I think isn't that quite rare?

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.960
 Yeah, not many animals use tools.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.240
 Let's think who uses tools.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.600
 Oh, Croz and Jack Doz have been tested and they definitely use them.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.360
 Is it a tool to use the ground?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.240
 I don't know, because there's a bird called Alamagaya which lifts up tortoises into the

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.040
 air and drops them onto the ground.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.040
 Oh yeah.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.040
 That's a riskless, isn't it?

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.680
 Yeah, onto a particular patch of rocky, stony ground.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.080
 So I don't know if that's using tools.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080
 Yeah, I would say so.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080
 Arguably.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080
 You said a name just then.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080
 That was the philosopher who died.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.200
 So did he genuinely die from a-

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.040
 Well, we don't know exactly how he died, but the only evidence that we have is that someone

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.000
 wrote that that's how he died.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.040
 Nobody, he did supposedly die that way, didn't he?

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.040
 Is that the only case in history of that having happened?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.040
 To my knowledge.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040
 So, yeah.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.200
 There was a different case of an asteroid killing a dog in Egypt in 1912, but that's completely

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200
 different.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.880
 The only link is something falling on someone's face.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.000
 There were always rumors that you could die from effluent flushed out of airplanes.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 That's not true, is it?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Frozen effluent.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 It's not true.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.080
 No, it can't happen in case anyone was scared.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.440
 Well, what happens is that people who live under flight paths will sometimes find blocks

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.920
 of ice, and it's slightly miscolored, and they think it's going to be frozen urine.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.240
 But what it usually is, is the airplanes have been flying very high.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.320
 They get ice on the wings, and then when they come down the ice melts, and it falls.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.320
 Okay.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320
 Basically, yeah.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.200
 Does mate you wonder if you've got terrible food poisoning on a plane if they have to

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.760
 on a long haul flight, if they have to make an emergency landing halfway there to unload?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.760
 Do you see that thing where a hundred children had vomiting and diarrhea, sickness on a flight

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760
 the other day?

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760
 It wasn't a hundred.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.760
 Was it not?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.760
 No.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.560
 I think the choir was 60, but I think a lot of them did go down with it.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560
 It was all of them.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.640
 They dispatched about four ambulance teams in parallel, but imagine being on that flight.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640
 I know.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.400
 I'd probably conflate in it with another fact, which is there was a Baltimore food safety

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.800
 conference a couple of weeks ago, and a hundred people who went to that got food poisoning.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800
 Brilliant.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.800
 Wow.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.400
 So let's talk about otters.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400
 Otters.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400
 Shall we?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.400
 Hold hands.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.400
 So they know.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400
 They hold hands, yeah, so they don't float away.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400
 Well, they sleep.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.200
 Yeah, let's put that up on the website, because everyone loves that video, don't they?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200
 That's really cute.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.400
 Not so cute is that they peel the skin off poisonous toads in one piece before eating

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.800
 the flesh so they don't get poisoned from the skin.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.480
 But that is as a party trick.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.800
 It's like I can peel an orange with one hand.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.600
 Here's a thing.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.520
 If you get an orange and put it in a bowl of water, it'll float.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.840
 If you peel it and put it in a bowl of water, it'll sink.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840
 Wow.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840
 What baby otters can't dive?

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.000
 They're too buoyant.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Really?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Yeah.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.200
 That's a thing that comes with age that they can suddenly dive.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.520
 There's been a bit of anti-otter propaganda on the internet recently.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520
 I was reading.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520
 What's that meant?

00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:00.520
 There was a magazine article on an online magazine called Vox, and it was entitled The

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.520
 Case Against Otters, Necrophiliac serial killing fur monsters of the sea.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.960
 It was written by a guy called Dylan Matthews, and he said that otters are jerks.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.200
 He's missed the chance of calling them rotters.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.880
 They kill baby otters.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:22.280
 They have attacked people, monkeys, and alligators, and they sometimes copulate with dead otters.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.280
 Attacked alligators?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280
 How did that go for them?

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.280
 That's very cool.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.160
 OK, this is very interesting if he says that, because the ancient Greeks had a theory

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.240
 or a belief that otters killed crocodiles by scampering into their mouths and then eating

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.640
 all of their entrails and then running out again when the crocodile was dead.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.640
 Isn't that great?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.880
 That's a brilliant idea, but it's definitely not true.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.880
 Yeah.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.640
 I was reading about Wombats, and Wombats have a pouch, so similar to a kangaroo.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.640
 OK.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.480
 But Wombats dig through the ground, and so their pouches are upside down.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480
 What?

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.480
 They don't get any of the stuff into their pouches.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.480
 Will the baby just fall out?

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.680
 No, because unlike a kangaroo, they're not vertical.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.120
 The one Wombat fact I remember is that they have cubic feces.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.920
 They do have cubic feces.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.440
 They also have incredible butts.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.520
 Like their asses are insanely hard.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.240
 No, no, they're very interesting though, they're very interesting because if they're chased

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.400
 by a predator, they run into their burrow, their hole, but they purposefully leave their

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.640
 butt out, and nothing can penetrate it.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.160
 Yeah, Chris Clement, who's a biologist from Australia, came on the museum of curiosity last

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.080
 year, and I'm sure he mentioned this.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.080
 He did.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080
 This is where I first have it.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.080
 They have a reinforced rump.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.240
 When a predator attacks a Wombat, it runs into its burrow and uses its tough cartilage

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.120
 filled bum to block the hole.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.440
 I've also found that apparently the further is very coarse and white, so it would feel

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.280
 like bristles to eat, which must be pleasant for a predator.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.280
 So try and buy it.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.280
 Yeah.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280
 I take it all back.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.280
 Yeah, super butts.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.280
 Yeah.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.520
 Just speaking of butts, I read that turtles breathe through those butts.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.000
 Not all turtles, but a lot.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Yeah, some of them do.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Did they urinate through their mouth?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 They do.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.760
 The whole system has gone haywire there.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.160
 Are you sure you just weren't holding the turtle the wrong way around?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.240
 Animals collecting stuff, um, power birds.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.000
 You guys have many with power birds.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.880
 Power birds build these amazing structures, like these homes for their, um, potential mate,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.360
 and then they collect shiny objects or like nice looking objects, and they adorn it,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.360
 and it's amazing.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.840
 So you see them trying to seduce ladies, and they'll bring them like anything they can

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840
 find.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.760
 There's one, I think there's a video of one, keeps bringing this lady like a shiny stone

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.160
 or a bit of sandwich or a bit of cloth, and the lady keeps rejecting them.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.000
 And then eventually he brings her a ring, and she goes, "Oh yeah, right, then.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Go for it.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.240
 Yeah, I'll put that on the website."

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.760
 That sounds very familiar.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760
 Yeah.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:02.000
 The number of times when I was carting my wife, bringing her a little bit of sandwich.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.760
 Okay, and now it's time for a final fact of the show, and that's your fact, James.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.280
 Yep, my fact is very simple this week.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.880
 Nops have been made illegal in Vancouver.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:23.600
 Just going for the cheap laugh, and illegal is the slight stretch.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:30.120
 It's, when you make a new house in Vancouver now, it's illegal to put a dawn up on rather

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.880
 than a dawn handle, and that's to make it more accessible.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.760
 Which I think is quite interesting, like, is it going to be the first place, is it going

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.760
 to be the rest of the world?

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.680
 Are we going to be losing the dawn ups?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.200
 No one will know what a dawn up is in 500 years.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200
 Yeah.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.560
 So that's weird of how recent dawn ups are, I mean, Victoria and Abraham Lincoln, who

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.320
 would not have known what a dawn up was.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320
 Really?

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.840
 Yeah, dawn ups only came in in the late 1800s.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.240
 Oh, the latches weren't there, things like that.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.040
 So if this works in Vancouver, it could be that there was only a 150-year period in the

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.880
 whole of history where people had dawn up.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.800
 Yeah, we think we were lucky enough to live in that area.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800
 And blessed.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.720
 That's your theory about landlines, isn't it, James?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720
 Yeah.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.080
 The idea of having a telephone in your house was it didn't happen until the mid-20

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.520
 century, then hardly anyone had it until the 70s and 80s.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.480
 And then everyone had it for a few decades.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.400
 And now everyone just has mobile phones, no one has landlines.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.280
 And so in 100 years, they'll look back at only a 20-year period where everyone had phone

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.280
 lines.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.280
 And it's going to look really weird.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280
 Yeah.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.840
 And they're still going to ask in 200 years, why are they still putting this on surface?

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.360
 Please insert your landline.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.040
 Stop putting that there.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.880
 So that's, I mean, that's a really good point.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.400
 More knobs are effectively going to be a blip.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.280
 It's a bit like, so that legislation reminds me of, it's like Shabbat elevators, isn't it?

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.040
 And Israel now, all new builds have to have Shabbat elevators.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.520
 What is one of those?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.240
 Because under Jewish law, you're not allowed to operate electronics on the Sabbath.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.200
 They're lifts that go automatically.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.200
 They also have Shindler's lifts, which they can use as well.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.400
 That's one of the most three biggest lift managers.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400
 Yeah, really?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.400
 Shindler's lifts.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400
 Yeah.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400
 That is, I can't believe I didn't know that.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400
 That's amazing.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:18.280
 I read from the ignoble reporters that supposedly lift music, if you have a cold, it's a great cure

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.280
 for the common cold.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.280
 Lift music is a scientific report.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.480
 First of all, we don't have any cure for the common cold.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.200
 Second of all, lift music.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200
 Yeah.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.080
 I'm only reporting science guys, people, people who listened to lift music got better in

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080
 two weeks.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.280
 People who didn't took as long as 14 days, like also recovered.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.720
 On the hand, on the door knobs thing.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.440
 I found a quote from someone who was hostile to the idea, because the reason they did it

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.400
 was for the elderly and an aging population.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.240
 A lot of people have arthritis and the sort of the twisting action of turning one of the

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.240
 tools.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.440
 Yeah, 67 million adult Americans will have arthritis by 2030, according to one survey.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.440
 So that's very interesting.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.440
 And I found someone opposing it saying, "Bairs will be very appreciative of this change,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.000
 as an unlocked lever door is an invitation in the snack time, those round knobs are tricky

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.560
 with tools, which kind of compares people who suffer from arthritis to bears."

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.720
 I was reading this in the economist and one of the censuses they had was, "The rules have

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:21.760
 provoked grumbling about the nanny state, much of it from dawn of manufacturers."

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.080
 I found another guy who was objecting who was the president of the antique dawn knob collectors

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080
 of America.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.720
 But presumably he should be happy because more of them will be antiques.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720
 Yeah.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.360
 It's an election all the more valuable.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360
 Yeah.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.520
 Literally everything will be an antique.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.800
 I was looking at weird laws.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.680
 And it's quite hard to find weird laws that are actually laws rather than internet myths,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.680
 obviously.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.480
 But I do like the fact that in Denmark, it actually is a legal requirement to check under

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.240
 your car for sleeping people or for people before you start driving it.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240
 Really?

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.760
 And if you do run somebody over because they were sleeping under your car when you started,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.040
 then you're going to be in trouble for it with insurance.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040
 Wow.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.960
 I don't know if this is a common habit in Denmark, if people fall asleep on the cars all

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960
 the time.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960
 That's very interesting.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.480
 But it's a thing.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.200
 And the other thing is that there's actually a legal in Thailand to go out in public without

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200
 worrying underwear.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200
 That's a thing.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200
 Wow.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.080
 And I also like places where it's illegal to die, which it isn't in the houses of parliament,

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.280
 although a lot of people think that it is.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.120
 It's not illegal to die in the houses of parliament.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.120
 No.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.120
 Wow.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.200
 You are free to go there and do that.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200
 But it is.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.520
 You know, just if you want to.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520
 Yeah.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:35.200
 Is illegal to die in Longyear Bayon, which is in Norway, yeah, it's in Svalbard.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200
 Yes.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.320
 When you say it's illegal to die there, what are the ramifications for you?

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320
 I think it--

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320
 Once you've done the act.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.320
 I think ramifications for your family.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.320
 Oh, OK.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.840
 So it's a little bit like that aeroplane moment.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.080
 How much do you really care about the family who are going to be punished after your death?

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.400
 It's because they found out that bodies don't decompose there.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.880
 Corpus is a preserved by permafrost, which I think James might know more about this

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.880
 is just to do with their climate.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880
 Yes.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.880
 Really, really cold.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.880
 Yeah.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880
 Because it's about as far off as you can get.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.880
 Right.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.240
 So basically they're like cryogenically frozen, if you will.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.800
 Do you think Mount Everest is our permanent sort of the most likely spot that future civilizations

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.720
 will find people of our time?

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720
 Because they're frozen.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.960
 They're fully-- like when they found Mallory, this whole body was there.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.960
 Yeah.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.960
 Well, honestly.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.960
 Yeah.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.360
 The look does as well in a run, I think, maybe it gets so hot that things won't decompose

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.360
 there.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.360
 Maybe I might go up.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.360
 That's amazing, though.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.840
 Because you often think, obviously, in cold things won't decompose.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.920
 But of course, like microbes are going to not be able to live at a certain temperature,

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920
 certainly.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.880
 Well, I was reading a guide to what to do after civilization ends yesterday.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.840
 And it recommended plastic bottles to, you know, the phrase sunlight is the best disinfectant

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840
 talking about openness.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.520
 It turns out the sunlight also acts as a disinfectant by killing microbes.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.320
 So if you want to have cleaner drinking water, put it in plastic bottles.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.640
 Let the light shine quite fiercely on it and the light and all the heat.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640
 I'm not sure.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.640
 We'll kill when it grows.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.640
 Knowledge.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.640
 That's good, eh?

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.640
 That is good.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.640
 Why are you doing that?

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640
 We're having a rough day yesterday, Andy.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.040
 I'm just finishing my plans.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.680
 Speaking of survivals, if we don't have Donob's anymore, then there are some things that

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.880
 they've been useful for in the past that we won't have anymore.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:25.160
 So after the tsunami, the famous one in Southeast Asia, there was a guy called Rizal Shah-Putra,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.480
 and he got lost at sea, as many people did.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.800
 But he survived because he ate coconuts which he cracked open with a Donob, which was also

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800
 floating past.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.800
 So that was a really useful Donob.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800
 That's great.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800
 Oh, yes.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.320
 If only he had a little pouch in which it's still years or a lot, then he wouldn't know that

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.320
 at all.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320
 Yeah.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:49.520
 Between 1830 and 1873, over 100 US patents alone were for Donob's.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.520
 Oh.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.120
 The slight improvements on the Donob's, or...

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.280
 I guess they would be like the latch, they would be in the toilets when you do just that

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.080
 little turnover, little bar goes over, and I guess they count as Donob's, don't they?

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.040
 I think a knob has to be knob-shaped.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.040
 Yeah.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.640
 God, then that's going to be an exciting afternoon looking to what those payed into.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.840
 There are still a lot of innovations happening though.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:16.160
 I think they're working on ones in hospitals which dispense hand sanitizer as you go through.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.960
 Although presumably they wouldn't do that every time you open the door, otherwise you

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.000
 just have loads of hand sanitizer on the floor and a lot of people slipping and falling.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.920
 But I think they have developed a way of doing it.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.680
 So you can also give yourself a quick hit of hand sanitizer as you go through from one room

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680
 to another.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680
 Right.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680
 It's pretty cool.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.520
 At least when you're falling and bleeding and your wounds are on open, you've got a very

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.080
 sanitised surface to London.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080
 Yeah.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.080
 In the absence of Derbysol.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:49.960
 Okay, that's it.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.360
 That's all our facts for this week.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.760
