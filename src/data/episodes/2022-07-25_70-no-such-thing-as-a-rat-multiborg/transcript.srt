00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,320
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,960
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,380
 My name is Dan Schreiber sitting here with Anich Zinski, James Harkin and Andy Murray.

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,920
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,140
 last seven days and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andrew Hunter

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,140
 Murray.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,760
 My fact is that babies practice their first words before saying them out loud, which is

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
 very sweet.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
 I love that.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
 How do we know?

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,920
 Well, this is from a study at the University of Washington, where scientists scan babies

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,080
 brains and observe what happened when they were being spoken to, and bits of their brains

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,440
 light up, different parts of the brain light up.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,520
 And some of the bits were associated just with listening and taking in information and

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,440
 other bits are associated with actually planning the motor movements that you need to say

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
 words.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,440
 So even when they're listening, they're trying to figure out how to make that sound basically.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
 So that's what it is.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,200
 It's just that they're figuring out how to make sounds.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,640
 But don't they all finally reach the same word?

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
 Is it all Mama?

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
 No.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
 Is it all?

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
 No.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
 That was the first one.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
 George Orwell's first word was supposedly beastly.

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
 Yeah.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
 Really good.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
 Yeah.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
 That says more about his mother than about him.

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
 Yeah, that's true.

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
 He's sitting here at Animal Farm though.

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
 That is quite true.

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
 Yeah.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,520
 Dadda is the most common, 15% of babies, apparently, have dadda.

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:45,400
 Followed by daddy, 13% mama, 10% dad, 10% mummy, 8% mum, 7% cat, 2% dog, 1%.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,880
 I found a survey from 2014 where more than one and eight parents claimed their child's

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
 first word was tablet.

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
 Has any tablet computer?

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 Yeah.

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,320
 Although this was a technology firm who make device protection cases, who sponsored

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,640
 the research, and it also found that babies break tablets a lot.

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,600
 So they sponsored the research and by coincidence, that's the word that comes out of that.

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,960
 Babies, I think, might be a lot cleverer than we give them credit for.

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,080
 There was a study done where they tested whether 100-hour-old babies, so a bunch of babies

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,580
 who are only a few days old, could count, and they'd show them a series of images with

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,940
 a certain number of shapes on them.

48
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,620
 So they'd show them a bunch of circles, and one picture would have three circles in it,

49
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,300
 one picture would have four circles, one would have five circles, et cetera.

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,620
 And then at the same time, they would play them recordings with a certain number of bleeps

51
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,620
 on them.

52
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,620
 Right.

53
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,260
 And when they played a recording of, let's say, three bleeps, then the babies would look towards

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,540
 the picture with three circles on it, and it was like they were connecting, you know,

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,380
 they were counting the number of bleeps, and then it was using it with the vision.

56
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,380
 Isn't that incredible?

57
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,380
 Yeah.

58
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,380
 Yeah.

59
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
 They can count up to 27 iPads though.

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
 [laughter]

61
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,800
 I've heard a thing about swearing in children, and it took children from one to 12, and it just

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,600
 measured a host of different swear words, so how frequently they use them.

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,560
 And so for one and two-year-olds, the most frequent swear word that they use is poopy.

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,100
 Is this pre-curve you, because if so, I don't really know how to say that.

65
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,260
 That falls off very rapidly by the age of seven or eight, okay?

66
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,060
 Duck is big around for three and four-year-olds, then Tails Off has a huge dip in the graph.

67
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,140
 Do you know that newborn babies recognise the theme song from their mum's favourite soap opera?

68
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
 Do they?

69
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,620
 They tested this at an old study in 1988.

70
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,900
 Yeah, they tested it.

71
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,860
 They also tested them on made-up words, so they made up a word like, I don't know, T2 or something,

72
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,780
 and they played it to the more than 25,000 times while the mother was pregnant.

73
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
 Oh my god.

74
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
 Oh my god.

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,540
 And after birth, unsurprisingly, the baby recognised the word.

76
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,340
 And it's variations, and other babies didn't recognise it.

77
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,380
 Have you heard about the babies, the way babies grip, newborn babies, the strength of their grip?

78
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,740
 They can grip strongly enough to support their own weight.

79
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
 Wow.

80
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
 Yeah.

81
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,740
 And they think this is a hangover from...

82
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,740
 I was just going to say, from being a chimp and having to pull yourself up the hairs or something.

83
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:10,420
 So does that mean if you put your finger in a baby's hand and they grab hold of it, you could lift it up?

84
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,420
 Yeah.

85
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,900
 Do you know how I know that with such confidence?

86
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,460
 In 1991, back in the good old days, a research had dangled 60 newborns from a walking stick

87
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,700
 to see how long they could last.

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
 Wow.

89
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,700
 And the longest lasted two minutes, 35?

90
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
 All right.

91
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
 And the short has lasted 10 seconds.

92
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
 Oh wow.

93
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
 Two minutes, 35.

94
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
 Yeah.

95
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,700
 How long was this stick that he could get 16 infants dangling you?

96
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,700
 That is incredible.

97
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
 That is incredible.

98
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,700
 That is incredible.

99
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
 I think it was what I'm sadly, I think it was one of the times.

100
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
 Right.

101
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:54,900
 And another thing babies can do, which I think is quite exciting, is they seem to have an innate awareness of organs and how bodies work.

102
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,900
 So there was a study done where there were like moving toys given to a bunch of toddlers.

103
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,100
 And then they split the dolls in half and they showed them to the babies and they made it so the dolls were completely hollow on the inside.

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,900
 And the babies were really confused.

105
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:18,500
 So when they split a doll in half and there was nothing on the inside, the babies would like show obvious signs of bewilderment and like look inside properly as if to say where the hell are organs is alive.

106
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 I don't think that shows detail, not a clear announcement.

107
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,700
 I wouldn't trust them to do an operator.

108
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,300
 I'd still go for Dr. A.

109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,100
 The adult doctor, Dr. B, the baby in the code, yeah.

110
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:41,100
 If you know that babies can't taste salt until they're four months old, they can also taste with their cheeks, which we can't do.

111
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
 It's not cool.

112
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
 As if they could just hold the thing to their cheeks.

113
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
 That is delicious.

114
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
 It needs more puzzle.

115
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
 More salt.

116
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
 I mean, I don't know actually.

117
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,100
 It has to be the inside of their cheeks, sadly.

118
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
 But even so, quite cool.

119
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
 The taste buds all over their cheeks.

120
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
 They've got taste buds on their cheeks.

121
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
 That's very cool.

122
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
 That would be really fun.

123
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
 It's a weird idea of being able to taste with your cheeks.

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
 Let's do it.

125
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:11,100
 So I was reading a story in the British newspaper archive in the Daily Gazette for Middlesbrough in 1887.

126
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
 And a man has written this letter into the newspaper.

127
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,100
 This man got on a train in 1887.

128
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:26,100
 A man in his early 20s got on the train carriage with him and was holding a baby, even though the man looked very young to be engaged in such a manner.

129
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
 So, you know, early 20s, but young to have a baby.

130
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,100
 The baby started crying and the man pinched the baby quite hard.

131
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
 And it's not like crying a lot more.

132
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,100
 And so, a couple of women nearby said, "Oh, if you keep doing that, you shouldn't do that to a baby.

133
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
 If you keep doing that, we're going to cool security."

134
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,100
 And the young man said, "I'll do what I like."

135
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:50,100
 And taking the baby by its long robe began to swing it around and around so that its head came into contact with the doorframe after each revolution.

136
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
 And the shrieking became terrific.

137
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,100
 And then bang, the train stops, the man gets out, leaving on the seat a broken Yankee rubber baby.

138
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:06,100
 Which is a prank doll they used to have in the 1880s that apparently young men would take on the trains and would terrify the living shit out of everyone else.

139
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
 Wow. I think I mean the living poofy.

140
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,100
 There's no way there's something like it was going to be a really traumatic story.

141
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
 It was awful.

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
 And then it was just a doll, though, Andy.

143
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
 It's still awful, though.

144
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
 It's still traumatic.

145
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
 I haven't recovered from the awfulness.

146
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,100
 Which I guess is the whole point of the prank.

147
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,100
 What a good prank that it's still affecting people even if hearing about it.

148
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
 130 years later, I'm upset.

149
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
 You're upset.

150
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,100
 This man should be so happy, my god.

151
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
 He must be happy in his grave right now.

152
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
 I'm glad he's dead.

153
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,100
 Okay, time for fact number two.

154
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
 And that is Chazinski.

155
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,100
 My back, the first pair of Nike trainers were made in a waffle iron.

156
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
 Who's going to quibble with my pronunciation of Nike?

157
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
 Nobody.

158
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
 No man.

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
 Nobody.

160
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,100
 And I reckon you're asking for a reason, right?

161
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,100
 I mean, technically, I guess we should say kneecare because that's how you pronounce it in ancient Greek.

162
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
 Well, that's how you pronounce the ancient Greek.

163
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
 I always say Nike.

164
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
 No, we have got some very exciting news.

165
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,100
 Two people wrote to the founder, the co-founder of Nike, to ask.

166
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,100
 And he wrote back to them.

167
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
 It's Nike.

168
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
 They wrote to Philip Knight.

169
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
 He's the chairman.

170
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,100
 And I believe he's the co-founder.

171
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
 He should change his name.

172
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
 Philip Knight.

173
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,100
 To Knight.

174
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
 To Knight.

175
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,100
 Yeah.

176
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,100
 Or he should change it to Knightie.

177
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,100
 But they sent him, and they wrote the phonetic pronunciation of both.

178
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
 Right.

179
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
 He just, all he did was just circle and send it back to them.

180
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,100
 And he circled Knight hyphen key as in a key opening a door.

181
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
 Yeah.

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
 So it's Nike.

183
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,100
 It was named, Nike was named by the first ever Nike employee who was called Jeff Johnson.

184
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,100
 But it means victory in Greek, which you were pronounced in ancient Greek kneecare.

185
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
 Oh, right.

186
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,100
 So, I mean, maybe they're wrong about the pronunciation of their own brand.

187
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,100
 But Nike was the goddess or kneecare, was the goddess of victory.

188
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
 Yeah.

189
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,100
 But I read that the thing she did was to fly around the battlefield, lifting people up and bestowing on us on them and things like that.

190
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
 So she wouldn't ever have needed shoes.

191
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
 Ah!

192
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
 No way.

193
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
 Sorry.

194
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
 Waffle line.

195
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
 Yeah, sorry.

196
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,100
 So we should go back to the, so the first row of Nike trainers were made by Bill Bowman, who was the Nike co-founder.

197
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
 And he'd worked for this company making shoes for a few years.

198
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:25,100
 But in 1971, they released the first line of like completely Nike trainers with the Nike label on them.

199
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
 And the way he designed them was, so they had a special way of gripping the ground.

200
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,100
 He wanted to design like a better pair of running shoes, revolutionized running shoes that could work on a whole bunch of surfaces and design them with better grip.

201
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,100
 But not with like spikes, like football spikes, which would dig into the ground.

202
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,100
 And he was discussing this conundrum, like how to develop trainers with good grip with his wife over breakfast.

203
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,100
 And she got some waffles out of the oven.

204
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,100
 And she was brainstorming at the time and saying, "Why didn't you try attaching some bits of my jewelry or something to the bottom of shoes and seeing if that works?"

205
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
 So something like that.

206
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,100
 He was like, "Yeah, you know that waffle you're holding? What if we turn that upside down and put it on the bottom of a trainer?"

207
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:08,100
 And then he disappeared, went back to his lab, got two cans of like this liquid plastic that you used to make trainers.

208
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:17,100
 Came back, seized the waffle iron off his wife, poured the liquid plastic into the waffle iron, and there was born the first soul of Nike trainers, which is that waffle soul.

209
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,100
 So, I think this resurfaced recently because they found the waffle iron.

210
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
 Yeah, they did.

211
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:30,100
 And I read that when they found this old waffle iron, which had just been in a rubbish tip at the back of the Founders Guard of Aged As Nages.

212
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
 Do you know why it was in a rubbish tip?

213
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,100
 No.

214
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:43,100
 So it wasn't even in a rubbish tip, it was buried because Bill Bauman in the place that he lived in America, it was like up a hill or something, and it was too far for rubbish drivers to come.

215
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,100
 And so he just buried it all in the garden, and his granddaughter or daughter, I think it was a daughter, wasn't it?

216
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
 It was just like found this a few years ago.

217
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
 It was like, there's this huge pile of stuff buried in our garden, just rubbish.

218
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,100
 He didn't live on the hill at first, he just kept on burying all of this whole sort of waste and eventually he did.

219
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,100
 But when they discovered this thing, I read this line, it truly is the headwaters of our innovation.

220
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:15,100
 Nike Historians Scott Reem said, from a Historians standpoint, it's like finding the Titanic, which it's not.

221
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,100
 And also, historians do kind of like the Titanic as well, don't they?

222
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
 Yeah, it's not the same thing.

223
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,100
 It's not like the history equivalent of finding the Titanic, because the Titanic is the history equivalent of the Titanic.

224
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,100
 But Nike has a historian. Yeah, that makes sense.

225
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,100
 It must be a really easy job up until the mid-20th century.

226
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,100
 1875, still nothing.

227
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,100
 I don't know, like 400 BC, goddess of victory.

228
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,100
 1912, Titanic sinks. Don't really give a shit about that.

229
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,100
 From a historian's point of view, this would be like finding the first ever Nike shoe.

230
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,100
 The waffle line that was used to make this first pair of trainers had been in use in the Barberman family since 1936.

231
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
 It was quite impressive.

232
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
 They must have pissed off when he broke it.

233
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
 Yeah, it's so casual, just ruining it.

234
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
 Yeah, he broke it.

235
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,100
 He broke it. It was not usable after that.

236
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,100
 Yeah, I think it tasted of like hot plastic.

237
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
 Do you know where waffles come from?

238
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:23,100
 They're actually derived from religious wafers, used for communion, as well as just to make food.

239
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:30,100
 But you used to have wafer ions, which in French were called mule aublie, and they had biblical scenes on them.

240
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
 That was the first waffle design.

241
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,100
 And communion wafers normally had a picture of Jesus and its crucifixion on them, because they were for holy use.

242
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,100
 Interesting thing about communion wafers is Catholics at least do this.

243
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
 You would go up and they would put the wafer directly into your mouth.

244
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,100
 And the reason that they did that is to stop people from stealing them, because people used to get them in their hands,

245
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,100
 pretend to put them in their mouths, and then take them home.

246
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,100
 And they would do like magic incantations with them, or sprinkle them on the crops to make them grow better.

247
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,100
 Or poor golden syrup and bacon over them, enjoy Canadian breakfasts.

248
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:13,100
 Well, speaking of untrustworthiness, which I guess that speaks to, waifers, which are people who sold waffles or waifers in the 16th, 17th century,

249
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
 were apparently notoriously untrustworthy.

250
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:23,100
 So they were described in the literature at the time as designing persons, thieves, et cetera, who took up wafering as a cloak for dishonest practices.

251
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:30,100
 And they appear in various literature in the 15th, 16th centuries, like Chaucer, as typically bad people.

252
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,100
 And they had to be abolished in 1826, the practice of being a waferer, because they were so untrustworthy.

253
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:46,100
 Also, I like this quote, I can't remember where I read this, in some history magazine, but it was Charles IX, who enacted the first ever waffle legislation in 1560.

254
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:56,100
 So as well as being untrustworthy, I think they were quite violent waferers, or ublies, as you said, they were called in France, and they kept on getting into fights with each other when they were selling too close to one another.

255
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:05,100
 So the first waffle legislation was to say exactly how much space they had to be between two wafer sellers, because otherwise they couldn't be trusted, not to beat the crap out of each other.

256
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:13,100
 So they had a picture of the crucifixion on them, and it was Jesus saying, "You have to be this far apart, guys. No fighting."

257
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:24,100
 You were saying about how waffle guys were untrustworthy. Well, these days they are quite trustworthy. The waffle house in America, they are famous for staying open, no matter what.

258
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,100
 If there's a disaster, they'll stay open, and they pride themselves on who always be able to go there and get a waffle if there's a problem.

259
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:41,100
 So that means that the federal emergency management agency, if ever they see that a waffle house is closed, they know that that's the kind of place they need to go and give aid to, because that must be the worst.

260
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,100
 If the waffle house is closed, then it must be pretty good. That's how they do it. That's amazing.

261
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
 So when disaster strikes, they still...

262
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:56,100
 When disaster strikes, if there's loads of different counties that are obviously all kind of in trouble, if the waffle house is closed in one of them, they'll go...

263
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,100
 Wow. It's quite a good tip, though, actually, if you own a waffle house in a disaster strike area to close it, and that's going to bring help.

264
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,100
 Yeah. Well, if you're the mayor of a disaster strike area, blow up the waffle house.

265
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
 Yes. Yeah.

266
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
 Also a good tip.

267
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:23,100
 There are 60,000 Nike's, which fell off a ship, and they are followed by meteorologists and oceanographers to see the currents of the oceans.

268
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
 Wow. In the same way that those rubber ducks were at that time.

269
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
 Do they say things like we've been running some experiments?

270
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
 No.

271
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,100
 I would have thought they would say that all the time.

272
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
 Sean, I would love it if you went into that office.

273
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
 You said that, and it was the first time they heard it.

274
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
 And you were the hero of the office.

275
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
 Andy's amazing.

276
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,100
 Hi, I'm here for my training. Are there any traders about?

277
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,100
 I don't want a waffle on it. It's too far. It's too far. They won't get that one.

278
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,100
 In the corner, the Nike historians pissing himself.

279
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:09,100
 These shoes that fell off the ship, they're still wearable. If you find them on a beach, you can still wear them.

280
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:17,100
 Which means that people collect them, and they have impromptu swap meats, where people who have two lefts, like swap one for a bite.

281
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,100
 If they had two different sizes, they tried swap them. That's amazing.

282
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
 That is really incredible.

283
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,100
 There's a charity called Because International, which has developed a shoe that grows with your foot.

284
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,100
 So that because it's one major problem in developing countries, is that people can't afford shoes.

285
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
 And so they're bare for all the time they grow out of their shoes.

286
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,100
 And it can grow up to seven sizes, I think. So it grows by sort of curving out with as your foot grows.

287
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,100
 So as a kid, you can have it when you're, you know, four, and still have it when you're two.

288
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:51,100
 That is cool. So there's a theory that shoes emerged 40,000 years ago, which is way earlier than our original estimate.

289
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
 We thought that we'd had them for maybe five or 10,000 years.

290
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,100
 But there's a scientist from Washington University called Eric Trinkus.

291
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,100
 And he found the time in history where toe bones began to get smaller.

292
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:08,100
 Because for most of our history, we've had really, really big toe bones, because we were doing lots of walking and climbing and carrying things around.

293
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,100
 But then 40,000 years ago, we kept our big leg bones. They stayed the same size, but our toe bones started to fall.

294
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
 So we all used to have like big clown feet.

295
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,100
 Yes, let's say that.

296
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,100
 And he was trying to look at what would remove stress on toes, but not on legs.

297
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
 And he says, that's shoes.

298
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
 But they couldn't just make bigger shoes.

299
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 Yeah, toe bones in.

300
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
 I'm not sure how much our toes shrink.

301
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,100
 In my imagination, they shrunk quite a lot.

302
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
 It's conundrum. What are we going to do?

303
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,100
 Our feet won't fit into these tiny shoes. We keep baking.

304
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,100
 I guess we'll just have to wait for our feet to evolve into smaller feet.

305
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,100
 Okay, time for fact number three. And that is my fact.

306
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
 My fact is rats dream of places they want to visit.

307
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,100
 Well, like the Taj Mahalar.

308
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
 Yeah.

309
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,100
 Maybe if they'd, if they'd sit basically whenever a rat gets shown something while they're conscious, they found this in mazes.

310
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
 And they'd see somewhere that they couldn't go to.

311
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
 Then when they went for a nap, rats have naps.

312
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,100
 They would, scientists found that they were dreaming about what it'd be like to actually get into that place

313
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
 and then get the thing that they think might be in there.

314
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,100
 So they start dreaming about all these unattained places that they'd like to visit.

315
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,100
 Because either they've seen a bit of cheese in it or yeah.

316
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,100
 And we know that because they look inside their brains which neurons are firing when they go around the maze, when they're awake, don't they?

317
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
 And then when they fall asleep, you look at the same neurons are firing.

318
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
 So they're obviously reliving going around the maze.

319
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:48,100
 And it's really sad that we've decided that means the only place a rat wants to visit above and beyond anything else is the bit of food in the maze that we planted there in the experiment they did yesterday.

320
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
 The interesting thing here is that we can tell what rats are dreaming about.

321
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:58,100
 It's extraordinary, isn't it, from why I've read and I do find it very hard to break through scientific chargents sometimes.

322
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,100
 But it sounds like, as Anna was saying, they look at these neurons that are firing off and they can see that they're making similar connections.

323
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:11,100
 I think there was a tiny thing about their actual physical movements of their body as well, kind of suggesting I'm going left.

324
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
 Right. I think I might be wrong about that.

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,100
 80% of dreams are about normal things like doing the washing up, pubbing at work.

326
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,100
 Yeah, that makes sense. 100% of mine.

327
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,100
 But then again, 5.2% of men have kissed a monster in their dreams.

328
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,100
 3.4% have had four play with an animal.

329
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,100
 And 1.7% have had sex with an object.

330
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
 Plant a rock.

331
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,100
 That's an object.

332
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,100
 Because plants and rocks are objects.

333
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,100
 If you kiss the monster, do you think a monster as in like a mermaid or a...

334
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
 Is a mermaid a monster?

335
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,100
 I think it'd be classified as a monster, yes.

336
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,100
 A monster truck would come under objects.

337
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,100
 What about some monster munch? Objects.

338
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,100
 There's actually a term for people who study dreams in science and it's ownerology.

339
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,100
 And it's not what the interpretation is. It's why we dream.

340
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,100
 And so it's not, you know, of your teeth fall out, you're stressed, that kind of stuff.

341
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,100
 It's a book by Richard Wiseman called Night School, which has a lot of stuff about dreaming.

342
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,100
 It says the guy who came up with the term rapid eye movement.

343
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,100
 I think his name was Acerinsky or Acerinsky.

344
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
 He nearly called it jerky eye movement.

345
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
 Oh yeah.

346
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
 Which is quite a nice thing.

347
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,100
 But then it had negative connotations to the word jerk.

348
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,100
 Because a lot of three and four year old people used to like each other off.

349
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
 Yeah.

350
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
 Yeah, but it could have been called that.

351
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
 So humans get erections in dreams.

352
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,100
 Male ones, that is male humans.

353
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,100
 And it's during REM sleep, which is usually where dreams happen.

354
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,100
 A lot of other animals, rats as well, they get them, get erections during REM sleep.

355
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,100
 But apparently the armadillo is the only animal to get erections in non REM sleep.

356
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
 Wow.

357
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
 Wow.

358
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
 What?

359
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
 It's just a fact.

360
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
 That is so weird.

361
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
 That's a great fact.

362
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
 Yeah.

363
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
 Is it embarrassing for a rat when it gets an erection, do you think?

364
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
 It's never wearing a jacket, so come and cover it up.

365
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,100
 I always wonder why you always came into work in a jacket.

366
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,100
 I'll be summer here in Tandy as you've got this long trench coat on.

367
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:27,100
 I've got another jacket under this one.

368
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,100
 You know, rats feel regret after they make a poor choice in life.

369
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 Food, though.

370
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
 Yeah.

371
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,100
 They didn't experiment, but they gave them the chance to eat food now after waiting for a bit.

372
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
 Or just move on to the next thing.

373
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,100
 And if they chose to move on, then the next food offering was worse.

374
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
 Oh.

375
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
 And they paused and they looked at the good reward that they now couldn't have.

376
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
 And then later on they changed their decision when they were run through it again.

377
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
 So they think that is them showing regret.

378
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,100
 And they didn't do it when they encountered bad food without having chosen accidentally the bad food.

379
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
 We do seem to anthropomorphize rats a lot.

380
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
 Or science does at the moment.

381
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,100
 Like there are a lot of studies that come out saying, yeah, rats feel regret.

382
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,100
 There's one that claims rats feel empathy, which is also very plausible.

383
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
 So this study got two rats to live together for two weeks or something.

384
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
 So they bonded, learn to be mates.

385
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,100
 And then researchers locked one of them in a cage, which could only be opened by the other rat from the outside.

386
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:25,100
 And they found that the other rat would always open the cage even when there was no apparent benefit for the other rat.

387
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100
 So even if opening the cage released the rat into a separate room.

388
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,100
 So there wasn't even the social advantage of having that rat hang out with you now.

389
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
 The rat would still go and open the cage.

390
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,100
 I think they even put food in there and the rat would open the cage before it went and ate the food.

391
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
 Because they wanted to free it's meat.

392
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
 There's no one to free the meat.

393
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
 Apparently, that's what we've decided.

394
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
 Oh, that's nice.

395
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
 Isn't it?

396
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
 That's good.

397
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
 They also, they piss on food that they want to mark as edible.

398
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
 Nothing wrong with that.

399
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,100
 Have you seen the fridge recently in the office?

400
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,100
 I think they're marking it as formally edible already.

401
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,100
 They've got some cake at my last birthday, don't you?

402
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,100
 Everyone complained, but it was edible cake.

403
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
 Very moist, this cake.

404
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
 Is it, I'm...

405
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
 It's urinal cake.

406
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:16,100
 Is it irony that in the act of signposting something that's edible, you make it no longer edible?

407
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
 Like, is that, that's like a catch-22, isn't it?

408
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
 Yeah.

409
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,100
 No one came to my following birthday.

410
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:30,100
 So, on rat sprains, they've, we've managed to get rats to communicate with each other mentally across ocean.

411
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:38,100
 So, scientists, again, experimenting on rats willy-nilly to their hearts content, but they've connected the brains of a pair of rats.

412
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
 And so, one rat can be in the US, one rat can be in Britain.

413
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,100
 And they've connected their brains up so they can share sensory information with each other.

414
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:52,100
 And they've trained the rats so that if they press a lever in a certain box that they're in, then they'll get some food.

415
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,100
 But they've trained them to communicate mentally with each other.

416
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:02,100
 So, they'll, so let's say there's the rat in the US has got a lever, but the rat in the UK has not got a lever.

417
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:08,100
 And the rat in the UK will send a sensory signal to the rat in the US, saying, "Press that lever now and we'll both get a food."

418
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:14,100
 And then the rat in the US presses the lever, based on signals it's receiving in its brain from the rat in the UK.

419
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
 And then they both get the food reward.

420
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
 Isn't that insane?

421
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,100
 And the scientists who did this, one of the scientists said, "Approved nothing."

422
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:28,100
 This was written up on a new scientist or something, and the scientist in charge said, "I don't think there's any risk of super smart rats from this.

423
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
 I'm not worried about an imminent invasion of rat multiborgs."

424
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
 No, there was I until that.

425
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,100
 But rat multiborgs.

426
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
 He's coined a word, he's worried.

427
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:47,100
 Okay, time for our final back to the show, and that is James.

428
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:56,100
 Okay, my fact this week is that humans used milk as paint for 40,000 years before anyone thought to drink it.

429
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,100
 It's amazing.

430
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:08,100
 Yeah, so very basically, the first use of milk-based paints is about 49,000 years ago.

431
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:16,100
 And the first use of milk as a drink, as in the first time humans could even digest cow's milk, was around 7 or 8,000 years ago.

432
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
 That is so weird.

433
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:29,100
 I like the idea that 40,000 years from now, somebody will be doing a podcast saying, "Did you know that humans used to use paint as paint for thousands of years before they worked out we could drink it?"

434
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
 That's true.

435
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,100
 It's very optimistic for the medium of podcast as well.

436
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
 It's a young medium.

437
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,100
 There is a woman who paints a milk at the moment, she's called Millie Brown.

438
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,100
 She drinks coloured milk, and then she regurgitates it onto canvas.

439
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:50,100
 I read an article about her, and it said, and I quote, "She has mastered the art of regurgitation."

440
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
 The art of regurgitation.

441
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,100
 All babies also are sort of novices in the art of regurgitation, but she has got it done.

442
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,100
 There are a few artists who use bodily fluids for painting.

443
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:12,100
 So one is Rose Lynn Fisher, who made a series of landscapes using 100 different varieties of tear.

444
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:21,100
 Yeah, so I think the way she sees it is you could have a really, really upset tear, or you could have a cutting onions tear, or 98 other types of tear.

445
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
 That's why you fall down, isn't it?

446
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,100
 That's the only two examples she ever has to use before someone interrupts and goes, "Oh, we're getting the idea."

447
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,100
 Do you think, "Few, because I did not have a third?"

448
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
 Well, there are loads.

449
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,100
 Okay, we don't need to go through the various different ways of which we cry, Andy.

450
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:45,100
 When Anna says her full things like that, no one eats his urine cake.

451
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,100
 Here's something.

452
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,100
 Before World War II, skimmed milk was just thrown away.

453
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,100
 It was just discarded. Nobody drank skimmed milk.

454
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:04,100
 It was discarded. It was fed to pigs, because you cream off the top stuff, and so much of it was just poured into rivers.

455
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:11,100
 It was only sold when marketers realised, because a lot of it's creamed off to make butter at the top bit, and loads of it was just chucked away.

456
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:17,100
 And then marketers realised, a, that people were getting really annoyed, saying this dream is full of discarded milk.

457
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,100
 And secondly, they realised it could be marketed as a weight loss device.

458
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
 Wow, that's really interesting.

459
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,100
 Another thing that they did during the war with milk was make plastic out of it.

460
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:40,100
 You couldn't, the case scene, case scene, is a protein which you get in milk, and that can be somehow, by adding acid, can be turned into a very brittle but still usable plastic.

461
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
 And apparently they used it even for aeroplanes.

462
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
 I read it was to glue them together.

463
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
 Oh, was it?

464
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
 Yeah.

465
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
 Oh my god, I don't trust that.

466
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
 Really?

467
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
 The wings are glued on with milk.

468
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
 Yeah, basically.

469
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
 The wings are glued on at all.

470
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,100
 I am definitely not going to get a plane. You've made a model plane haven't you? Just think bigger.

471
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,100
 St. Cuthbert chopped his own leg off in remorse after speaking angrily to his parents.

472
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,100
 And it was then repaired with a cast made of milk.

473
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
 Oh.

474
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
 St. Cuthbert.

475
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
 I just want to say this.

476
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,100
 There is a really fantastic book called Milk, a local and global history by Deborah Valenze, which is where I got lots of my stuff from.

477
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,100
 Oh no.

478
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
 It's really good.

479
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:24,100
 If you like milk, it's an actually river or in drinks. Do you know what animal exclusively drinks milk?

480
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
 Ooh.

481
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
 The only thing they have a drink?

482
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
 Yeah, dolphins.

483
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
 Yes.

484
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
 No, yes.

485
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
 Because they don't drink when they're adults.

486
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
 They don't drink.

487
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
 The only thing they drink is their mother's milk.

488
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,100
 So they all they've ever known is the sweet taste of milk.

489
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,100
 I was reading something about dolphins today.

490
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,100
 It was someone's done some research on dolphin vaginas.

491
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
 And to see some pervert.

492
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:54,100
 It's hastily come up with a reason why they're in the lab with squeaky.

493
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
 Squeaky.

494
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,100
 He certainly was after that experiment.

495
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:09,100
 Anyway, part of that article, one of the things they said is that if a female dolphin doesn't want to have sex,

496
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:18,100
 then one of the ways that she does it is by putting her vagina out of the water so that the male can't get that.

497
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,100
 Presumably, some people have gone dolphin watching.

498
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,100
 If it spotted a lot of females poking the vaginas out of the water.

499
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,100
 It's not exactly jars with no symptoms.

500
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,100
 It's not exactly flipper either.

501
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,100
 I think it's the same person who did the famous work on duck vaginas.

502
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,100
 Duck penis is how they don't kind of fit together.

503
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,100
 You got just sort of a giant scientist.

504
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,100
 Dolphin milk is almost 50% fat.

505
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
 And cow's milk is 4% by word of comparison.

506
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
 So it is really, really thick.

507
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
 And we've said I think before, it's like toothpaste.

508
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
 It's so thick.

509
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:04,100
 So it's really hard for baby dolphins to drink while they are in fluid themselves.

510
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
 They can roll their tongues up so they're like straws.

511
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,100
 And their tongues form this watertight seal, which keeps the milk in and keeps salt water out.

512
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
 So they don't drink any of the salt water.

513
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,100
 So it has to be fluid transfer within another liquid.

514
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
 It's very, very difficult.

515
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
 Right.

516
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,100
 Another milk that used to be very popular is ass milk in the 18th century.

517
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
 Donkey milk, you mean?

518
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,100
 Yeah.

519
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
 Yeah, I'm just joking.

520
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
 What are your lines for that?

521
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
 That's rude.

522
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,100
 Call it poopy milk, please.

523
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:40,100
 Ass milk was so popular in the 18th century that there was even a Mrs. Dawkins of Bolserver Street

524
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,100
 who was the ass milk provider for the...

525
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,100
 I'm just wondering if I could change the job title.

526
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,100
 Just a donkey milk, actually.

527
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,100
 We've had the name label printed, so...

528
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,100
 She was the ass milk salesperson to the royal family.

529
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,100
 Well, was it expensive, was it?

530
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,100
 It was expensive. It was used as like a cure all for anything that was wrong with you.

531
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
 You would take ass milk.

532
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,100
 It was even used as a face wash and to shine shoes.

533
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
 So it was used for everything.

534
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
 Yeah.

535
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
 That's amazing.

536
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,100
 Was it expensive because Donkey's a fewer than cows?

537
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,100
 That is true, and also they produce a lot less milk.

538
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:32,100
 So in ancient Greek times, one remedy for women who had trouble conceiving was to pour milk into their vagina.

539
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
 Oh, yeah, did it work?

540
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
 I don't think so.

541
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
 No.

542
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
 What was the logic behind that?

543
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
 Did they have logic back then?

544
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
 Did anyone ask for logic back then?

545
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
 They just said that.

546
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,100
 Well, they supposedly invented logic, didn't they?

547
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
 The ancient Greeks, but...

548
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
 It sounds like they had to, because eventually...

549
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
 A question started being asked.

550
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
 Sorry.

551
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
 Why are we putting the milk in my vagina?

552
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,100
 What do you mean why?

553
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,100
 So you guys could try producing milk, and I would like one of you to do this.

554
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
 Okay.

555
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,100
 So you obviously have the glands which allow you to produce milk,

556
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,100
 but you just don't have enough prolactin, but apparently if men massage their nipples,

557
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,100
 you can stimulate, you can get a spike of prolactin, which means that you're able to produce milk from your nipples.

558
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
 How long do you have to massage for?

559
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
 I'll just try it and tell me.

560
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
 Oh, okay.

561
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
 I know, because I don't know.

562
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,100
 I've been unwittingly preparing for the experiment for years.

563
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,100
 So I've got the holes in my raincoat.

564
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:34,100
 Okay, that's it.

565
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
 That's all of our facts.

566
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
 Thank you so much for listening.

582
