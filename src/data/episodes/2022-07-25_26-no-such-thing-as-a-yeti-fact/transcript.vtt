00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'm sitting here with three of the regular elves.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 It's James Harkin, Andy Murray, and on fact checking duties today.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 It's Anichezinski, and we got a special guest joining us today.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 He's my favorite comedy writer. We're very excited.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Simon Rich from New York, here on a book tour.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Hello. Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 This is super fun. Yeah, thanks for coming.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 So you're here, you've only here until tomorrow, unfortunately.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Sure trip, yeah. Yeah.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 So Spoil Bratz, new book, collection of short stories.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 One of which is being adapted into a movie by Seth Rogan.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Your previous book, The Last Girl from No North,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 being turned into a sitcom currently coming out next year.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Used to work for Pixar, Saturday Night Live, and you're under 30.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 How the fuck did you do this?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Well, the books are really short.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 The books I write. They're almost more like pamphlets.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Also, the font is really large.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 The margins are wide.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Sometimes they'll just, like in between chapters,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 they'll just be a few unnecessarily blank pages.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Just to kind of pat it out. So that's the biggest trick.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Cool. Okay. Well, let's kick into our show.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 So we're going to go back number one.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 We're going to start with you. Simon.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Cool. So my fact is about Coco, the gorilla who knows sign language.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 And according to my research,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 over the course of her lifetime, she has owned and cared for three pet cats.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Yeah. So, and how did she get these cats?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It's a good question.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I know that she actually, because she speaks sign language,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 knows a thousand words and sign languages.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 And apparently they asked her, what would you like for Christmas?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And she said, I would like a pet cat.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 It's a good thing she doesn't know, Flamethrower.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Or the word for freedom.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Right, or a freedom pet.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 A thousand words, isn't that many, though, is it?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Is it not?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 I don't love the thousand words.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 I know more than that is just numbers.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 But if you take the thousand words you use most often,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 they probably cover almost everything.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 And then it's specific ones after that, like hammer, cool thrombosis or whatever.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 So, you know, maybe they're in your top thousand, I don't know.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 It would be lovely to see the thousand words you use most often.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Yes. It would be really cool.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 I have that list in Russian, actually.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 What, that you use?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 No, I got that, I was trying to learn Russian and I still am, but not very well.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 And I thought one way to do it would be to get the thousand most popular spoken words in Russian.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And then try and learn them all.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Well, that's how Dr. Seuss wrote "Cat in the Hat."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Oh, really?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Yeah, he got a book that was a list of, I think, the first 100 words that children learn how to read.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And he almost as an exercise decided, or as like a shamelessly cynical marketing poet.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 He decided I'll write a book using just those words.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 He had very big funds as well, didn't he?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 But did he not do a thing where one of his books was a bet with his publisher that he could write a book with fewer than 50 words or something like that?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 I think it might be in the Hamidian.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Was that Hamidian?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 But he, a lot of his stories are, it's hard to tell if they're true.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Like, he spread a lot of mythology about him, so often his time.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 He said that he used to get all of his ideas from a small town where they made the cuckoo clock.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 He used to go there and they'd give him ideas.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Well, but he was also a mummy hunter, which is interesting.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Yeah, he used to go with his wife and go mummy hunting.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Was this late 19th century early 20th?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 At least 20 years ago.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 He would have been later, right?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Yeah, because I knew he was a cartoonist during World War II.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Well, he must have been before or after that.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 It's amazing that even then you could still go mummy hunting.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Well, they used to dig up mummies and crush them up and sell them as medicine in jars.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Where?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Just, you know, around.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Like Brooklyn?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Yeah, like that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Oh, no, there's a book that says that the kings of England lots of the mechanicals, because they consumed human flesh in the form of mummies.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Granted up mummies and things like that, yeah.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Yeah, they thought it had some sort of curative property.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Wow.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Yeah.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Anyway, back to Cocoa.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 So Cocoa asked for a pet cat.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And also was quite the seat of Cocoa basically one day.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 This is a story I read about Cocoa, the gorilla.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 They came back to where Cocoa is and a sink had been ripped out of the wall.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 This is my favorite Cocoa story too.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Oh, tell us then, tell us.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Right, yes.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 So a gigantic sink had been ripped out of the wall and a 2,000 pound sink.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And the scientist confronted her and said, you know, who ripped out the sink?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Signed, who ripped out the sink?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And after the long pause, Cocoa signed Janis.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And Janis was one of the lab assistants who was 21-year-old 95-pound woman.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 And Cocoa tried to pin it on her.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And the scientist signed to Cocoa.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 I don't believe that Janis ripped out the sink.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 I think gorilla ripped out the sink.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 And Cocoa had to sort of hang her head and admit what she'd done.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And she signed Cocoa ripped sink, bad gorilla Cocoa.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Because I read that she blamed the cat as well.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Oh, wow.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 She's always pinning things on her.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Yeah.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Is that why she wanted the cat to just disguise her crime?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Yeah.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 She needed a stooge.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 A stooge.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 But that's actually, I read about another story about Cocoa, apparently.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 So she has a name for a human, which is Nipple.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And she, at least three former keepers, have claimed that they were pressured into showing their breasts at the gorilla's request.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 That's right.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 This Cocoa was kind of an evil tyrant.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 It seems like she got whatever she wanted, whatever she wanted.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And there were no checks and balances.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And she was constantly making a scientist disrobe.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Yeah, Coco knows what's going on.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Absolutely.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 So the cat she wanted was a white fluffy cat, which she could strok.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 She dictated her demand.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Yeah.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 She's quite old, though.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 She's 30 or 40 years old.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 How long have you lived?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 In human lives.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 I think that's a reasonably advanced stage.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 I think maybe longer than that evidently.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Right.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 But I mean, captivity in the world difference.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Yeah, they live longer in captivity.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 I think the oldest known primate that's non-human, I think, was cheetah out of the Tarzan movies.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Because it lived in captivity in Hollywood somewhere.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And obviously, we don't know how old every single primators, but this one in particular lived to about 70 or something.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Really?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Yeah.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 It was an artist.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Hollywood lifestyle there, isn't it?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Yeah, cheetah was an artist, right?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Yeah.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 It's same with bubbles.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Michael Jackson's monkey.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 But bubbles had a rough end.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 He ended up in a sanctuary far away from the glitz and glamour.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Michael never apparently never visited.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Although it's said, I read this thing where they said that he always thought of bubbles as his first child

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 and added that he hoped the Jackson children would keep in touch with their stepbrother after he's gone.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 So he did love him, but he got too aggressive.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 He got too big apparently.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 That's right.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Apparently when chimpanzees get too big...

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Well, can you imagine bubbles in that animal sanctuary with the other chimps trying to explain what his childhood was like?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 How would anyone believe it?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 He would have been the Michael Jackson of the chimpanzee world.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 That's right.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Yeah, my grandmother used to own a chimpanzee in Cambodia.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Really?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 It was a real half-brother.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 It was named after me, actually.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Yeah, it was cool.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 They call me chumps.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 That's my nickname I had as a kid from them, and they name...

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Sounds like you were named after the chimpanzee.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Yeah.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Well, they had a gibbon as well, and they kept in this cage in this restaurant.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 They had a restaurant in Cambodia where...

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 It's not like a figure-un-given thing, is it?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 No, no, no.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 They were just...

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Okay, sure.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 It was an amazing restaurant because they used to have a massive menu,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 but everyone kept ordering the goulash, and they discovered one of the chefs

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 kept putting marijuana inside, which is legal there.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 So they got rid of the whole menu, and it was just a goulash marijuana place.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 That's all my grandmother.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 But they had to give away the chimpanzee because she got sexually frustrated

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 with the gibbon in the cage, and ripped its arm off.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Very sad.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Oh, wow.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Rip!

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 It's almost...

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 That's what I love to do for you.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Wow.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 They're a freakishly strong, and they've evolved to go for vulnerable parts of, you know,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 another primate's body, so they will rip off the genitals of male rivals and throw them...

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Yeah, hundreds of feet.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Throw them.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 And because then you're simultaneously killing your enemy, and also you're expunging his genetic influence on you.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Oh, gosh.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 John Wayne Bobbitts is the animal penguin.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Exactly.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Very efficient.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Yes.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Or violence.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 God, imagine you just walking through the forest as an explorer, and this gorilla cock smacks you in the face if you're walking along.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 It's a rough day.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 That's a rough day.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Oh, gorilla testicles only about an eighth or a sixteenth the size of human ones.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 So only the penis is a very small gorilla penis.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 But that's because they do all the establishing supremacy with their muscles, isn't it, with their body?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Yeah.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 There's no need for sperm competition, because they, you know, once you're a male gorilla,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 and you get a harem, then you're away, you don't need to worry about competition from other males in that sense.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 And you don't need like a cool car.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Yeah.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 You can just kind of show up.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Yeah, I think it's something like a male silverback gorilla's erect penis is a quarter of an inch in length or something like that.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 You might be right.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 So like a normal sized penis, right guys?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Like an average male penis.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Okay, should we wrap off with this one?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Anna, we should go to you.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Do you have anything you want to add?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Yeah, a few things.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 So long time ago, you guys were talking about the 1000 most commonly used English words.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Yep.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 So I've got a list of them here, and I just, I thought I'd read them all out.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 V.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 You're right.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 The Orbanand.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Yep.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 How much time have we got?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 I know the three, I know the three most common nouns are time, person and year.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Yes.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And the first 25, shut up James, don't care it's my role now.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 This is my moment.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 The first 25 words in 1000 most frequently used words make up a third of all printed material.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Just 25 words.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Wow.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 The reason Coco knew what a cat was before she had her pet cat.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Her two favorite books were the three little kittens and put in boots.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And so she looked at those pictures and knew the word cat.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 I don't know the three little kittens.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Neither do I.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 I don't know if it's two little kittens.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Anyway, they first of all tried to give her a stuff toy that looked like a cat to fopper off.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 And she was really pissed off and made it clear that she needed the real thing.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 So they got, they got her the real thing.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 And she named it all ball.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Did we discuss that?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 No, we didn't.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 So she, she named her first kitten.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Obviously she only has a thousand words in her vocabulary, which it turns out was enough for a good cat name.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 So she called it all ball.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Because apparently, according to her owners, she likes to rhyme in sign language.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Time for fact number two, and that's my fact.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 My fact this week is according to Yeti experts.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Oh, God.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Yeah.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 It is easier to escape a female Yeti than a male Yeti because female Yetis have such long dangling boobs

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 that before they can chase you, they need to chuck them over their shoulders like a scarf.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Otherwise, they may trip on them and bang their head.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 James, you're looking skeptical.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 That's a fact.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Yeah, it's a fact about something that doesn't exist.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 It's a fact about something that no one has ever seen.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Yes.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 But it's a fact that comes from Captain John Null.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Captain John Null was the guy who first broke into Tibet under a guise because he weren't allowed as a westerner into Tibet.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 And he was the first person to see Mount Everest and think we need to climb that.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 He came back to England and he pitched it at the Royal Geographical Society.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And that's what led to the Mallory Expedition.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 And he was on the Mallory Expedition.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 He was the official photographer.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Do you think they said, I'm not really sure that sounds like a good idea.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And he said, oh, no, there's giant monkeys with enormous breasts.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Hey, I don't know if he believed in the Yeti.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 That might have been a, that was a bit of myth that he brought back with him.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 But it's a fact.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 It is a fact about something that people who believe in the Yeti believe.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 If you were talking to someone who believes in the Yeti right here in this room and you said, did you know this?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 I'd say, yeah, of course.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 It's a weird one though, isn't it?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Because it's a fact that that is believed amongst people who believe in it.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Yeah.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 It's like a different world of facts.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 It's like a second subspecies of facts.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Because it is a Yeti fact.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 But it's not a real world fact.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 I think it's a person fact.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Yeah, it's a fact about what people believe.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 So do you know about the $10 million Bigfoot bounty TV show?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 No.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Yeah.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Okay, it was on a very small American channel.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 I can't remember which one it is.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Like a satellite channel or a cable channel.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And there was a number of teams.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And they every week tried to find evidence of Bigfoot.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 And whoever found the least evidence each week would get kicked off until there was only two teams there.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 So how did they classify the least evidence?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 They had a team of experts who would explain that.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 And the final two, whoever got the most evidence.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 If they could find evidence of Bigfoot, then they would win $10 million.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Wow.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Did the price go unclaimed?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 It went unclaimed.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 At that point, I know Bigfoot is something of a recluse.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 But if I were him, I would go and make a deal.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 And so I'll take five.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 You take five million.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 I'll pose for one picture.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Yeah.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Hang on.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 The premise of this show is that if you find most or least evidence, you're either saved or kicked off.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Yeah.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 But if at the end of the show, the people who found most evidence had found no evidence.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 And therefore the $10 million went unclaimed.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Then all the other teams are like, they can't even less than no evidence.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Yeah.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 That's the premise.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 The $10 million was underwritten by Lloyds of London, probably as a joke.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Oh man, I'd love to see the look on their face if they found Bigfoot.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Yeah.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 What a rough shareholder's meeting that is.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 We're in the red this quarter.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 They found Bigfoot.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 We're sorry.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 They did quite recently.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 There was a study done of creatures claiming to be Bigfoot or the Sasquatch.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 And they took 57 samples of hair that people had sent into them saying this is Bigfoot or this is a Sasquatch.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 One of them was a piece of fiberglass, so that didn't get used.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 But they managed to get down to about 30 where they didn't know what it was immediately.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And of that 30, they turned out to be cows, horses, raccoons or sometimes bears.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 But they think that they might have got two samples from previously unrecognized bear species or hybrids.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Wow.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 So they might have discovered new species by doing that.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 There's plenty more to find out there.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 We live under this weird assumption that we've discovered everything.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Right, and in the ocean we've barely cracked the surface, right?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 The ocean is, I think we've done something like 6% tops.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 We've definitely mapped Mars better than the ocean.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 The thing that I liked most about this Yeti fact, other than its Yetis and I love Yetis,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 is that I just love its advice to escape.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 It's a escape advice, and I love escape advice, because I think it's the best kind of weird, handy advice that you probably will never need to use.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 But it will always stick with you.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 If you know this fact now about female Yetis, this will not leave you for the rest of your life.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 I found this thing of the best way to, in Chinese mythology, to escape a vampire,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 is to make sure you have bags of rice around because they count.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 They're obsessive counters apparently vampires.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Yeah, so do you spill rice?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 You spill rice as they're chasing you.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 They have a dilemma where they're like.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 They have that in Eastern European vampire culture as well.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Like you put sand on the doorstep and they won't come into your house because they'll just stand there counting.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 What we're saying is that all vampires have obsessive compulsive disorder.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Yeah, like that one off Sesame Street who goes, "Van, is that where it came from, the counting Sesame Street?"

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 No, I think that was just a pond on the word count probably.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 If you wanted to escape being an Aztec prisoner, Andy, I know you like, you know this fact, you like it.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 If you were a slave, sorry, in Aztec times, the way to escape was to run away from your master in the middle of the market

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 and step in some human excrement.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 And if you did that, you were no longer a slave.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Really?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Yeah, that was quite a loophole.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 It implies either that there was a lot of human excrement around all that it was very rare.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Maybe it was actually, there was quite a lot because the sewers went alongside the town walls kind of thing.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 But the other thing was if someone tried to stop you from being a slave and someone noticed that, then,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 sorry, if you stopped someone trying to escape, then you became a slave.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 So no one ever stopped them.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Once they started running away, everyone went, "Oh, nothing's doing me."

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 I think it's because people are fair chance.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Yeah, I don't expect that.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Really great story that I like about that's one of the moments of needing to escape.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 The guy who's set up MI6, Mansfield coming.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 He's great because you assume that he would be the ultimate spy.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Yeah.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Because this great story where during World War I he went into Germany, disguised as a German soldier, infiltrating a German camp,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 but got busted immediately because it turned out he didn't know any German.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Immediately at the gate.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 He could at least log that he was like, "Yeah."

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 If he'd learned 25 words, he would've been right.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 He would've been right.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 He used to do this thing. He had a wooden leg.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 But no one really knew at the time that he had a wooden leg.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 But in meetings, if he got bored with what anyone was saying,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 and no one knew he had this leg, he used to take a massive knife that he had on the desk and just stab himself in the leg.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Never would go, "Whoa!"

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 And then he'd just take over.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 That's what I wanted to say.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 That's what I do with my wooden genitals.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 After that, you rip them off and throw them on shit yards.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 You should see people's faces.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 We should probably wrap up on this one as well.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Anna, have you got anything to add?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Just a couple of small things.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 So on yetis, you were saying that it's, if you're being chased by a female yeti,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 you're in luck because they've got these big breasts that get in their way.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 But apparently, you're going to yeti experts.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 You're also likely to be able to escape a male if you run downhill

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 because it's got long hair that blows in its eyes when running, so it can't see well.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Oh, I have that.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 So...

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And, oh, just the ocean floor.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 The estimates are that we've only discovered 10% of what there is to be discovered in the ocean.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Although, if you're talking about map seafloor that's in the public domain,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 we've only discovered two to three percent.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 But apparently, so much of the information about the ocean is completely classified

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 and shrouded in secrecy, according to National Geographic.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 The 7% of what we've discovered about the ocean.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 No one's allowed to know because it's so highly secret.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 What's genuinely classified?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Yeah.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 So, military classified information.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 I guess they have the gadgets that go under there.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 So that it's proprietary information, right?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Well, so they wouldn't want it so they don't want to share that technology?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Right, probably, right.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 It must come down to that.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Yeah.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Because nobody's claimed it.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Nobody's claimed that chunk of the earth.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 They have drones.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Lots of drones.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Ocean drones now, which is so cool.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 They have whole generations of little robots.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 And their only job is to measure or assess one thing.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And you just set them off and they can go all over the world.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 They're always beaming information back.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Yeah.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Like Google spiders.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Yeah, in a way, yeah.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Wow.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 It sounds amazing.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Sounds made up.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Yeah.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Yeah.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Okay, on to fact number three, James.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Okay.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 My fact this week is the Karma Sutra suggests 64 arts to practice alongside sex.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 They include solving word puzzles and teaching birds how to talk.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Yeah, that's weird.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 I just assumed it was just all sex party.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 No, not that much sex in there at all, really.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 In that case, I am a lot sexier than I realize.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 I'm getting pretty good at the telegraph cryptic crossword.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 That's amazing.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Yeah, 64 of them.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Some of the others tattooing the art of making beds, playing on musical glasses filled with water,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 knowledge of minds and quarries and the art of cock fighting.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Or are these dating ideas before you get to the actual portion of the book about sex?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 No, it's...

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Why not visit a minor quarry?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Why not play musical glasses filled with water?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Yeah.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 But so what was the book then?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 What is it?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Okay, the book is It was written in the third century by a celibate monk.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 And he was bringing together all of the different writings from beforehand that were about sex or about the art of mating in humans.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 So where does teaching bird to speak?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 These are things that if you do those, it will improve your general life and also your sex life.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Sort of make a holistic approach.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Yeah.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 There are nine pages on how to look after your wife and 26 pages detailing how to seduce other men's wives.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 What's harder to be fair?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 It's harder.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 It needs more.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Well, here's one way to seduce other men's wives from that. It's called pocket, no pocket. First take the heart of a mongoose, then the fruits of a fenugreek plant, and a god, and some snake eyes.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Mix them all together, cook them over the fire, and then put them in your eyes and it will make you invisible.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And then you can go and find another man's wife.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 What? I've been in the conversation.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 We've been translated invisible for blind.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 God, times were great back then. If a recipe at the beginning of a thing says, take the heart of a mongoose.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 It is a lead with that.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Yeah, just the very first ingredient. That's like the equivalent of like, preheat the oven at 350 degrees.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 It's just the most basic construction.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 There's a papyrus, an Egyptian papyrus, which has a load of things that when it says snake's blood, what it's supposed to be, is some kind of fruit juice or something.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 It says crocodile excrement, it's supposed to be some clave, a special kind of clay from Ethiopia.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 So they use these words even though they didn't really mean that.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Oh, it's all coded, yes.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 James has a theory that, because they say that the ancient Egyptians use crocodile as a contraceptive.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And I think it was just actually a piece of clay from Abyssinia or from Ethiopia.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 And they used to make it into what do you call these apessary and stuff people from being able to impregnate you that way.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 But you get it in all the lists of facts.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 It's like they use crocodile done for contraceptives.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 These are always pretty unlikely.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Yeah, all euphemisms.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 It's always I have a newt, right?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 It's more new to see, you know?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Can you imagine them trying to piece that together?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 What is going on?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Where do they want from us?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 So that'd be amazing.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Someone in that period taking it literally and going and actually getting the heart of a mongoose.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Maybe...

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 What did you do to our fucking mongoose?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 That means pencil. Get a pencil.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Everyone knows it.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 That would be very embarrassing to serve that, you know, which is potion-up and fill the bottle of literal ingredients.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 It would explain a lot of fancy cookbooks today as well.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 If Heaston Blumenthal is actually using a series of elaborate metaphors and he just wants us to make spaghetti bolognese.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 That's true.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 But he's taking liquid nitrogen.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Oh, I mean, I mean ice.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Yeah, so what else is there in that pharmaceutical?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 So the pharmaceutical was discovered by Richard Burton, who did the first British English translation.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Yeah.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 We should say not Richard Burton, the actor.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Yes.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Richard Burton, the Victorian explorer.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Yeah.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Yeah, not that Richard Burton.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Who is the most extraordinary character?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Yeah.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Seemingly fictional when you read his life story because of the amount of things that he did.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Spoke like 30 languages.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 There's probably too many that have made up there.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Yeah, he did speak a lot of languages, but I'm not sure how well he spoke them all.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Because he translated the comma sutra from Sanskrit.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 And whenever he was supposed to translate the word dildo, he put statue instead,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 which kind of changes the meaning of some of the things in there.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Yeah.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 He also, when instead of writing about penises and vaginas because he was writing for Victorian audience,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 he would call the penis lingam, which was Sanskrit for wonder of light.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And he would call the vagina yoni, which was Sanskrit for sacred temple.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 Wow.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 So it's place your wand of light into the sacred temple.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 So it must read like a Harry Potter book when you read his version of the comma sutra.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Do we have more sort of ancient love guides outside of the comma sutra?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 I've never really heard of it.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Egyptian one.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Is that?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 Yeah, kind of a question.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Oh, there's one called the Turin erotic papyrus.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 What's that?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Genuinely, there's the Turin shroud.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 And then for about two thousand years before that is the Turin erotic papyrus.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 And it's a series of blue drawings, basically.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Yeah.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 I don't think it's meant quite as a love guide.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 I think it's more to titillate and things like that.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Okay.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 There was that great.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I can't remember his name.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Anna, you might be able to find it.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 But in the Natural History Museum, they have effectively what is an erotic book.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 It was during a Shackleton trip where the guy who was studying penguins witnessed the insane love life of penguins.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 And he found it so dirty that all of the bits where he had to describe the actual sexual acts he put into what was it?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Greek.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 So that you had to be a real scholar to actually--

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 I don't think it was an erotic papyrus.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 I think it was a code on top of Ancient Greek.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Yeah.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 So they crack the code.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Wow.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 And then even after you crack the code, it's still an Ancient Greek.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 It's still an Ancient Greek, right?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 If I saw something coded in Ancient Greek, I would, man, I would assume the worst and translate that.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Yeah.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 But it was a lot harder to access in the old days, wasn't it?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 You had to crack the codes and then translate from Greek.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 And then it's about penguin.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 And so the Kalmasutri again, they have a section on oral sex.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Well, it starts off saying oral sex is very, very terrible and you shouldn't be doing that kind of thing.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And then they have quite a few pages on how to do it.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Like how?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 This is what you definitely shouldn't do.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Whatever you do, don't do this.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 And then don't do it this way.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 And don't do it this way.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.500
 Wow.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:55.000
 It's a bit like during prohibition when they used to sell wine making kits and it would be grapes and whatever.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 And it says, whatever you do, don't put this alcohol in these grapes and don't bust them down or whatever.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 For a long time, a theater in New York City, it was against the law unless it had some kind of higher moral purpose.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And so pretty much every show during the sort of PT Barnum Days was a show like a sexy melodrama.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And then at the end, a Stern matronally woman would come out for 30 seconds after two hours of this and say,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 "Don't do what you've just said."

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 And that would kind of be it.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 And they were referred to as moral lectures.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Wow.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 And people would start to file out, you know, as the woman came on.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Yeah, I'd rather have that at the beginning, I think.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 Would you?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Yeah.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Does that not spoil the rest of the movement?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 No, because then you forget about it once the sexy melodrama starts.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Well, there you go.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Well, during the, before, there's a few decades where film was really closely regulated by the United States government.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 And one of the things was you can never portray a criminal in the positive light.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 And you can never show them getting away with their crime.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 They always had to be punished.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 And so there's a lot of films where basically they get the girl, they get the money,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 they get the fame and the glory, and then they're just inexplicably gunned down.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 And then by a Stern matronally woman.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 And then she points at the camera and nod.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 And she draws a finger across her throat.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 But it's all these hilarious, like, tacked on endings.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Right.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Yeah.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 You were just mentioning P.T. Barnum before.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 My favorite P.T. Barnum thing is that when people used to go to his circuses,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 you would pay your money, pay two dollars, go in.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And then there would be a big sign saying, this way to the egress.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And everyone would go down there, not really realizing that egress means exit.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 And they'd go straight out and they'd have to pay to go back in again.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And they'd probably wouldn't ask for their money back, because they were too humiliated to admit.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 I thought it was a female eagle.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 That's great.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Well, he was brilliant.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Oh, he was.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Yeah.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 He invented the skylight, I believe.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 I think he's the first person to.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Yeah, the American Museum in Manhattan.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 That should probably be fact-checked.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 But yeah, the first person to burn electric lights at night for no pragmatic reason.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Other than self-promotion.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 So the original New York City skyline was just the word Barnum.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 And I can't shape this void.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 He didn't burn down, didn't it?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Yeah, burn down by time.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 I wonder if, yeah.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 And then later on, he had spent a long time building an optical palace.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Yeah, how's that burn down?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 I think the day after completion.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Yeah, he built a kind of sort of like a zanadude type place.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 A gigantic mansion.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 And it burned down almost immediately.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Yeah.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And then weirdly, he, this is all in Connecticut, where he sort of retired after his long career.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 And I think, I think Bridgeport, Connecticut, he, I think, became mayor of the town.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 All right.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 So he had his whole like small town political career towards the end.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Oh.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 It used to be a problem with things burned down, didn't it?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Like there was a lot of that.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Yeah, it still isn't many ways, you know.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 We just haven't solved that problem of the building burning down yet.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 But in theaters, it used to be because they used to light things up with like fire all the time.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 And there was a few that burnt down in common garden quite a while ago.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 And then they had to put the prices up.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And people protested against the prices going up because they had to pay for this.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 And they protested.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 They rioted for days and days and days.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 And they were known as the op riots because people wanted the old prices.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 And so OP is all price.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And people would just stand there while they were trying to do the play and just go op, op, op, op for like hours on end.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 It's off ground.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 I know.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 That's a rough night.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Yeah.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 I always think the worst would be the actors on stage during the Lincoln assassination.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Just like, man, how do you, how do you get the audience back after that?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Okay, Anna, have you got anything to add?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Yeah, a couple of things to clarify.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 So the guy you were talking about who wrote the sexual habits of Adele Penguins was Dr. George Levick,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 who was the surgeon and medical officer for the British Antarctic Expedition led by Scott, 1910.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Yeah, it was suppressed for almost 100 years, 97 years, and was only made public in 2012

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 because it was considered too crude for society to handle.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 I think we mentioned that on QI, the penguin thing.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 I think it might have been on the show in which case he kept its secret for more than 100 years until 2012

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 and then the next year we put it on national television.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 Yeah, sorry, Victorians, and his stupid sensibilities.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 In a way, he should have, if you'd only published it then, we'd all have forgotten about it by now.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Things in the Karma Sutra.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 So something that Burton, you're right, he did mis-translated a lot of the Karma Sutra.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 But he downplays women's positions.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 So in the Karma Sutra, women, there's a lot of equality in there, a lot of gender equality,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 which obviously he didn't approve of being a Victorian man.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And so, for instance, there's a bit in the text that advises that the wife of an unfaithful man

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 should scold him with sharp language, and Burton just inserts the word "never" into that.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Why do I love people man?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Should never scold those.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 It should be index.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 So this is a minor change, it's an editing decision.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Okay, time for the final fact of the show, Andy.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Hello, my fact this week is that there are more than 15 trillion tons of water above the earth now

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 at any given moment.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Isn't that amazing?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 That's a lot.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Yeah.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 Is that a lot?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 15 trillion tons, I guess it is.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 I think so.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 It's hard to imagine such a big number.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 I know what you mean.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 It's a small proportion, a very small proportion of the total amount of water on the planet, obviously.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 But nonetheless, it is a vast amount.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 It's too big to compute, really.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 But this is the really cool thing about clouds.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 So the average cloud weighs about 400 tons.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 It turns out, the average cumulus cloud.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 So, individually, all the drop...

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Because why don't they just fall?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Well, they are.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 They're always falling.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 But the air inside the cloud is moving upwards faster than they're falling.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 So it's like a slinky on an escalator.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 If you can imagine that.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Yeah.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Yeah.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 And the water droplets are so tiny, they're 0.01 millimeters in diameter.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 A billion of them would be the same size as a sugar cube.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And they're very fast-paced down.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 When you say a slinky on an escalator, do you mean an escalator going up?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Yeah, I do.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 I've never had that image in my head ever.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 It's always stairs where the slinky just going down.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 But presumably the slinky can stay.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Yeah, that's what the wow.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Yeah.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 That's a strong image.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 I've never had that in my life.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 A perpetual motion machine.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Yeah.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 We cracked it.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 There we go.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 If only we could figure out the way of the escalator going up without any impotive energy.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 Oh, I forgot about that.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Oh, silicone, silicone oil.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 I still say we pan.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Yeah.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Yeah.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 The size of the tiny aerosol droplets in a cloud is one micron in width, which is the same width

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 as a human sperm.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Wow.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Okay.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Normal male penis is just slightly bigger than that.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Right?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 But the sperm is the smallest cell in the body, isn't it?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Or just about the smallest cell.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 It's very close to it.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 Yeah.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Everyone seems as, but I don't think it is really.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 But it's down there.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Yeah.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 It's pretty small, but like blood platelets are pretty small.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 I think it's not the smell.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 It's generally sad to be the smallest.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 But the female egg is definitely the largest.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Yeah, really the biggest.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Yeah.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 But the biggest egg in all nature would be like a bird egg, probably like an ostrich egg.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Yeah.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Those things are big.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Yeah.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 I think the bird egg, remember the one that David Attenborough found, the egg of it.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 It looks like a giant ostrich.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 And it's the largest an egg can be.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 All right.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Before it gets too thick that the thing inside can't crack out of it.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Or that it just forms a big.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 But can't be bothered.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 The oven's called the oven.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Sorry, I'm in the oven, not the the egg.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Like a chicken's egg.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Because that's fantastic.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 Oh, right.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Yeah.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 I'm just thinking about that egg.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 The giant bird egg.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Do we still have the elephant bird?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 No, no, it's extinct, but we do have the egg.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 It's kind of like when you go to Mongolia and you find dinosaur eggs.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 I just found a new dinosaur.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Do you guys see that?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Yeah.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Yeah, gigantic one.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Yeah, the biggest thing I've ever found.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 They say it's 12 times as big as a T-Rex.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 What?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Yeah.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Wow.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 I heard that in the Guardian this morning.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Yeah, 12 times.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 It is scary when you see the photos of these giant like thigh bones which are twice the size of a person.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 But did you know that most of these dinosaurs had feathers?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 This is the new theory.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 They looked like people, yeah, people say they basically looked like giant chickens and make them a little less intimidated.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Jurassic Park needs a hold.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Sure.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Someone will do it.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Someone will do it at some point.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 For the 20th anniversary, they'll come up with all feathers on every dinosaur.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 For lots of raptors, I think.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 And lots of raptors were tiny, weren't they?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 They were the size of, I think, large chickens or small dogs.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Some were in between those two.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Yeah.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Plout juice.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Do you know what that is?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Plout juice.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Plout juice.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Yeah.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 Rain.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 Well, yeah, it is pretty much.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 You're in your fancy words.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 This is a Bolton thing.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 No, it's not very much not.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 It's bottled water that you can get in clarages.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 And they sell it in a menu like wine.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And it's collected on a plastic roof on a tiny wind swept island off the Australian coast.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 And it's the most expensive bottled water ever to arrive in the UK.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Wow.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 How's it sold as being better?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Because the trade winds come off the ocean and they're supposed to be much purer

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 because there isn't any pollution on the rain.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Wait, doesn't it?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Because it's just H2O.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Yeah.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 There are ways of purifying water.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 You just need to boil it and condense it.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 And then you've got no impurities at all.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Yeah.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Yet we have this idealized water in our heads.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Yeah.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 But you could buy on some so badly.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Yeah.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Don't you guys want to taste that?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 I bet it's great.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 It's all got a clarages.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Let's get sushi on the way.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 I want to do this thing.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Yeah.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 Let me be swimming in cladjuice.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Cladjuice.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 It doesn't sound nice though.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 It's not a nice name.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 Yeah.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Why do they call it cladjuice?

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Cloud water.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Lovely.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Cloud juice.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Yeah.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 It's a cladgy.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 It's a sky muck.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 But there's also, you could get beer where the water comes from glaciers

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 and that's supposed to be like better and purer.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 Oh, like ice wine as well.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Which is wine where the grapes are frozen.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 And so all the sugar is pushed into the remaining bit of the grape, which isn't frozen.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 And then you crush that grape.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Right.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 So it makes them much sweeter wine.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Okay.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 So have you heard of cloud nine?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Yes.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Yeah.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Yeah.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Well, this is really cool.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Cloud nine is not the highest most elegant floaty cloud there is.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 Cloud nine is actually at the very bottom of the height scale in the international cloud atlas.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 It's like high fog, essentially.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Oh, absolutely.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 It's cool.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 It's cumuloneimbus.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 So cumulus of the fluffy ones nimble so rainy.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 And that's cloud nine.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 If you want really high elegant clouds, you want cloud zero, which is cirrus.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 And that's the stuff which is just ice crystals in the sky.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 It's just millions of ice crystals flying together.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Yeah.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Did they like change the numbers or something?

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Is that why we say cloud nine is...

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 No.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 So they were all...

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 So the famous system was invented by a scientist called Luke Howard.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Yeah.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 Which is all the lesser names, cumulus, nimble, stratus.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 Cirrus is lovely.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 It means a curl of hair.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Oh.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 It's really out.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Because it looks beautiful like that.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.600
 But he came up with the system and the poet Gehrther was so impressed with this incredible

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.720
 classification job that he dedicated four whole poems to him and he praised him for bestowing

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.640
 form on the formless and a system of order to change on a boundless world.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.080
 You know, back in the day, when there weren't names of different types of clouds.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.080
 But this is really cool.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.280
 The year before Luke Howard came up with his, that was 1802.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.320
 There was another French scientist called Jean-Baptiste Lamarque.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.160
 He came up with the system.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.660
 And he came up with his when he was ill in bed looking at the clouds floating past his window.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:56.440
 And they had Onvoile, which means hazy, atrupe, mast, pomley, which means dappled, and groupie,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.440
 which means grouped.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.640
 Was that the same Lamarque who came up with evolution at the same time as Darwin?

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.640
 Yeah.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.640
 The same guy.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.640
 He was off on a couple of things.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.640
 Yeah.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.160
 But unfortunately, no one paid any attention to his system in the next year along comes

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.400
 fancy boy with his Latin and the way you go.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.800
 They believed him about, you know, giraffes stretching their next out until they were along.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800
 Yeah.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800
 When people bought that for a while, right?

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.800
 They're still some people.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.200
 They're still some people who think that Lamarque is going to come back one day.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.200
 What?

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.160
 There was some studies like, in the last few years, that mice can pass their memories onto

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.960
 their grandchildren.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.640
 And if that was true, that would be Lamarque's own box.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.640
 That Lamarque's own.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640
 Right.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.640
 Right.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.640
 Yeah, it's such a mad idea.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.640
 It has to pass on learned trade-offs.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640
 It was fear, wasn't it?

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:46.400
 They associated a particular smell with fear and two generations on the mice, which had had

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.640
 no contact with their grandparents, exhibited the same fear, which is, if true, unbelievable.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.240
 So it's not, but it's not like us getting, you know, you and me suddenly talking about

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240
 the war.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.080
 No, no, no, but the fear had altered their, just like no, those memories came down.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.400
 No, but the fear had altered their genes.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.440
 So they were afraid of the smell of, I think it was lavender.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:14.160
 So they were afraid of experiment, a lot of experiment is they hooked a mouse's, they hooked

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:21.760
 his pleasure sensors in his brain with an electrode to a button, which he could press

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.240
 in order to send a jolt of engulfants into his system.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.360
 And he kept, you know, predictably, he kept pressing the button.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.400
 And he pressed it so incessantly that he forgot to eat and he forgot to drink.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.920
 And his limbs eventually atrophied to the point where he had to just press it with his face.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.920
 Oh my God.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.840
 And then he died ultimately of starvation.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.840
 And no one stepped in?

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.840
 No, they just let him go with it.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.840
 Oh my God.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.960
 It just sounds like one of the saw movies or something.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.960
 Yeah.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.480
 And then I read another one about, they took a bunch of mice and they played them classical

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.800
 music and they took a bunch of other mice and they played them rock and roll and they mixed

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:08.360
 them together and the rock mice ate the classical mice.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360
 Okay.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360
 Should we wrap up on this?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.520
 Anna, have you got, have you got anything you want to add?

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.800
 So the largest dinosaur ever found has been discovered.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.800
 It weighed as much, they estimate, as 14 African elephants.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.080
 It's seven tons heavier than the previous record holder.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.080
 Why?

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.080
 It was found in Argentina.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080
 So it's pretty impressive.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.640
 And it's about 20 meters tall, which reminded me of a thing I read and I think it was

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.640
 a new scientist blog.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:36.920
 If anyone saw the first episode of this series of Doctor Who where the T-Rex was the same height

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.920
 as Big Ben.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.920
 Oh yeah.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.840
 The largest known specimen of a T-Rex that we have is four meters and Big Ben is 96.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.840
 So.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.840
 Okay.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840
 That's it.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.840
 That's all of our facts.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840
 Thanks everyone for listening.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:58.440

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.760
 on this podcast, you can reach most of us on Twitter.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.040
 I can be got on @shriverland andy @andruhunterem.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.040
 James.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040
 That's egg-shaped.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.840
 Simon, you're not on Twitter are you?

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840
 No, no, guys.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840
 Sorry.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840
 Oh my god.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.840
 How?

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840
 Why?

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.640
 You know, I just, yeah, I just, it's just my level of coolness.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.640
 It's just too high.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.280
 I just know I would consume my entire life if I was on social media so I just steer clear

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.280
 of all of it.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.280
 Fair enough.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:31.120
 If you can't get him online but you can get him in bookshops, that's a good word.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.120
 Yeah, so Spoilt Bratz is out now, but also all of his books, Last Girl Front on Earth, Elliott

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120
 Alligash.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120
 What in God's name?

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120
 Yep.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.800
 And then there's two in America, if you're listening in America, there is free range chickens

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.800
 and ant form.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.800
 Could you remember as well?

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800
 That's amazing.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.800
 There's no notes in front of them.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.800
 He's just doing this.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.800
 Yes.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.800
 I remember.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.800
 I really appreciate that.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800
 I've read all the books.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.040
 I'm, this is not a lie, I'm a massive fan.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.640
 I think he's the best comedy writer out there at the moment.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.600
 So get Simon's books.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.920
 You can find us all on Twitter, Anna, you're not on Twitter still.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.720
 Yeah, I like the fact we discussed this a lot and no one's ever suggested that I'm too

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.160
 cool to be on Twitter over the 20 episodes we've had.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.160
 Not cool enough.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.160
 Not cool enough.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.160
 Yeah.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.160
 Double standards.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160
 Okay, that's it for this week.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.080
 We're going to be back again next week than another episode.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.080
 No such thing as a fish.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.000
 Go to our website and you can find all previous episodes and we'll be back again.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 Yeah.
