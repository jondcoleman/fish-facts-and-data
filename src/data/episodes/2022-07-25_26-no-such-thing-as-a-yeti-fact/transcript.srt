1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm sitting here with three of the regular elves.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 It's James Harkin, Andy Murray, and on fact checking duties today.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 It's Anichezinski, and we got a special guest joining us today.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 He's my favorite comedy writer. We're very excited.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Simon Rich from New York, here on a book tour.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hello. Thanks so much for having me.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 This is super fun. Yeah, thanks for coming.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So you're here, you've only here until tomorrow, unfortunately.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Sure trip, yeah. Yeah.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 So Spoil Bratz, new book, collection of short stories.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 One of which is being adapted into a movie by Seth Rogan.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Your previous book, The Last Girl from No North,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 being turned into a sitcom currently coming out next year.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Used to work for Pixar, Saturday Night Live, and you're under 30.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 How the fuck did you do this?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Well, the books are really short.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 The books I write. They're almost more like pamphlets.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Also, the font is really large.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The margins are wide.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Sometimes they'll just, like in between chapters,

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 they'll just be a few unnecessarily blank pages.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Just to kind of pat it out. So that's the biggest trick.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Cool. Okay. Well, let's kick into our show.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So we're going to go back number one.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 We're going to start with you. Simon.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Cool. So my fact is about Coco, the gorilla who knows sign language.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And according to my research,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 over the course of her lifetime, she has owned and cared for three pet cats.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Yeah. So, and how did she get these cats?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 It's a good question.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I know that she actually, because she speaks sign language,

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 knows a thousand words and sign languages.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And apparently they asked her, what would you like for Christmas?

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And she said, I would like a pet cat.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 It's a good thing she doesn't know, Flamethrower.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Or the word for freedom.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Right, or a freedom pet.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 A thousand words, isn't that many, though, is it?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Is it not?

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I don't love the thousand words.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I know more than that is just numbers.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 But if you take the thousand words you use most often,

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 they probably cover almost everything.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And then it's specific ones after that, like hammer, cool thrombosis or whatever.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 So, you know, maybe they're in your top thousand, I don't know.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It would be lovely to see the thousand words you use most often.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Yes. It would be really cool.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I have that list in Russian, actually.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 What, that you use?

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 No, I got that, I was trying to learn Russian and I still am, but not very well.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And I thought one way to do it would be to get the thousand most popular spoken words in Russian.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And then try and learn them all.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Well, that's how Dr. Seuss wrote "Cat in the Hat."

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Oh, really?

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Yeah, he got a book that was a list of, I think, the first 100 words that children learn how to read.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And he almost as an exercise decided, or as like a shamelessly cynical marketing poet.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 He decided I'll write a book using just those words.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 He had very big funds as well, didn't he?

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 But did he not do a thing where one of his books was a bet with his publisher that he could write a book with fewer than 50 words or something like that?

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I think it might be in the Hamidian.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Was that Hamidian?

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 But he, a lot of his stories are, it's hard to tell if they're true.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Like, he spread a lot of mythology about him, so often his time.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He said that he used to get all of his ideas from a small town where they made the cuckoo clock.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 He used to go there and they'd give him ideas.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Well, but he was also a mummy hunter, which is interesting.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Yeah, he used to go with his wife and go mummy hunting.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Was this late 19th century early 20th?

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 At least 20 years ago.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 He would have been later, right?

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Yeah, because I knew he was a cartoonist during World War II.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Well, he must have been before or after that.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 It's amazing that even then you could still go mummy hunting.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Well, they used to dig up mummies and crush them up and sell them as medicine in jars.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Where?

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Just, you know, around.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Like Brooklyn?

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Yeah, like that.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Oh, no, there's a book that says that the kings of England lots of the mechanicals, because they consumed human flesh in the form of mummies.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Granted up mummies and things like that, yeah.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Yeah, they thought it had some sort of curative property.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Wow.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Yeah.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Anyway, back to Cocoa.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So Cocoa asked for a pet cat.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And also was quite the seat of Cocoa basically one day.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 This is a story I read about Cocoa, the gorilla.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 They came back to where Cocoa is and a sink had been ripped out of the wall.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 This is my favorite Cocoa story too.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Oh, tell us then, tell us.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Right, yes.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 So a gigantic sink had been ripped out of the wall and a 2,000 pound sink.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And the scientist confronted her and said, you know, who ripped out the sink?

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Signed, who ripped out the sink?

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And after the long pause, Cocoa signed Janis.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And Janis was one of the lab assistants who was 21-year-old 95-pound woman.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And Cocoa tried to pin it on her.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And the scientist signed to Cocoa.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I don't believe that Janis ripped out the sink.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I think gorilla ripped out the sink.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And Cocoa had to sort of hang her head and admit what she'd done.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And she signed Cocoa ripped sink, bad gorilla Cocoa.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Because I read that she blamed the cat as well.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Oh, wow.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 She's always pinning things on her.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Yeah.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Is that why she wanted the cat to just disguise her crime?

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Yes, exactly.

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Yeah.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 She needed a stooge.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 A stooge.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 But that's actually, I read about another story about Cocoa, apparently.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 So she has a name for a human, which is Nipple.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And she, at least three former keepers, have claimed that they were pressured into showing their breasts at the gorilla's request.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 That's right.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 This Cocoa was kind of an evil tyrant.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 It seems like she got whatever she wanted, whatever she wanted.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And there were no checks and balances.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And she was constantly making a scientist disrobe.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Yeah, Coco knows what's going on.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Absolutely.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So the cat she wanted was a white fluffy cat, which she could strok.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 She dictated her demand.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Yeah.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 She's quite old, though.

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 She's 30 or 40 years old.

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 How long have you lived?

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 In human lives.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I think that's a reasonably advanced stage.

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I think maybe longer than that evidently.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Right.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 But I mean, captivity in the world difference.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Yeah, they live longer in captivity.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I think the oldest known primate that's non-human, I think, was cheetah out of the Tarzan movies.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Oh, yeah.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Because it lived in captivity in Hollywood somewhere.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And obviously, we don't know how old every single primators, but this one in particular lived to about 70 or something.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Really?

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Yeah.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 It was an artist.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Hollywood lifestyle there, isn't it?

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yeah, cheetah was an artist, right?

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Yeah.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's same with bubbles.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Michael Jackson's monkey.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But bubbles had a rough end.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 He ended up in a sanctuary far away from the glitz and glamour.

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Michael never apparently never visited.

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Although it's said, I read this thing where they said that he always thought of bubbles as his first child

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 and added that he hoped the Jackson children would keep in touch with their stepbrother after he's gone.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So he did love him, but he got too aggressive.

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 He got too big apparently.

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 That's right.

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Apparently when chimpanzees get too big...

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Well, can you imagine bubbles in that animal sanctuary with the other chimps trying to explain what his childhood was like?

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 How would anyone believe it?

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 He would have been the Michael Jackson of the chimpanzee world.

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 That's right.

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Yeah, my grandmother used to own a chimpanzee in Cambodia.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Really?

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It was a real half-brother.

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 It was named after me, actually.

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Yeah, it was cool.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 They call me chumps.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 That's my nickname I had as a kid from them, and they name...

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Sounds like you were named after the chimpanzee.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Yeah.

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Well, they had a gibbon as well, and they kept in this cage in this restaurant.

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 They had a restaurant in Cambodia where...

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 It's not like a figure-un-given thing, is it?

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 No, no, no.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 They were just...

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Okay, sure.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It was an amazing restaurant because they used to have a massive menu,

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 but everyone kept ordering the goulash, and they discovered one of the chefs

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 kept putting marijuana inside, which is legal there.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So they got rid of the whole menu, and it was just a goulash marijuana place.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 No, no, no, no.

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 That's all my grandmother.

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But they had to give away the chimpanzee because she got sexually frustrated

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 with the gibbon in the cage, and ripped its arm off.

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Very sad.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Oh, wow.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Rip!

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 It's almost...

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 That's what I love to do for you.

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Wow.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 They're a freakishly strong, and they've evolved to go for vulnerable parts of, you know,

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 another primate's body, so they will rip off the genitals of male rivals and throw them...

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Yeah, hundreds of feet.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Throw them.

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Yeah, oh, yeah.

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And because then you're simultaneously killing your enemy, and also you're expunging his genetic influence on you.

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Oh, gosh.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 John Wayne Bobbitts is the animal penguin.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Exactly.

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Very efficient.

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Yes.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Or violence.

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 God, imagine you just walking through the forest as an explorer, and this gorilla cock smacks you in the face if you're walking along.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It's a rough day.

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 That's a rough day.

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Oh, gorilla testicles only about an eighth or a sixteenth the size of human ones.

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 So only the penis is a very small gorilla penis.

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But that's because they do all the establishing supremacy with their muscles, isn't it, with their body?

218
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Yeah.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 There's no need for sperm competition, because they, you know, once you're a male gorilla,

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 and you get a harem, then you're away, you don't need to worry about competition from other males in that sense.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And you don't need like a cool car.

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Yeah.

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 You can just kind of show up.

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Yeah, I think it's something like a male silverback gorilla's erect penis is a quarter of an inch in length or something like that.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You might be right.

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So like a normal sized penis, right guys?

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Like an average male penis.

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Okay, should we wrap off with this one?

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Yeah, yeah.

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Anna, we should go to you.

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Do you have anything you want to add?

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Yeah, a few things.

233
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 So long time ago, you guys were talking about the 1000 most commonly used English words.

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Oh, yeah.

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Oh, yeah.

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Yep.

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So I've got a list of them here, and I just, I thought I'd read them all out.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 V.

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 You're right.

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 The Orbanand.

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Yep.

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 How much time have we got?

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I know the three, I know the three most common nouns are time, person and year.

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Yes.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And the first 25, shut up James, don't care it's my role now.

247
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 This is my moment.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 The first 25 words in 1000 most frequently used words make up a third of all printed material.

249
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Just 25 words.

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Wow.

251
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 The reason Coco knew what a cat was before she had her pet cat.

252
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Her two favorite books were the three little kittens and put in boots.

253
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And so she looked at those pictures and knew the word cat.

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I don't know the three little kittens.

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Neither do I.

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I don't know if it's two little kittens.

257
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Anyway, they first of all tried to give her a stuff toy that looked like a cat to fopper off.

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And she was really pissed off and made it clear that she needed the real thing.

259
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So they got, they got her the real thing.

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And she named it all ball.

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Did we discuss that?

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 No, we didn't.

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So she, she named her first kitten.

264
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Obviously she only has a thousand words in her vocabulary, which it turns out was enough for a good cat name.

265
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So she called it all ball.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Because apparently, according to her owners, she likes to rhyme in sign language.

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Time for fact number two, and that's my fact.

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 My fact this week is according to Yeti experts.

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Oh, God.

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Yeah.

271
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It is easier to escape a female Yeti than a male Yeti because female Yetis have such long dangling boobs

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 that before they can chase you, they need to chuck them over their shoulders like a scarf.

273
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Otherwise, they may trip on them and bang their head.

274
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 James, you're looking skeptical.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 That's a fact.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Yeah, it's a fact about something that doesn't exist.

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 It's a fact about something that no one has ever seen.

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Yes.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But it's a fact that comes from Captain John Null.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Captain John Null was the guy who first broke into Tibet under a guise because he weren't allowed as a westerner into Tibet.

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And he was the first person to see Mount Everest and think we need to climb that.

282
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He came back to England and he pitched it at the Royal Geographical Society.

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And that's what led to the Mallory Expedition.

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And he was on the Mallory Expedition.

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 He was the official photographer.

286
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Do you think they said, I'm not really sure that sounds like a good idea.

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And he said, oh, no, there's giant monkeys with enormous breasts.

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Yeah, exactly.

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Hey, I don't know if he believed in the Yeti.

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 That might have been a, that was a bit of myth that he brought back with him.

291
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 But it's a fact.

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It is a fact about something that people who believe in the Yeti believe.

293
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 If you were talking to someone who believes in the Yeti right here in this room and you said, did you know this?

294
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I'd say, yeah, of course.

295
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's a weird one though, isn't it?

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Because it's a fact that that is believed amongst people who believe in it.

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Yeah.

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's like a different world of facts.

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It's like a second subspecies of facts.

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Because it is a Yeti fact.

301
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 But it's not a real world fact.

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I think it's a person fact.

303
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Yeah, it's a fact about what people believe.

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So do you know about the $10 million Bigfoot bounty TV show?

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 No.

306
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Yeah.

307
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Okay, it was on a very small American channel.

308
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I can't remember which one it is.

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Like a satellite channel or a cable channel.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And there was a number of teams.

311
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And they every week tried to find evidence of Bigfoot.

312
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And whoever found the least evidence each week would get kicked off until there was only two teams there.

313
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So how did they classify the least evidence?

314
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 They had a team of experts who would explain that.

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And the final two, whoever got the most evidence.

316
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 If they could find evidence of Bigfoot, then they would win $10 million.

317
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Wow.

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Did the price go unclaimed?

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 It went unclaimed.

320
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 At that point, I know Bigfoot is something of a recluse.

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But if I were him, I would go and make a deal.

322
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And so I'll take five.

323
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 You take five million.

324
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I'll pose for one picture.

325
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Yeah.

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Hang on.

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 The premise of this show is that if you find most or least evidence, you're either saved or kicked off.

328
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Yeah.

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 But if at the end of the show, the people who found most evidence had found no evidence.

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And therefore the $10 million went unclaimed.

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Then all the other teams are like, they can't even less than no evidence.

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Yeah.

333
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 That's the premise.

334
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 The $10 million was underwritten by Lloyds of London, probably as a joke.

335
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Oh man, I'd love to see the look on their face if they found Bigfoot.

336
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Yeah.

337
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 What a rough shareholder's meeting that is.

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 We're in the red this quarter.

339
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 They found Bigfoot.

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 We're sorry.

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 They did quite recently.

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 There was a study done of creatures claiming to be Bigfoot or the Sasquatch.

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And they took 57 samples of hair that people had sent into them saying this is Bigfoot or this is a Sasquatch.

344
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 One of them was a piece of fiberglass, so that didn't get used.

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 But they managed to get down to about 30 where they didn't know what it was immediately.

346
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And of that 30, they turned out to be cows, horses, raccoons or sometimes bears.

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 But they think that they might have got two samples from previously unrecognized bear species or hybrids.

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Wow.

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 So they might have discovered new species by doing that.

350
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 There's plenty more to find out there.

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 We live under this weird assumption that we've discovered everything.

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Right, and in the ocean we've barely cracked the surface, right?

353
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Yeah, yeah.

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 The ocean is, I think we've done something like 6% tops.

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 We've definitely mapped Mars better than the ocean.

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 The thing that I liked most about this Yeti fact, other than its Yetis and I love Yetis,

357
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 is that I just love its advice to escape.

358
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It's a escape advice, and I love escape advice, because I think it's the best kind of weird, handy advice that you probably will never need to use.

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 But it will always stick with you.

360
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 If you know this fact now about female Yetis, this will not leave you for the rest of your life.

361
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 I found this thing of the best way to, in Chinese mythology, to escape a vampire,

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 is to make sure you have bags of rice around because they count.

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 They're obsessive counters apparently vampires.

364
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Yeah, so do you spill rice?

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 You spill rice as they're chasing you.

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 They have a dilemma where they're like.

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 They have that in Eastern European vampire culture as well.

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Like you put sand on the doorstep and they won't come into your house because they'll just stand there counting.

369
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 What we're saying is that all vampires have obsessive compulsive disorder.

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Yeah, like that one off Sesame Street who goes, "Van, is that where it came from, the counting Sesame Street?"

371
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 No, I think that was just a pond on the word count probably.

372
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 If you wanted to escape being an Aztec prisoner, Andy, I know you like, you know this fact, you like it.

373
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 If you were a slave, sorry, in Aztec times, the way to escape was to run away from your master in the middle of the market

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 and step in some human excrement.

375
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And if you did that, you were no longer a slave.

376
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Really?

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Yeah, that was quite a loophole.

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It implies either that there was a lot of human excrement around all that it was very rare.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Maybe it was actually, there was quite a lot because the sewers went alongside the town walls kind of thing.

380
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But the other thing was if someone tried to stop you from being a slave and someone noticed that, then,

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 sorry, if you stopped someone trying to escape, then you became a slave.

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 So no one ever stopped them.

383
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Once they started running away, everyone went, "Oh, nothing's doing me."

384
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I think it's because people are fair chance.

385
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Yeah, I don't expect that.

386
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Really great story that I like about that's one of the moments of needing to escape.

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 The guy who's set up MI6, Mansfield coming.

388
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Oh, yeah.

389
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 He's great because you assume that he would be the ultimate spy.

390
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Yeah.

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Because this great story where during World War I he went into Germany, disguised as a German soldier, infiltrating a German camp,

392
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 but got busted immediately because it turned out he didn't know any German.

393
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Immediately at the gate.

394
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He could at least log that he was like, "Yeah."

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 If he'd learned 25 words, he would've been right.

396
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 He would've been right.

397
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 He used to do this thing. He had a wooden leg.

398
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 But no one really knew at the time that he had a wooden leg.

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 But in meetings, if he got bored with what anyone was saying,

400
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and no one knew he had this leg, he used to take a massive knife that he had on the desk and just stab himself in the leg.

401
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Never would go, "Whoa!"

402
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And then he'd just take over.

403
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 That's what I wanted to say.

404
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 That's what I do with my wooden genitals.

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 After that, you rip them off and throw them on shit yards.

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 You should see people's faces.

407
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 We should probably wrap up on this one as well.

408
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Anna, have you got anything to add?

409
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Just a couple of small things.

410
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So on yetis, you were saying that it's, if you're being chased by a female yeti,

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 you're in luck because they've got these big breasts that get in their way.

412
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 But apparently, you're going to yeti experts.

413
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 You're also likely to be able to escape a male if you run downhill

414
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 because it's got long hair that blows in its eyes when running, so it can't see well.

415
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Oh, I have that.

416
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So...

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And, oh, just the ocean floor.

418
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 The estimates are that we've only discovered 10% of what there is to be discovered in the ocean.

419
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Although, if you're talking about map seafloor that's in the public domain,

420
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 we've only discovered two to three percent.

421
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But apparently, so much of the information about the ocean is completely classified

422
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 and shrouded in secrecy, according to National Geographic.

423
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The 7% of what we've discovered about the ocean.

424
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 No one's allowed to know because it's so highly secret.

425
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 What's genuinely classified?

426
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Yeah.

427
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 So, military classified information.

428
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I guess they have the gadgets that go under there.

429
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 So that it's proprietary information, right?

430
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Well, so they wouldn't want it so they don't want to share that technology?

431
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Right, probably, right.

432
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 It must come down to that.

433
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Yeah.

434
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Because nobody's claimed it.

435
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Nobody's claimed that chunk of the earth.

436
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 They have drones.

437
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Lots of drones.

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Ocean drones now, which is so cool.

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 They have whole generations of little robots.

440
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And their only job is to measure or assess one thing.

441
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And you just set them off and they can go all over the world.

442
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 They're always beaming information back.

443
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Yeah.

444
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Like Google spiders.

445
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Yeah, in a way, yeah.

446
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Wow.

447
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It sounds amazing.

448
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Sounds made up.

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Yeah.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Yeah.

451
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Okay, on to fact number three, James.

452
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Okay.

453
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 My fact this week is the Karma Sutra suggests 64 arts to practice alongside sex.

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 They include solving word puzzles and teaching birds how to talk.

455
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Yeah, that's weird.

456
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I just assumed it was just all sex party.

457
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 No, not that much sex in there at all, really.

458
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 In that case, I am a lot sexier than I realize.

459
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I'm getting pretty good at the telegraph cryptic crossword.

460
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 That's amazing.

461
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Yeah, 64 of them.

462
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Some of the others tattooing the art of making beds, playing on musical glasses filled with water,

463
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 knowledge of minds and quarries and the art of cock fighting.

464
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Or are these dating ideas before you get to the actual portion of the book about sex?

465
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 No, it's...

466
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Why not visit a minor quarry?

467
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Why not play musical glasses filled with water?

468
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Yeah.

469
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But so what was the book then?

470
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 What is it?

471
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Okay, the book is It was written in the third century by a celibate monk.

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And he was bringing together all of the different writings from beforehand that were about sex or about the art of mating in humans.

473
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So where does teaching bird to speak?

474
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 These are things that if you do those, it will improve your general life and also your sex life.

475
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Sort of make a holistic approach.

476
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Yeah.

477
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 There are nine pages on how to look after your wife and 26 pages detailing how to seduce other men's wives.

478
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 What's harder to be fair?

479
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's harder.

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It needs more.

481
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Well, here's one way to seduce other men's wives from that. It's called pocket, no pocket. First take the heart of a mongoose, then the fruits of a fenugreek plant, and a god, and some snake eyes.

482
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Mix them all together, cook them over the fire, and then put them in your eyes and it will make you invisible.

483
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And then you can go and find another man's wife.

484
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 What? I've been in the conversation.

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 We've been translated invisible for blind.

486
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 God, times were great back then. If a recipe at the beginning of a thing says, take the heart of a mongoose.

487
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 It is a lead with that.

488
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Yeah, just the very first ingredient. That's like the equivalent of like, preheat the oven at 350 degrees.

489
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 It's just the most basic construction.

490
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 There's a papyrus, an Egyptian papyrus, which has a load of things that when it says snake's blood, what it's supposed to be, is some kind of fruit juice or something.

491
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It says crocodile excrement, it's supposed to be some clave, a special kind of clay from Ethiopia.

492
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So they use these words even though they didn't really mean that.

493
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Oh, it's all coded, yes.

494
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 James has a theory that, because they say that the ancient Egyptians use crocodile as a contraceptive.

495
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And I think it was just actually a piece of clay from Abyssinia or from Ethiopia.

496
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And they used to make it into what do you call these apessary and stuff people from being able to impregnate you that way.

497
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But you get it in all the lists of facts.

498
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It's like they use crocodile done for contraceptives.

499
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 These are always pretty unlikely.

500
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Yeah, all euphemisms.

501
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 It's always I have a newt, right?

502
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Yeah, exactly.

503
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 It's more new to see, you know?

504
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Can you imagine them trying to piece that together?

505
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 What is going on?

506
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Where do they want from us?

507
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 So that'd be amazing.

508
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Someone in that period taking it literally and going and actually getting the heart of a mongoose.

509
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Maybe...

510
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 What did you do to our fucking mongoose?

511
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 That means pencil. Get a pencil.

512
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Everyone knows it.

513
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 That would be very embarrassing to serve that, you know, which is potion-up and fill the bottle of literal ingredients.

514
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 It would explain a lot of fancy cookbooks today as well.

515
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 If Heaston Blumenthal is actually using a series of elaborate metaphors and he just wants us to make spaghetti bolognese.

516
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 That's true.

517
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But he's taking liquid nitrogen.

518
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Oh, I mean, I mean ice.

519
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Yeah, so what else is there in that pharmaceutical?

520
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 So the pharmaceutical was discovered by Richard Burton, who did the first British English translation.

521
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Yeah.

522
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 We should say not Richard Burton, the actor.

523
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Yes.

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Richard Burton, the Victorian explorer.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Yeah.

526
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Yeah, not that Richard Burton.

527
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Who is the most extraordinary character?

528
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Yeah.

529
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Seemingly fictional when you read his life story because of the amount of things that he did.

530
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Spoke like 30 languages.

531
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 There's probably too many that have made up there.

532
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Yeah, he did speak a lot of languages, but I'm not sure how well he spoke them all.

533
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Because he translated the comma sutra from Sanskrit.

534
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And whenever he was supposed to translate the word dildo, he put statue instead,

535
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 which kind of changes the meaning of some of the things in there.

536
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Yeah.

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 He also, when instead of writing about penises and vaginas because he was writing for Victorian audience,

538
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 he would call the penis lingam, which was Sanskrit for wonder of light.

539
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And he would call the vagina yoni, which was Sanskrit for sacred temple.

540
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Wow.

541
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 So it's place your wand of light into the sacred temple.

542
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 So it must read like a Harry Potter book when you read his version of the comma sutra.

543
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Do we have more sort of ancient love guides outside of the comma sutra?

544
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I've never really heard of it.

545
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Egyptian one.

546
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Is that?

547
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Yeah, kind of a question.

548
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Oh, there's one called the Turin erotic papyrus.

549
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 What's that?

550
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Genuinely, there's the Turin shroud.

551
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And then for about two thousand years before that is the Turin erotic papyrus.

552
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And it's a series of blue drawings, basically.

553
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Yeah.

554
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I don't think it's meant quite as a love guide.

555
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I think it's more to titillate and things like that.

556
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Okay.

557
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 There was that great.

558
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 I can't remember his name.

559
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Anna, you might be able to find it.

560
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But in the Natural History Museum, they have effectively what is an erotic book.

561
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 It was during a Shackleton trip where the guy who was studying penguins witnessed the insane love life of penguins.

562
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And he found it so dirty that all of the bits where he had to describe the actual sexual acts he put into what was it?

563
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Greek.

564
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 So that you had to be a real scholar to actually--

565
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 I don't think it was an erotic papyrus.

566
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I think it was a code on top of Ancient Greek.

567
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Yeah.

568
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 So they crack the code.

569
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Wow.

570
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And then even after you crack the code, it's still an Ancient Greek.

571
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It's still an Ancient Greek, right?

572
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 If I saw something coded in Ancient Greek, I would, man, I would assume the worst and translate that.

573
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Yeah.

574
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 But it was a lot harder to access in the old days, wasn't it?

575
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 You had to crack the codes and then translate from Greek.

576
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And then it's about penguin.

577
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 [LAUGHTER]

578
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And so the Kalmasutri again, they have a section on oral sex.

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Well, it starts off saying oral sex is very, very terrible and you shouldn't be doing that kind of thing.

580
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And then they have quite a few pages on how to do it.

581
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Like how?

582
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 This is what you definitely shouldn't do.

583
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Whatever you do, don't do this.

584
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And then don't do it this way.

585
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And don't do it this way.

586
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,500
 Wow.

587
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:55,000
 It's a bit like during prohibition when they used to sell wine making kits and it would be grapes and whatever.

588
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And it says, whatever you do, don't put this alcohol in these grapes and don't bust them down or whatever.

589
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 For a long time, a theater in New York City, it was against the law unless it had some kind of higher moral purpose.

590
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And so pretty much every show during the sort of PT Barnum Days was a show like a sexy melodrama.

591
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And then at the end, a Stern matronally woman would come out for 30 seconds after two hours of this and say,

592
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 "Don't do what you've just said."

593
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 [LAUGHTER]

594
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And that would kind of be it.

595
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And they were referred to as moral lectures.

596
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Wow.

597
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And people would start to file out, you know, as the woman came on.

598
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Yeah, I'd rather have that at the beginning, I think.

599
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Would you?

600
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Yeah.

601
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Does that not spoil the rest of the movement?

602
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 No, because then you forget about it once the sexy melodrama starts.

603
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Well, there you go.

604
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 [LAUGHTER]

605
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Well, during the, before, there's a few decades where film was really closely regulated by the United States government.

606
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And one of the things was you can never portray a criminal in the positive light.

607
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And you can never show them getting away with their crime.

608
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 They always had to be punished.

609
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And so there's a lot of films where basically they get the girl, they get the money,

610
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 they get the fame and the glory, and then they're just inexplicably gunned down.

611
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 [LAUGHTER]

612
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And then by a Stern matronally woman.

613
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 [LAUGHTER]

614
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And then she points at the camera and nod.

615
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 [LAUGHTER]

616
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And she draws a finger across her throat.

617
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 [LAUGHTER]

618
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 But it's all these hilarious, like, tacked on endings.

619
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Right.

620
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Yeah.

621
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 You were just mentioning P.T. Barnum before.

622
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 My favorite P.T. Barnum thing is that when people used to go to his circuses,

623
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 you would pay your money, pay two dollars, go in.

624
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And then there would be a big sign saying, this way to the egress.

625
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And everyone would go down there, not really realizing that egress means exit.

626
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And they'd go straight out and they'd have to pay to go back in again.

627
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And they'd probably wouldn't ask for their money back, because they were too humiliated to admit.

628
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Yeah, exactly.

629
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I thought it was a female eagle.

630
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 That's great.

631
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Well, he was brilliant.

632
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Oh, he was.

633
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Yeah.

634
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He invented the skylight, I believe.

635
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I think he's the first person to.

636
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Yeah, the American Museum in Manhattan.

637
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 That should probably be fact-checked.

638
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 But yeah, the first person to burn electric lights at night for no pragmatic reason.

639
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Other than self-promotion.

640
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 So the original New York City skyline was just the word Barnum.

641
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And I can't shape this void.

642
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 He didn't burn down, didn't it?

643
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Oh, yeah.

644
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Yeah, burn down by time.

645
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I wonder if, yeah.

646
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And then later on, he had spent a long time building an optical palace.

647
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Yeah, how's that burn down?

648
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 I think the day after completion.

649
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Yeah, he built a kind of sort of like a zanadude type place.

650
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 A gigantic mansion.

651
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And it burned down almost immediately.

652
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Yeah.

653
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And then weirdly, he, this is all in Connecticut, where he sort of retired after his long career.

654
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And I think, I think Bridgeport, Connecticut, he, I think, became mayor of the town.

655
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 All right.

656
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 So he had his whole like small town political career towards the end.

657
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Oh.

658
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 It used to be a problem with things burned down, didn't it?

659
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Like there was a lot of that.

660
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Yeah, it still isn't many ways, you know.

661
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 We just haven't solved that problem of the building burning down yet.

662
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 But in theaters, it used to be because they used to light things up with like fire all the time.

663
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And there was a few that burnt down in common garden quite a while ago.

664
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And then they had to put the prices up.

665
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And people protested against the prices going up because they had to pay for this.

666
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And they protested.

667
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 They rioted for days and days and days.

668
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And they were known as the op riots because people wanted the old prices.

669
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And so OP is all price.

670
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And people would just stand there while they were trying to do the play and just go op, op, op, op for like hours on end.

671
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 It's off ground.

672
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I know.

673
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 That's a rough night.

674
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Yeah.

675
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 I always think the worst would be the actors on stage during the Lincoln assassination.

676
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Just like, man, how do you, how do you get the audience back after that?

677
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Okay, Anna, have you got anything to add?

678
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Yeah, a couple of things to clarify.

679
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 So the guy you were talking about who wrote the sexual habits of Adele Penguins was Dr. George Levick,

680
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 who was the surgeon and medical officer for the British Antarctic Expedition led by Scott, 1910.

681
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Yeah, it was suppressed for almost 100 years, 97 years, and was only made public in 2012

682
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 because it was considered too crude for society to handle.

683
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I think we mentioned that on QI, the penguin thing.

684
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I think it might have been on the show in which case he kept its secret for more than 100 years until 2012

685
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 and then the next year we put it on national television.

686
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Yeah, sorry, Victorians, and his stupid sensibilities.

687
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 In a way, he should have, if you'd only published it then, we'd all have forgotten about it by now.

688
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Yeah, exactly.

689
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Things in the Karma Sutra.

690
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 So something that Burton, you're right, he did mis-translated a lot of the Karma Sutra.

691
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 But he downplays women's positions.

692
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So in the Karma Sutra, women, there's a lot of equality in there, a lot of gender equality,

693
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 which obviously he didn't approve of being a Victorian man.

694
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And so, for instance, there's a bit in the text that advises that the wife of an unfaithful man

695
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 should scold him with sharp language, and Burton just inserts the word "never" into that.

696
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Why do I love people man?

697
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Should never scold those.

698
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 It should be index.

699
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 So this is a minor change, it's an editing decision.

700
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Okay, time for the final fact of the show, Andy.

701
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Hello, my fact this week is that there are more than 15 trillion tons of water above the earth now

702
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 at any given moment.

703
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Isn't that amazing?

704
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 That's a lot.

705
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Yeah.

706
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Is that a lot?

707
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 15 trillion tons, I guess it is.

708
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I think so.

709
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 It's hard to imagine such a big number.

710
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I know what you mean.

711
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 It's a small proportion, a very small proportion of the total amount of water on the planet, obviously.

712
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 But nonetheless, it is a vast amount.

713
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 It's too big to compute, really.

714
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 But this is the really cool thing about clouds.

715
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 So the average cloud weighs about 400 tons.

716
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 It turns out, the average cumulus cloud.

717
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 So, individually, all the drop...

718
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Because why don't they just fall?

719
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Well, they are.

720
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 They're always falling.

721
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 But the air inside the cloud is moving upwards faster than they're falling.

722
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 So it's like a slinky on an escalator.

723
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 If you can imagine that.

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Yeah.

725
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Yeah.

726
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And the water droplets are so tiny, they're 0.01 millimeters in diameter.

727
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 A billion of them would be the same size as a sugar cube.

728
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And they're very fast-paced down.

729
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 When you say a slinky on an escalator, do you mean an escalator going up?

730
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Yeah, I do.

731
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I've never had that image in my head ever.

732
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 It's always stairs where the slinky just going down.

733
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 But presumably the slinky can stay.

734
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Yeah, that's what the wow.

735
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Yeah.

736
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 That's a strong image.

737
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I've never had that in my life.

738
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 A perpetual motion machine.

739
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Yeah.

740
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 We cracked it.

741
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 There we go.

742
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 If only we could figure out the way of the escalator going up without any impotive energy.

743
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Oh, I forgot about that.

744
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Oh, silicone, silicone oil.

745
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 I still say we pan.

746
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Yeah.

747
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Yeah.

748
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 The size of the tiny aerosol droplets in a cloud is one micron in width, which is the same width

749
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 as a human sperm.

750
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Wow.

751
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Okay.

752
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Normal male penis is just slightly bigger than that.

753
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Right?

754
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 But the sperm is the smallest cell in the body, isn't it?

755
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Or just about the smallest cell.

756
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 It's very close to it.

757
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Yeah.

758
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Everyone seems as, but I don't think it is really.

759
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 But it's down there.

760
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Yeah.

761
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 It's pretty small, but like blood platelets are pretty small.

762
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Oh, yeah.

763
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 I think it's not the smell.

764
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 It's generally sad to be the smallest.

765
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 But the female egg is definitely the largest.

766
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Yeah, really the biggest.

767
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Yeah.

768
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 But the biggest egg in all nature would be like a bird egg, probably like an ostrich egg.

769
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Yeah.

770
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Those things are big.

771
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Yeah.

772
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 I think the bird egg, remember the one that David Attenborough found, the egg of it.

773
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 It looks like a giant ostrich.

774
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 And it's the largest an egg can be.

775
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 All right.

776
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Before it gets too thick that the thing inside can't crack out of it.

777
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Or that it just forms a big.

778
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 But can't be bothered.

779
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 The oven's called the oven.

780
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Sorry, I'm in the oven, not the the egg.

781
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Like a chicken's egg.

782
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Because that's fantastic.

783
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Oh, right.

784
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Yeah, yeah.

785
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Yeah.

786
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 I'm just thinking about that egg.

787
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 The giant bird egg.

788
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Do we still have the elephant bird?

789
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 No, no, it's extinct, but we do have the egg.

790
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 It's kind of like when you go to Mongolia and you find dinosaur eggs.

791
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 I just found a new dinosaur.

792
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Do you guys see that?

793
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Yeah.

794
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Yeah, gigantic one.

795
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Yeah, the biggest thing I've ever found.

796
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 They say it's 12 times as big as a T-Rex.

797
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 What?

798
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Yeah.

799
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Wow.

800
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 I heard that in the Guardian this morning.

801
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Yeah, 12 times.

802
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It is scary when you see the photos of these giant like thigh bones which are twice the size of a person.

803
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 But did you know that most of these dinosaurs had feathers?

804
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 This is the new theory.

805
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 They looked like people, yeah, people say they basically looked like giant chickens and make them a little less intimidated.

806
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Jurassic Park needs a hold.

807
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Sure.

808
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Someone will do it.

809
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Someone will do it at some point.

810
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 For the 20th anniversary, they'll come up with all feathers on every dinosaur.

811
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 For lots of raptors, I think.

812
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And lots of raptors were tiny, weren't they?

813
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 They were the size of, I think, large chickens or small dogs.

814
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Some were in between those two.

815
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Yeah.

816
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Plout juice.

817
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Do you know what that is?

818
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Plout juice.

819
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Plout juice.

820
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Yeah.

821
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Rain.

822
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Well, yeah, it is pretty much.

823
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 You're in your fancy words.

824
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 This is a Bolton thing.

825
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 No, it's not very much not.

826
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 It's bottled water that you can get in clarages.

827
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And they sell it in a menu like wine.

828
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And it's collected on a plastic roof on a tiny wind swept island off the Australian coast.

829
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And it's the most expensive bottled water ever to arrive in the UK.

830
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Wow.

831
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 How's it sold as being better?

832
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Because the trade winds come off the ocean and they're supposed to be much purer

833
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 because there isn't any pollution on the rain.

834
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Wait, doesn't it?

835
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Because it's just H2O.

836
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Yeah.

837
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 There are ways of purifying water.

838
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 You just need to boil it and condense it.

839
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And then you've got no impurities at all.

840
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Yeah.

841
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Yet we have this idealized water in our heads.

842
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Yeah.

843
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 But you could buy on some so badly.

844
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Yeah.

845
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Don't you guys want to taste that?

846
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 I bet it's great.

847
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 It's all got a clarages.

848
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Let's get sushi on the way.

849
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I want to do this thing.

850
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Yeah.

851
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Let me be swimming in cladjuice.

852
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Cladjuice.

853
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 It doesn't sound nice though.

854
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 It's not a nice name.

855
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Yeah.

856
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Why do they call it cladjuice?

857
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Cloud water.

858
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Lovely.

859
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Cloud juice.

860
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Yeah.

861
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 It's a cladgy.

862
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 It's a sky muck.

863
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 But there's also, you could get beer where the water comes from glaciers

864
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 and that's supposed to be like better and purer.

865
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Oh, like ice wine as well.

866
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Which is wine where the grapes are frozen.

867
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And so all the sugar is pushed into the remaining bit of the grape, which isn't frozen.

868
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And then you crush that grape.

869
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Right.

870
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 So it makes them much sweeter wine.

871
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Okay.

872
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 So have you heard of cloud nine?

873
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Yes.

874
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Yeah.

875
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Yeah.

876
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Well, this is really cool.

877
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Cloud nine is not the highest most elegant floaty cloud there is.

878
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 Cloud nine is actually at the very bottom of the height scale in the international cloud atlas.

879
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 It's like high fog, essentially.

880
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Oh, absolutely.

881
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 It's cool.

882
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 It's cumuloneimbus.

883
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 So cumulus of the fluffy ones nimble so rainy.

884
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 And that's cloud nine.

885
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Yeah, yeah.

886
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 If you want really high elegant clouds, you want cloud zero, which is cirrus.

887
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And that's the stuff which is just ice crystals in the sky.

888
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 It's just millions of ice crystals flying together.

889
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Yeah.

890
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Did they like change the numbers or something?

891
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Is that why we say cloud nine is...

892
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 No.

893
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 So they were all...

894
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 So the famous system was invented by a scientist called Luke Howard.

895
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Yeah.

896
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Which is all the lesser names, cumulus, nimble, stratus.

897
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Cirrus is lovely.

898
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 It means a curl of hair.

899
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Oh.

900
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 It's really out.

901
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Because it looks beautiful like that.

902
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,600
 But he came up with the system and the poet Gehrther was so impressed with this incredible

903
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,720
 classification job that he dedicated four whole poems to him and he praised him for bestowing

904
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,640
 form on the formless and a system of order to change on a boundless world.

905
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,080
 You know, back in the day, when there weren't names of different types of clouds.

906
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
 But this is really cool.

907
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,280
 The year before Luke Howard came up with his, that was 1802.

908
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,320
 There was another French scientist called Jean-Baptiste Lamarque.

909
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,160
 He came up with the system.

910
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,660
 And he came up with his when he was ill in bed looking at the clouds floating past his window.

911
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:56,440
 And they had Onvoile, which means hazy, atrupe, mast, pomley, which means dappled, and groupie,

912
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
 which means grouped.

913
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,640
 Was that the same Lamarque who came up with evolution at the same time as Darwin?

914
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
 Yeah.

915
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
 The same guy.

916
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
 He was off on a couple of things.

917
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
 Yeah.

918
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,160
 But unfortunately, no one paid any attention to his system in the next year along comes

919
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,400
 fancy boy with his Latin and the way you go.

920
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,800
 They believed him about, you know, giraffes stretching their next out until they were along.

921
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
 Yeah.

922
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
 When people bought that for a while, right?

923
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
 Yeah, yeah.

924
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
 They're still some people.

925
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,200
 They're still some people who think that Lamarque is going to come back one day.

926
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
 What?

927
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,160
 There was some studies like, in the last few years, that mice can pass their memories onto

928
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,960
 their grandchildren.

929
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,640
 And if that was true, that would be Lamarque's own box.

930
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
 That Lamarque's own.

931
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
 Right.

932
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
 Right.

933
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
 Yeah, it's such a mad idea.

934
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,640
 It has to pass on learned trade-offs.

935
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
 It was fear, wasn't it?

936
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,400
 They associated a particular smell with fear and two generations on the mice, which had had

937
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,640
 no contact with their grandparents, exhibited the same fear, which is, if true, unbelievable.

938
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,240
 So it's not, but it's not like us getting, you know, you and me suddenly talking about

939
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
 the war.

940
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,080
 No, no, no, but the fear had altered their, just like no, those memories came down.

941
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,400
 No, but the fear had altered their genes.

942
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,440
 So they were afraid of the smell of, I think it was lavender.

943
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:14,160
 So they were afraid of experiment, a lot of experiment is they hooked a mouse's, they hooked

944
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,760
 his pleasure sensors in his brain with an electrode to a button, which he could press

945
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,240
 in order to send a jolt of engulfants into his system.

946
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,360
 And he kept, you know, predictably, he kept pressing the button.

947
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,400
 And he pressed it so incessantly that he forgot to eat and he forgot to drink.

948
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,920
 And his limbs eventually atrophied to the point where he had to just press it with his face.

949
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
 Oh my God.

950
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,840
 And then he died ultimately of starvation.

951
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
 And no one stepped in?

952
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
 No, they just let him go with it.

953
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
 Oh my God.

954
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,960
 It just sounds like one of the saw movies or something.

955
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
 Yeah.

956
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,480
 And then I read another one about, they took a bunch of mice and they played them classical

957
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,800
 music and they took a bunch of other mice and they played them rock and roll and they mixed

958
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,360
 them together and the rock mice ate the classical mice.

959
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
 Okay.

960
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
 Should we wrap up on this?

961
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,520
 Anna, have you got, have you got anything you want to add?

962
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,800
 So the largest dinosaur ever found has been discovered.

963
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,800
 It weighed as much, they estimate, as 14 African elephants.

964
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,080
 It's seven tons heavier than the previous record holder.

965
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
 Why?

966
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
 It was found in Argentina.

967
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
 So it's pretty impressive.

968
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,640
 And it's about 20 meters tall, which reminded me of a thing I read and I think it was

969
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
 a new scientist blog.

970
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,920
 If anyone saw the first episode of this series of Doctor Who where the T-Rex was the same height

971
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
 as Big Ben.

972
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
 Oh yeah.

973
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,840
 The largest known specimen of a T-Rex that we have is four meters and Big Ben is 96.

974
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
 So.

975
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
 Okay.

976
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,840
 That's it.

977
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,840
 That's all of our facts.

978
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
 Thanks everyone for listening.

979
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:58,440
 If you want to get in contact with any of us about the things we've been talking about

980
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,760
 on this podcast, you can reach most of us on Twitter.

981
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,040
 I can be got on @shriverland andy @andruhunterem.

982
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
 James.

983
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
 That's egg-shaped.

984
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,840
 Simon, you're not on Twitter are you?

985
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
 No, no, guys.

986
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
 Sorry.

987
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
 Oh my god.

988
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
 How?

989
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
 Why?

990
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,640
 You know, I just, yeah, I just, it's just my level of coolness.

991
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
 It's just too high.

992
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,280
 I just know I would consume my entire life if I was on social media so I just steer clear

993
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
 of all of it.

994
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
 Fair enough.

995
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,120
 If you can't get him online but you can get him in bookshops, that's a good word.

996
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,120
 Yeah, so Spoilt Bratz is out now, but also all of his books, Last Girl Front on Earth, Elliott

997
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
 Alligash.

998
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
 What in God's name?

999
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
 Yep.

1000
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,800
 And then there's two in America, if you're listening in America, there is free range chickens

1001
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
 and ant form.

1002
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
 Could you remember as well?

1003
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
 That's amazing.

1004
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
 There's no notes in front of them.

1005
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
 He's just doing this.

1006
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
 Yes.

1007
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
 I remember.

1008
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
 I really appreciate that.

1009
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
 I've read all the books.

1010
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,040
 I'm, this is not a lie, I'm a massive fan.

1011
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,640
 I think he's the best comedy writer out there at the moment.

1012
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,600
 So get Simon's books.

1013
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,920
 You can find us all on Twitter, Anna, you're not on Twitter still.

1014
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,720
 Yeah, I like the fact we discussed this a lot and no one's ever suggested that I'm too

1015
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,160
 cool to be on Twitter over the 20 episodes we've had.

1016
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
 Not cool enough.

1017
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
 Not cool enough.

1018
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
 Yeah.

1019
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
 Double standards.

1020
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
 Okay, that's it for this week.

1021
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,080
 We're going to be back again next week than another episode.

1022
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
 No such thing as a fish.

1023
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,000
 Go to our website and you can find all previous episodes and we'll be back again.

1024
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Yeah.

1025
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 In seven days.

1026
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 See you then.

1027
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Bye.
