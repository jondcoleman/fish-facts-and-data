00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:24,00:00:27,James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.
00:00:27,00:00:28,"And once again, we have gathered"
00:00:28,00:00:30,around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:30,00:00:32,from the last seven days.
00:00:32,00:00:34,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:37,00:00:40,- The beep was invented in 1957.
00:00:40,00:00:41,- Was it?
00:00:41,00:00:42,"- No, well."
00:00:42,00:00:43,(laughing)
00:00:43,00:00:47,So I got this from an article which I won't name
00:00:47,00:00:48,because it turns out now to be incorrect.
00:00:48,00:00:53,"But basically, it's about the beep that happened"
00:00:53,00:00:56,"on the Sputnik satellite, it was launched in 1957."
00:00:56,00:00:59,"And really annoyingly, Anna has found about 58 examples"
00:00:59,00:01:03,of beeps dating back to the mid-40th century.
00:01:03,00:01:05,"And it's just like, welcome back, Anna."
00:01:05,00:01:06,- Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.
00:01:06,00:01:07,- She's awesome.
00:01:07,00:01:08,"- Yeah, we didn't get this from Maisie Adler,"
00:01:08,00:01:10,but I tell you that much.
00:01:10,00:01:12,"Listened politely to the fact, I didn't question it."
00:01:12,00:01:14,"But it certainly, the beep became popular"
00:01:14,00:01:18,and a big thing about Sputnik was the fact that it beeped.
00:01:18,00:01:19,"And in fact, I think, I think,"
00:01:19,00:01:21,that's all Sputnik could do.
00:01:21,00:01:22,"- Pretty much what it did, yeah."
00:01:22,00:01:24,"- Yeah, it was the size of a big pumpkin"
00:01:24,00:01:26,and it was a ball of aluminium or metal
00:01:26,00:01:27,and it just flew around.
00:01:27,00:01:28,- I would say the main thing it could do
00:01:28,00:01:31,was go around the earth in orbit.
00:01:31,00:01:33,Like the beep was secondary almost.
00:01:33,00:01:34,- Yeah.
00:01:34,00:01:35,"- You're right, you're right."
00:01:35,00:01:37,The main thing was it could fly around the world.
00:01:37,00:01:37,That's true.
00:01:37,00:01:39,But no one would have known if it wasn't beeping.
00:01:39,00:01:40,- Yes.
00:01:40,00:01:42,- Because it was broadcasting radio pulses.
00:01:42,00:01:45,"It was orbited the earth every hour and a half, roughly."
00:01:45,00:01:47,It beeped for 21 days only.
00:01:47,00:01:50,But the beep was seen as quite spooky
00:01:50,00:01:51,'cause you could hear it.
00:01:51,00:01:53,How radio people could tune in and listen to Sputnik.
00:01:53,00:01:54,- Amazing.
00:01:54,00:01:57,"- Life magazine said it was an eerie, intermittent croak."
00:01:57,00:01:59,And for a fair number of people--
00:01:59,00:02:00,"- Doesn't sound like a beep, actually, does it?"
00:02:00,00:02:01,"- No, if you--"
00:02:01,00:02:02,"- I guess if you don't know what a beep is,"
00:02:02,00:02:05,'cause it's only been mentioned five million times
00:02:05,00:02:06,in history.
00:02:06,00:02:09,- I guess for a few people it would have been
00:02:09,00:02:11,the first electronic beep that heard.
00:02:11,00:02:13,"- Pretty amazing, really."
00:02:13,00:02:15,"And it was the beep that changed the world, right?"
00:02:15,00:02:17,"Because suddenly the Americans were like,"
00:02:17,00:02:19,"oh shit, Russia's in space."
00:02:19,00:02:21,This is evidence 'cause we can hear it beeping.
00:02:21,00:02:23,We're gonna have to do something about that.
00:02:23,00:02:25,And then they decided to create NASA and go to the moon.
00:02:25,00:02:26,- Yeah.
00:02:26,00:02:28,- There's a theory that if the Soviets hadn't launched
00:02:28,00:02:31,"Sputnik, or America had launched the first satellite,"
00:02:31,00:02:34,then you wouldn't have had the moon program in the same way.
00:02:34,00:02:34,- I'm sure that's true.
00:02:34,00:02:36,- You might not have had Apollo.
00:02:36,00:02:37,'Cause it really frightened America.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"- Oh, definitely."
00:02:38,00:02:39,- Just literally a ball that went beep.
00:02:39,00:02:42,- But the other thing is the reason it was so shiny
00:02:42,00:02:44,"is 'cause they also, the idea was the guy Karlov"
00:02:44,00:02:46,"who created it or who designed it,"
00:02:46,00:02:48,he decided that he wanted it shiny
00:02:48,00:02:51,so that people will be able to see it in space.
00:02:51,00:02:52,But actually it was way too small
00:02:52,00:02:53,and no one could see it.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- Was it?
00:02:54,00:02:54,- Yeah.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"I mean, if you had a really good telescope, you could, but."
00:02:56,00:02:58,- I think you could at dawn and dusk.
00:02:58,00:03:00,Although you'd have to know where to be pointing.
00:03:00,00:03:02,It would probably be very hard to spot.
00:03:02,00:03:03,- Not really.
00:03:03,00:03:05,He wanted it to be quite a lot bigger as well
00:03:05,00:03:06,so that people will be able to see it.
00:03:06,00:03:09,- But it really did freak people out at the time.
00:03:09,00:03:13,"Even Kruschev said, ""Now we not only have a rocket"
00:03:13,00:03:14,"""that can fly to other countries,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,"""but we have a satellite that flies around the world."
00:03:16,00:03:19,"""I don't have to point to this with my finger."
00:03:19,00:03:20,"""Any idiot can see it."
00:03:20,00:03:22,"""They might as well put bombers and fighters"
00:03:22,00:03:23,"""in the museum."""
00:03:23,00:03:26,"He was just alluding to, ""We're now the superpower."""
00:03:26,00:03:28,"- It's nukes, isn't it, is what he's referring to."
00:03:28,00:03:29,If we can put that on there.
00:03:29,00:03:30,"- Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:30,00:03:32,- Our technology is sophisticated.
00:03:32,00:03:33,- And the Americans not long after
00:03:33,00:03:35,tried to send up their satellite.
00:03:35,00:03:35,That didn't work.
00:03:35,00:03:38,"It was called Kaputnik, I think they called it."
00:03:38,00:03:40,"Not the Americans, the Russians, making fun of it."
00:03:40,00:03:45,"- Yes, it was called the Vanguard."
00:03:45,00:03:45,- Yeah.
00:03:45,00:03:46,"- The Vanguard one, yeah."
00:03:46,00:03:48,And they sort of panicked after Sputnik.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"And it was, what, two months later?"
00:03:50,00:03:51,- Yeah.
00:03:51,00:03:52,- And it was so embarrassing.
00:03:52,00:03:54,It exploded on the launch pad.
00:03:54,00:03:56,Then it fired into a nearby swamp.
00:03:56,00:03:58,"But unfortunately, the firing into a swamp"
00:03:58,00:03:59,"had made the sensors on board think,"
00:03:59,00:04:01,"""Oh, great, we're in orbit."""
00:04:01,00:04:03,So then it just started beeping from the swamp.
00:04:03,00:04:05,So embarrassing.
00:04:05,00:04:06,It's just mortifying.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"- As well as Kaputnik, it was also known as"
00:04:08,00:04:11,"Flopnik, Pufnik, or Staputnik."
00:04:11,00:04:12,"- Staputnik, I love that."
00:04:12,00:04:13,- That's great.
00:04:13,00:04:15,- It's not often you think that Soviet Russia
00:04:15,00:04:16,was a really fun place to be.
00:04:16,00:04:17,"But I think for that week,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,it would have been a really fun place
00:04:19,00:04:20,to be hanging out in Russia.
00:04:20,00:04:21,- Just hilarious.
00:04:21,00:04:22,- Just comedy gold.
00:04:22,00:04:23,"Well, do you know why they didn't choose"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"the other project called Project Orbiter,"
00:04:26,00:04:30,which had more advanced technology within it?
00:04:30,00:04:33,"And it was run by someone, and here's your clue."
00:04:33,00:04:36,"It was run by Werner von Braun, who was,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,"would you, in German, you'd say brown, not brawn."
00:04:38,00:04:39,"- Oh, I thought it was brawn."
00:04:39,00:04:39,- You'd say brawn.
00:04:39,00:04:42,"- In English, he knows what brown is."
00:04:42,00:04:43,"- Well, I know him as von Braun."
00:04:43,00:04:44,- That's how I know him.
00:04:44,00:04:45,- Yeah.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"- So it was managed by Werner von Braun,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,who was a Nazi.
00:04:49,00:04:52,And the Americans thought it might be a bit awkward
00:04:52,00:04:55,if our first satellite that we get into space
00:04:55,00:04:56,was built by a Nazi.
00:04:56,00:04:59,"So he was a Nazi who was, at the end of the war,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,as were quite a few Nazi scientists.
00:05:01,00:05:04,He was taken on by America
00:05:04,00:05:06,so they could get Nick Nazi technology.
00:05:06,00:05:08,And so they started using his brain and then--
00:05:08,00:05:09,- And his brawn.
00:05:09,00:05:10,- And his brawn.
00:05:10,00:05:12,(laughing)
00:05:12,00:05:16,"- Okay, that's it."
00:05:16,00:05:19,- We can all go home now.
00:05:19,00:05:21,- I like one of the cultural things that happened with this
00:05:21,00:05:24,is that in the way that everything after Watergate
00:05:24,00:05:28,"became gate, Nick became popularized in Western cultures."
00:05:28,00:05:31,"So there was Peace Nick, there was Beat Nick,"
00:05:31,00:05:32,"Neat Nick, we're all different words,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,but Beat Nick is one that's really stuck out for us.
00:05:34,00:05:36,"- I thought it came from Ludnick,"
00:05:36,00:05:38,which is a Yiddish word meaning a bit of a--
00:05:38,00:05:39,"- It did, Nick was already used as--"
00:05:39,00:05:41,"- Nick was already being used, yes."
00:05:41,00:05:42,But it popularized it.
00:05:42,00:05:43,- It was popularized.
00:05:43,00:05:45,(laughing)
00:05:45,00:05:49,"- In Russian, Nick is just, it means a person."
00:05:49,00:05:51,"Like, as in, you know, someone called Nick."
00:05:51,00:05:53,Podcast Nick would be someone who makes podcasts.
00:05:53,00:05:55,"- Oh, that's cool, yeah."
00:05:55,00:05:56,- You know how we're saying it was a massive deal
00:05:56,00:05:58,"and you know, Khrushchev made this huge speech saying"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"we've conquered the world now, et cetera?"
00:06:00,00:06:01,- Yeah.
00:06:01,00:06:03,"- Well, they launched Sputnik"
00:06:03,00:06:06,and then no one really got that it was a big deal.
00:06:06,00:06:08,Khrushchev announced it to the cocktail party he was at
00:06:08,00:06:10,and everyone sort of politely clapped
00:06:10,00:06:11,and didn't understand it.
00:06:11,00:06:15,"Prafter, the next day, it was like a little thing"
00:06:15,00:06:17,way down on their front page.
00:06:17,00:06:19,- It was almost not on the front page.
00:06:19,00:06:20,- It was almost not on the front page.
00:06:20,00:06:21,- It got less prominent than Marshal Zukov
00:06:21,00:06:24,"visiting Yugoslavia, which arguably, in historical terms,"
00:06:24,00:06:25,turns out to have been a smaller story.
00:06:25,00:06:26,(laughing)
00:06:26,00:06:28,"- How interesting, so why did they do that?"
00:06:28,00:06:31,- But it was because of how the world reacted.
00:06:31,00:06:33,- It was 'cause the West reacted in the future.
00:06:33,00:06:35,It was the West assumed technological superiority.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"- The next day in Prafter, it was all over the headlines"
00:06:38,00:06:39,"because the U.S. had suddenly, you know,"
00:06:39,00:06:40,"the New York Times said,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,"""Oh my God, they've beaten us, we're flattened, we're ruined."""
00:06:42,00:06:45,"And Rush went, ""Oh, maybe this is a huge deal"
00:06:45,00:06:46,"""that we've done this, well done us."""
00:06:46,00:06:48,And then they got really excited about it.
00:06:48,00:06:50,- I did read a report saying Khrushchev announced it.
00:06:50,00:06:52,"Like, he got the news from the launchpad,"
00:06:52,00:06:53,"whatever, that it was in orbit,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,and smiled and was happy and announced it to the room
00:06:55,00:06:57,and then went to sleep that night.
00:06:57,00:06:59,But the alternative to that is him
00:06:59,00:07:01,remaining permanently awake for the rest of his life.
00:07:01,00:07:03,(laughing)
00:07:03,00:07:05,"- In America, there were lots of restaurants"
00:07:05,00:07:06,that released merch.
00:07:06,00:07:08,There was Sputnik Lollipops.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"There was a toy manufacturer, did a scooter,"
00:07:11,00:07:12,"which was just the same scooter,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,but they called it Pednik.
00:07:14,00:07:17,There were spherical containers that held ice creams.
00:07:17,00:07:18,They would put antennas on top
00:07:18,00:07:21,"so that you would have the straw as the Sputnik kind of,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,"look, 'cause they had antennae that were coming out."
00:07:23,00:07:26,"- Yeah, so the Lollipops have multiple stalks."
00:07:26,00:07:27,"- I reckon the pole is-- - Stalks, poles."
00:07:27,00:07:29,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:07:29,00:07:30,"- It had multiple antennae, right?"
00:07:30,00:07:31,Did it have two or four?
00:07:31,00:07:32,"- Four, I think."
00:07:32,00:07:33,"- Four. - Yeah, that's true."
00:07:33,00:07:34,"- That's really hard to eat a lollipop,"
00:07:34,00:07:35,which has got four sticks sticking in it.
00:07:35,00:07:36,- Yeah. - Or four people
00:07:36,00:07:39,can eat it at the same time or hold one stick
00:07:39,00:07:41,and then lick it. (laughing)
00:07:41,00:07:42,No?
00:07:42,00:07:44,How many kids have you got done?
00:07:44,00:07:45,"Three kids. - Three, yeah."
00:07:45,00:07:47,- If you could have one lollipop that you'd buy them
00:07:47,00:07:48,and all three of them could eat it.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"- You contain them, they'd be in one location."
00:07:50,00:07:51,(laughing)
00:07:51,00:07:53,"- I don't know, I think, sorry,"
00:07:53,00:07:55,"but if they're all licking one lollipop at the same time,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,people are gonna think they're snogging.
00:07:57,00:07:58,(laughing)
00:07:58,00:08:00,"And so do services, we'll get 'em for home."
00:08:00,00:08:02,"I mean, that's true."
00:08:02,00:08:03,"And then the next thing that happened,"
00:08:03,00:08:06,"so obviously America's smashed back on its heels,"
00:08:06,00:08:09,"it's reeling, the next thing happens, Sputnik II."
00:08:09,00:08:11,And this one's big and it's got a dog on it.
00:08:11,00:08:12,"- Yeah. - And that's, you know,"
00:08:12,00:08:12,it's like that.
00:08:12,00:08:14,"- And that was when they invented the bark, wasn't it?"
00:08:14,00:08:18,(laughing)
00:08:18,00:08:19,"- And that was Paul Bloody Leica,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,who had a pretty rotten time in space
00:08:21,00:08:24,and then sort of conked out.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"- Which means barker, in fact, Leica, isn't it?"
00:08:26,00:08:27,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:27,00:08:28,- I think she was causing me else.
00:08:28,00:08:29,- What all this was leading up to
00:08:29,00:08:32,was the 40th anniversary of the Soviet Union
00:08:32,00:08:34,"being founded, right, 'cause it's 1957,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,"October, October Revolution, all of that stuff,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,"November, depending on the calendar."
00:08:38,00:08:41,"Anyway, there was a theory in the West"
00:08:41,00:08:44,"that the Soviet Union was launching a third Sputnik,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,which was going to go to the moon
00:08:46,00:08:48,with a hydrogen bomb on it.
00:08:48,00:08:49,- And an elephant.
00:08:49,00:08:50,(laughing)
00:08:50,00:08:52,"- And there was a lunar eclipse coming up,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"so the moon was going to be completely blotted out,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"you know, in the shadow of the sun,"
00:08:56,00:08:58,"or shadow of the earth, sorry."
00:08:58,00:09:00,So the theory was that they were gonna detonate
00:09:00,00:09:01,the bomb against the moon
00:09:01,00:09:03,"and create a kind of super full moon,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,'cause it would be even brighter than a normal full moon
00:09:05,00:09:07,"with this, you know."
00:09:07,00:09:08,"And anyway, they weren't doing that."
00:09:08,00:09:10,"- Well, they did do lots of Sputnik,"
00:09:10,00:09:11,"well, Sputnik just means satellite,"
00:09:11,00:09:15,"so anything that they send up is a Sputnik, basically."
00:09:15,00:09:17,"But yeah, they've done 20 odd, I think, now."
00:09:17,00:09:19,- But none of them have been the moon blowing up.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"No, which was a stupid idea."
00:09:21,00:09:23,I don't even think I'd know if I saw something
00:09:23,00:09:24,"that was a bit brighter and a bit bigger than the moon,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,'cause you haven't got the actual moon to compare it to.
00:09:27,00:09:28,"- Yeah, maybe."
00:09:28,00:09:30,"- Well, it would be a full moon for a second"
00:09:30,00:09:31,as the detonation happened.
00:09:31,00:09:32,You would think something was up.
00:09:32,00:09:34,"- Every now and then, like once every month or so,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,do you not go outside and go up?
00:09:36,00:09:37,The moon's quite big tonight.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:09:38,00:09:40,"It's a certain time of day, isn't it?"
00:09:40,00:09:42,"Yeah, do you think that's always a Sputnik?"
00:09:42,00:09:43,- I think that's it.
00:09:43,00:09:46,"Every morning, when the moon is near the horizon,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,that's the Russians blowing it up.
00:09:48,00:09:51,"- Oh, I think they're wasting a lot of resources on this."
00:09:51,00:09:54,"- Yuri Gagarin, first man to orbit the Earth?"
00:09:54,00:09:55,- Yep.
00:09:55,00:09:56,- Cosmonauts? - First man in space.
00:09:56,00:09:56,- First man in space.
00:09:56,00:09:57,- Was he?
00:09:57,00:09:59,"I thought someone had gone up a bit before that, but not."
00:09:59,00:10:01,- Gone past the carman line.
00:10:01,00:10:02,- He was the first.
00:10:02,00:10:03,- That space.
00:10:03,00:10:04,"- Yuri's, yeah, acknowledged as first."
00:10:04,00:10:06,- I'm a carman waiting in the sky.
00:10:06,00:10:08,Was originally written about that.
00:10:08,00:10:13,"- He was five foot two,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,which means that he would only just qualify it
00:10:15,00:10:17,to be an air stewardess on Ryanair.
00:10:17,00:10:18,- Right.
00:10:18,00:10:18,- But.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- Which was his dream, wasn't it?"
00:10:20,00:10:21,- It's what he was trying to do all that time.
00:10:21,00:10:23,He was just trying to get the attention of Michael O'Leary.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"- I mean, it was really bad."
00:10:24,00:10:26,"Because the first time he went in space,"
00:10:26,00:10:28,"it was one thing, but he had to pay for his seat."
00:10:31,00:10:33,- And you know the space dogs?
00:10:33,00:10:34,- The Soviet ones.
00:10:34,00:10:34,- Lika?
00:10:34,00:10:35,- Lika.
00:10:35,00:10:39,"Well, there's an argument that they preserved peace"
00:10:39,00:10:41,"and stopped the world from imploding,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,exploding due to nuclear attack.
00:10:43,00:10:45,And here is the argument.
00:10:45,00:10:48,"So in 1960, the Soviets sent up some more dogs."
00:10:48,00:10:50,They were called Belka and Strelka.
00:10:50,00:10:53,And they went into orbit with some rats
00:10:53,00:10:55,and a rabbit and some flies.
00:10:55,00:10:58,And they orbited the world 17 times
00:10:58,00:11:01,and they came back down and they were big celebrities.
00:11:01,00:11:02,They had chat shows and stuff.
00:11:02,00:11:04,- Who had chat shows?
00:11:04,00:11:06,- I don't think they actually hosted their own chat shows.
00:11:06,00:11:06,Sorry.
00:11:06,00:11:08,I think they might have just guessed it.
00:11:08,00:11:11,They wrote in a small segment.
00:11:11,00:11:12,- But hosting is a good idea.
00:11:12,00:11:14,Every week the guest has to feed Belka and Strelka.
00:11:14,00:11:15,I think that's a really nice idea.
00:11:15,00:11:16,- Lovely.
00:11:16,00:11:18,Let's pitch it.
00:11:18,00:11:20,It's our next commission.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"Anyway, so they were the first dogs who survived"
00:11:22,00:11:24,'cause some people were a bit sad that Lika didn't.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"Anyway, soon after that, JFK and Kristoff"
00:11:27,00:11:30,"and their wives had a meeting, a summit,"
00:11:30,00:11:34,in Vienna and it was awkward as things often were
00:11:34,00:11:37,at the time between America and the USSR.
00:11:37,00:11:39,And then Jackie Kennedy broke the tension
00:11:39,00:11:40,"by saying to Kristoff,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,"""Oh, what happened to those two lovely dogs"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"""that you sent into space, by the way?"""
00:11:44,00:11:46,"And Kristoff said, ""Oh, they actually had puppies."
00:11:46,00:11:48,"""Do you want one?"""
00:11:48,00:11:49,And he posted to her.
00:11:49,00:11:50,So a few weeks later--
00:11:50,00:11:51,(laughing)
00:11:51,00:11:53,"- It arrived, unfortunately."
00:11:53,00:11:56,Not quite as alive as it was in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
00:11:56,00:11:57,(laughing)
00:11:57,00:12:02,"Oh no, he put the bubble wrap in the envelope and it was fine."
00:12:02,00:12:04,"Yeah, so a puppy arrived at the White House."
00:12:04,00:12:06,- Were they called pupnics?
00:12:06,00:12:08,- I actually think they might have called them pupnics.
00:12:08,00:12:08,- That would make sense.
00:12:08,00:12:09,- That rings a bell.
00:12:09,00:12:10,It would make sense.
00:12:10,00:12:11,I think they had the same sense of humor as you did
00:12:11,00:12:13,in the White House at the time.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"- Okay, I'm just gonna collect Spot the Dog."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"- Oh yeah, Spotnick."
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Suggestions.
00:12:17,00:12:17,- Mudnick.
00:12:17,00:12:18,Mudnick.
00:12:18,00:12:19,There we go.
00:12:19,00:12:20,"- Yeah, very good."
00:12:20,00:12:21,- Mudnick.
00:12:21,00:12:22,"- Just edit out my one,"
00:12:22,00:12:22,you got three really good ones.
00:12:22,00:12:25,(laughing)
00:12:26,00:12:29,- So keep that comment in so everyone will always want that.
00:12:29,00:12:30,Write in with your speculations
00:12:30,00:12:33,as to Annie's shit suggestion.
00:12:33,00:12:35,(laughing)
00:12:35,00:12:38,"Anyway, he was a White House puppy pet"
00:12:38,00:12:40,and it really calmed things down.
00:12:40,00:12:41,"I mean, obviously things didn't remain calm"
00:12:41,00:12:43,for the subsequent 30 years.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- That's sad.
00:12:44,00:12:45,Yelka and Stelka are the only ones
00:12:45,00:12:47,that you learn about in Russian schools really.
00:12:47,00:12:49,They don't really mention Leica very much.
00:12:49,00:12:50,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:50,00:12:50,So sad.
00:12:50,00:12:51,"After Leica went up,"
00:12:51,00:12:53,dog lovers worldwide protested.
00:12:53,00:12:54,There was a march at the UN
00:12:54,00:12:57,with featuring dogs wearing protest signs.
00:12:57,00:12:58,- Wow.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"There was also a producer of a chat,"
00:12:59,00:13:01,"so I was like, what am I gonna do now?"
00:13:01,00:13:03,(laughing)
00:13:03,00:13:05,- Can we say a thing or two about Beeps?
00:13:05,00:13:07,"- Oh sure, yeah."
00:13:07,00:13:10,We don't have time to list all the previous Beeps
00:13:10,00:13:10,prior to this one.
00:13:10,00:13:12,- Let's see how far we get.
00:13:12,00:13:15,So this is a really fun thing about Beeps.
00:13:15,00:13:16,"Skodas, right, the cars."
00:13:16,00:13:17,- Oh yeah.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"- The horns get tested, don't they?"
00:13:18,00:13:20,Car horns get tested.
00:13:20,00:13:22,And these days they're tested way more
00:13:22,00:13:23,in the development process
00:13:23,00:13:24,than they ever have been before.
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Okay.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"- So Skodas in the '70s were tested 50,000 times"
00:13:27,00:13:29,to make sure they wouldn't run out of Beeps
00:13:29,00:13:31,after that.
00:13:31,00:13:34,"- Sorry, you beeped a horn 50,000 times"
00:13:34,00:13:35,before selling the car.
00:13:35,00:13:36,- I don't think.
00:13:36,00:13:37,(laughing)
00:13:37,00:13:39,"- You beeped it 50,000 first and it ran out."
00:13:39,00:13:39,"- No, no, no."
00:13:39,00:13:40,- You do that in the car dealership.
00:13:40,00:13:41,(laughing)
00:13:41,00:13:42,I'm just gonna go quick.
00:13:42,00:13:43,(laughing)
00:13:43,00:13:44,That doesn't happen.
00:13:44,00:13:44,"- 50,000."
00:13:44,00:13:46,- Every car that Skoda sells.
00:13:46,00:13:46,(laughing)
00:13:46,00:13:47,- Okay.
00:13:47,00:13:48,- It happens.
00:13:48,00:13:50,- It happens in the development process.
00:13:50,00:13:52,- 'Cause I have a Skoda and I've got this big handprint
00:13:52,00:13:54,in the middle of my steering wheel.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- Everyone's dry.
00:13:55,00:13:56,- Do they not crash test every car
00:13:56,00:13:57,before they sell that there's one?
00:13:57,00:13:59,(laughing)
00:13:59,00:14:00,Just gonna drive this into a wall
00:14:00,00:14:02,"before we send it to you, sir?"
00:14:02,00:14:03,(laughing)
00:14:03,00:14:04,- So no.
00:14:04,00:14:05,"- Sorry, yeah."
00:14:05,00:14:06,- They test it.
00:14:06,00:14:07,"- But these days, electric Skodas,"
00:14:07,00:14:09,"they get 150,000."
00:14:09,00:14:11,But that's regionally specific.
00:14:11,00:14:14,"And when they sell cars in India,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,"they're tested 500,000 times."
00:14:16,00:14:17,- What?
00:14:17,00:14:18,"- 'Cause in India, use of the car horn is way bigger."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Like, everyone is beeping all the time."
00:14:20,00:14:23,So they have to test half a million honks before.
00:14:23,00:14:24,- Wow.
00:14:24,00:14:25,"- I was saying in India,"
00:14:25,00:14:29,like they do honk in the way you're supposed to honk.
00:14:29,00:14:31,As the only time you're ever supposed to honk
00:14:31,00:14:33,"is if someone, to let someone know"
00:14:33,00:14:35,you're there to stop an accident.
00:14:35,00:14:36,- Right.
00:14:36,00:14:37,"- If you drive in India,"
00:14:37,00:14:40,they're doing that because they're about to drive into you
00:14:40,00:14:41,and they're honking and stuff.
00:14:41,00:14:43,"They don't do it in the UK like honk, honk,"
00:14:43,00:14:45,"the traffic light's gone, you need to move."
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- Oh, yeah, that's true."
00:14:47,00:14:48,- They do proper honking in India.
00:14:48,00:14:50,- I think you're also encouraged to honk
00:14:50,00:14:51,as a way of saying goodbye to somebody
00:14:51,00:14:53,"not gonna see you for a few weeks, aren't you?"
00:14:53,00:14:56,"- That's actually, yeah, that's the only other time."
00:14:56,00:14:57,- Is that the highway cut?
00:14:57,00:14:58,"- It's in the highway cut, is it?"
00:14:58,00:14:59,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:59,00:15:01,"- And also honk if you love blah,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,whatever's on the sign at the side of the line.
00:15:03,00:15:04,That's important too.
00:15:04,00:15:05,(laughing)
00:15:05,00:15:08,"- So when buying a car, as well as asking for mileage,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"you should ask for a honkage, is that what we're saying?"
00:15:10,00:15:11,"- How many honks you've got,"
00:15:11,00:15:13,how many honks you've packed into this bad boy?
00:15:13,00:15:15,(laughing)
00:15:15,00:15:17,(upbeat music)
00:15:17,00:15:20,(upbeat music)
00:15:20,00:15:23,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:23,00:15:24,and that is James.
00:15:24,00:15:27,"- Okay, my fact this week is that William Gladstone"
00:15:27,00:15:29,once canceled an evening engagement
00:15:29,00:15:33,so he could binge on the latest popular drama series.
00:15:33,00:15:35,(laughing)
00:15:35,00:15:37,"So this is William Gladstone,"
00:15:37,00:15:40,"who was a British prime minister,"
00:15:40,00:15:45,and quite famously quite door and serious and whatever.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"So I quite like the idea of him,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,"you know, watching Breaking Bad or whatever."
00:15:50,00:15:52,But obviously this wasn't that.
00:15:52,00:15:55,"This was The Woman in White,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,"which was a story by Wilkie Collins,"
00:15:58,00:16:02,which was originally done in...
00:16:02,00:16:03,- Cereals.
00:16:03,00:16:06,- It was originally sold in breakfast cereals.
00:16:06,00:16:07,(laughing)
00:16:07,00:16:10,So it was a free gift at the bottom of our flex boxes.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"And it was originally done in cereals, in magazines,"
00:16:12,00:16:15,"and then the entire book came out in 1860, I think,"
00:16:15,00:16:19,"1859, 1860, and he got it and he wanted to read it."
00:16:19,00:16:21,So he just canceled his...
00:16:21,00:16:22,- I love it.
00:16:22,00:16:23,- It's so great. - I love it.
00:16:23,00:16:24,Imagine...
00:16:24,00:16:26,"- What if he was taking a date, though?"
00:16:26,00:16:27,Do you still love it?
00:16:27,00:16:28,- Oh!
00:16:28,00:16:29,"- What if the date went to the theater,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"and I was like, ""Where's Willie?"""
00:16:31,00:16:31,(laughing)
00:16:31,00:16:33,- He's with Wilkie.
00:16:33,00:16:34,- He's with William Wilkie.
00:16:34,00:16:35,- You don't get...
00:16:35,00:16:36,What's he called Wilkie?
00:16:36,00:16:37,What's that his name?
00:16:37,00:16:38,"- He knows his middle name,"
00:16:38,00:16:39,so he was William Wilkie Collins.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"- Okay, but I'm just saying you don't get Wilkie's anymore."
00:16:41,00:16:44,"- Well, actually, he wanted to be called Wilkie,"
00:16:44,00:16:48,"so he insisted that you never call him Mr. Collins,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,or you never call him William Collins or whatever.
00:16:50,00:16:54,He insisted that everyone just called him Cher or Madonna.
00:16:54,00:16:55,He was just Wilkie.
00:16:55,00:16:56,- Really?
00:16:56,00:16:57,"- Well, 'cause his dad and his grandfather,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,"I think, were both Williams as well."
00:16:59,00:17:00,So I think it was one of those cases
00:17:00,00:17:02,"where the middle name suddenly became the first name,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,and it was an honorary first name.
00:17:04,00:17:06,- But I think he wanted us to drop the surname as well.
00:17:06,00:17:08,We should just be saying Wilkie.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"- Well, that's what he wanted, but you know."
00:17:10,00:17:12,- I think we should do what shows him respect for the guy.
00:17:12,00:17:13,- Yeah.
00:17:13,00:17:15,- The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says
00:17:15,00:17:18,"it was typical of his dislike of formality,"
00:17:18,00:17:20,'cause he was quite an odd cookie.
00:17:20,00:17:24,"- He was a rum-cove, and he was rum."
00:17:24,00:17:25,Can we talk about the book quickly?
00:17:25,00:17:26,"- Yeah, let's do that."
00:17:26,00:17:29,"- 'Cause the book is, it's really good."
00:17:29,00:17:30,- Have you read it?
00:17:30,00:17:31,"- I have read it, I mean, years and years ago."
00:17:31,00:17:33,"- Yeah, I have, and I'm really excited to."
00:17:33,00:17:35,"- I've read ""The Woman in White"" and ""The Moonstone,"""
00:17:35,00:17:37,"and he wrote, I think, about 20 novels,"
00:17:37,00:17:38,and those are the two sort of big hits.
00:17:38,00:17:39,- I've read the first 50 pages
00:17:39,00:17:41,"'cause I bought it on Tuesday, and--"
00:17:41,00:17:42,- It's pretty good.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"- Really big, isn't it really big?"
00:17:44,00:17:45,"- Yeah, it's huge."
00:17:45,00:17:47,"- But they got paid by writing a chapter at a time,"
00:17:47,00:17:50,"so you would, you just, and so it came out in this magazine."
00:17:50,00:17:53,"It was a Dickens-owned magazine called ""All the Year Round,"""
00:17:53,00:17:55,"and when it was first published in chapter four,"
00:17:55,00:17:59,"chapter by chapter sales, went from 40,000 to 300,000."
00:17:59,00:18:01,"It was mega, it was so exciting."
00:18:01,00:18:04,- But it's weird that he caused Dickens's publication
00:18:04,00:18:06,"to become so popular, because he actually,"
00:18:06,00:18:08,"kind of, hero worshiped Dickens, didn't he?"
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Whereas really, Dickens should have been thanking him"
00:18:10,00:18:12,"for making his magazine, ""All Year Round,"""
00:18:12,00:18:13,"or whatever, go through the route."
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- Well, he was younger, he was a protege of Dickens,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,and then Dickens quickly fell in love with him
00:18:17,00:18:19,"and sort of the roles slightly reversed,"
00:18:19,00:18:22,where he sort of was inspired by Wilkie's writing.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"- But he did do this weird, like, Dickens tribute tour,"
00:18:26,00:18:27,'cause we've talked about Dickens traveling around the world
00:18:27,00:18:29,"and giving lectures, and then he immediately traveled"
00:18:29,00:18:31,around the world giving public readings
00:18:31,00:18:33,and going to the same locations that Dickens had.
00:18:33,00:18:34,- Wow. - I think he took holidays
00:18:34,00:18:37,at Dickens' favorite holiday resorts.
00:18:37,00:18:37,- Did he?
00:18:37,00:18:39,"And then they fell out, didn't they?"
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Did they?
00:18:40,00:18:43,"- They fell out because Charles Dickens' daughter, Kate,"
00:18:43,00:18:46,"married Wilkie Collins' brother, Charles."
00:18:46,00:18:47,- Oh!
00:18:47,00:18:48,"- And they really properly fell out,"
00:18:48,00:18:52,and then Collins started really slagging off all of his books.
00:18:52,00:18:54,He called Barnaby Road the weakest book
00:18:54,00:18:55,that Dickens ever wrote.
00:18:55,00:18:56,"- To be fair, that's true,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,and I don't think that's necessarily
00:18:58,00:18:59,"slagging off his books, is it?"
00:18:59,00:19:00,"- He was ranking them, he was ranking them."
00:19:00,00:19:01,"- He was ranking them, yeah."
00:19:01,00:19:03,- Imagine if I'd ranked all the episodes
00:19:03,00:19:05,"of this podcast in order, which I definitely haven't,"
00:19:05,00:19:06,so we should--
00:19:06,00:19:08,- He then went on to say that Dombie and son's
00:19:08,00:19:10,no intelligent person can have read it
00:19:10,00:19:12,without astonishment of the badness of it.
00:19:12,00:19:15,"- Yeah, I guess. - That's not good, yeah."
00:19:15,00:19:16,- Critique.
00:19:16,00:19:18,- He called in Edwin Drude the melancholy work
00:19:18,00:19:20,of a worn-out brain.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"- Oh, God, well, that was fun finish, that's unfair."
00:19:22,00:19:23,"- Yeah, and he must have said it"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"after Dickens died as well, right?"
00:19:26,00:19:28,"- Yeah, there's stories that he was asked to finish, Drude,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,'cause they thought that he knew Dickens so well
00:19:31,00:19:31,in the writing style.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"- Well, that's weird, 'cause Collins,"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"when he was writing a book called No Name,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"he got really ill, and Dickens offered to take over."
00:19:37,00:19:38,"He said, ""I know you don't need the help,"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"but if just in case you do want that finished,"
00:19:40,00:19:41,"I can do it for you."""
00:19:41,00:19:44,So they both were involved in that kind of project.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"That thing of them, so Dickens' daughter"
00:19:46,00:19:47,"marrying Wilkie Collins' brother,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,I guess they would have been the same age
00:19:49,00:19:50,'cause Collins was a much younger man.
00:19:50,00:19:53,But part of the reason that Dickens really didn't like
00:19:53,00:19:57,"the situation was that Wilkie Collins' brother, Charles,"
00:19:57,00:20:01,"was apparently a complete, just like milk toast, wet blanket."
00:20:01,00:20:05,"- Well, he wasn't very wet because he refused to have baths"
00:20:05,00:20:08,"because he almost drowned when he was five years old,"
00:20:08,00:20:11,and he was petrified by water for the rest of his life
00:20:11,00:20:13,and wouldn't even get into a bath.
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Right.
00:20:14,00:20:15,"- Okay, that might have been part of it."
00:20:15,00:20:16,"But it's so weird, 'cause they looked, apparently,"
00:20:16,00:20:19,"both sibling and child Dickens' daughter, Katie,"
00:20:19,00:20:22,they both looked the most like.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"Like, Wilkie Collins' brother looked just like him,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,and Katie Dickens looked just like Charles Dickens.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"- Oh, really, okay."
00:20:27,00:20:29,"- She had their little goatee beard, didn't she?"
00:20:29,00:20:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:31,00:20:31,- Yeah.
00:20:31,00:20:32,- That's very funny.
00:20:32,00:20:35,- They met through a bloke called Augustus Egg.
00:20:35,00:20:36,"That was their mutual friend, I know."
00:20:36,00:20:38,- Who did Wilkie and Dickens with her?
00:20:38,00:20:40,"- Dickens and Collins, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:40,00:20:43,"And they went on holiday with Egg,"
00:20:43,00:20:45,"and Collins lectured Egg on art,"
00:20:45,00:20:48,and hummed opera airs incorrectly and interminably
00:20:48,00:20:49,was the report.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"- The meeting of those two,"
00:20:50,00:20:51,they actually met because they were acting
00:20:51,00:20:53,"in the same play at the time, right?"
00:20:53,00:20:55,So Dickens brought him onto a production.
00:20:55,00:20:59,"- The play that they met in was by Edward Bill Williton,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"who wrote, ""It was a dark and stormy night."""
00:21:01,00:21:02,He's the guy who wrote that sentence.
00:21:02,00:21:03,- Yes.
00:21:03,00:21:04,- And this is the great thing.
00:21:04,00:21:04,"Okay, so this looks back to the woman in white"
00:21:04,00:21:07,because Bill Williton hated the woman in white.
00:21:07,00:21:09,He said it was great trash.
00:21:09,00:21:10,"I think he meant big trash rather than like,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,"""Oh, it's great trash,"" you know?"
00:21:12,00:21:15,"And the point is that Bill Williton had had his wife,"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"Rosina, committed to an asylum a couple of years before,"
00:21:18,00:21:21,and that plotline is in the woman in white.
00:21:21,00:21:22,- That's how interesting.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- And all of Collins' works in some way.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"Loads of them are about women being mistreated by men,"
00:21:25,00:21:26,"or being, you know, like--"
00:21:26,00:21:28,- There's very much to spoil if you haven't read
00:21:28,00:21:29,"the woman in white, by the way."
00:21:29,00:21:30,"- Oh, yeah, that's right."
00:21:30,00:21:31,- Then let's start from the end at this stage.
00:21:31,00:21:33,"- Can I just say, I don't think we should be giving"
00:21:33,00:21:36,a spy list of classic words in this picture.
00:21:36,00:21:40,"- Yeah, but Collins dedicated the book to the man"
00:21:40,00:21:42,"who, the commissioner for lunacy was his title,"
00:21:42,00:21:45,who had helped release Rosina from the asylum.
00:21:45,00:21:45,- Really?
00:21:45,00:21:47,"- So obviously, Bill Williton hated the book"
00:21:47,00:21:49,because it was such a slam on him in a way.
00:21:49,00:21:52,"- It turns out, and yeah, that makes sense"
00:21:52,00:21:54,'cause I was reading an obituary of Wilkie Collins
00:21:54,00:21:56,"just after he died, and this friend of his who was writing it"
00:21:56,00:21:59,"said that when he wrote the woman in white,"
00:21:59,00:22:01,Collins had told him he received a letter
00:22:01,00:22:04,"from Rosina, Lytton's wife, who said,"
00:22:04,00:22:05,"""I really enjoyed your book,"
00:22:05,00:22:06,"""but I thought the villain,"" she said, ""Camp Fosco."
00:22:06,00:22:08,"""I thought the villain was a really poor villain,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"""not realistic at all, you know."
00:22:10,00:22:12,"""Next time if you want a villain, come to me."
00:22:12,00:22:15,"""I have my eyes upon a villain every minute of the day."
00:22:15,00:22:17,"""It is my husband."""
00:22:17,00:22:18,"- Oh, nice."
00:22:18,00:22:22,- So one of those things that happened
00:22:22,00:22:23,when the book came out is it was one of those things
00:22:23,00:22:26,"we've spoken about where when things take off,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,the merch just starts rolling in.
00:22:28,00:22:30,"You know, there was a waltz that was named after it."
00:22:30,00:22:31,"There were cloaks, there were hats."
00:22:31,00:22:34,Perfumes were made that were sort of like meant to be
00:22:34,00:22:36,the woman in white's perfume.
00:22:36,00:22:38,It was just full of merch around London.
00:22:38,00:22:40,- Walter became a fashionable name for babies
00:22:40,00:22:41,'cause there's a character named Walter.
00:22:41,00:22:42,"- Right, did it, that was the thing."
00:22:42,00:22:44,"- Yeah, Walter's the hero, isn't he?"
00:22:44,00:22:46,"The kind of slightly boring hero,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,and the heroine is slightly boring as well.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"- Wow, so I'm not allowed to spoiler the ending,"
00:22:50,00:22:51,but you're allowed to spoiler the fact
00:22:51,00:22:53,that people in it are slightly boring.
00:22:53,00:22:54,- Terrible.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"- It's not a spoiler, I think that's more of an opinion."
00:22:56,00:22:57,Do you know what really annoys me
00:22:57,00:22:59,about basically all adaptations?
00:22:59,00:23:00,"- And this applies to lots of stuff,"
00:23:00,00:23:03,but I'm gonna use the woman in white to vent.
00:23:03,00:23:07,There have been loads of films and TV series of it
00:23:07,00:23:10,"over the years, and the most recent was 2018 I saw"
00:23:10,00:23:13,"with Jesse Buckley in it, who's an attractive actress."
00:23:13,00:23:16,And the thing that I remember from the woman in white
00:23:16,00:23:19,is that there are these two quite extreme characters
00:23:19,00:23:20,who are the real good characters.
00:23:20,00:23:25,"There's Count Fosco, who's this hugely fat Italian villain,"
00:23:25,00:23:28,"and then there's Marion, who is very sharp,"
00:23:28,00:23:32,"very bright, very bold, and very ugly."
00:23:32,00:23:36,"She's got a moustache, she's got a huge masculine jaw."
00:23:36,00:23:38,"She's ugly enough that Walt was almost repulsed by her when,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,'cause she looks really attractive from behind.
00:23:40,00:23:45,It's one of those weird sort of '90s rom-com reveals.
00:23:45,00:23:49,"She turns around, and he's like, ""Oh, that face!"""
00:23:49,00:23:50,"- Is this ""Shallow Hell?"""
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Is ""Shallow Hell"" based on one of the words?"
00:23:51,00:23:54,(all laughing)
00:23:54,00:23:55,"- I think it must have been said, ""Shallow Hell."""
00:23:55,00:23:58,- Have you thought she looked attractive from behind?
00:23:58,00:24:00,"And yeah, every single adaptation, she's not ugly."
00:24:00,00:24:01,- How interesting.
00:24:01,00:24:03,Do you think that the actors
00:24:03,00:24:05,are taking away jobs from ugly actors?
00:24:05,00:24:06,- I genuinely do.
00:24:06,00:24:09,I really think that they are quite incredibly annoying.
00:24:09,00:24:13,"No, they sort of make themselves look a bit tomboyish."
00:24:13,00:24:16,And I think it's bullshit in entertainment today.
00:24:16,00:24:18,You don't do it with men.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"- No, they do fit people up a lot."
00:24:20,00:24:21,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:24:21,00:24:23,"- Well, they just pick a fit actress to play an ugly role,"
00:24:23,00:24:24,'cause they think that people can't handle
00:24:24,00:24:25,watching an unattractive woman.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"- Okay, yeah."
00:24:26,00:24:27,- Do they mention it in the dialogue?
00:24:27,00:24:30,"Like, as if people go up to her in the movie"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"and go, ""You're an ugly person."""
00:24:32,00:24:33,(all laughing)
00:24:33,00:24:35,And she's just then looking stunning.
00:24:35,00:24:38,"And I'm like, ""Oh, yes, I know this face."""
00:24:38,00:24:40,"Stop, I'm completely dark."
00:24:40,00:24:42,"- It does happen, the Jack Reacher books,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"those were adapted, and they put Tom Cruise in the role."
00:24:44,00:24:46,"And that was the biggest uproar about the whole thing,"
00:24:46,00:24:49,is that he's meant to be six foot 10.
00:24:49,00:24:51,He's meant to be hulkingly massive.
00:24:51,00:24:54,- And then you've got this. - That's just drastic miscasting.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"As in, obviously, Tom Cruise is brilliant,"
00:24:57,00:24:58,"but he doesn't look like Jack Reacher,"
00:24:58,00:25:01,who I think at one point stops a bullet with his chest.
00:25:01,00:25:03,(all laughing)
00:25:03,00:25:06,"I think at one point in the books, anyway."
00:25:06,00:25:07,"Can we talk a bit about ""Working Colourns?"""
00:25:07,00:25:09,- Yeah.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"- So his health situation was quite interesting,"
00:25:11,00:25:15,"because it was bad, he had bad health."
00:25:15,00:25:18,"If he had good health, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting."
00:25:18,00:25:19,- Unless it was really good.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"- One of it was so good, he was still alive."
00:25:20,00:25:21,- Then he'd be alive.
00:25:21,00:25:22,- Yeah.
00:25:22,00:25:25,"- As it was, he had neuralgia, rheumatism,"
00:25:25,00:25:28,"spasm suffocation, I don't think we know what that was,"
00:25:28,00:25:31,"gout in the eyes, a boil on his groin."
00:25:31,00:25:35,"At one point, his partner Caroline had to mesmerize his feet"
00:25:35,00:25:36,to try and cure them.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"- Oh, wow."
00:25:37,00:25:37,- Yeah.
00:25:37,00:25:38,- How do you mesmerize?
00:25:38,00:25:39,"We've talked about mesmerism before,"
00:25:39,00:25:40,but how do you do it to feet?
00:25:40,00:25:43,"- You know, when you sit down on your leg for too long,"
00:25:43,00:25:44,and it goes to sleep.
00:25:44,00:25:45,- Yeah.
00:25:45,00:25:46,- Is that it?
00:25:46,00:25:47,- It's gotta be that.
00:25:47,00:25:48,"Yeah, it's gotta be something like that."
00:25:48,00:25:50,- You just sat on them.
00:25:50,00:25:51,- I don't know.
00:25:51,00:25:51,"- 'Cause he had gout eyes,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,so he couldn't do it through mesmerizing his eyes.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"Like, they were really bunged up."
00:25:54,00:25:56,"- Well, you don't get gout in your eyes."
00:25:56,00:25:56,- That's what I thought.
00:25:56,00:25:58,"- No, I know, but when you read the descriptions"
00:25:58,00:25:59,"of what happened to his eyes,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,"they were bleeding, they were pussy, they were--"
00:26:01,00:26:02,"- But I believe, again,"
00:26:02,00:26:04,this is based on this obit written by his friend.
00:26:04,00:26:06,"He said that he went round to his house when he was older,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,"and he couldn't stop looking at his eyes,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,"'cause they looked so weird,"
00:26:09,00:26:12,and he couldn't really meet your eye properly.
00:26:12,00:26:13,"And eventually, Colin said,"
00:26:13,00:26:14,"""I see you're looking at my eyes."
00:26:14,00:26:15,"""I know it's distracting."
00:26:15,00:26:18,"""I've got gout eye,"" and the friend implies,"
00:26:18,00:26:19,"and we know this is a fact,"
00:26:19,00:26:21,that it's probably all the Lordenham he was taking.
00:26:21,00:26:22,"- Yeah, yeah, it's so neat."
00:26:22,00:26:24,"- His eyes to come up quite blurry, rather than--"
00:26:24,00:26:25,"- Oh, of course."
00:26:25,00:26:25,- It wasn't a disease of the eye.
00:26:25,00:26:27,He was just off his face all the time.
00:26:27,00:26:28,- It's gonna be great in his biopic
00:26:28,00:26:29,"when Tom Cruise is playing him,"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"and they're saying, ""Your eyes, they're horrible."""
00:26:31,00:26:32,(all laughing)
00:26:32,00:26:33,"- Apparently, he was taking enough"
00:26:33,00:26:36,to kill six people every day.
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Yeah.
00:26:37,00:26:38,- And he was also taking poppers
00:26:38,00:26:41,in about the same amount for his heart.
00:26:41,00:26:43,- Didn't see a student in the early 2000s.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"- Wait, did poppers, I didn't think poppers existed."
00:26:45,00:26:46,"- Well, I'm ill nitrate."
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- Oh, right."
00:26:47,00:26:48,"- So, yeah, that's--"
00:26:48,00:26:49,"- They didn't come in this fun,"
00:26:49,00:26:51,colorful packets that they do now.
00:26:51,00:26:53,"- I wouldn't know, actually."
00:26:53,00:26:55,(all laughing)
00:26:55,00:26:57,- And he was taking arsenic as well at the same time.
00:26:57,00:26:58,"- Oh, my God."
00:26:58,00:27:02,- All that meant that he saw ghosts all the time.
00:27:02,00:27:03,"- Oh, yeah."
00:27:03,00:27:05,"- Yeah, he thought he had a doppelganger,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"a ghost willky, that was with him."
00:27:07,00:27:08,"- And it was just a mirror, wasn't it?"
00:27:08,00:27:11,- How did he come up with that amazing name for the ghost?
00:27:11,00:27:12,- He's one of the best.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- Yeah, he would, like Dan says,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,"the doppelganger would be around,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,there would be ghosts pushing down the stairs
00:27:18,00:27:20,"when he was trying to go up to bed,"
00:27:20,00:27:21,so he couldn't climb it.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"A bit, you know, that dream that people have"
00:27:23,00:27:24,where you just can't get up a hill
00:27:24,00:27:26,"and kind of be quicksand, that kind of thing,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,but it was ghosts pushing him down.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"And then when he got to the top of the stairs,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,he would be met by a green woman with tusks.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- Oh.
00:27:34,00:27:37,"- I mean, do you think maybe you're only taking enough"
00:27:37,00:27:40,"to kill five people a day, might be a good idea, will you?"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"- No, no."
00:27:42,00:27:45,"- And his love life as well was absolutely,"
00:27:45,00:27:46,it was just really interesting.
00:27:46,00:27:47,It was kind of--
00:27:47,00:27:47,"- For the time, I guess it was--"
00:27:47,00:27:49,- Interesting because he was someone of the best.
00:27:49,00:27:52,(laughing)
00:27:52,00:27:53,- He's very healthy.
00:27:53,00:27:57,"- No, interesting even for today, I would say, Dan."
00:27:57,00:27:59,"If someone these days had this love life,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,"I would be interested, I want to know more."
00:28:01,00:28:03,"He didn't want to marry, fine,"
00:28:03,00:28:04,and he was in a relationship
00:28:04,00:28:06,with a woman called Caroline Graves.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"She was a widow, she had a child from earlier relationship."
00:28:08,00:28:10,And then he started an affair
00:28:10,00:28:13,"with a woman called Martha Rudd, right?"
00:28:13,00:28:16,"And she was, I think, about 20 when they met."
00:28:16,00:28:18,And they had three children together.
00:28:18,00:28:20,Caroline Graves didn't love this.
00:28:20,00:28:22,She went off to marry someone else.
00:28:22,00:28:23,- Fair enough.
00:28:23,00:28:24,- Completely fair enough.
00:28:24,00:28:25,"And he actually went to the wedding,"
00:28:25,00:28:27,so it might have been all--
00:28:27,00:28:28,- I think it was quite friendly.
00:28:28,00:28:29,- Yeah.
00:28:29,00:28:30,- I got the impression there wasn't too much resentment.
00:28:30,00:28:31,- So that's good.
00:28:31,00:28:33,So then Wilkie Collins is in a relationship
00:28:33,00:28:34,"with his new woman, Martha Rudd."
00:28:34,00:28:35,They have three children together.
00:28:35,00:28:37,He sort of keeps them in a flat away from his house.
00:28:37,00:28:40,And he only wants to be known as Dawson
00:28:40,00:28:42,"when he goes over, I think."
00:28:42,00:28:43,- Cool.
00:28:43,00:28:45,- He just sort of has an assumed name for the landlady.
00:28:45,00:28:46,"He doesn't want any publicity, all of that."
00:28:46,00:28:49,"But then Caroline, his previous partner,"
00:28:49,00:28:50,her marriage doesn't work out.
00:28:50,00:28:52,"So she comes back, she lives with him,"
00:28:52,00:28:56,and he's just rattling between two families back and forth.
00:28:56,00:28:58,And then sometimes he takes them all on holiday together
00:28:58,00:29:00,to Ramsgate and puts them in boarding houses
00:29:00,00:29:03,next to each other and all the kids play together.
00:29:03,00:29:04,And they have a great time.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"- I think the kids play together,"
00:29:05,00:29:06,but the women never meet.
00:29:06,00:29:07,- Yeah.
00:29:07,00:29:08,- It's weird.
00:29:08,00:29:09,- It's so weird.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"- And he's at one, I presume at one house or the other"
00:29:11,00:29:12,all the time.
00:29:12,00:29:12,- Wow.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- And they just have to kind of, that's the situation."
00:29:14,00:29:16,- It sounds like a sort of amateur play
00:29:16,00:29:19,where the women are both played by the same person.
00:29:19,00:29:20,'Cause it's so important they never meet.
00:29:20,00:29:22,They live basically on the same street.
00:29:22,00:29:23,- Yeah.
00:29:23,00:29:24,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:29:24,00:29:24,- Exactly.
00:29:24,00:29:25,"- They walk out of the door and they're like,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,"""Oh, you just missed it."""
00:29:27,00:29:28,- Exactly.
00:29:28,00:29:30,And she's going to drive it out of breath.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"""Oh, you missed it."""
00:29:32,00:29:34,- That's married Mrs. Doubtfully.
00:29:34,00:29:36,(laughing)
00:29:36,00:29:38,- Do you know when Martha was born?
00:29:38,00:29:39,- No.
00:29:39,00:29:40,- She was born in Martham.
00:29:40,00:29:43,(laughing)
00:29:43,00:29:47,- That sounds like you just conjugated her name.
00:29:47,00:29:48,"- It's the accusative, actually."
00:29:48,00:29:52,"Yeah, very unimaginative parents, Martham in Norfolk."
00:29:52,00:29:54,"- I was going to say, where the heck is Martham?"
00:29:54,00:29:56,- I think it's a village in Norfolk.
00:29:56,00:29:57,- That's so good.
00:29:57,00:29:59,- So did they name her after the village?
00:29:59,00:30:00,- Not clear.
00:30:00,00:30:01,Did try to find out.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"Funnily enough, it wasn't one of those facts"
00:30:02,00:30:03,"that's been recorded to history,"
00:30:03,00:30:04,as far as I could tell.
00:30:04,00:30:05,I wasn't born in Peniston.
00:30:05,00:30:07,(laughing)
00:30:07,00:30:09,"- If you are in Martham listening to this now,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,please write in.
00:30:11,00:30:12,- Yeah.
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Just tell us what it's like.
00:30:13,00:30:14,- Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:15,- Send us a photo.
00:30:15,00:30:16,(laughing)
00:30:16,00:30:17,"- I know I'm a bit unsure about that,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"but you don't do the emails anymore,"
00:30:19,00:30:20,rather.
00:30:20,00:30:20,"- Oh, yeah, sorry."
00:30:20,00:30:22,"Of course, inundate us with emails."
00:30:22,00:30:23,(laughing)
00:30:23,00:30:24,Everyone from Martham.
00:30:24,00:30:25,"- If you've ever been to Martham,"
00:30:25,00:30:27,"or been any place beginning with that,"
00:30:27,00:30:28,then write it.
00:30:28,00:30:29,(laughing)
00:30:29,00:30:30,"'Cause the last time I said that,"
00:30:30,00:30:31,"I said something like,"
00:30:31,00:30:33,if you are eating particular foods
00:30:33,00:30:34,"in America right now,"
00:30:34,00:30:35,"and it was thanks to that bloke,"
00:30:35,00:30:37,"David Fairchild, who imported them all."
00:30:37,00:30:39,"And we got a lot of emails of people eating avocados,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,people eating rice.
00:30:41,00:30:42,"I can't remember what it was,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,but it was a lot.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"- Martha tended,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,so Martha said she could have married Wilkie Collins
00:30:49,00:30:50,whenever she wanted.
00:30:50,00:30:53,That was a bit of a lady that had to protest too much thing.
00:30:53,00:30:57,"But she didn't go to his funeral,"
00:30:57,00:31:00,"nor did their kids, weirdly."
00:31:00,00:31:01,"But then, she did."
00:31:01,00:31:03,"- She was there, but she was called Caroline Gray."
00:31:03,00:31:05,(laughing)
00:31:05,00:31:06,- Where's Martha?
00:31:06,00:31:07,(laughing)
00:31:07,00:31:09,- She did go to the balloon.
00:31:09,00:31:11,(laughing)
00:31:11,00:31:13,"After Caroline died,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,she took over tending Wilkie Collins grave.
00:31:15,00:31:17,So it just seems like there's so much happening
00:31:17,00:31:19,below the surface we don't know about.
00:31:19,00:31:21,- Caroline was also buried in that grave.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"- Yes, Caroline was buried in the same plot."
00:31:23,00:31:25,"- I suppose she tended Caroline's grave as well,"
00:31:25,00:31:28,but she quickly dug herself into the coffin for a while.
00:31:28,00:31:29,(laughing)
00:31:29,00:31:30,"Oh, thanks for looking up to my grave."
00:31:30,00:31:33,"Clives out of the coffin, no problem."
00:31:33,00:31:35,(laughing)
00:31:35,00:31:42,"Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:31:42,00:31:43,and that is my fact.
00:31:43,00:31:46,My fact this week is that 15th century Korean royals
00:31:46,00:31:48,had their lives so thoroughly documented
00:31:48,00:31:51,that the records include kings complaining
00:31:51,00:31:53,about their recorders recording them.
00:31:53,00:31:57,"So, this was sent to me by my friend, Mark Vent."
00:31:57,00:31:58,I've never heard of it.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"It's called The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"where basically they recorded literally everything,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,included in these accounts.
00:32:05,00:32:06,"In 1404, for example,"
00:32:06,00:32:09,there was a king who fell off a horse by accident.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"He was really embarrassed,"
00:32:10,00:32:11,"and he went up to the guy recording it saying,"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"""Can you not put in the whole horse-falling thing?"""
00:32:13,00:32:14,And the guy put it in.
00:32:14,00:32:17,So we've got an account of the king
00:32:17,00:32:18,"then bitching about the guy going,"
00:32:18,00:32:20,"""I bet he's put in the horse thing, hasn't he?"""
00:32:20,00:32:21,"- He said, ""Stop writing."
00:32:21,00:32:23,"""No, no, stop writing that."
00:32:23,00:32:25,"""Don't write that either, you bastard."""
00:32:25,00:32:27,- You know the never-ending story?
00:32:27,00:32:29,"There's a character sitting on the top of a mountain,"
00:32:29,00:32:30,transcribing everything.
00:32:30,00:32:33,This is basically how they treated their entire dynasty.
00:32:33,00:32:37,"And as a result, we've got 500 years' worth"
00:32:37,00:32:39,of complete records of the king
00:32:39,00:32:41,and all of the king's administrators.
00:32:41,00:32:42,- It's brilliant.
00:32:42,00:32:43,"- Yeah, it's incredible."
00:32:43,00:32:44,- It's such a good idea.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"Unlike now, where literally this week,"
00:32:46,00:32:49,"we're hearing that people are deleting WhatsApps every,"
00:32:49,00:32:50,"you know, they're doing government business,"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"and they're deleting the WhatsApps every seven days,"
00:32:52,00:32:54,so we never know what they said.
00:32:54,00:32:55,- You're right.
00:32:55,00:32:56,"If we doubt this system, they couldn't have done it,"
00:32:56,00:32:59,'cause the king wasn't even allowed to see it.
00:32:59,00:33:00,- It wasn't allowed to see it.
00:33:00,00:33:01,"- After he died, you weren't allowed to look"
00:33:01,00:33:04,at the recordings of what you've done and said.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:33:05,00:33:06,The rules were very strict about who couldn't look
00:33:06,00:33:09,"in the annals, but they were broken sometimes."
00:33:09,00:33:10,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:33:10,00:33:12,"- So there was, I've read an account of a tyrant king"
00:33:12,00:33:14,who looked in the annals and then six people were executed
00:33:14,00:33:16,because of what he found written in there.
00:33:16,00:33:18,"So I think after that, they probably had to tighten"
00:33:18,00:33:19,up the rules.
00:33:19,00:33:21,Maybe he was the reason the kings then weren't allowed
00:33:21,00:33:21,to look in the annals.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"- So what it was, I mean, I don't know if this is"
00:33:23,00:33:25,"the specific account you're talking about,"
00:33:25,00:33:29,but the people who were writing the histories often went
00:33:29,00:33:32,back in to change what they've written because the king
00:33:32,00:33:34,wasn't allowed to look at what happened.
00:33:34,00:33:36,"You know, he'd have to die and then people could look"
00:33:36,00:33:40,"at what was said about him, but politicians would get word"
00:33:40,00:33:41,that maybe something was written down.
00:33:41,00:33:44,So the historiographers would go back into it
00:33:44,00:33:45,and kind of change it.
00:33:45,00:33:47,And the king found out about that and he got really pissed
00:33:47,00:33:49,off that they were more petrified of the politicians
00:33:49,00:33:52,than the king himself of what the king would do.
00:33:52,00:33:53,And then that got banned.
00:33:53,00:33:55,- So you weren't allowed to then go in and change
00:33:55,00:33:56,your own story?
00:33:56,00:33:58,"- They were known as the literati purges, weren't they?"
00:33:58,00:33:59,(laughing)
00:33:59,00:34:02,"And the one Andy's talking about who was Yon Sangun,"
00:34:02,00:34:07,"who was the tyrant king, he closed down the university"
00:34:07,00:34:11,and turned it into his personal pleasure grounds
00:34:11,00:34:15,where he would import young girls from around the provinces.
00:34:15,00:34:18,He also demolished a huge area where people were living
00:34:18,00:34:21,in the capital and turned it into his own hunting grounds.
00:34:21,00:34:25,"And then when everyone complained, he told his ministers"
00:34:25,00:34:27,they weren't allowed to speak and they had to wear a sign
00:34:27,00:34:30,"saying, ""A mouth is a door that brings in disaster."
00:34:30,00:34:33,"A tongue is a sword that cuts off a head."""
00:34:33,00:34:35,- I really thought it was gonna rhyme.
00:34:35,00:34:36,(laughing)
00:34:36,00:34:37,- It probably was in Korea.
00:34:37,00:34:37,"- It's Korean, yeah."
00:34:37,00:34:39,(laughing)
00:34:39,00:34:40,"- Wait, a tongue is a sword?"
00:34:40,00:34:41,- It feels like you could say plaster at some point.
00:34:41,00:34:42,A tongue is a sword that--
00:34:42,00:34:43,"- Calls for a plaster, yeah?"
00:34:43,00:34:44,- It's a plaster.
00:34:44,00:34:46,"- Wait, what's the mouth?"
00:34:46,00:34:48,- A mouth is a door that brings in disaster.
00:34:48,00:34:51,A tongue is a sword that calls for a plaster.
00:34:51,00:34:51,- Looks good.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"- It's not amazing, but it's hard to work with."
00:34:53,00:34:54,- I think it's good.
00:34:54,00:34:55,- What are the teeth?
00:34:55,00:34:57,- Something knocked out by your master.
00:34:57,00:34:59,"- Oh, very good."
00:34:59,00:35:00,- Lovely.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- Anyway, he sounds like a rotter."
00:35:01,00:35:02,(laughing)
00:35:02,00:35:04,"Yeah, it was really strange."
00:35:04,00:35:07,"There were eventually about 2,000 volumes of this stuff."
00:35:07,00:35:08,"2,000 volumes."
00:35:08,00:35:09,And it was all sorts of clobber as well.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"It was the weather, it was diplomatic affairs,"
00:35:11,00:35:12,it was the economy.
00:35:12,00:35:13,"It was, you know."
00:35:13,00:35:15,- Probably quite a boring job to actually do it.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Day in, day out, dribbling away."
00:35:17,00:35:18,"And you must have had this constantly saying,"
00:35:18,00:35:19,"""So can you slow down, please?"""
00:35:19,00:35:21,"- Sorry, can you say that again?"
00:35:21,00:35:22,- Yeah.
00:35:22,00:35:23,- And then you have to write that down.
00:35:23,00:35:24,- Yes.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"- And then I wrote down, ""Can you slow down, please?"""
00:35:26,00:35:28,"- Sorry, can you fall off the horse again, but slower?"
00:35:28,00:35:30,(laughing)
00:35:30,00:35:34,"- Yeah, it's 1,967 books in total is what they have."
00:35:34,00:35:35,"They say if you stacked it,"
00:35:35,00:35:36,it would be taller than a 10-story building.
00:35:36,00:35:39,"Is the height we're talking of these books,"
00:35:39,00:35:40,"which just means nothing,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,but that's quite fun as a visual.
00:35:42,00:35:45,- Thank you for explaining why you've mentioned it.
00:35:45,00:35:47,"- But the point that they make in this thing is,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"until it's been digitized,"
00:35:49,00:35:53,it was an intensely hard history to get your head around
00:35:53,00:35:54,because--
00:35:54,00:35:55,- 'Cause you gotta climb nine stars
00:35:55,00:35:57,to get to the level you want.
00:35:57,00:35:58,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:35:58,00:36:00,"Well, there's no, it's not a history book."
00:36:00,00:36:03,"It's not written like, ""Here's the story of the king."""
00:36:03,00:36:04,"You've got a bit of the king,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"and then you've suddenly got the weather report,"
00:36:06,00:36:09,"and you have to hunt through 1,900 volumes"
00:36:09,00:36:11,to find the thing you're looking for.
00:36:11,00:36:13,"Obviously there's, you know, when the periods--"
00:36:13,00:36:14,"- There's days of the stuff, but yeah."
00:36:14,00:36:15,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:36:15,00:36:15,"- But now it has been digitized, right?"
00:36:15,00:36:16,"- It has, yeah."
00:36:16,00:36:18,- And it's the plan is to translate them
00:36:18,00:36:20,into English by the year 2033.
00:36:20,00:36:21,- Okay.
00:36:21,00:36:24,This dynasty was an interesting one.
00:36:24,00:36:25,It was a very long-lasting dynasty.
00:36:25,00:36:27,"- Yeah, 500 years."
00:36:27,00:36:27,"- Yeah, 500."
00:36:27,00:36:30,"- 1392 until, well, accounts vary,"
00:36:30,00:36:32,but I'm going with 1910.
00:36:32,00:36:33,"- Hmm, controversial."
00:36:33,00:36:37,"- Well, Japan invaded Korea at that point."
00:36:37,00:36:38,Certainly not despite it.
00:36:38,00:36:42,"That was, yeah, in the 14th century, when it started,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,"it was, you know, the big deal was that they were moving"
00:36:44,00:36:46,from an old aristocracy to state-trained bureaucrats
00:36:46,00:36:47,"who were running the show,"
00:36:47,00:36:49,"and that was, you know."
00:36:49,00:36:52,- It was very much in the Eastern tradition
00:36:52,00:36:54,"of meritocracy, having preceded us."
00:36:54,00:36:56,"Well, they were just much more organized than we were."
00:36:56,00:36:59,- It was a meritocracy as long as you weren't a woman.
00:36:59,00:37:01,"- Oh, God, yeah, women had an absolute whale of a time,"
00:37:01,00:37:02,of course.
00:37:02,00:37:04,There was a ruling from behind the bamboo screen
00:37:04,00:37:06,"was a thing in the Choson dynasty,"
00:37:06,00:37:09,"which was when, if you were a regent,"
00:37:09,00:37:12,"so obviously if a male royal hadn't come of age yet,"
00:37:12,00:37:15,"and you were the mother, then you could rule,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,but you had to sit behind the bamboo screen at the time
00:37:17,00:37:19,"when he sat on the throne, acting like he was saying stuff."
00:37:19,00:37:23,"- Oh, do you have your hand up his bum at the time?"
00:37:23,00:37:25,(all laughing)
00:37:25,00:37:31,"I mean, if we thought that those three kids"
00:37:31,00:37:35,"looking the same lot, he was going to get social services in."
00:37:35,00:37:37,"- The ruling from behind the screen, that was quite cool."
00:37:37,00:37:38,"- Yeah, it was really cool."
00:37:38,00:37:39,"- We've spoken about that before, haven't we?"
00:37:39,00:37:41,- What we've spoken about it in Russia.
00:37:41,00:37:44,"- Yeah, when someone was behind, literally, the throne."
00:37:44,00:37:45,- The chair.
00:37:45,00:37:47,"- Yeah, yeah, just go, ""Why don't you say?"""
00:37:47,00:37:49,"But here, you weren't hit, like they knew you were there,"
00:37:49,00:37:52,"'cause there's a big screen, maybe with nice pictures on it."
00:37:52,00:37:53,"But have a fight a lot,"
00:37:53,00:37:55,if your grandmother or your mother ruled.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"There was one queen, I think,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,who ruled for about 25 years from behind the screen.
00:37:58,00:37:59,- What?
00:37:59,00:38:00,"Oh, really? - With the same regent?"
00:38:00,00:38:01,"- Yeah. - It's kind of that,"
00:38:01,00:38:02,"you're not ready yet, so I'm sorry."
00:38:02,00:38:04,(all laughing)
00:38:04,00:38:05,"- Oh, I thought they had a rule that when you turned 20,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,so it was if you were under 20.
00:38:07,00:38:10,"- They did, but lots of weird stuff always happens,"
00:38:10,00:38:11,"and she liked power, and so it was a bit like,"
00:38:11,00:38:14,"oh, actually, you're not qualified, it turns out,"
00:38:14,00:38:16,and she was machinating behind the scenes
00:38:16,00:38:19,to make sure she stayed in control.
00:38:19,00:38:20,"But it was, one of the good things about them"
00:38:20,00:38:21,"recording all these details,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,"was that you got just a lot of blood and gore,"
00:38:24,00:38:26,"'cause everyone, like Royals were in the past,"
00:38:26,00:38:28,"almost everywhere, everyone was quite bloodthirsty."
00:38:28,00:38:30,So one of the stories that I liked that was recorded
00:38:30,00:38:32,was the story of Prince Sado.
00:38:32,00:38:34,(all laughing)
00:38:34,00:38:35,"You know what, Sado?"
00:38:35,00:38:38,"- Is that the English translation, or?"
00:38:38,00:38:41,"- It basically should be, 'cause he was a sad character."
00:38:41,00:38:44,"This was in the 1700s, and his dad was King Yong Zhou,"
00:38:44,00:38:48,who really wanted Sado to be studious and clever.
00:38:48,00:38:49,- Sounds like he was.
00:38:49,00:38:50,(all laughing)
00:38:50,00:38:51,"- Well, sadly, he wasn't."
00:38:51,00:38:52,He was actually a free spirit.
00:38:52,00:38:55,He wanted to be a musician and an artist kind of type.
00:38:55,00:38:56,"- Oh, yeah, classic."
00:38:56,00:38:58,"- His dad was a super lame, bullied him,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,"used to mock him in front of the eunuchs, and the ladies."
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Not in front of the eunuchs.
00:39:02,00:39:03,(all laughing)
00:39:03,00:39:05,"No, that's so unkind."
00:39:05,00:39:08,"- It's the worst, and it drove Sado a bit mad."
00:39:08,00:39:12,"Sado went mad-o, and he sort of,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,"he went from being a really gentle, sweet boy"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"to murdering everyone, and he used to walk into chambers"
00:39:17,00:39:19,"holding severed heads of eunuchs, in fact."
00:39:19,00:39:21,- Guess what else I've cut off?
00:39:21,00:39:23,"Yeah, yeah, that kind of thing, yeah."
00:39:23,00:39:26,"- Yeah, and so his father was then like,"
00:39:26,00:39:27,"""Well, we can't have this, we can't have you inheriting,"
00:39:27,00:39:29,"""so you're gonna have to die,"
00:39:29,00:39:31,"""but you're not allowed to defile the royal body"
00:39:31,00:39:33,"""by actually killing someone."""
00:39:33,00:39:35,"So he asked his son to commit suicide,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"and Sado, Sado, though he was,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"was not Sado enough to commit suicide,"
00:39:39,00:39:40,"so his dad said, ""Okay, well then,"
00:39:40,00:39:42,"""can you climb into this rice chest?"""
00:39:42,00:39:45,And then he locked him in a rice chest and starved him to death.
00:39:45,00:39:47,"- Wait, did he know that that was gonna be locked?"
00:39:47,00:39:48,"- I guess maybe he thought really,"
00:39:48,00:39:50,"look, I guess this has to happen."
00:39:50,00:39:51,- Was he put in the chest?
00:39:51,00:39:52,"- It might have been,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,there might have been someone gently encouraging him
00:39:54,00:39:55,"with a hand. - Although, although,"
00:39:55,00:39:56,"is there any animals, you know?"
00:39:56,00:39:57,"- Yeah, if it's in the animals, then it must have happened,"
00:39:57,00:39:58,"otherwise it'd be like, you know,"
00:39:58,00:40:00,"""Don't say that I'm shoving my son"
00:40:00,00:40:02,"""into this rice chest right now."""
00:40:02,00:40:04,"- Yeah, you're right, he got involuntarily."
00:40:04,00:40:05,"- Yeah. - There was a place,"
00:40:05,00:40:06,I can't remember where it was.
00:40:06,00:40:09,"The tradition was that you couldn't kill the king,"
00:40:09,00:40:10,but you could put them in a bag
00:40:10,00:40:12,and hit the bag very hard with a club.
00:40:12,00:40:13,And I think that was the...
00:40:13,00:40:14,"- I think that was the Ottoman Empire, wasn't it?"
00:40:14,00:40:15,"- It was the Ottomans, I'm sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:15,00:40:17,"- I think you beat them in some kind of rugs sometimes,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,"didn't you, so that you couldn't spill blood?"
00:40:19,00:40:20,"- You say, ""I'm just beating this rug,"""
00:40:20,00:40:22,and actually it contains the king or whatever.
00:40:22,00:40:26,"And that was the means of executing very, very posh people."
00:40:26,00:40:28,"- Right, wasn't there a tradition,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,"there was a pirate tradition as well,"
00:40:29,00:40:32,"wasn't there, of chest, putting people in chests and--"
00:40:32,00:40:34,- That's treasure.
00:40:34,00:40:36,(laughing)
00:40:36,00:40:37,"- That goes back to the people,"
00:40:37,00:40:39,when they picked up my treasure.
00:40:39,00:40:41,(laughing)
00:40:41,00:40:43,"- It's some poor, desiccated skeleton in there."
00:40:43,00:40:45,"- No, it's hook, I'm thinking of the movie hook."
00:40:45,00:40:47,"- Oh, you're not, you're not really."
00:40:47,00:40:47,"- Yeah, right at the beginning, yeah,"
00:40:47,00:40:49,"but they put them in the boo box, the boo box,"
00:40:49,00:40:50,and he goes inside. - The boo box.
00:40:50,00:40:51,"- Yeah, and you would have a slide,"
00:40:51,00:40:53,and you'd put scorpions in and close it.
00:40:53,00:40:54,"- We don't need to go into the details,"
00:40:54,00:40:56,I don't think it is historical facts.
00:40:56,00:40:58,"- Interesting fact, it was Glenn Close,"
00:40:58,00:40:59,"who played the male pirate,"
00:40:59,00:41:02,"and no one really knew that, uncredited, yeah."
00:41:02,00:41:03,"- Hook, who played hook?"
00:41:03,00:41:07,"- No, played the pirate put in the treasure chest, yeah."
00:41:07,00:41:09,"- Okay, so. - Anybody's done it."
00:41:09,00:41:12,"- One interesting thing about these annals is,"
00:41:12,00:41:15,"like Andy said, they kind of would tell you the weather,"
00:41:15,00:41:17,and stuff like that.
00:41:17,00:41:20,"But it also would tell you whenever there was an aurora,"
00:41:20,00:41:24,"and there was a time between 1645 and 1715,"
00:41:24,00:41:27,"which we now sometimes call the mini ice age,"
00:41:27,00:41:30,"and we've managed to use, or not we,"
00:41:30,00:41:33,"a guy called Jan and his team,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,"managed to use the records, looking into the history books,"
00:41:35,00:41:38,and have worked out the solar cycles
00:41:38,00:41:40,that were happening around that time.
00:41:40,00:41:41,- Beautiful. - By the number of auroras
00:41:41,00:41:43,that were recorded in the annals.
00:41:43,00:41:44,- That's so cool. - Isn't that cool?
00:41:44,00:41:46,- That's amazing. - And so we now know
00:41:46,00:41:48,"that around that time, the solar cycle"
00:41:48,00:41:49,"was only about eight years,"
00:41:49,00:41:51,whereas it's normally a bit longer than that.
00:41:51,00:41:53,- That's incredible. - I just love that stuff.
00:41:53,00:41:55,- There's also UFO encounters
00:41:55,00:41:59,"in the Chosen dynasty, which is very exciting."
00:41:59,00:42:03,"So, September 1609, there was a reported case"
00:42:03,00:42:05,of things shaped like a bowl in the sky.
00:42:05,00:42:07,And there's a few paranormal things
00:42:07,00:42:09,"that make it in there as well, but what's really amazing,"
00:42:09,00:42:11,"I'm so excited by this, I haven't seen it yet,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,but it's obviously immediately become
00:42:13,00:42:14,one of my favorite TV shows.
00:42:14,00:42:17,"The Chosen X Files, it's a real TV show,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"and it's a historical, and it uses accounts"
00:42:19,00:42:23,"from the Chosen annals as the basis for each episode,"
00:42:23,00:42:26,and there's an ancient investigator of the time
00:42:26,00:42:28,who is assigned to go and investigate
00:42:28,00:42:30,all of the weird paranormalities
00:42:30,00:42:31,that we find in the annals.
00:42:31,00:42:32,- What kind of things are we talking about?
00:42:32,00:42:34,"- Oh, I just told you, the UFO."
00:42:34,00:42:35,- A bowl in the fall of the sky.
00:42:35,00:42:37,"- A bowl shape across the moon, sounds like."
00:42:37,00:42:38,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, who knows?"
00:42:38,00:42:39,"I mean, it's obviously not a UFO,"
00:42:39,00:42:42,"but they recorded it as unidentified stuff,"
00:42:42,00:42:44,"there's cursed items, all that sort of stuff,"
00:42:44,00:42:44,"and yeah, it's been turned into a-"
00:42:44,00:42:46,"- Well, that's the good thing about the annals"
00:42:46,00:42:48,is that it's really easy to re-enact
00:42:48,00:42:49,so much of what happened.
00:42:49,00:42:52,So you can make an incredibly accurate historical
00:42:52,00:42:54,"representation, and I think historical re-enactments"
00:42:54,00:42:56,are much more popular and common
00:42:56,00:42:59,"in Korea now of this period,"
00:42:59,00:43:02,"because you know exactly what people were wearing,"
00:43:02,00:43:04,"exactly how they ate their meals,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,"like meals were described in such detail,"
00:43:06,00:43:08,"and the order in which meals,"
00:43:08,00:43:10,like the order in which different foods
00:43:10,00:43:11,had to be placed on the table.
00:43:11,00:43:14,It was all extremely ordered life.
00:43:14,00:43:16,"Everything was very ceremonial,"
00:43:16,00:43:18,"and so you'd have to bring in the sausages first,"
00:43:18,00:43:20,"and then the cabbage five minutes later,"
00:43:20,00:43:22,and we know all of this.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"So re-enactments, piece of cake."
00:43:24,00:43:25,- That's cool.
00:43:25,00:43:27,- Welcome to the piece of cake company.
00:43:27,00:43:29,(laughing)
00:43:29,00:43:32,- Can you guess the seven sins for which you were allowed
00:43:32,00:43:34,to divorce your wife under the Joseon dynasty?
00:43:34,00:43:36,"- So her sins, not mine."
00:43:36,00:43:38,(laughing)
00:43:38,00:43:38,- Yeah.
00:43:38,00:43:39,- Okay.
00:43:39,00:43:40,- Adultery.
00:43:40,00:43:41,- Wives weren't allowed to divorce their husbands.
00:43:41,00:43:42,- Adultery.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"- Adultery's in there, yes."
00:43:44,00:43:45,- Seft.
00:43:45,00:43:48,"- Very good stealing is in there, yes."
00:43:48,00:43:50,- Inability to have children is usually one of them.
00:43:50,00:43:51,"- Yes, very good."
00:43:51,00:43:52,Fairly to produce a male heir.
00:43:52,00:43:54,"You can have daughters if you want, but you'll get divorced."
00:43:54,00:43:55,- Touching my stuff.
00:43:55,00:43:56,What about?
00:43:56,00:43:58,(laughing)
00:43:58,00:44:00,"- It's not actually on there, it's been an oversight."
00:44:00,00:44:03,"I've been moving the remote control from where I like it,"
00:44:03,00:44:07,"where I like it, next to where I sit on the sofa,"
00:44:07,00:44:09,to apparently a better place next to the television.
00:44:09,00:44:11,- Why would you put it next to the television?
00:44:11,00:44:12,It's a remote control.
00:44:12,00:44:16,It should be remotes from the place that it's beeping to.
00:44:16,00:44:17,- I don't know if I meant to unleash this.
00:44:17,00:44:18,"- No, no, this is brilliant."
00:44:18,00:44:22,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, I love my wife and it's all going right."
00:44:22,00:44:24,(laughing)
00:44:24,00:44:25,"- We've only got three so far, haven't we?"
00:44:25,00:44:27,"- You've done Fairly to produce a male heir,"
00:44:27,00:44:29,"adultery, stealing."
00:44:29,00:44:32,"- Well, not maintaining the household properly."
00:44:32,00:44:35,"- No, that's not, there's excessive jealousy"
00:44:35,00:44:36,towards other women in the household
00:44:36,00:44:38,who I guess would often be concubines.
00:44:38,00:44:40,"So you can't, yeah, you can divorce your wife."
00:44:40,00:44:43,"- Bad mouthing with the friends, they were overheard,"
00:44:43,00:44:44,spotted in the annals.
00:44:44,00:44:46,"- I'm gonna give you that, talking excessively."
00:44:46,00:44:47,- Ooh.
00:44:47,00:44:49,(laughing)
00:44:49,00:44:51,"- Too much chat, you're gone."
00:44:51,00:44:53,The last one is serious disease.
00:44:53,00:44:55,"- Oh, right."
00:44:55,00:44:58,"- So you've got to, I mean, I think that is irresponsible"
00:44:58,00:44:59,to get a bad disease when you're trying
00:44:59,00:45:00,to produce a male heir.
00:45:00,00:45:02,"- Yeah, if you've got, if your wife's got gout eyes,"
00:45:02,00:45:06,"I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna get that."
00:45:06,00:45:07,"- Exactly, get rid of them love."
00:45:07,00:45:11,- So the remote control thing you're stuck with?
00:45:11,00:45:12,"- I think I might have just missed it out, yeah,"
00:45:12,00:45:14,"and I think my body was eight since, yeah."
00:45:14,00:45:15,"- Eight, yeah."
00:45:15,00:45:18,(upbeat music)
00:45:18,00:45:23,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:45:23,00:45:25,and that is Anna.
00:45:25,00:45:27,"- My fact this week is that in real life,"
00:45:27,00:45:29,it was difficult to free Willy
00:45:29,00:45:31,because he couldn't hold his breath under water
00:45:31,00:45:35,"for long enough, but this is about the film Free Willy."
00:45:35,00:45:36,"- Which, if you haven't seen it,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,"is a classic '90s kids movie, it's brilliant."
00:45:38,00:45:39,- Is it?
00:45:39,00:45:41,"- 1993, it's so good, it really is great."
00:45:41,00:45:43,- I know it's about a whale.
00:45:43,00:45:44,- Yep.
00:45:44,00:45:46,- Who is freed.
00:45:46,00:45:47,- Yes.
00:45:47,00:45:50,- I feel like there is a scene where he jumps over a wall.
00:45:50,00:45:51,- Yes.
00:45:51,00:45:51,"- Yes, very good."
00:45:51,00:45:54,- And that is his friend with a child who's working to free
00:45:54,00:45:58,and that is not a spoiler because the climactic moment
00:45:58,00:46:00,"of the film is on not only the title,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,it's also in the trailer and on the poster.
00:46:02,00:46:03,- It's the poster.
00:46:03,00:46:05,"- It's the whole thing, it's the weirdest thing."
00:46:05,00:46:07,- I like Anna Karenina having a train on the front cover.
00:46:07,00:46:09,"- No, Andy, it's called Free Willy,"
00:46:09,00:46:11,"it's not called Free Willy question, Mark."
00:46:11,00:46:14,"We know that the Free Willy is gonna happen, shall we?"
00:46:14,00:46:16,"- No, because Free Willy is like an imperative,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"like Free Willy, you don't know they obey it, do you?"
00:46:18,00:46:19,"- Oh, it's not an adjective."
00:46:19,00:46:20,"- No, no, no."
00:46:20,00:46:21,"- No, it's not."
00:46:21,00:46:22,(laughing)
00:46:22,00:46:23,"- Well, actually he starts the film as a Free Will"
00:46:23,00:46:26,"before being captured by some rascally fisherman,"
00:46:26,00:46:27,"you know, some scoundrels."
00:46:27,00:46:29,So he starts off as Free Willy.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"- But yeah, most of the film, he's not free,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,"so really, to be accurate, it should have been called"
00:46:33,00:46:36,Captive Willy 'cause that's the majority of the film.
00:46:36,00:46:37,(laughing)
00:46:37,00:46:41,Captive Willy is in another genre entirely in films.
00:46:41,00:46:43,"- So he was a real whale, he was called Keiko."
00:46:43,00:46:43,- Yeah.
00:46:43,00:46:46,"- Yeah, and he was, so yeah, there was this whale"
00:46:46,00:46:49,"called Keiko and after the film came out, basically,"
00:46:49,00:46:50,it was incredibly popular.
00:46:50,00:46:52,"Anyone who was a child online, he's probably,"
00:46:52,00:46:53,"remember seeing it, except James."
00:46:53,00:46:58,"And after it came out, there was this massive campaign"
00:46:58,00:47:02,"and in fact, the film at the end of it had a number to call"
00:47:02,00:47:03,"if you wanted to save the whales,"
00:47:03,00:47:05,but it was an environmental agency that you got through to.
00:47:05,00:47:07,"But actually, most people who called the number"
00:47:07,00:47:11,or many thousands just wanted that specific whale to be free.
00:47:11,00:47:13,"They were like, but what about the actor in the film?"
00:47:13,00:47:14,The actor who plays the whale?
00:47:14,00:47:16,"- The kid, oh right."
00:47:16,00:47:19,"- No one gives shit about the kid, he's still in captivity."
00:47:19,00:47:22,"So yeah, there was this campaign to free Keiko."
00:47:22,00:47:25,So they had to train this whale that had been in captivity
00:47:25,00:47:29,for 15 years to learn to live in the wild.
00:47:29,00:47:32,"Then it was an incredibly arduous, resource-intensive process."
00:47:32,00:47:34,And one of the things about Keiko was that
00:47:34,00:47:36,couldn't hold his breath underwater.
00:47:36,00:47:38,"And whales need to obviously,"
00:47:38,00:47:39,'cause they can't breathe underwater.
00:47:39,00:47:42,"So Killer Whales, which he was,"
00:47:42,00:47:44,hold their breath usually for about 15 minutes underwater.
00:47:44,00:47:47,"He couldn't even make sort of three,"
00:47:47,00:47:48,but they did manage to train him.
00:47:48,00:47:49,"And by the time they released him,"
00:47:49,00:47:51,he could hold his breath for 13 minutes.
00:47:51,00:47:52,So very good.
00:47:52,00:47:55,"- Oh right, so he had a pretty unhappy life in the wild."
00:47:55,00:47:56,He was used to living with humans.
00:47:56,00:47:58,"He'd been living with humans almost all his life,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,"and he was taken to Iceland,"
00:48:01,00:48:02,"and then he made his way over to Norway,"
00:48:02,00:48:05,but he really was pretty dependent on humans
00:48:05,00:48:06,"for the rest of his life, pretty sad."
00:48:06,00:48:08,- It's very interesting because there's a side
00:48:08,00:48:11,of environmentalists and people look after animals
00:48:11,00:48:13,"who say this was the worst thing in the world,"
00:48:13,00:48:15,to let him back out into the wild
00:48:15,00:48:16,because of all these reasons.
00:48:16,00:48:18,How could he attach himself to a pod?
00:48:18,00:48:22,"He's been fed frozen herring, his last 13 years."
00:48:22,00:48:24,But the people who did it still maintained
00:48:24,00:48:24,"it was the best thing to do,"
00:48:24,00:48:27,and that he was the second oldest orca
00:48:27,00:48:29,to live in captivity ever.
00:48:29,00:48:30,"In the time that he was in there,"
00:48:30,00:48:33,something like 13 other orcas died
00:48:33,00:48:36,to just show how quickly the mortality rate was.
00:48:36,00:48:38,"- Yeah, and he did, yeah, exactly."
00:48:38,00:48:39,He might have died anyway.
00:48:39,00:48:40,He just died of a disease
00:48:40,00:48:43,shortly after managing to be released.
00:48:43,00:48:45,"But yeah, and he hung around on the edge of a pod,"
00:48:45,00:48:49,"but it was mostly tragic, or silly at least,"
00:48:49,00:48:50,because there should have been a fund
00:48:50,00:48:53,for broad environmentally good reasons
00:48:53,00:48:56,"rather than probably a fund to just release this one whale,"
00:48:56,00:48:57,which was fine in captivity.
00:48:57,00:48:59,"- The release I think is that in free willies,"
00:48:59,00:49:01,"certainly two and three,"
00:49:01,00:49:04,the willie is played completely by an animatronic whale.
00:49:04,00:49:05,- Yeah.
00:49:05,00:49:09,- It's an early example of AI taking away jobs.
00:49:09,00:49:11,"- Well, largely in one, it was played"
00:49:11,00:49:14,by an animatronic whale as well.
00:49:14,00:49:15,- And CGI.
00:49:15,00:49:17,- For the bits where the child is putting his hand
00:49:17,00:49:18,"in the whale's mouth,"
00:49:18,00:49:19,I think they did have to have that in the middle.
00:49:19,00:49:22,"- Sorry to interrupt, because I don't know this movie."
00:49:22,00:49:24,"In free willie two, three, and four,"
00:49:24,00:49:26,"you're saying it's the same willie,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,as in the character is the same willie.
00:49:28,00:49:29,- He's freed.
00:49:29,00:49:30,- But then what?
00:49:30,00:49:33,"- Oh, so, yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:49:33,00:49:35,"- In free willie two, he's gone home."
00:49:35,00:49:37,"He's found his pod, and he's found his mum,"
00:49:37,00:49:38,which is exciting.
00:49:38,00:49:40,I think there's an oil spill or something bad.
00:49:40,00:49:43,That might be the film three.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"And then it turns out, look at me jumping"
00:49:44,00:49:47,in front of Dan when Dan's got the entire plot in his head.
00:49:47,00:49:48,"And film three, he started a family"
00:49:48,00:49:50,and he's got a pregnant one.
00:49:50,00:49:52,"- Oh, so he is free throughout those extra films."
00:49:52,00:49:54,"- They keep trying to capture him again,"
00:49:54,00:49:56,and the kid from the first movie appears in the second.
00:49:56,00:49:58,So it's the same cast trying to make sure
00:49:58,00:50:00,he remains free is the idea.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"- So by that point, the title is an adjective."
00:50:02,00:50:06,"He is free willie, rather than an imperative."
00:50:06,00:50:09,"- And it was sad because the character, you know,"
00:50:09,00:50:11,meets up with his pod again and gets together
00:50:11,00:50:12,"with the lady whale and, you know,"
00:50:12,00:50:14,she's expecting a baby in the third film.
00:50:14,00:50:17,And yet K-Code never experienced any of this.
00:50:17,00:50:18,It's sad.
00:50:18,00:50:19,"- Yes, it is sad."
00:50:19,00:50:20,- Absolutely sad.
00:50:20,00:50:21,"- And two and three has the same cast,"
00:50:21,00:50:24,"but four, they sort of thought the story is now told."
00:50:24,00:50:25,So they had to entirely recast it.
00:50:25,00:50:28,"And Bindi Irwin, the daughter of Steve Irwin,"
00:50:28,00:50:29,"Crocodile Hunter, is the lead role."
00:50:29,00:50:30,- Get out.
00:50:30,00:50:31,"- You know, I will stay in."
00:50:31,00:50:33,- It's free Bindi.
00:50:33,00:50:34,And is it a different whale?
00:50:34,00:50:35,- I've seen it.
00:50:35,00:50:36,I can't remember.
00:50:36,00:50:37,- 'Cause we've seen Jaws 4.
00:50:37,00:50:38,- Yes.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"- Which is, I think the kid of--"
00:50:39,00:50:39,- It's the descendant.
00:50:39,00:50:41,"It might be that, possibly."
00:50:41,00:50:42,"- It's the kid of the original shark,"
00:50:42,00:50:44,which is attacking the family.
00:50:44,00:50:45,But not family by blood.
00:50:45,00:50:47,Family by marriage of the original people.
00:50:47,00:50:48,- Oh my God.
00:50:48,00:50:49,- And it follows them across the world.
00:50:49,00:50:50,It's like--
00:50:50,00:50:51,- Through telepathy.
00:50:51,00:50:53,- This shark knows about sort of
00:50:53,00:50:55,social relationships as well as smell and blood.
00:50:55,00:50:55,"- No, I stopped describing it, please."
00:50:55,00:50:57,- Have you heard of Auker the movie
00:50:57,00:50:58,while we're talking about movies?
00:50:58,00:51:00,"- Auker, no."
00:51:00,00:51:03,"- So I wondered if there was like a killer whale movie,"
00:51:03,00:51:04,which was a bit like Jaws.
00:51:04,00:51:05,"- Oh, right."
00:51:05,00:51:06,- And it turns out there is.
00:51:06,00:51:10,"It's called Auker the movie from 1970, whenever it was."
00:51:10,00:51:12,"And basically someone had watched Jaws,"
00:51:12,00:51:14,seen how popular it was.
00:51:14,00:51:16,"And thought, what's scarier than a shark?"
00:51:16,00:51:17,A killer whale.
00:51:17,00:51:18,- Yeah.
00:51:18,00:51:19,- And it--
00:51:19,00:51:19,"- Incorrect, but okay."
00:51:19,00:51:22,"- Oh, killer whales literally eat sharks for breakfast."
00:51:22,00:51:24,"- Yeah, killer whales don't harm humans."
00:51:24,00:51:26,- They do in captivity.
00:51:26,00:51:28,"- The area against us, sorry."
00:51:28,00:51:31,"Two instances, 'cause we're really horrible to them."
00:51:31,00:51:33,Killer whales do not eat humans.
00:51:33,00:51:35,- I think sharks generally speaking don't eat humans.
00:51:35,00:51:36,- The number of shark incidents.
00:51:36,00:51:38,"Look, we all like our ocean friends, okay?"
00:51:38,00:51:40,"- A few people a year do get,"
00:51:40,00:51:42,people do get attacked by sharks.
00:51:42,00:51:44,- Killer whales do not attack humans in the wild.
00:51:44,00:51:45,- What about the boats they've been attacking
00:51:45,00:51:46,in the last year?
00:51:46,00:51:47,- They attack boats.
00:51:47,00:51:49,They're not killing humans.
00:51:49,00:51:50,- Who goes on boats?
00:51:50,00:51:50,- They're not humans.
00:51:50,00:51:51,(laughing)
00:51:51,00:51:53,- And you're giving them either too much
00:51:53,00:51:54,"or too little credit, right?"
00:51:54,00:51:55,You're right.
00:51:55,00:51:57,"- Anyway, you've got an approval rating of 9%."
00:51:57,00:51:58,(laughing)
00:51:58,00:51:59,"- Oh, really?"
00:51:59,00:52:01,"- I don't have that, we have seen the sequel"
00:52:01,00:52:03,"and the sequel and the sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel."
00:52:03,00:52:03,- Yeah.
00:52:03,00:52:06,"- Bob Irwin, Steve Sarn is in Auker 4."
00:52:06,00:52:08,- So when they were auditioning for the movie.
00:52:08,00:52:09,- Yeah.
00:52:09,00:52:10,- Free Willy.
00:52:10,00:52:11,- They auditioned lots of different whales.
00:52:11,00:52:13,I don't know what the process was.
00:52:13,00:52:13,- Singing.
00:52:13,00:52:15,- I think maybe.
00:52:15,00:52:15,(laughing)
00:52:15,00:52:20,But 21 of the 23 whales they auditioned belong to SeaWorld.
00:52:20,00:52:21,- Right.
00:52:21,00:52:23,- And SeaWorld apparently uncomfortable
00:52:23,00:52:24,"with the movie's message,"
00:52:24,00:52:27,"which is basically, you're caging whales, you monsters."
00:52:27,00:52:29,This is an incredibly medieval barbaric thing to do.
00:52:29,00:52:30,- Yeah.
00:52:30,00:52:31,- And they asked at one point for a new ending.
00:52:31,00:52:32,- Yeah.
00:52:32,00:52:35,- But presumably it went with Willy's days captive.
00:52:35,00:52:36,(laughing)
00:52:36,00:52:37,- He does it.
00:52:37,00:52:38,- Yeah.
00:52:38,00:52:39,- He jumps back over the wall.
00:52:39,00:52:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:40,00:52:41,(laughing)
00:52:41,00:52:43,"- Yeah, and so I think they got Keiko"
00:52:43,00:52:44,from a Mexican sea life park because of SeaWorld.
00:52:44,00:52:46,"- They did, which is quite odd"
00:52:46,00:52:49,because the Mexican park was in very poor condition
00:52:49,00:52:51,"and the whale, Keiko, was in very poor condition in it."
00:52:51,00:52:53,"But the Mexican owners, the Mexican park,"
00:52:53,00:52:54,were absolutely fine with the message.
00:52:54,00:52:55,- Right.
00:52:55,00:52:56,"- I think they were a bit like, yeah, no,"
00:52:56,00:52:57,it's shit here for the whales.
00:52:57,00:52:58,You should spread the word.
00:52:58,00:53:01,- That was weird for Keiko in that Mexican park
00:53:01,00:53:04,"because the water, rather than pouring sea water"
00:53:04,00:53:06,"for it to live in, they just had water,"
00:53:06,00:53:08,which they added salt to.
00:53:08,00:53:09,(laughing)
00:53:09,00:53:10,Like it was really bad.
00:53:10,00:53:13,"- I mean, in theory, that sounds like the same,"
00:53:13,00:53:14,but I bet it's not.
00:53:14,00:53:16,"- It's just kind of not gonna be, is it?"
00:53:16,00:53:16,"- No, no."
00:53:16,00:53:17,- It probably tastes weird.
00:53:17,00:53:18,- Yeah.
00:53:18,00:53:19,- Yeah.
00:53:19,00:53:20,- Seasoned water.
00:53:20,00:53:21,- Yeah.
00:53:21,00:53:22,- Seasoned your water.
00:53:22,00:53:22,- And the altitude's quite high up
00:53:22,00:53:23,for what Keiko would have been used to.
00:53:23,00:53:24,- Seats.
00:53:24,00:53:25,(laughing)
00:53:25,00:53:26,- And so it can level up.
00:53:26,00:53:27,(laughing)
00:53:27,00:53:29,(laughing)
00:53:29,00:53:32,"- So what altitude do you normally live at, Keiko?"
00:53:32,00:53:33,(laughing)
00:53:33,00:53:34,- Jesus.
00:53:34,00:53:36,(laughing)
00:53:36,00:53:38,- He didn't live in one of those really high seas.
00:53:38,00:53:39,(laughing)
00:53:39,00:53:41,- Those are the high seas that the pirates go in.
00:53:41,00:53:42,- That's it?
00:53:42,00:53:42,- Yeah.
00:53:42,00:53:45,- Why do you think the whales are alpine sea experience?
00:53:45,00:53:46,I'm not happy.
00:53:46,00:53:48,(laughing)
00:53:48,00:53:50,"- Here's the thing, I watched a clip of it last night,"
00:53:50,00:53:51,"and actually it's amazing to,"
00:53:51,00:53:55,"James, not included in this, but when you watch it back,"
00:53:55,00:53:59,"my memory of Willie going over as a phenomenal scene,"
00:53:59,00:54:02,"and watch it again, they use CGI,"
00:54:02,00:54:04,and it's really obvious when it lands in on the other side.
00:54:04,00:54:05,You can see the splash would kind of
00:54:05,00:54:07,"computer graphics, early computer graphics."
00:54:07,00:54:09,"- Couldn't do water in those days, could you?"
00:54:09,00:54:10,"In fact, it's still hard to do water."
00:54:10,00:54:11,- Right.
00:54:11,00:54:12,"- I think that's sensible though,"
00:54:12,00:54:14,'cause you have got an eight-year-old child actor
00:54:14,00:54:19,"firing the 1,300 kilo rubber whale over that."
00:54:19,00:54:22,"- Take 12, we're gonna need another kid."
00:54:22,00:54:24,(laughing)
00:54:24,00:54:25,"- And there was a stunt, as you said then,"
00:54:25,00:54:28,"there was a stunt double, which was coated in 1,300 kilos."
00:54:28,00:54:30,"Oh, sorry, that's 1,300 kilos of rubber"
00:54:30,00:54:32,"just on the outside. - On the outside, yeah."
00:54:32,00:54:34,"- That's just the skin, and the special effects supervisor"
00:54:34,00:54:37,said that the dummy looked so realistic to Keiko
00:54:37,00:54:39,that he became aroused when he saw it.
00:54:39,00:54:41,(laughing)
00:54:41,00:54:42,Did not happen to Keiko in the end.
00:54:42,00:54:44,Obviously he died. - Except Brian died.
00:54:44,00:54:45,"- Well, yes."
00:54:45,00:54:46,- He got pneumonia.
00:54:46,00:54:47,- After he died.
00:54:47,00:54:48,"- Oh, okay."
00:54:48,00:54:51,Reincarnated as a rabbit.
00:54:51,00:54:55,"- Before that, well, possibly, but he was buried."
00:54:55,00:54:56,"- Oh, okay, let's see. - Really?"
00:54:56,00:54:59,"- That poor grave digger, imagine being told"
00:54:59,00:55:01,that's your gig this morning.
00:55:01,00:55:03,"- Poor, what they call the people who carry them."
00:55:03,00:55:05,- Polbearers. - Polbearers.
00:55:05,00:55:07,"- 2,000 Polbearers."
00:55:07,00:55:09,"- Yeah, they were so weird."
00:55:09,00:55:12,"That was, 'cause he died in Norway,"
00:55:12,00:55:14,"or off the, in the fjords of Norway."
00:55:14,00:55:15,- Right.
00:55:15,00:55:17,"- Normally, you would just tow the whale out to sea"
00:55:17,00:55:18,"and then attach a deep weight to it, and it would sink."
00:55:18,00:55:20,"- Okay, and that would be good for the environment"
00:55:20,00:55:23,'cause animals in the bottom of the sea can feed on it.
00:55:23,00:55:25,"- Yeah, they didn't do that."
00:55:25,00:55:30,"They dug an enormous grave, and then just slid him in."
00:55:30,00:55:32,"- And is it marked as in, has it become a destination?"
00:55:32,00:55:34,"- There's a little can of stones, which marks the grave."
00:55:34,00:55:37,"It's right next to the sea, obviously, in land."
00:55:37,00:55:38,- It's not in a churchyard.
00:55:38,00:55:39,"- It was not in Birmingham, or anywhere,"
00:55:39,00:55:41,"really, really far in town, I don't know."
00:55:41,00:55:43,"- On top of a mountain, oh, we always love the altitude."
00:55:43,00:55:45,(all laughing)
00:55:45,00:55:48,"- Yeah, but they grabbed a special permission."
00:55:48,00:55:49,"There are only seven people at the funeral,"
00:55:49,00:55:50,which I find very sad.
00:55:50,00:55:51,- How many whales?
00:55:51,00:55:53,(all laughing)
00:55:53,00:55:54,- None.
00:55:54,00:55:55,"- You know, we were saying earlier"
00:55:55,00:55:59,about how killer whales might slam into a boat?
00:55:59,00:56:00,- Yeah.
00:56:00,00:56:02,- And scientists aren't quite fully sure
00:56:02,00:56:03,why that happens.
00:56:03,00:56:05,And there's a theory that the reason it happens
00:56:05,00:56:07,is because if a boat is out at sea
00:56:07,00:56:09,"and it's turned its engine off,"
00:56:09,00:56:11,they think it's possible that the killer whales
00:56:11,00:56:13,love going up to the back of the boat
00:56:13,00:56:15,and feeling the water get propelled
00:56:15,00:56:17,"through the jet, through its propeller."
00:56:17,00:56:19,"And it's a bit like a fun kind of like,"
00:56:19,00:56:21,like if you're in a jacuzzi and you've got--
00:56:21,00:56:21,"- Like a wave machine, yeah."
00:56:21,00:56:22,"- Yeah, exactly like that."
00:56:22,00:56:25,"So if they see one and it's not on,"
00:56:25,00:56:27,the thought is that they're slamming into the boat
00:56:27,00:56:30,"in frustration to make it start,"
00:56:30,00:56:31,make that thing happen that they're going to.
00:56:31,00:56:33,No one knows that for sure.
00:56:33,00:56:34,"- Well, the thing is, is if you look"
00:56:34,00:56:36,"in the newspaper archives, you do see"
00:56:36,00:56:38,that every now and then there's a spike.
00:56:38,00:56:41,"Like in 1953, there was a spike of if you search"
00:56:41,00:56:44,"for orca ramming boat or killer whale ramming boat,"
00:56:44,00:56:45,you'll see one.
00:56:45,00:56:46,There was another one in 2001.
00:56:46,00:56:49,"And it's just, I think it happens quite regularly."
00:56:49,00:56:52,"And once one of them gets in the news,"
00:56:52,00:56:53,"a few more people are like,"
00:56:53,00:56:54,"""Oh, that happened to me today,"
00:56:54,00:56:55,"so let's get in the use of it."""
00:56:55,00:56:56,"I don't know if that's true, but that's--"
00:56:56,00:56:58,"- I'm sure that's part of it, definitely, yeah."
00:56:58,00:57:01,"- They have periods, killer whales."
00:57:01,00:57:03,So one of the only other mammals to have periods.
00:57:03,00:57:07,"But, sorry, they have menopause."
00:57:07,00:57:08,"- Oh, okay."
00:57:08,00:57:09,- And they're one of the only other mammals
00:57:09,00:57:10,"to have menopause. - I'm the opposite, in fact."
00:57:10,00:57:14,(laughing)
00:57:14,00:57:17,- They have menopause and you get postmenopausal females.
00:57:17,00:57:20,"And we're not really sure why this is,"
00:57:20,00:57:21,why they have menopause.
00:57:21,00:57:24,But it has been found that postmenopausal female orcas
00:57:24,00:57:28,like to have sex with adolescent males.
00:57:28,00:57:29,"- Oh, wow. - Young males."
00:57:29,00:57:31,- And there's one particular--
00:57:31,00:57:32,- The Coopers of the Sea.
00:57:32,00:57:35,"- Exactly, yes."
00:57:35,00:57:36,"And there's a woman called Deborah Giles,"
00:57:36,00:57:38,who's Director of Research.
00:57:38,00:57:41,(laughing)
00:57:41,00:57:43,- Very hands-on research.
00:57:43,00:57:44,(laughing)
00:57:44,00:57:46,"- So in case you're listening, I'm sure you don't do that."
00:57:46,00:57:47,You might do that.
00:57:47,00:57:48,It's fine if you do.
00:57:48,00:57:50,"- Right in, right in the middle of the snow."
00:57:50,00:57:52,- Deborah has had nothing to do with any--
00:57:52,00:57:53,She's just Director of Research
00:57:53,00:57:55,at the Center for Whale Research.
00:57:55,00:58:00,"And she explains, the reason the old ladies"
00:58:00,00:58:04,"are doing this to the young boys could be,"
00:58:04,00:58:06,"so it could be to provide them with sex ed,"
00:58:06,00:58:10,"show them the ropes, show them some good moves."
00:58:10,00:58:14,And also it's because females
00:58:14,00:58:17,"who are looking for a sexually active male to copulate with,"
00:58:17,00:58:20,they reject ones that they don't think are quite up to scratch.
00:58:20,00:58:24,"And young males, when they get rejected by the female orcas,"
00:58:24,00:58:25,get really upset and pissed off
00:58:25,00:58:27,much like a young 15-year-old boy
00:58:27,00:58:29,who has been embarrassed in front of his friends
00:58:29,00:58:31,when he asks out a girl.
00:58:31,00:58:32,And it causes tensions in the group
00:58:32,00:58:35,'cause these young males act out and they get disruptive.
00:58:35,00:58:37,"So the older females who are post-menopausal,"
00:58:37,00:58:40,"so they can't, they go and have sex with them and--"
00:58:40,00:58:41,"- It's like a pity, a pity."
00:58:41,00:58:42,"- It's pity sex, yeah."
00:58:42,00:58:43,- Wow.
00:58:43,00:58:46,"- Yeah, it's Stifler's mum."
00:58:46,00:58:47,- Stifler's mum.
00:58:47,00:58:48,- It's not so much--
00:58:48,00:58:50,- Another 90s film reference for him.
00:58:50,00:58:51,(laughing)
00:58:51,00:58:55,"- Killer Whales, they like changes in altitude."
00:58:55,00:58:57,(laughing)
00:58:57,00:59:03,So if you get big ships that are kind of trying
00:59:03,00:59:07,"to catch fish at the bottom of the sea,"
00:59:07,00:59:10,then it's an easy place to get some fish
00:59:10,00:59:11,if you're a killer whale.
00:59:11,00:59:12,"Basically you go down to where they're catching it,"
00:59:12,00:59:14,if they're dredging and you might get some good--
00:59:14,00:59:15,- Oh yeah.
00:59:15,00:59:17,- Some good Patagonian tooth fish.
00:59:17,00:59:20,And they found that quite recently
00:59:20,00:59:22,there was an adult female killer whale
00:59:22,00:59:26,"who got to the depth of 1,087 meters"
00:59:26,00:59:28,in order to get these fish.
00:59:28,00:59:31,Which is about as deep as Mount Snowden is high.
00:59:31,00:59:33,- Wow.
00:59:33,00:59:35,- So that's quite a big altitude difference.
00:59:35,00:59:37,"- You say wow, it's way easier to go down than to go up."
00:59:37,00:59:39,"- No, just as I said, I like fish."
00:59:39,00:59:43,"- Okay, let's see you either walk to the top of Snowden,"
00:59:43,00:59:45,"well by the way, there's a train,"
00:59:45,00:59:48,"or go all the way 1,000 meters to the bottom of the ocean."
00:59:48,00:59:51,"- Oh look, I may not have the whale anatomy"
00:59:51,00:59:53,"that makes it as easy as it is, but it's fast."
00:59:53,00:59:54,"- Hannah, it's easier to come up,"
00:59:54,00:59:56,it's easier to float to the surface than just to sink down.
00:59:56,00:59:57,You have to actively push against the force
00:59:57,00:59:58,of all that water.
00:59:58,01:00:00,- Think of the pressure down there.
01:00:00,01:00:01,- I'm finding it a bit hard though
01:00:01,01:00:03,to visualize the Snowden reference.
01:00:03,01:00:07,How many volumes of the Anaheim of the Judson Dynasty
01:00:07,01:00:08,are we talking?
01:00:08,01:00:11,(upbeat music)
