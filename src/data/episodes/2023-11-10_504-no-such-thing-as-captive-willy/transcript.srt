00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,400
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,920
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,500
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,520
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,640
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,920
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,480
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,680
 And once again, we have gathered

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,880
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,120
 from the last seven days.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,760
 And in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,760
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,400
 - The beep was invented in 1957.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,240
 - Was it?

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,080
 - No, well.

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,920
 (laughing)

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,080
 So I got this from an article which I won't name

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,600
 because it turns out now to be incorrect.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,000
 But basically, it's about the beep that happened

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,280
 on the Sputnik satellite, it was launched in 1957.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,720
 And really annoyingly, Anna has found about 58 examples

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,000
 of beeps dating back to the mid-40th century.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
 And it's just like, welcome back, Anna.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
 - Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,240
 - She's awesome.

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,580
 - Yeah, we didn't get this from Maisie Adler,

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,400
 but I tell you that much.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,480
 Listened politely to the fact, I didn't question it.

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,920
 But it certainly, the beep became popular

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,080
 and a big thing about Sputnik was the fact that it beeped.

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,800
 And in fact, I think, I think,

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,080
 that's all Sputnik could do.

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,120
 - Pretty much what it did, yeah.

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,760
 - Yeah, it was the size of a big pumpkin

36
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,720
 and it was a ball of aluminium or metal

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,560
 and it just flew around.

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,960
 - I would say the main thing it could do

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
 was go around the earth in orbit.

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
 Like the beep was secondary almost.

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,360
 - Yeah.

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,280
 - You're right, you're right.

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,140
 The main thing was it could fly around the world.

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,980
 That's true.

45
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,640
 But no one would have known if it wasn't beeping.

46
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,480
 - Yes.

47
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
 - Because it was broadcasting radio pulses.

48
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,600
 It was orbited the earth every hour and a half, roughly.

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,880
 It beeped for 21 days only.

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,480
 But the beep was seen as quite spooky

51
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,320
 'cause you could hear it.

52
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,440
 How radio people could tune in and listen to Sputnik.

53
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,280
 - Amazing.

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,680
 - Life magazine said it was an eerie, intermittent croak.

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,020
 And for a fair number of people--

56
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,720
 - Doesn't sound like a beep, actually, does it?

57
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,560
 - No, if you--

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
 - I guess if you don't know what a beep is,

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,000
 'cause it's only been mentioned five million times

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
 in history.

61
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,960
 - I guess for a few people it would have been

62
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,840
 the first electronic beep that heard.

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
 - Pretty amazing, really.

64
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,200
 And it was the beep that changed the world, right?

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,160
 Because suddenly the Americans were like,

66
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,320
 oh shit, Russia's in space.

67
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,480
 This is evidence 'cause we can hear it beeping.

68
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,080
 We're gonna have to do something about that.

69
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,520
 And then they decided to create NASA and go to the moon.

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
 - Yeah.

71
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,760
 - There's a theory that if the Soviets hadn't launched

72
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,680
 Sputnik, or America had launched the first satellite,

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,120
 then you wouldn't have had the moon program in the same way.

74
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
 - I'm sure that's true.

75
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,120
 - You might not have had Apollo.

76
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
 'Cause it really frightened America.

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760
 - Oh, definitely.

78
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
 - Just literally a ball that went beep.

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,080
 - But the other thing is the reason it was so shiny

80
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,720
 is 'cause they also, the idea was the guy Karlov

81
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,600
 who created it or who designed it,

82
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,520
 he decided that he wanted it shiny

83
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,320
 so that people will be able to see it in space.

84
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,480
 But actually it was way too small

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
 and no one could see it.

86
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,140
 - Was it?

87
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,980
 - Yeah.

88
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,800
 I mean, if you had a really good telescope, you could, but.

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,600
 - I think you could at dawn and dusk.

90
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,560
 Although you'd have to know where to be pointing.

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,280
 It would probably be very hard to spot.

92
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
 - Not really.

93
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,080
 He wanted it to be quite a lot bigger as well

94
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,960
 so that people will be able to see it.

95
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,480
 - But it really did freak people out at the time.

96
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,320
 Even Kruschev said, "Now we not only have a rocket

97
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,800
 "that can fly to other countries,

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,880
 "but we have a satellite that flies around the world.

99
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,080
 "I don't have to point to this with my finger.

100
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
 "Any idiot can see it.

101
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
 "They might as well put bombers and fighters

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,480
 "in the museum."

103
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,920
 He was just alluding to, "We're now the superpower."

104
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,760
 - It's nukes, isn't it, is what he's referring to.

105
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,600
 If we can put that on there.

106
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,960
 - Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,280
 - Our technology is sophisticated.

108
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,680
 - And the Americans not long after

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
 tried to send up their satellite.

110
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
 That didn't work.

111
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,320
 It was called Kaputnik, I think they called it.

112
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
 Not the Americans, the Russians, making fun of it.

113
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,000
 - Yes, it was called the Vanguard.

114
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
 - Yeah.

115
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
 - The Vanguard one, yeah.

116
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,760
 And they sort of panicked after Sputnik.

117
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
 And it was, what, two months later?

118
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,280
 - Yeah.

119
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,920
 - And it was so embarrassing.

120
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,360
 It exploded on the launch pad.

121
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,200
 Then it fired into a nearby swamp.

122
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,600
 But unfortunately, the firing into a swamp

123
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,960
 had made the sensors on board think,

124
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,280
 "Oh, great, we're in orbit."

125
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,520
 So then it just started beeping from the swamp.

126
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,360
 So embarrassing.

127
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
 It's just mortifying.

128
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,560
 - As well as Kaputnik, it was also known as

129
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,560
 Flopnik, Pufnik, or Staputnik.

130
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,920
 - Staputnik, I love that.

131
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,760
 - That's great.

132
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,440
 - It's not often you think that Soviet Russia

133
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,520
 was a really fun place to be.

134
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,720
 But I think for that week,

135
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,160
 it would have been a really fun place

136
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,480
 to be hanging out in Russia.

137
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320
 - Just hilarious.

138
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,160
 - Just comedy gold.

139
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,880
 Well, do you know why they didn't choose

140
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,040
 the other project called Project Orbiter,

141
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,360
 which had more advanced technology within it?

142
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,040
 And it was run by someone, and here's your clue.

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,440
 It was run by Werner von Braun, who was,

144
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,200
 would you, in German, you'd say brown, not brawn.

145
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
 - Oh, I thought it was brawn.

146
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
 - You'd say brawn.

147
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,320
 - In English, he knows what brown is.

148
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,640
 - Well, I know him as von Braun.

149
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
 - That's how I know him.

150
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
 - Yeah.

151
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,160
 - So it was managed by Werner von Braun,

152
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,360
 who was a Nazi.

153
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,600
 And the Americans thought it might be a bit awkward

154
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,040
 if our first satellite that we get into space

155
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
 was built by a Nazi.

156
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
 So he was a Nazi who was, at the end of the war,

157
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,920
 as were quite a few Nazi scientists.

158
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,040
 He was taken on by America

159
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,280
 so they could get Nick Nazi technology.

160
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,800
 And so they started using his brain and then--

161
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
 - And his brawn.

162
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,480
 - And his brawn.

163
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,740
 (laughing)

164
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,880
 - Okay, that's it.

165
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,600
 - We can all go home now.

166
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,560
 - I like one of the cultural things that happened with this

167
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,440
 is that in the way that everything after Watergate

168
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,640
 became gate, Nick became popularized in Western cultures.

169
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,040
 So there was Peace Nick, there was Beat Nick,

170
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,680
 Neat Nick, we're all different words,

171
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,520
 but Beat Nick is one that's really stuck out for us.

172
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,480
 - I thought it came from Ludnick,

173
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,120
 which is a Yiddish word meaning a bit of a--

174
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,760
 - It did, Nick was already used as--

175
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,200
 - Nick was already being used, yes.

176
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,040
 But it popularized it.

177
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
 - It was popularized.

178
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
 (laughing)

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,080
 - In Russian, Nick is just, it means a person.

180
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,160
 Like, as in, you know, someone called Nick.

181
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,840
 Podcast Nick would be someone who makes podcasts.

182
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,000
 - Oh, that's cool, yeah.

183
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,720
 - You know how we're saying it was a massive deal

184
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,880
 and you know, Khrushchev made this huge speech saying

185
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,680
 we've conquered the world now, et cetera?

186
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,520
 - Yeah.

187
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,800
 - Well, they launched Sputnik

188
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,240
 and then no one really got that it was a big deal.

189
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,480
 Khrushchev announced it to the cocktail party he was at

190
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,400
 and everyone sort of politely clapped

191
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
 and didn't understand it.

192
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,320
 Prafter, the next day, it was like a little thing

193
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,880
 way down on their front page.

194
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,200
 - It was almost not on the front page.

195
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
 - It was almost not on the front page.

196
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,880
 - It got less prominent than Marshal Zukov

197
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,400
 visiting Yugoslavia, which arguably, in historical terms,

198
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,880
 turns out to have been a smaller story.

199
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
 (laughing)

200
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,960
 - How interesting, so why did they do that?

201
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,080
 - But it was because of how the world reacted.

202
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,040
 - It was 'cause the West reacted in the future.

203
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,600
 It was the West assumed technological superiority.

204
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,360
 - The next day in Prafter, it was all over the headlines

205
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,640
 because the U.S. had suddenly, you know,

206
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,480
 the New York Times said,

207
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,880
 "Oh my God, they've beaten us, we're flattened, we're ruined."

208
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,040
 And Rush went, "Oh, maybe this is a huge deal

209
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,400
 "that we've done this, well done us."

210
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
 And then they got really excited about it.

211
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,680
 - I did read a report saying Khrushchev announced it.

212
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
 Like, he got the news from the launchpad,

213
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
 whatever, that it was in orbit,

214
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,760
 and smiled and was happy and announced it to the room

215
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,840
 and then went to sleep that night.

216
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
 But the alternative to that is him

217
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
 remaining permanently awake for the rest of his life.

218
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,600
 (laughing)

219
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,240
 - In America, there were lots of restaurants

220
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,800
 that released merch.

221
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,960
 There was Sputnik Lollipops.

222
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
 There was a toy manufacturer, did a scooter,

223
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
 which was just the same scooter,

224
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
 but they called it Pednik.

225
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,080
 There were spherical containers that held ice creams.

226
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,600
 They would put antennas on top

227
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,560
 so that you would have the straw as the Sputnik kind of,

228
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,440
 look, 'cause they had antennae that were coming out.

229
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,200
 - Yeah, so the Lollipops have multiple stalks.

230
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,760
 - I reckon the pole is-- - Stalks, poles.

231
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,120
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

232
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,520
 - It had multiple antennae, right?

233
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
 Did it have two or four?

234
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
 - Four, I think.

235
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,040
 - Four. - Yeah, that's true.

236
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
 - That's really hard to eat a lollipop,

237
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,240
 which has got four sticks sticking in it.

238
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,680
 - Yeah. - Or four people

239
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,640
 can eat it at the same time or hold one stick

240
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,600
 and then lick it. (laughing)

241
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,920
 No?

242
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,160
 How many kids have you got done?

243
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
 Three kids. - Three, yeah.

244
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,760
 - If you could have one lollipop that you'd buy them

245
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,840
 and all three of them could eat it.

246
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
 - You contain them, they'd be in one location.

247
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,760
 (laughing)

248
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,880
 - I don't know, I think, sorry,

249
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,960
 but if they're all licking one lollipop at the same time,

250
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,520
 people are gonna think they're snogging.

251
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,360
 (laughing)

252
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,520
 And so do services, we'll get 'em for home.

253
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,560
 I mean, that's true.

254
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
 And then the next thing that happened,

255
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,280
 so obviously America's smashed back on its heels,

256
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,080
 it's reeling, the next thing happens, Sputnik II.

257
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,000
 And this one's big and it's got a dog on it.

258
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,120
 - Yeah. - And that's, you know,

259
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,960
 it's like that.

260
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,600
 - And that was when they invented the bark, wasn't it?

261
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,360
 (laughing)

262
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,880
 - And that was Paul Bloody Leica,

263
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,840
 who had a pretty rotten time in space

264
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,120
 and then sort of conked out.

265
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,640
 - Which means barker, in fact, Leica, isn't it?

266
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
 - I think she was causing me else.

268
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,480
 - What all this was leading up to

269
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,160
 was the 40th anniversary of the Soviet Union

270
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,360
 being founded, right, 'cause it's 1957,

271
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,640
 October, October Revolution, all of that stuff,

272
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,280
 November, depending on the calendar.

273
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,120
 Anyway, there was a theory in the West

274
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,320
 that the Soviet Union was launching a third Sputnik,

275
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,280
 which was going to go to the moon

276
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,400
 with a hydrogen bomb on it.

277
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,240
 - And an elephant.

278
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,720
 (laughing)

279
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,760
 - And there was a lunar eclipse coming up,

280
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,920
 so the moon was going to be completely blotted out,

281
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,720
 you know, in the shadow of the sun,

282
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,400
 or shadow of the earth, sorry.

283
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,560
 So the theory was that they were gonna detonate

284
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
 the bomb against the moon

285
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,680
 and create a kind of super full moon,

286
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,720
 'cause it would be even brighter than a normal full moon

287
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,360
 with this, you know.

288
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,840
 And anyway, they weren't doing that.

289
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,040
 - Well, they did do lots of Sputnik,

290
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,640
 well, Sputnik just means satellite,

291
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,040
 so anything that they send up is a Sputnik, basically.

292
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,320
 But yeah, they've done 20 odd, I think, now.

293
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,520
 - But none of them have been the moon blowing up.

294
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
 No, which was a stupid idea.

295
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,080
 I don't even think I'd know if I saw something

296
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,800
 that was a bit brighter and a bit bigger than the moon,

297
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,560
 'cause you haven't got the actual moon to compare it to.

298
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
 - Yeah, maybe.

299
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,160
 - Well, it would be a full moon for a second

300
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,280
 as the detonation happened.

301
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,600
 You would think something was up.

302
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,880
 - Every now and then, like once every month or so,

303
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
 do you not go outside and go up?

304
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,240
 The moon's quite big tonight.

305
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

306
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,960
 It's a certain time of day, isn't it?

307
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,560
 Yeah, do you think that's always a Sputnik?

308
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
 - I think that's it.

309
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,560
 Every morning, when the moon is near the horizon,

310
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
 that's the Russians blowing it up.

311
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,520
 - Oh, I think they're wasting a lot of resources on this.

312
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,400
 - Yuri Gagarin, first man to orbit the Earth?

313
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,240
 - Yep.

314
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,080
 - Cosmonauts? - First man in space.

315
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,920
 - First man in space.

316
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,760
 - Was he?

317
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
 I thought someone had gone up a bit before that, but not.

318
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
 - Gone past the carman line.

319
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
 - He was the first.

320
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,280
 - That space.

321
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,960
 - Yuri's, yeah, acknowledged as first.

322
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,800
 - I'm a carman waiting in the sky.

323
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,400
 Was originally written about that.

324
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,080
 - He was five foot two,

325
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,560
 which means that he would only just qualify it

326
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,280
 to be an air stewardess on Ryanair.

327
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,120
 - Right.

328
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
 - But.

329
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
 - Which was his dream, wasn't it?

330
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,520
 - It's what he was trying to do all that time.

331
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,480
 He was just trying to get the attention of Michael O'Leary.

332
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
 - I mean, it was really bad.

333
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
 Because the first time he went in space,

334
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,520
 it was one thing, but he had to pay for his seat.

335
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,200
 - And you know the space dogs?

336
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
 - The Soviet ones.

337
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,880
 - Lika?

338
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,720
 - Lika.

339
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,000
 Well, there's an argument that they preserved peace

340
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,440
 and stopped the world from imploding,

341
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
 exploding due to nuclear attack.

342
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
 And here is the argument.

343
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,800
 So in 1960, the Soviets sent up some more dogs.

344
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,280
 They were called Belka and Strelka.

345
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,280
 And they went into orbit with some rats

346
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,360
 and a rabbit and some flies.

347
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
 And they orbited the world 17 times

348
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
 and they came back down and they were big celebrities.

349
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,560
 They had chat shows and stuff.

350
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
 - Who had chat shows?

351
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,120
 - I don't think they actually hosted their own chat shows.

352
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,960
 Sorry.

353
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,880
 I think they might have just guessed it.

354
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,240
 They wrote in a small segment.

355
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,360
 - But hosting is a good idea.

356
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
 Every week the guest has to feed Belka and Strelka.

357
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
 I think that's a really nice idea.

358
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
 - Lovely.

359
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,400
 Let's pitch it.

360
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,240
 It's our next commission.

361
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,120
 Anyway, so they were the first dogs who survived

362
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,920
 'cause some people were a bit sad that Lika didn't.

363
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,480
 Anyway, soon after that, JFK and Kristoff

364
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,800
 and their wives had a meeting, a summit,

365
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,320
 in Vienna and it was awkward as things often were

366
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,240
 at the time between America and the USSR.

367
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,960
 And then Jackie Kennedy broke the tension

368
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,880
 by saying to Kristoff,

369
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,600
 "Oh, what happened to those two lovely dogs

370
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,280
 "that you sent into space, by the way?"

371
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,640
 And Kristoff said, "Oh, they actually had puppies.

372
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
 "Do you want one?"

373
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
 And he posted to her.

374
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
 So a few weeks later--

375
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,560
 (laughing)

376
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,520
 - It arrived, unfortunately.

377
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,160
 Not quite as alive as it was in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

378
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
 (laughing)

379
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,080
 Oh no, he put the bubble wrap in the envelope and it was fine.

380
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,440
 Yeah, so a puppy arrived at the White House.

381
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
 - Were they called pupnics?

382
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,040
 - I actually think they might have called them pupnics.

383
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
 - That would make sense.

384
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,720
 - That rings a bell.

385
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,560
 It would make sense.

386
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
 I think they had the same sense of humor as you did

387
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,080
 in the White House at the time.

388
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,680
 - Okay, I'm just gonna collect Spot the Dog.

389
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,200
 - Oh yeah, Spotnick.

390
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
 - Suggestions.

391
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
 - Mudnick.

392
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
 Mudnick.

393
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,560
 There we go.

394
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,400
 - Yeah, very good.

395
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,240
 - Mudnick.

396
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
 - Just edit out my one,

397
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,920
 you got three really good ones.

398
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,160
 (laughing)

399
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
 - So keep that comment in so everyone will always want that.

400
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,880
 Write in with your speculations

401
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,040
 as to Annie's shit suggestion.

402
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,800
 (laughing)

403
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,280
 Anyway, he was a White House puppy pet

404
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,080
 and it really calmed things down.

405
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
 I mean, obviously things didn't remain calm

406
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,200
 for the subsequent 30 years.

407
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,040
 - That's sad.

408
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,360
 Yelka and Stelka are the only ones

409
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,240
 that you learn about in Russian schools really.

410
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,200
 They don't really mention Leica very much.

411
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

412
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,860
 So sad.

413
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,700
 After Leica went up,

414
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,640
 dog lovers worldwide protested.

415
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,880
 There was a march at the UN

416
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,160
 with featuring dogs wearing protest signs.

417
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,000
 - Wow.

418
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
 There was also a producer of a chat,

419
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,080
 so I was like, what am I gonna do now?

420
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,720
 (laughing)

421
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,800
 - Can we say a thing or two about Beeps?

422
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,040
 - Oh sure, yeah.

423
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,040
 We don't have time to list all the previous Beeps

424
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,880
 prior to this one.

425
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
 - Let's see how far we get.

426
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,080
 So this is a really fun thing about Beeps.

427
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,580
 Skodas, right, the cars.

428
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,420
 - Oh yeah.

429
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,880
 - The horns get tested, don't they?

430
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,720
 Car horns get tested.

431
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,480
 And these days they're tested way more

432
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
 in the development process

433
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,560
 than they ever have been before.

434
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,400
 - Okay.

435
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,440
 - So Skodas in the '70s were tested 50,000 times

436
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,320
 to make sure they wouldn't run out of Beeps

437
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,160
 after that.

438
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,360
 - Sorry, you beeped a horn 50,000 times

439
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,400
 before selling the car.

440
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,240
 - I don't think.

441
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
 (laughing)

442
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,120
 - You beeped it 50,000 first and it ran out.

443
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
 - No, no, no.

444
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,800
 - You do that in the car dealership.

445
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,640
 (laughing)

446
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,480
 I'm just gonna go quick.

447
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,320
 (laughing)

448
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,160
 That doesn't happen.

449
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,980
 - 50,000.

450
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,120
 - Every car that Skoda sells.

451
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,960
 (laughing)

452
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,800
 - Okay.

453
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,640
 - It happens.

454
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,480
 - It happens in the development process.

455
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,680
 - 'Cause I have a Skoda and I've got this big handprint

456
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,000
 in the middle of my steering wheel.

457
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,280
 - Everyone's dry.

458
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,600
 - Do they not crash test every car

459
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,680
 before they sell that there's one?

460
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,560
 (laughing)

461
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,880
 Just gonna drive this into a wall

462
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,360
 before we send it to you, sir?

463
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,640
 (laughing)

464
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,480
 - So no.

465
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,320
 - Sorry, yeah.

466
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,160
 - They test it.

467
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
 - But these days, electric Skodas,

468
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,520
 they get 150,000.

469
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,960
 But that's regionally specific.

470
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,240
 And when they sell cars in India,

471
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
 they're tested 500,000 times.

472
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,400
 - What?

473
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
 - 'Cause in India, use of the car horn is way bigger.

474
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
 Like, everyone is beeping all the time.

475
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,960
 So they have to test half a million honks before.

476
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,800
 - Wow.

477
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,880
 - I was saying in India,

478
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,120
 like they do honk in the way you're supposed to honk.

479
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,080
 As the only time you're ever supposed to honk

480
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,680
 is if someone, to let someone know

481
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,160
 you're there to stop an accident.

482
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,000
 - Right.

483
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
 - If you drive in India,

484
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
 they're doing that because they're about to drive into you

485
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,560
 and they're honking and stuff.

486
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,720
 They don't do it in the UK like honk, honk,

487
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,760
 the traffic light's gone, you need to move.

488
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,200
 - Oh, yeah, that's true.

489
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,560
 - They do proper honking in India.

490
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,280
 - I think you're also encouraged to honk

491
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,560
 as a way of saying goodbye to somebody

492
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,920
 not gonna see you for a few weeks, aren't you?

493
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,280
 - That's actually, yeah, that's the only other time.

494
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
 - Is that the highway cut?

495
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,120
 - It's in the highway cut, is it?

496
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

497
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,520
 - And also honk if you love blah,

498
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,280
 whatever's on the sign at the side of the line.

499
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,560
 That's important too.

500
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,840
 (laughing)

501
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,280
 - So when buying a car, as well as asking for mileage,

502
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,560
 you should ask for a honkage, is that what we're saying?

503
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
 - How many honks you've got,

504
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,080
 how many honks you've packed into this bad boy?

505
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,320
 (laughing)

506
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,900
 (upbeat music)

507
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,940
 (upbeat music)

508
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,020
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

509
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,460
 and that is James.

510
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,340
 - Okay, my fact this week is that William Gladstone

511
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,820
 once canceled an evening engagement

512
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,540
 so he could binge on the latest popular drama series.

513
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,020
 (laughing)

514
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,300
 So this is William Gladstone,

515
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,260
 who was a British prime minister,

516
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,260
 and quite famously quite door and serious and whatever.

517
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,380
 So I quite like the idea of him,

518
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,820
 you know, watching Breaking Bad or whatever.

519
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,500
 But obviously this wasn't that.

520
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,260
 This was The Woman in White,

521
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,240
 which was a story by Wilkie Collins,

522
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,300
 which was originally done in...

523
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,780
 - Cereals.

524
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,340
 - It was originally sold in breakfast cereals.

525
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,180
 (laughing)

526
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,060
 So it was a free gift at the bottom of our flex boxes.

527
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,900
 And it was originally done in cereals, in magazines,

528
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,700
 and then the entire book came out in 1860, I think,

529
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,660
 1859, 1860, and he got it and he wanted to read it.

530
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
 So he just canceled his...

531
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,500
 - I love it.

532
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,340
 - It's so great. - I love it.

533
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,340
 Imagine...

534
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
 - What if he was taking a date, though?

535
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,300
 Do you still love it?

536
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,140
 - Oh!

537
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,300
 - What if the date went to the theater,

538
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,040
 and I was like, "Where's Willie?"

539
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,880
 (laughing)

540
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,520
 - He's with Wilkie.

541
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,980
 - He's with William Wilkie.

542
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,820
 - You don't get...

543
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,660
 What's he called Wilkie?

544
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,500
 What's that his name?

545
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,320
 - He knows his middle name,

546
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,700
 so he was William Wilkie Collins.

547
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,620
 - Okay, but I'm just saying you don't get Wilkie's anymore.

548
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,580
 - Well, actually, he wanted to be called Wilkie,

549
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,020
 so he insisted that you never call him Mr. Collins,

550
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,780
 or you never call him William Collins or whatever.

551
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,260
 He insisted that everyone just called him Cher or Madonna.

552
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,420
 He was just Wilkie.

553
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,260
 - Really?

554
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,580
 - Well, 'cause his dad and his grandfather,

555
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,140
 I think, were both Williams as well.

556
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,620
 So I think it was one of those cases

557
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,900
 where the middle name suddenly became the first name,

558
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,700
 and it was an honorary first name.

559
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,900
 - But I think he wanted us to drop the surname as well.

560
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,620
 We should just be saying Wilkie.

561
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,620
 - Well, that's what he wanted, but you know.

562
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,300
 - I think we should do what shows him respect for the guy.

563
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,140
 - Yeah.

564
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,700
 - The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says

565
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,820
 it was typical of his dislike of formality,

566
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,980
 'cause he was quite an odd cookie.

567
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,060
 - He was a rum-cove, and he was rum.

568
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
 Can we talk about the book quickly?

569
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,220
 - Yeah, let's do that.

570
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,100
 - 'Cause the book is, it's really good.

571
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,540
 - Have you read it?

572
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,900
 - I have read it, I mean, years and years ago.

573
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,420
 - Yeah, I have, and I'm really excited to.

574
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,400
 - I've read "The Woman in White" and "The Moonstone,"

575
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,060
 and he wrote, I think, about 20 novels,

576
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,420
 and those are the two sort of big hits.

577
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,940
 - I've read the first 50 pages

578
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,780
 'cause I bought it on Tuesday, and--

579
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,620
 - It's pretty good.

580
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,640
 - Really big, isn't it really big?

581
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,480
 - Yeah, it's huge.

582
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,220
 - But they got paid by writing a chapter at a time,

583
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,540
 so you would, you just, and so it came out in this magazine.

584
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,460
 It was a Dickens-owned magazine called "All the Year Round,"

585
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,780
 and when it was first published in chapter four,

586
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,140
 chapter by chapter sales, went from 40,000 to 300,000.

587
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,500
 It was mega, it was so exciting.

588
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,260
 - But it's weird that he caused Dickens's publication

589
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,100
 to become so popular, because he actually,

590
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,220
 kind of, hero worshiped Dickens, didn't he?

591
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,140
 Whereas really, Dickens should have been thanking him

592
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,220
 for making his magazine, "All Year Round,"

593
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,660
 or whatever, go through the route.

594
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,940
 - Well, he was younger, he was a protege of Dickens,

595
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,780
 and then Dickens quickly fell in love with him

596
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,860
 and sort of the roles slightly reversed,

597
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,300
 where he sort of was inspired by Wilkie's writing.

598
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,100
 - But he did do this weird, like, Dickens tribute tour,

599
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,780
 'cause we've talked about Dickens traveling around the world

600
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,660
 and giving lectures, and then he immediately traveled

601
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,540
 around the world giving public readings

602
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,740
 and going to the same locations that Dickens had.

603
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,940
 - Wow. - I think he took holidays

604
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,020
 at Dickens' favorite holiday resorts.

605
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,860
 - Did he?

606
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,260
 And then they fell out, didn't they?

607
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,100
 - Did they?

608
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,140
 - They fell out because Charles Dickens' daughter, Kate,

609
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,020
 married Wilkie Collins' brother, Charles.

610
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,140
 - Oh!

611
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,780
 - And they really properly fell out,

612
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,620
 and then Collins started really slagging off all of his books.

613
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
 He called Barnaby Road the weakest book

614
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,940
 that Dickens ever wrote.

615
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,980
 - To be fair, that's true,

616
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,140
 and I don't think that's necessarily

617
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,220
 slagging off his books, is it?

618
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,500
 - He was ranking them, he was ranking them.

619
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,340
 - He was ranking them, yeah.

620
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,540
 - Imagine if I'd ranked all the episodes

621
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,500
 of this podcast in order, which I definitely haven't,

622
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,420
 so we should--

623
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,900
 - He then went on to say that Dombie and son's

624
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,700
 no intelligent person can have read it

625
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,780
 without astonishment of the badness of it.

626
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,180
 - Yeah, I guess. - That's not good, yeah.

627
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,020
 - Critique.

628
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,620
 - He called in Edwin Drude the melancholy work

629
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,060
 of a worn-out brain.

630
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,820
 - Oh, God, well, that was fun finish, that's unfair.

631
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,860
 - Yeah, and he must have said it

632
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,040
 after Dickens died as well, right?

633
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,980
 - Yeah, there's stories that he was asked to finish, Drude,

634
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,060
 'cause they thought that he knew Dickens so well

635
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,900
 in the writing style.

636
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,740
 - Well, that's weird, 'cause Collins,

637
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,460
 when he was writing a book called No Name,

638
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,980
 he got really ill, and Dickens offered to take over.

639
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
 He said, "I know you don't need the help,

640
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,940
 but if just in case you do want that finished,

641
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,780
 I can do it for you."

642
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,420
 So they both were involved in that kind of project.

643
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,500
 That thing of them, so Dickens' daughter

644
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,940
 marrying Wilkie Collins' brother,

645
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,100
 I guess they would have been the same age

646
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,940
 'cause Collins was a much younger man.

647
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,780
 But part of the reason that Dickens really didn't like

648
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,300
 the situation was that Wilkie Collins' brother, Charles,

649
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,100
 was apparently a complete, just like milk toast, wet blanket.

650
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,180
 - Well, he wasn't very wet because he refused to have baths

651
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,860
 because he almost drowned when he was five years old,

652
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,460
 and he was petrified by water for the rest of his life

653
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,360
 and wouldn't even get into a bath.

654
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,200
 - Right.

655
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,140
 - Okay, that might have been part of it.

656
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,900
 But it's so weird, 'cause they looked, apparently,

657
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,940
 both sibling and child Dickens' daughter, Katie,

658
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,060
 they both looked the most like.

659
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,780
 Like, Wilkie Collins' brother looked just like him,

660
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,780
 and Katie Dickens looked just like Charles Dickens.

661
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,100
 - Oh, really, okay.

662
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,140
 - She had their little goatee beard, didn't she?

663
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,980
 - Yeah.

665
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,820
 - That's very funny.

666
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,100
 - They met through a bloke called Augustus Egg.

667
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,980
 That was their mutual friend, I know.

668
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,420
 - Who did Wilkie and Dickens with her?

669
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,300
 - Dickens and Collins, yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,340
 And they went on holiday with Egg,

671
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,940
 and Collins lectured Egg on art,

672
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,660
 and hummed opera airs incorrectly and interminably

673
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,500
 was the report.

674
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,340
 - The meeting of those two,

675
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,780
 they actually met because they were acting

676
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,020
 in the same play at the time, right?

677
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,140
 So Dickens brought him onto a production.

678
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,060
 - The play that they met in was by Edward Bill Williton,

679
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,220
 who wrote, "It was a dark and stormy night."

680
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,460
 He's the guy who wrote that sentence.

681
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,300
 - Yes.

682
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,140
 - And this is the great thing.

683
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,940
 Okay, so this looks back to the woman in white

684
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,660
 because Bill Williton hated the woman in white.

685
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,180
 He said it was great trash.

686
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,660
 I think he meant big trash rather than like,

687
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,180
 "Oh, it's great trash," you know?

688
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,220
 And the point is that Bill Williton had had his wife,

689
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,940
 Rosina, committed to an asylum a couple of years before,

690
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,180
 and that plotline is in the woman in white.

691
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,020
 - That's how interesting.

692
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,220
 - And all of Collins' works in some way.

693
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,340
 Loads of them are about women being mistreated by men,

694
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,780
 or being, you know, like--

695
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,180
 - There's very much to spoil if you haven't read

696
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,340
 the woman in white, by the way.

697
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,180
 - Oh, yeah, that's right.

698
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,540
 - Then let's start from the end at this stage.

699
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,380
 - Can I just say, I don't think we should be giving

700
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,500
 a spy list of classic words in this picture.

701
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,300
 - Yeah, but Collins dedicated the book to the man

702
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,580
 who, the commissioner for lunacy was his title,

703
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,100
 who had helped release Rosina from the asylum.

704
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,940
 - Really?

705
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,220
 - So obviously, Bill Williton hated the book

706
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,980
 because it was such a slam on him in a way.

707
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,100
 - It turns out, and yeah, that makes sense

708
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,300
 'cause I was reading an obituary of Wilkie Collins

709
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,740
 just after he died, and this friend of his who was writing it

710
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,100
 said that when he wrote the woman in white,

711
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,300
 Collins had told him he received a letter

712
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,020
 from Rosina, Lytton's wife, who said,

713
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,060
 "I really enjoyed your book,

714
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,820
 "but I thought the villain," she said, "Camp Fosco.

715
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,700
 "I thought the villain was a really poor villain,

716
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,220
 "not realistic at all, you know.

717
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,780
 "Next time if you want a villain, come to me.

718
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,660
 "I have my eyes upon a villain every minute of the day.

719
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,100
 "It is my husband."

720
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,420
 - Oh, nice.

721
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,340
 - So one of those things that happened

722
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,980
 when the book came out is it was one of those things

723
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,620
 we've spoken about where when things take off,

724
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,220
 the merch just starts rolling in.

725
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,740
 You know, there was a waltz that was named after it.

726
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,820
 There were cloaks, there were hats.

727
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,700
 Perfumes were made that were sort of like meant to be

728
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,220
 the woman in white's perfume.

729
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,340
 It was just full of merch around London.

730
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,380
 - Walter became a fashionable name for babies

731
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,460
 'cause there's a character named Walter.

732
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,820
 - Right, did it, that was the thing.

733
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,100
 - Yeah, Walter's the hero, isn't he?

734
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,700
 The kind of slightly boring hero,

735
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,660
 and the heroine is slightly boring as well.

736
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,420
 - Wow, so I'm not allowed to spoiler the ending,

737
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,500
 but you're allowed to spoiler the fact

738
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,380
 that people in it are slightly boring.

739
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,220
 - Terrible.

740
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,260
 - It's not a spoiler, I think that's more of an opinion.

741
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,460
 Do you know what really annoys me

742
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,020
 about basically all adaptations?

743
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,980
 - And this applies to lots of stuff,

744
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,500
 but I'm gonna use the woman in white to vent.

745
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,300
 There have been loads of films and TV series of it

746
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,940
 over the years, and the most recent was 2018 I saw

747
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,940
 with Jesse Buckley in it, who's an attractive actress.

748
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,420
 And the thing that I remember from the woman in white

749
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,060
 is that there are these two quite extreme characters

750
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,340
 who are the real good characters.

751
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,340
 There's Count Fosco, who's this hugely fat Italian villain,

752
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,940
 and then there's Marion, who is very sharp,

753
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,460
 very bright, very bold, and very ugly.

754
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,140
 She's got a moustache, she's got a huge masculine jaw.

755
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,500
 She's ugly enough that Walt was almost repulsed by her when,

756
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,460
 'cause she looks really attractive from behind.

757
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,460
 It's one of those weird sort of '90s rom-com reveals.

758
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,220
 She turns around, and he's like, "Oh, that face!"

759
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,420
 - Is this "Shallow Hell?"

760
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,980
 Is "Shallow Hell" based on one of the words?

761
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,020
 (all laughing)

762
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,220
 - I think it must have been said, "Shallow Hell."

763
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,620
 - Have you thought she looked attractive from behind?

764
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,740
 And yeah, every single adaptation, she's not ugly.

765
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,580
 - How interesting.

766
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,020
 Do you think that the actors

767
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,860
 are taking away jobs from ugly actors?

768
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,700
 - I genuinely do.

769
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,620
 I really think that they are quite incredibly annoying.

770
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,700
 No, they sort of make themselves look a bit tomboyish.

771
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,500
 And I think it's bullshit in entertainment today.

772
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,300
 You don't do it with men.

773
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,180
 - No, they do fit people up a lot.

774
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,020
 - Yeah, yeah.

775
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,260
 - Well, they just pick a fit actress to play an ugly role,

776
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,580
 'cause they think that people can't handle

777
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,900
 watching an unattractive woman.

778
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,740
 - Okay, yeah.

779
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,980
 - Do they mention it in the dialogue?

780
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,300
 Like, as if people go up to her in the movie

781
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,620
 and go, "You're an ugly person."

782
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,460
 (all laughing)

783
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,220
 And she's just then looking stunning.

784
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,660
 And I'm like, "Oh, yes, I know this face."

785
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,940
 Stop, I'm completely dark.

786
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,780
 - It does happen, the Jack Reacher books,

787
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,740
 those were adapted, and they put Tom Cruise in the role.

788
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,900
 And that was the biggest uproar about the whole thing,

789
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,140
 is that he's meant to be six foot 10.

790
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,700
 He's meant to be hulkingly massive.

791
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,900
 - And then you've got this. - That's just drastic miscasting.

792
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,140
 As in, obviously, Tom Cruise is brilliant,

793
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,700
 but he doesn't look like Jack Reacher,

794
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,460
 who I think at one point stops a bullet with his chest.

795
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,780
 (all laughing)

796
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,380
 I think at one point in the books, anyway.

797
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,940
 Can we talk a bit about "Working Colourns?"

798
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,460
 - Yeah.

799
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,700
 - So his health situation was quite interesting,

800
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,040
 because it was bad, he had bad health.

801
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,300
 If he had good health, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting.

802
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,660
 - Unless it was really good.

803
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,900
 - One of it was so good, he was still alive.

804
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,740
 - Then he'd be alive.

805
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,580
 - Yeah.

806
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,540
 - As it was, he had neuralgia, rheumatism,

807
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,060
 spasm suffocation, I don't think we know what that was,

808
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,260
 gout in the eyes, a boil on his groin.

809
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,020
 At one point, his partner Caroline had to mesmerize his feet

810
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,180
 to try and cure them.

811
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,020
 - Oh, wow.

812
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,860
 - Yeah.

813
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,700
 - How do you mesmerize?

814
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,860
 We've talked about mesmerism before,

815
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,900
 but how do you do it to feet?

816
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,740
 - You know, when you sit down on your leg for too long,

817
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,580
 and it goes to sleep.

818
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,420
 - Yeah.

819
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,260
 - Is that it?

820
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,100
 - It's gotta be that.

821
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,240
 Yeah, it's gotta be something like that.

822
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,180
 - You just sat on them.

823
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,020
 - I don't know.

824
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,840
 - 'Cause he had gout eyes,

825
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,100
 so he couldn't do it through mesmerizing his eyes.

826
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,660
 Like, they were really bunged up.

827
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,060
 - Well, you don't get gout in your eyes.

828
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,900
 - That's what I thought.

829
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,480
 - No, I know, but when you read the descriptions

830
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,620
 of what happened to his eyes,

831
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,020
 they were bleeding, they were pussy, they were--

832
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,340
 - But I believe, again,

833
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,740
 this is based on this obit written by his friend.

834
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,980
 He said that he went round to his house when he was older,

835
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,620
 and he couldn't stop looking at his eyes,

836
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,780
 'cause they looked so weird,

837
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,060
 and he couldn't really meet your eye properly.

838
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,900
 And eventually, Colin said,

839
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
 "I see you're looking at my eyes.

840
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
 "I know it's distracting.

841
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,680
 "I've got gout eye," and the friend implies,

842
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,860
 and we know this is a fact,

843
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,820
 that it's probably all the Lordenham he was taking.

844
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,660
 - Yeah, yeah, it's so neat.

845
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,300
 - His eyes to come up quite blurry, rather than--

846
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,140
 - Oh, of course.

847
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,960
 - It wasn't a disease of the eye.

848
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,300
 He was just off his face all the time.

849
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,260
 - It's gonna be great in his biopic

850
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,620
 when Tom Cruise is playing him,

851
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,020
 and they're saying, "Your eyes, they're horrible."

852
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,580
 (all laughing)

853
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,940
 - Apparently, he was taking enough

854
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,180
 to kill six people every day.

855
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,020
 - Yeah.

856
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,820
 - And he was also taking poppers

857
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,060
 in about the same amount for his heart.

858
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,220
 - Didn't see a student in the early 2000s.

859
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,140
 - Wait, did poppers, I didn't think poppers existed.

860
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,860
 - Well, I'm ill nitrate.

861
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,700
 - Oh, right.

862
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
 - So, yeah, that's--

863
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,660
 - They didn't come in this fun,

864
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,660
 colorful packets that they do now.

865
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,160
 - I wouldn't know, actually.

866
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,700
 (all laughing)

867
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,900
 - And he was taking arsenic as well at the same time.

868
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,740
 - Oh, my God.

869
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,420
 - All that meant that he saw ghosts all the time.

870
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,980
 - Oh, yeah.

871
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,540
 - Yeah, he thought he had a doppelganger,

872
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,980
 a ghost willky, that was with him.

873
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,820
 - And it was just a mirror, wasn't it?

874
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,220
 - How did he come up with that amazing name for the ghost?

875
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,340
 - He's one of the best.

876
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,100
 - Yeah, he would, like Dan says,

877
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,220
 the doppelganger would be around,

878
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,980
 there would be ghosts pushing down the stairs

879
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,540
 when he was trying to go up to bed,

880
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,500
 so he couldn't climb it.

881
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,340
 A bit, you know, that dream that people have

882
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,540
 where you just can't get up a hill

883
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,380
 and kind of be quicksand, that kind of thing,

884
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,220
 but it was ghosts pushing him down.

885
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,740
 And then when he got to the top of the stairs,

886
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,620
 he would be met by a green woman with tusks.

887
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,460
 - Oh.

888
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,940
 - I mean, do you think maybe you're only taking enough

889
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,420
 to kill five people a day, might be a good idea, will you?

890
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,060
 - No, no.

891
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,020
 - And his love life as well was absolutely,

892
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,300
 it was just really interesting.

893
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,140
 It was kind of--

894
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,980
 - For the time, I guess it was--

895
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,980
 - Interesting because he was someone of the best.

896
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,220
 (laughing)

897
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,380
 - He's very healthy.

898
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,060
 - No, interesting even for today, I would say, Dan.

899
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,180
 If someone these days had this love life,

900
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,060
 I would be interested, I want to know more.

901
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,220
 He didn't want to marry, fine,

902
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
 and he was in a relationship

903
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
 with a woman called Caroline Graves.

904
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,940
 She was a widow, she had a child from earlier relationship.

905
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,660
 And then he started an affair

906
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,540
 with a woman called Martha Rudd, right?

907
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,260
 And she was, I think, about 20 when they met.

908
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,180
 And they had three children together.

909
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,100
 Caroline Graves didn't love this.

910
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,420
 She went off to marry someone else.

911
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,260
 - Fair enough.

912
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,900
 - Completely fair enough.

913
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,980
 And he actually went to the wedding,

914
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,220
 so it might have been all--

915
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,460
 - I think it was quite friendly.

916
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,300
 - Yeah.

917
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,620
 - I got the impression there wasn't too much resentment.

918
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,580
 - So that's good.

919
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,300
 So then Wilkie Collins is in a relationship

920
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,500
 with his new woman, Martha Rudd.

921
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,540
 They have three children together.

922
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,820
 He sort of keeps them in a flat away from his house.

923
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,740
 And he only wants to be known as Dawson

924
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,660
 when he goes over, I think.

925
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,500
 - Cool.

926
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,020
 - He just sort of has an assumed name for the landlady.

927
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,780
 He doesn't want any publicity, all of that.

928
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,060
 But then Caroline, his previous partner,

929
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,100
 her marriage doesn't work out.

930
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,380
 So she comes back, she lives with him,

931
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,300
 and he's just rattling between two families back and forth.

932
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,540
 And then sometimes he takes them all on holiday together

933
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,580
 to Ramsgate and puts them in boarding houses

934
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,300
 next to each other and all the kids play together.

935
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,140
 And they have a great time.

936
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,300
 - I think the kids play together,

937
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,700
 but the women never meet.

938
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,540
 - Yeah.

939
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,380
 - It's weird.

940
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,220
 - It's so weird.

941
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,180
 - And he's at one, I presume at one house or the other

942
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,020
 all the time.

943
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,860
 - Wow.

944
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,220
 - And they just have to kind of, that's the situation.

945
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,780
 - It sounds like a sort of amateur play

946
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,220
 where the women are both played by the same person.

947
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,780
 'Cause it's so important they never meet.

948
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,460
 They live basically on the same street.

949
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,300
 - Yeah.

950
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,140
 - Yeah, yeah.

951
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,980
 - Exactly.

952
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
 - They walk out of the door and they're like,

953
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,700
 "Oh, you just missed it."

954
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
 - Exactly.

955
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,300
 And she's going to drive it out of breath.

956
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,460
 "Oh, you missed it."

957
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,140
 - That's married Mrs. Doubtfully.

958
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,220
 (laughing)

959
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,460
 - Do you know when Martha was born?

960
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,300
 - No.

961
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,780
 - She was born in Martham.

962
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,820
 (laughing)

963
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,060
 - That sounds like you just conjugated her name.

964
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,700
 - It's the accusative, actually.

965
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,740
 Yeah, very unimaginative parents, Martham in Norfolk.

966
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,580
 - I was going to say, where the heck is Martham?

967
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,940
 - I think it's a village in Norfolk.

968
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,780
 - That's so good.

969
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,380
 - So did they name her after the village?

970
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,220
 - Not clear.

971
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,060
 Did try to find out.

972
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,260
 Funnily enough, it wasn't one of those facts

973
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,860
 that's been recorded to history,

974
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
 as far as I could tell.

975
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,860
 I wasn't born in Peniston.

976
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,660
 (laughing)

977
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,860
 - If you are in Martham listening to this now,

978
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,620
 please write in.

979
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,460
 - Yeah.

980
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,500
 - Just tell us what it's like.

981
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,340
 - Yeah.

982
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,180
 - Send us a photo.

983
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,660
 (laughing)

984
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,820
 - I know I'm a bit unsure about that,

985
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,300
 but you don't do the emails anymore,

986
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,140
 rather.

987
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,980
 - Oh, yeah, sorry.

988
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,740
 Of course, inundate us with emails.

989
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,580
 (laughing)

990
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
 Everyone from Martham.

991
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,940
 - If you've ever been to Martham,

992
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,540
 or been any place beginning with that,

993
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,380
 then write it.

994
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,220
 (laughing)

995
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,340
 'Cause the last time I said that,

996
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,180
 I said something like,

997
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,500
 if you are eating particular foods

998
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 in America right now,

999
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
 and it was thanks to that bloke,

1000
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,180
 David Fairchild, who imported them all.

1001
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,660
 And we got a lot of emails of people eating avocados,

1002
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,700
 people eating rice.

1003
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,860
 I can't remember what it was,

1004
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,700
 but it was a lot.

1005
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,660
 - Martha tended,

1006
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,620
 so Martha said she could have married Wilkie Collins

1007
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,460
 whenever she wanted.

1008
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,180
 That was a bit of a lady that had to protest too much thing.

1009
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,020
 But she didn't go to his funeral,

1010
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,140
 nor did their kids, weirdly.

1011
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,900
 But then, she did.

1012
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,700
 - She was there, but she was called Caroline Gray.

1013
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,420
 (laughing)

1014
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,580
 - Where's Martha?

1015
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,900
 (laughing)

1016
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,260
 - She did go to the balloon.

1017
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,900
 (laughing)

1018
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,100
 After Caroline died,

1019
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,420
 she took over tending Wilkie Collins grave.

1020
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,660
 So it just seems like there's so much happening

1021
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,020
 below the surface we don't know about.

1022
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,260
 - Caroline was also buried in that grave.

1023
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,020
 - Yes, Caroline was buried in the same plot.

1024
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
 - I suppose she tended Caroline's grave as well,

1025
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,660
 but she quickly dug herself into the coffin for a while.

1026
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,500
 (laughing)

1027
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,900
 Oh, thanks for looking up to my grave.

1028
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,020
 Clives out of the coffin, no problem.

1029
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,260
 (laughing)

1030
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:42,300
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

1031
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,460
 and that is my fact.

1032
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,740
 My fact this week is that 15th century Korean royals

1033
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,860
 had their lives so thoroughly documented

1034
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,020
 that the records include kings complaining

1035
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,540
 about their recorders recording them.

1036
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,220
 So, this was sent to me by my friend, Mark Vent.

1037
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,060
 I've never heard of it.

1038
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,140
 It's called The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty,

1039
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,860
 where basically they recorded literally everything,

1040
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,700
 included in these accounts.

1041
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,940
 In 1404, for example,

1042
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,180
 there was a king who fell off a horse by accident.

1043
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,140
 He was really embarrassed,

1044
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,540
 and he went up to the guy recording it saying,

1045
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,740
 "Can you not put in the whole horse-falling thing?"

1046
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,780
 And the guy put it in.

1047
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,420
 So we've got an account of the king

1048
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,660
 then bitching about the guy going,

1049
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,940
 "I bet he's put in the horse thing, hasn't he?"

1050
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,780
 - He said, "Stop writing.

1051
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,100
 "No, no, stop writing that.

1052
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,740
 "Don't write that either, you bastard."

1053
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,340
 - You know the never-ending story?

1054
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,660
 There's a character sitting on the top of a mountain,

1055
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,620
 transcribing everything.

1056
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,980
 This is basically how they treated their entire dynasty.

1057
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,100
 And as a result, we've got 500 years' worth

1058
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,260
 of complete records of the king

1059
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,660
 and all of the king's administrators.

1060
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,500
 - It's brilliant.

1061
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,340
 - Yeah, it's incredible.

1062
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,180
 - It's such a good idea.

1063
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,580
 Unlike now, where literally this week,

1064
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,100
 we're hearing that people are deleting WhatsApps every,

1065
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,500
 you know, they're doing government business,

1066
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,660
 and they're deleting the WhatsApps every seven days,

1067
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,980
 so we never know what they said.

1068
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,820
 - You're right.

1069
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
 If we doubt this system, they couldn't have done it,

1070
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,180
 'cause the king wasn't even allowed to see it.

1071
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,020
 - It wasn't allowed to see it.

1072
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,820
 - After he died, you weren't allowed to look

1073
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,220
 at the recordings of what you've done and said.

1074
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,060
 - Yeah, exactly.

1075
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,780
 The rules were very strict about who couldn't look

1076
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,780
 in the annals, but they were broken sometimes.

1077
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,620
 - Absolutely, yeah.

1078
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,460
 - So there was, I've read an account of a tyrant king

1079
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,620
 who looked in the annals and then six people were executed

1080
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,380
 because of what he found written in there.

1081
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,580
 So I think after that, they probably had to tighten

1082
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,420
 up the rules.

1083
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,020
 Maybe he was the reason the kings then weren't allowed

1084
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,860
 to look in the annals.

1085
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,820
 - So what it was, I mean, I don't know if this is

1086
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,580
 the specific account you're talking about,

1087
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,740
 but the people who were writing the histories often went

1088
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,180
 back in to change what they've written because the king

1089
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,260
 wasn't allowed to look at what happened.

1090
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,340
 You know, he'd have to die and then people could look

1091
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,060
 at what was said about him, but politicians would get word

1092
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,500
 that maybe something was written down.

1093
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,460
 So the historiographers would go back into it

1094
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
 and kind of change it.

1095
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,620
 And the king found out about that and he got really pissed

1096
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,900
 off that they were more petrified of the politicians

1097
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,460
 than the king himself of what the king would do.

1098
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,500
 And then that got banned.

1099
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,540
 - So you weren't allowed to then go in and change

1100
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,380
 your own story?

1101
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,820
 - They were known as the literati purges, weren't they?

1102
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,660
 (laughing)

1103
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,860
 And the one Andy's talking about who was Yon Sangun,

1104
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,860
 who was the tyrant king, he closed down the university

1105
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,540
 and turned it into his personal pleasure grounds

1106
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,420
 where he would import young girls from around the provinces.

1107
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,140
 He also demolished a huge area where people were living

1108
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,820
 in the capital and turned it into his own hunting grounds.

1109
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,020
 And then when everyone complained, he told his ministers

1110
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,260
 they weren't allowed to speak and they had to wear a sign

1111
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,580
 saying, "A mouth is a door that brings in disaster.

1112
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,660
 A tongue is a sword that cuts off a head."

1113
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,220
 - I really thought it was gonna rhyme.

1114
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,060
 (laughing)

1115
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,060
 - It probably was in Korea.

1116
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,900
 - It's Korean, yeah.

1117
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,500
 (laughing)

1118
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,340
 - Wait, a tongue is a sword?

1119
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,620
 - It feels like you could say plaster at some point.

1120
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,700
 A tongue is a sword that--

1121
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,860
 - Calls for a plaster, yeah?

1122
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,780
 - It's a plaster.

1123
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,700
 - Wait, what's the mouth?

1124
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,500
 - A mouth is a door that brings in disaster.

1125
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,020
 A tongue is a sword that calls for a plaster.

1126
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,860
 - Looks good.

1127
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,580
 - It's not amazing, but it's hard to work with.

1128
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,420
 - I think it's good.

1129
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,420
 - What are the teeth?

1130
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,980
 - Something knocked out by your master.

1131
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,060
 - Oh, very good.

1132
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,220
 - Lovely.

1133
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,500
 - Anyway, he sounds like a rotter.

1134
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,940
 (laughing)

1135
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,260
 Yeah, it was really strange.

1136
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,020
 There were eventually about 2,000 volumes of this stuff.

1137
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
 2,000 volumes.

1138
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,860
 And it was all sorts of clobber as well.

1139
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
 It was the weather, it was diplomatic affairs,

1140
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,820
 it was the economy.

1141
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,660
 It was, you know.

1142
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,700
 - Probably quite a boring job to actually do it.

1143
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,380
 Day in, day out, dribbling away.

1144
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,700
 And you must have had this constantly saying,

1145
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,900
 "So can you slow down, please?"

1146
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,180
 - Sorry, can you say that again?

1147
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,020
 - Yeah.

1148
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,660
 - And then you have to write that down.

1149
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,500
 - Yes.

1150
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,700
 - And then I wrote down, "Can you slow down, please?"

1151
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,500
 - Sorry, can you fall off the horse again, but slower?

1152
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,260
 (laughing)

1153
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,020
 - Yeah, it's 1,967 books in total is what they have.

1154
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,140
 They say if you stacked it,

1155
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,980
 it would be taller than a 10-story building.

1156
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,380
 Is the height we're talking of these books,

1157
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,540
 which just means nothing,

1158
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,700
 but that's quite fun as a visual.

1159
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,820
 - Thank you for explaining why you've mentioned it.

1160
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,700
 - But the point that they make in this thing is,

1161
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,180
 until it's been digitized,

1162
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,380
 it was an intensely hard history to get your head around

1163
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,220
 because--

1164
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,580
 - 'Cause you gotta climb nine stars

1165
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,300
 to get to the level you want.

1166
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,380
 - Yeah, exactly.

1167
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,900
 Well, there's no, it's not a history book.

1168
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,540
 It's not written like, "Here's the story of the king."

1169
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
 You've got a bit of the king,

1170
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,100
 and then you've suddenly got the weather report,

1171
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,740
 and you have to hunt through 1,900 volumes

1172
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,540
 to find the thing you're looking for.

1173
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,340
 Obviously there's, you know, when the periods--

1174
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,180
 - There's days of the stuff, but yeah.

1175
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,020
 - Yeah, exactly.

1176
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,940
 - But now it has been digitized, right?

1177
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,780
 - It has, yeah.

1178
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,260
 - And it's the plan is to translate them

1179
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,780
 into English by the year 2033.

1180
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,860
 - Okay.

1181
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,380
 This dynasty was an interesting one.

1182
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,900
 It was a very long-lasting dynasty.

1183
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,020
 - Yeah, 500 years.

1184
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,860
 - Yeah, 500.

1185
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,580
 - 1392 until, well, accounts vary,

1186
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,540
 but I'm going with 1910.

1187
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,780
 - Hmm, controversial.

1188
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,540
 - Well, Japan invaded Korea at that point.

1189
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,620
 Certainly not despite it.

1190
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,140
 That was, yeah, in the 14th century, when it started,

1191
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,340
 it was, you know, the big deal was that they were moving

1192
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,940
 from an old aristocracy to state-trained bureaucrats

1193
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,980
 who were running the show,

1194
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,100
 and that was, you know.

1195
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,260
 - It was very much in the Eastern tradition

1196
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,660
 of meritocracy, having preceded us.

1197
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,220
 Well, they were just much more organized than we were.

1198
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,220
 - It was a meritocracy as long as you weren't a woman.

1199
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,740
 - Oh, God, yeah, women had an absolute whale of a time,

1200
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,580
 of course.

1201
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,820
 There was a ruling from behind the bamboo screen

1202
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,460
 was a thing in the Choson dynasty,

1203
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,220
 which was when, if you were a regent,

1204
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,780
 so obviously if a male royal hadn't come of age yet,

1205
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,260
 and you were the mother, then you could rule,

1206
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,220
 but you had to sit behind the bamboo screen at the time

1207
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,700
 when he sat on the throne, acting like he was saying stuff.

1208
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,060
 - Oh, do you have your hand up his bum at the time?

1209
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,660
 (all laughing)

1210
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,740
 I mean, if we thought that those three kids

1211
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,660
 looking the same lot, he was going to get social services in.

1212
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,420
 - The ruling from behind the screen, that was quite cool.

1213
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,260
 - Yeah, it was really cool.

1214
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,900
 - We've spoken about that before, haven't we?

1215
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,700
 - What we've spoken about it in Russia.

1216
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,540
 - Yeah, when someone was behind, literally, the throne.

1217
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,380
 - The chair.

1218
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,180
 - Yeah, yeah, just go, "Why don't you say?"

1219
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,500
 But here, you weren't hit, like they knew you were there,

1220
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,020
 'cause there's a big screen, maybe with nice pictures on it.

1221
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,140
 But have a fight a lot,

1222
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,300
 if your grandmother or your mother ruled.

1223
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,180
 There was one queen, I think,

1224
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,460
 who ruled for about 25 years from behind the screen.

1225
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,300
 - What?

1226
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,420
 Oh, really? - With the same regent?

1227
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,340
 - Yeah. - It's kind of that,

1228
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,860
 you're not ready yet, so I'm sorry.

1229
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,260
 (all laughing)

1230
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,980
 - Oh, I thought they had a rule that when you turned 20,

1231
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,540
 so it was if you were under 20.

1232
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,060
 - They did, but lots of weird stuff always happens,

1233
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,820
 and she liked power, and so it was a bit like,

1234
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,580
 oh, actually, you're not qualified, it turns out,

1235
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,740
 and she was machinating behind the scenes

1236
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,060
 to make sure she stayed in control.

1237
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,500
 But it was, one of the good things about them

1238
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,740
 recording all these details,

1239
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,340
 was that you got just a lot of blood and gore,

1240
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,340
 'cause everyone, like Royals were in the past,

1241
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,940
 almost everywhere, everyone was quite bloodthirsty.

1242
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,940
 So one of the stories that I liked that was recorded

1243
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,980
 was the story of Prince Sado.

1244
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,660
 (all laughing)

1245
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,700
 You know what, Sado?

1246
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,140
 - Is that the English translation, or?

1247
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,340
 - It basically should be, 'cause he was a sad character.

1248
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,780
 This was in the 1700s, and his dad was King Yong Zhou,

1249
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,540
 who really wanted Sado to be studious and clever.

1250
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,380
 - Sounds like he was.

1251
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,660
 (all laughing)

1252
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,580
 - Well, sadly, he wasn't.

1253
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
 He was actually a free spirit.

1254
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,300
 He wanted to be a musician and an artist kind of type.

1255
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,460
 - Oh, yeah, classic.

1256
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,700
 - His dad was a super lame, bullied him,

1257
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,500
 used to mock him in front of the eunuchs, and the ladies.

1258
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,420
 - Not in front of the eunuchs.

1259
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,260
 (all laughing)

1260
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,780
 No, that's so unkind.

1261
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,860
 - It's the worst, and it drove Sado a bit mad.

1262
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,500
 Sado went mad-o, and he sort of,

1263
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,220
 he went from being a really gentle, sweet boy

1264
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,500
 to murdering everyone, and he used to walk into chambers

1265
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,860
 holding severed heads of eunuchs, in fact.

1266
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,700
 - Guess what else I've cut off?

1267
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,340
 Yeah, yeah, that kind of thing, yeah.

1268
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,180
 - Yeah, and so his father was then like,

1269
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,820
 "Well, we can't have this, we can't have you inheriting,

1270
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,300
 "so you're gonna have to die,

1271
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,220
 "but you're not allowed to defile the royal body

1272
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,300
 "by actually killing someone."

1273
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,460
 So he asked his son to commit suicide,

1274
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,180
 and Sado, Sado, though he was,

1275
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,140
 was not Sado enough to commit suicide,

1276
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,500
 so his dad said, "Okay, well then,

1277
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,660
 "can you climb into this rice chest?"

1278
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,060
 And then he locked him in a rice chest and starved him to death.

1279
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,100
 - Wait, did he know that that was gonna be locked?

1280
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,540
 - I guess maybe he thought really,

1281
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,220
 look, I guess this has to happen.

1282
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,700
 - Was he put in the chest?

1283
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,540
 - It might have been,

1284
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,180
 there might have been someone gently encouraging him

1285
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,020
 with a hand. - Although, although,

1286
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,060
 is there any animals, you know?

1287
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,460
 - Yeah, if it's in the animals, then it must have happened,

1288
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,900
 otherwise it'd be like, you know,

1289
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,700
 "Don't say that I'm shoving my son

1290
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,060
 "into this rice chest right now."

1291
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,100
 - Yeah, you're right, he got involuntarily.

1292
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,380
 - Yeah. - There was a place,

1293
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,340
 I can't remember where it was.

1294
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,220
 The tradition was that you couldn't kill the king,

1295
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,420
 but you could put them in a bag

1296
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,020
 and hit the bag very hard with a club.

1297
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,380
 And I think that was the...

1298
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,620
 - I think that was the Ottoman Empire, wasn't it?

1299
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,460
 - It was the Ottomans, I'm sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1300
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,420
 - I think you beat them in some kind of rugs sometimes,

1301
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,300
 didn't you, so that you couldn't spill blood?

1302
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,700
 - You say, "I'm just beating this rug,"

1303
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,540
 and actually it contains the king or whatever.

1304
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,740
 And that was the means of executing very, very posh people.

1305
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,620
 - Right, wasn't there a tradition,

1306
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,860
 there was a pirate tradition as well,

1307
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,860
 wasn't there, of chest, putting people in chests and--

1308
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,220
 - That's treasure.

1309
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,580
 (laughing)

1310
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,900
 - That goes back to the people,

1311
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
 when they picked up my treasure.

1312
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,260
 (laughing)

1313
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,940
 - It's some poor, desiccated skeleton in there.

1314
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,700
 - No, it's hook, I'm thinking of the movie hook.

1315
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,020
 - Oh, you're not, you're not really.

1316
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,980
 - Yeah, right at the beginning, yeah,

1317
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,740
 but they put them in the boo box, the boo box,

1318
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,740
 and he goes inside. - The boo box.

1319
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,980
 - Yeah, and you would have a slide,

1320
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,860
 and you'd put scorpions in and close it.

1321
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,900
 - We don't need to go into the details,

1322
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,660
 I don't think it is historical facts.

1323
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,140
 - Interesting fact, it was Glenn Close,

1324
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,500
 who played the male pirate,

1325
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,460
 and no one really knew that, uncredited, yeah.

1326
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,820
 - Hook, who played hook?

1327
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,500
 - No, played the pirate put in the treasure chest, yeah.

1328
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,900
 - Okay, so. - Anybody's done it.

1329
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,180
 - One interesting thing about these annals is,

1330
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,580
 like Andy said, they kind of would tell you the weather,

1331
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,100
 and stuff like that.

1332
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,940
 But it also would tell you whenever there was an aurora,

1333
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,780
 and there was a time between 1645 and 1715,

1334
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,620
 which we now sometimes call the mini ice age,

1335
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,980
 and we've managed to use, or not we,

1336
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,100
 a guy called Jan and his team,

1337
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,940
 managed to use the records, looking into the history books,

1338
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,500
 and have worked out the solar cycles

1339
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,020
 that were happening around that time.

1340
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,460
 - Beautiful. - By the number of auroras

1341
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,540
 that were recorded in the annals.

1342
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,780
 - That's so cool. - Isn't that cool?

1343
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,220
 - That's amazing. - And so we now know

1344
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,340
 that around that time, the solar cycle

1345
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,500
 was only about eight years,

1346
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,460
 whereas it's normally a bit longer than that.

1347
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,220
 - That's incredible. - I just love that stuff.

1348
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,220
 - There's also UFO encounters

1349
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,180
 in the Chosen dynasty, which is very exciting.

1350
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,020
 So, September 1609, there was a reported case

1351
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,740
 of things shaped like a bowl in the sky.

1352
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,740
 And there's a few paranormal things

1353
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,940
 that make it in there as well, but what's really amazing,

1354
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,940
 I'm so excited by this, I haven't seen it yet,

1355
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,340
 but it's obviously immediately become

1356
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,620
 one of my favorite TV shows.

1357
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,620
 The Chosen X Files, it's a real TV show,

1358
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,660
 and it's a historical, and it uses accounts

1359
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,700
 from the Chosen annals as the basis for each episode,

1360
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,340
 and there's an ancient investigator of the time

1361
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,580
 who is assigned to go and investigate

1362
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,060
 all of the weird paranormalities

1363
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,380
 that we find in the annals.

1364
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,980
 - What kind of things are we talking about?

1365
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,220
 - Oh, I just told you, the UFO.

1366
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,740
 - A bowl in the fall of the sky.

1367
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,220
 - A bowl shape across the moon, sounds like.

1368
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, who knows?

1369
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,260
 I mean, it's obviously not a UFO,

1370
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,220
 but they recorded it as unidentified stuff,

1371
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,020
 there's cursed items, all that sort of stuff,

1372
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,860
 and yeah, it's been turned into a-

1373
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,380
 - Well, that's the good thing about the annals

1374
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,580
 is that it's really easy to re-enact

1375
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,740
 so much of what happened.

1376
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,300
 So you can make an incredibly accurate historical

1377
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,780
 representation, and I think historical re-enactments

1378
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,980
 are much more popular and common

1379
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,260
 in Korea now of this period,

1380
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,740
 because you know exactly what people were wearing,

1381
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,300
 exactly how they ate their meals,

1382
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,380
 like meals were described in such detail,

1383
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,420
 and the order in which meals,

1384
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,100
 like the order in which different foods

1385
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,220
 had to be placed on the table.

1386
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,660
 It was all extremely ordered life.

1387
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,060
 Everything was very ceremonial,

1388
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,140
 and so you'd have to bring in the sausages first,

1389
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,460
 and then the cabbage five minutes later,

1390
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,780
 and we know all of this.

1391
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,780
 So re-enactments, piece of cake.

1392
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,620
 - That's cool.

1393
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,020
 - Welcome to the piece of cake company.

1394
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,100
 (laughing)

1395
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
 - Can you guess the seven sins for which you were allowed

1396
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,940
 to divorce your wife under the Joseon dynasty?

1397
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,140
 - So her sins, not mine.

1398
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,060
 (laughing)

1399
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,900
 - Yeah.

1400
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,740
 - Okay.

1401
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,580
 - Adultery.

1402
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,620
 - Wives weren't allowed to divorce their husbands.

1403
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,620
 - Adultery.

1404
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,340
 - Adultery's in there, yes.

1405
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,180
 - Seft.

1406
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,580
 - Very good stealing is in there, yes.

1407
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,580
 - Inability to have children is usually one of them.

1408
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
 - Yes, very good.

1409
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,780
 Fairly to produce a male heir.

1410
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,500
 You can have daughters if you want, but you'll get divorced.

1411
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,580
 - Touching my stuff.

1412
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,420
 What about?

1413
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,980
 (laughing)

1414
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,980
 - It's not actually on there, it's been an oversight.

1415
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,740
 I've been moving the remote control from where I like it,

1416
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,020
 where I like it, next to where I sit on the sofa,

1417
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,980
 to apparently a better place next to the television.

1418
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,780
 - Why would you put it next to the television?

1419
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,900
 It's a remote control.

1420
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,340
 It should be remotes from the place that it's beeping to.

1421
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,860
 - I don't know if I meant to unleash this.

1422
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,700
 - No, no, this is brilliant.

1423
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,220
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, I love my wife and it's all going right.

1424
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,340
 (laughing)

1425
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,500
 - We've only got three so far, haven't we?

1426
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,380
 - You've done Fairly to produce a male heir,

1427
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,100
 adultery, stealing.

1428
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,300
 - Well, not maintaining the household properly.

1429
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,180
 - No, that's not, there's excessive jealousy

1430
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,500
 towards other women in the household

1431
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,940
 who I guess would often be concubines.

1432
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,540
 So you can't, yeah, you can divorce your wife.

1433
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,020
 - Bad mouthing with the friends, they were overheard,

1434
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,180
 spotted in the annals.

1435
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,940
 - I'm gonna give you that, talking excessively.

1436
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,780
 - Ooh.

1437
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,540
 (laughing)

1438
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,620
 - Too much chat, you're gone.

1439
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,460
 The last one is serious disease.

1440
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,660
 - Oh, right.

1441
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,380
 - So you've got to, I mean, I think that is irresponsible

1442
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,820
 to get a bad disease when you're trying

1443
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,660
 to produce a male heir.

1444
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,900
 - Yeah, if you've got, if your wife's got gout eyes,

1445
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,140
 I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna get that.

1446
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,780
 - Exactly, get rid of them love.

1447
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,700
 - So the remote control thing you're stuck with?

1448
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,860
 - I think I might have just missed it out, yeah,

1449
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,460
 and I think my body was eight since, yeah.

1450
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,940
 - Eight, yeah.

1451
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,520
 (upbeat music)

1452
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,300
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1453
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,100
 and that is Anna.

1454
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,460
 - My fact this week is that in real life,

1455
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,340
 it was difficult to free Willy

1456
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
 because he couldn't hold his breath under water

1457
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,340
 for long enough, but this is about the film Free Willy.

1458
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,540
 - Which, if you haven't seen it,

1459
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,940
 is a classic '90s kids movie, it's brilliant.

1460
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,780
 - Is it?

1461
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,860
 - 1993, it's so good, it really is great.

1462
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,420
 - I know it's about a whale.

1463
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,260
 - Yep.

1464
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,580
 - Who is freed.

1465
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,420
 - Yes.

1466
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,220
 - I feel like there is a scene where he jumps over a wall.

1467
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,060
 - Yes.

1468
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,900
 - Yes, very good.

1469
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,340
 - And that is his friend with a child who's working to free

1470
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,060
 and that is not a spoiler because the climactic moment

1471
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,340
 of the film is on not only the title,

1472
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,180
 it's also in the trailer and on the poster.

1473
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,020
 - It's the poster.

1474
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,340
 - It's the whole thing, it's the weirdest thing.

1475
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,660
 - I like Anna Karenina having a train on the front cover.

1476
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,500
 - No, Andy, it's called Free Willy,

1477
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
 it's not called Free Willy question, Mark.

1478
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,100
 We know that the Free Willy is gonna happen, shall we?

1479
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,180
 - No, because Free Willy is like an imperative,

1480
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,100
 like Free Willy, you don't know they obey it, do you?

1481
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,580
 - Oh, it's not an adjective.

1482
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,420
 - No, no, no.

1483
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,260
 - No, it's not.

1484
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,100
 (laughing)

1485
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,340
 - Well, actually he starts the film as a Free Will

1486
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,300
 before being captured by some rascally fisherman,

1487
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,460
 you know, some scoundrels.

1488
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,060
 So he starts off as Free Willy.

1489
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,300
 - But yeah, most of the film, he's not free,

1490
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,300
 so really, to be accurate, it should have been called

1491
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,020
 Captive Willy 'cause that's the majority of the film.

1492
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,740
 (laughing)

1493
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:41,020
 Captive Willy is in another genre entirely in films.

1494
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,140
 - So he was a real whale, he was called Keiko.

1495
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,980
 - Yeah.

1496
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,740
 - Yeah, and he was, so yeah, there was this whale

1497
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,380
 called Keiko and after the film came out, basically,

1498
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,580
 it was incredibly popular.

1499
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,180
 Anyone who was a child online, he's probably,

1500
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,820
 remember seeing it, except James.

1501
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,980
 And after it came out, there was this massive campaign

1502
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,140
 and in fact, the film at the end of it had a number to call

1503
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,460
 if you wanted to save the whales,

1504
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,840
 but it was an environmental agency that you got through to.

1505
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,420
 But actually, most people who called the number

1506
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,460
 or many thousands just wanted that specific whale to be free.

1507
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,500
 They were like, but what about the actor in the film?

1508
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,820
 The actor who plays the whale?

1509
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,540
 - The kid, oh right.

1510
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,980
 - No one gives shit about the kid, he's still in captivity.

1511
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,900
 So yeah, there was this campaign to free Keiko.

1512
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,940
 So they had to train this whale that had been in captivity

1513
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,180
 for 15 years to learn to live in the wild.

1514
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,540
 Then it was an incredibly arduous, resource-intensive process.

1515
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,740
 And one of the things about Keiko was that

1516
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,500
 couldn't hold his breath underwater.

1517
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,220
 And whales need to obviously,

1518
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,380
 'cause they can't breathe underwater.

1519
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,020
 So Killer Whales, which he was,

1520
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,860
 hold their breath usually for about 15 minutes underwater.

1521
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,460
 He couldn't even make sort of three,

1522
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,580
 but they did manage to train him.

1523
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,700
 And by the time they released him,

1524
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,220
 he could hold his breath for 13 minutes.

1525
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,060
 So very good.

1526
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,260
 - Oh right, so he had a pretty unhappy life in the wild.

1527
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,420
 He was used to living with humans.

1528
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,980
 He'd been living with humans almost all his life,

1529
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,100
 and he was taken to Iceland,

1530
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,500
 and then he made his way over to Norway,

1531
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,140
 but he really was pretty dependent on humans

1532
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,860
 for the rest of his life, pretty sad.

1533
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,620
 - It's very interesting because there's a side

1534
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,380
 of environmentalists and people look after animals

1535
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,220
 who say this was the worst thing in the world,

1536
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,460
 to let him back out into the wild

1537
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,740
 because of all these reasons.

1538
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,580
 How could he attach himself to a pod?

1539
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,620
 He's been fed frozen herring, his last 13 years.

1540
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,100
 But the people who did it still maintained

1541
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,980
 it was the best thing to do,

1542
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,220
 and that he was the second oldest orca

1543
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,460
 to live in captivity ever.

1544
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,740
 In the time that he was in there,

1545
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,380
 something like 13 other orcas died

1546
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,420
 to just show how quickly the mortality rate was.

1547
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,300
 - Yeah, and he did, yeah, exactly.

1548
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,700
 He might have died anyway.

1549
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,860
 He just died of a disease

1550
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,140
 shortly after managing to be released.

1551
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,860
 But yeah, and he hung around on the edge of a pod,

1552
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,180
 but it was mostly tragic, or silly at least,

1553
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,860
 because there should have been a fund

1554
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,740
 for broad environmentally good reasons

1555
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,380
 rather than probably a fund to just release this one whale,

1556
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,620
 which was fine in captivity.

1557
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,420
 - The release I think is that in free willies,

1558
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,300
 certainly two and three,

1559
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,820
 the willie is played completely by an animatronic whale.

1560
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,660
 - Yeah.

1561
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,820
 - It's an early example of AI taking away jobs.

1562
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,900
 - Well, largely in one, it was played

1563
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,500
 by an animatronic whale as well.

1564
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,340
 - And CGI.

1565
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,540
 - For the bits where the child is putting his hand

1566
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:18,380
 in the whale's mouth,

1567
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,900
 I think they did have to have that in the middle.

1568
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,460
 - Sorry to interrupt, because I don't know this movie.

1569
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,520
 In free willie two, three, and four,

1570
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,020
 you're saying it's the same willie,

1571
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,260
 as in the character is the same willie.

1572
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,460
 - He's freed.

1573
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,780
 - But then what?

1574
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,500
 - Oh, so, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1575
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,060
 - In free willie two, he's gone home.

1576
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,420
 He's found his pod, and he's found his mum,

1577
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,260
 which is exciting.

1578
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,660
 I think there's an oil spill or something bad.

1579
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,220
 That might be the film three.

1580
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,780
 And then it turns out, look at me jumping

1581
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,500
 in front of Dan when Dan's got the entire plot in his head.

1582
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,860
 And film three, he started a family

1583
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,260
 and he's got a pregnant one.

1584
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,700
 - Oh, so he is free throughout those extra films.

1585
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,140
 - They keep trying to capture him again,

1586
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,580
 and the kid from the first movie appears in the second.

1587
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,380
 So it's the same cast trying to make sure

1588
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,220
 he remains free is the idea.

1589
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,580
 - So by that point, the title is an adjective.

1590
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,020
 He is free willie, rather than an imperative.

1591
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,140
 - And it was sad because the character, you know,

1592
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,380
 meets up with his pod again and gets together

1593
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,740
 with the lady whale and, you know,

1594
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,620
 she's expecting a baby in the third film.

1595
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,660
 And yet K-Code never experienced any of this.

1596
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,500
 It's sad.

1597
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,340
 - Yes, it is sad.

1598
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,180
 - Absolutely sad.

1599
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,620
 - And two and three has the same cast,

1600
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,340
 but four, they sort of thought the story is now told.

1601
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,780
 So they had to entirely recast it.

1602
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,220
 And Bindi Irwin, the daughter of Steve Irwin,

1603
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,980
 Crocodile Hunter, is the lead role.

1604
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,820
 - Get out.

1605
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,660
 - You know, I will stay in.

1606
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,060
 - It's free Bindi.

1607
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,340
 And is it a different whale?

1608
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,500
 - I've seen it.

1609
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,340
 I can't remember.

1610
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,180
 - 'Cause we've seen Jaws 4.

1611
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,020
 - Yes.

1612
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,060
 - Which is, I think the kid of--

1613
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,980
 - It's the descendant.

1614
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,020
 It might be that, possibly.

1615
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,580
 - It's the kid of the original shark,

1616
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,380
 which is attacking the family.

1617
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,740
 But not family by blood.

1618
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,820
 Family by marriage of the original people.

1619
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,660
 - Oh my God.

1620
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,820
 - And it follows them across the world.

1621
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,660
 It's like--

1622
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,500
 - Through telepathy.

1623
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,180
 - This shark knows about sort of

1624
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,140
 social relationships as well as smell and blood.

1625
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:55,980
 - No, I stopped describing it, please.

1626
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,420
 - Have you heard of Auker the movie

1627
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,660
 while we're talking about movies?

1628
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,140
 - Auker, no.

1629
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,060
 - So I wondered if there was like a killer whale movie,

1630
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,780
 which was a bit like Jaws.

1631
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,620
 - Oh, right.

1632
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,540
 - And it turns out there is.

1633
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,420
 It's called Auker the movie from 1970, whenever it was.

1634
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,860
 And basically someone had watched Jaws,

1635
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,020
 seen how popular it was.

1636
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,580
 And thought, what's scarier than a shark?

1637
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,420
 A killer whale.

1638
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,260
 - Yeah.

1639
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,100
 - And it--

1640
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:19,940
 - Incorrect, but okay.

1641
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,540
 - Oh, killer whales literally eat sharks for breakfast.

1642
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,860
 - Yeah, killer whales don't harm humans.

1643
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,460
 - They do in captivity.

1644
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,380
 - The area against us, sorry.

1645
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,500
 Two instances, 'cause we're really horrible to them.

1646
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,340
 Killer whales do not eat humans.

1647
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,220
 - I think sharks generally speaking don't eat humans.

1648
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,260
 - The number of shark incidents.

1649
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,500
 Look, we all like our ocean friends, okay?

1650
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,860
 - A few people a year do get,

1651
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,340
 people do get attacked by sharks.

1652
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,900
 - Killer whales do not attack humans in the wild.

1653
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,900
 - What about the boats they've been attacking

1654
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,740
 in the last year?

1655
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,700
 - They attack boats.

1656
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,220
 They're not killing humans.

1657
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,060
 - Who goes on boats?

1658
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:50,900
 - They're not humans.

1659
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,740
 (laughing)

1660
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,140
 - And you're giving them either too much

1661
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,300
 or too little credit, right?

1662
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,140
 You're right.

1663
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,380
 - Anyway, you've got an approval rating of 9%.

1664
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,220
 (laughing)

1665
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,060
 - Oh, really?

1666
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,140
 - I don't have that, we have seen the sequel

1667
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,140
 and the sequel and the sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel.

1668
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,980
 - Yeah.

1669
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,580
 - Bob Irwin, Steve Sarn is in Auker 4.

1670
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,940
 - So when they were auditioning for the movie.

1671
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,780
 - Yeah.

1672
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,620
 - Free Willy.

1673
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,940
 - They auditioned lots of different whales.

1674
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,060
 I don't know what the process was.

1675
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,900
 - Singing.

1676
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,100
 - I think maybe.

1677
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,940
 (laughing)

1678
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,460
 But 21 of the 23 whales they auditioned belong to SeaWorld.

1679
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,580
 - Right.

1680
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,580
 - And SeaWorld apparently uncomfortable

1681
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,780
 with the movie's message,

1682
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,300
 which is basically, you're caging whales, you monsters.

1683
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,860
 This is an incredibly medieval barbaric thing to do.

1684
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,700
 - Yeah.

1685
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,940
 - And they asked at one point for a new ending.

1686
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,780
 - Yeah.

1687
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,740
 - But presumably it went with Willy's days captive.

1688
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,580
 (laughing)

1689
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,420
 - He does it.

1690
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,260
 - Yeah.

1691
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,580
 - He jumps back over the wall.

1692
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1693
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,580
 (laughing)

1694
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,300
 - Yeah, and so I think they got Keiko

1695
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,700
 from a Mexican sea life park because of SeaWorld.

1696
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,020
 - They did, which is quite odd

1697
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,100
 because the Mexican park was in very poor condition

1698
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,340
 and the whale, Keiko, was in very poor condition in it.

1699
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,340
 But the Mexican owners, the Mexican park,

1700
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,980
 were absolutely fine with the message.

1701
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,820
 - Right.

1702
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,660
 - I think they were a bit like, yeah, no,

1703
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,620
 it's shit here for the whales.

1704
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,980
 You should spread the word.

1705
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,020
 - That was weird for Keiko in that Mexican park

1706
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,220
 because the water, rather than pouring sea water

1707
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,440
 for it to live in, they just had water,

1708
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,260
 which they added salt to.

1709
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,460
 (laughing)

1710
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,660
 Like it was really bad.

1711
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,620
 - I mean, in theory, that sounds like the same,

1712
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,460
 but I bet it's not.

1713
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,140
 - It's just kind of not gonna be, is it?

1714
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,980
 - No, no.

1715
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,820
 - It probably tastes weird.

1716
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,660
 - Yeah.

1717
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,500
 - Yeah.

1718
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,320
 - Seasoned water.

1719
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,160
 - Yeah.

1720
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,000
 - Seasoned your water.

1721
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,840
 - And the altitude's quite high up

1722
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,680
 for what Keiko would have been used to.

1723
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,500
 - Seats.

1724
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,340
 (laughing)

1725
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,180
 - And so it can level up.

1726
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,420
 (laughing)

1727
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,140
 (laughing)

1728
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,700
 - So what altitude do you normally live at, Keiko?

1729
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,740
 (laughing)

1730
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,580
 - Jesus.

1731
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,300
 (laughing)

1732
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,200
 - He didn't live in one of those really high seas.

1733
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,040
 (laughing)

1734
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,160
 - Those are the high seas that the pirates go in.

1735
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,000
 - That's it?

1736
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,840
 - Yeah.

1737
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,240
 - Why do you think the whales are alpine sea experience?

1738
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,240
 I'm not happy.

1739
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,680
 (laughing)

1740
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,320
 - Here's the thing, I watched a clip of it last night,

1741
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,920
 and actually it's amazing to,

1742
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,140
 James, not included in this, but when you watch it back,

1743
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,480
 my memory of Willie going over as a phenomenal scene,

1744
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,160
 and watch it again, they use CGI,

1745
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,600
 and it's really obvious when it lands in on the other side.

1746
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,720
 You can see the splash would kind of

1747
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,520
 computer graphics, early computer graphics.

1748
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,360
 - Couldn't do water in those days, could you?

1749
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,920
 In fact, it's still hard to do water.

1750
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,760
 - Right.

1751
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,600
 - I think that's sensible though,

1752
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,960
 'cause you have got an eight-year-old child actor

1753
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,720
 firing the 1,300 kilo rubber whale over that.

1754
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,020
 - Take 12, we're gonna need another kid.

1755
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,280
 (laughing)

1756
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,840
 - And there was a stunt, as you said then,

1757
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,760
 there was a stunt double, which was coated in 1,300 kilos.

1758
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,800
 Oh, sorry, that's 1,300 kilos of rubber

1759
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,360
 just on the outside. - On the outside, yeah.

1760
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,800
 - That's just the skin, and the special effects supervisor

1761
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,640
 said that the dummy looked so realistic to Keiko

1762
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,560
 that he became aroused when he saw it.

1763
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,240
 (laughing)

1764
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,760
 Did not happen to Keiko in the end.

1765
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,240
 Obviously he died. - Except Brian died.

1766
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,080
 - Well, yes.

1767
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,160
 - He got pneumonia.

1768
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,000
 - After he died.

1769
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,240
 - Oh, okay.

1770
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,400
 Reincarnated as a rabbit.

1771
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,200
 - Before that, well, possibly, but he was buried.

1772
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,960
 - Oh, okay, let's see. - Really?

1773
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,560
 - That poor grave digger, imagine being told

1774
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,040
 that's your gig this morning.

1775
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,240
 - Poor, what they call the people who carry them.

1776
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,360
 - Polbearers. - Polbearers.

1777
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,800
 - 2,000 Polbearers.

1778
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,920
 - Yeah, they were so weird.

1779
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,640
 That was, 'cause he died in Norway,

1780
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,840
 or off the, in the fjords of Norway.

1781
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,680
 - Right.

1782
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,360
 - Normally, you would just tow the whale out to sea

1783
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,960
 and then attach a deep weight to it, and it would sink.

1784
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,720
 - Okay, and that would be good for the environment

1785
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,720
 'cause animals in the bottom of the sea can feed on it.

1786
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,400
 - Yeah, they didn't do that.

1787
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,040
 They dug an enormous grave, and then just slid him in.

1788
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,720
 - And is it marked as in, has it become a destination?

1789
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,840
 - There's a little can of stones, which marks the grave.

1790
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,560
 It's right next to the sea, obviously, in land.

1791
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,400
 - It's not in a churchyard.

1792
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,920
 - It was not in Birmingham, or anywhere,

1793
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,240
 really, really far in town, I don't know.

1794
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,920
 - On top of a mountain, oh, we always love the altitude.

1795
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,960
 (all laughing)

1796
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,320
 - Yeah, but they grabbed a special permission.

1797
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,920
 There are only seven people at the funeral,

1798
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,840
 which I find very sad.

1799
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,920
 - How many whales?

1800
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,280
 (all laughing)

1801
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,620
 - None.

1802
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,880
 - You know, we were saying earlier

1803
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,200
 about how killer whales might slam into a boat?

1804
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,040
 - Yeah.

1805
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,560
 - And scientists aren't quite fully sure

1806
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,520
 why that happens.

1807
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,640
 And there's a theory that the reason it happens

1808
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,800
 is because if a boat is out at sea

1809
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,760
 and it's turned its engine off,

1810
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,640
 they think it's possible that the killer whales

1811
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,440
 love going up to the back of the boat

1812
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,560
 and feeling the water get propelled

1813
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,640
 through the jet, through its propeller.

1814
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,640
 And it's a bit like a fun kind of like,

1815
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,000
 like if you're in a jacuzzi and you've got--

1816
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,840
 - Like a wave machine, yeah.

1817
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,880
 - Yeah, exactly like that.

1818
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,640
 So if they see one and it's not on,

1819
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,340
 the thought is that they're slamming into the boat

1820
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,080
 in frustration to make it start,

1821
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,920
 make that thing happen that they're going to.

1822
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,520
 No one knows that for sure.

1823
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,840
 - Well, the thing is, is if you look

1824
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,960
 in the newspaper archives, you do see

1825
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,720
 that every now and then there's a spike.

1826
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,280
 Like in 1953, there was a spike of if you search

1827
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,200
 for orca ramming boat or killer whale ramming boat,

1828
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,040
 you'll see one.

1829
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,400
 There was another one in 2001.

1830
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,680
 And it's just, I think it happens quite regularly.

1831
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,220
 And once one of them gets in the news,

1832
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,060
 a few more people are like,

1833
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,200
 "Oh, that happened to me today,

1834
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,560
 so let's get in the use of it."

1835
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,640
 I don't know if that's true, but that's--

1836
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,360
 - I'm sure that's part of it, definitely, yeah.

1837
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,320
 - They have periods, killer whales.

1838
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,760
 So one of the only other mammals to have periods.

1839
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,280
 But, sorry, they have menopause.

1840
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,120
 - Oh, okay.

1841
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,200
 - And they're one of the only other mammals

1842
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,720
 to have menopause. - I'm the opposite, in fact.

1843
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,480
 (laughing)

1844
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,880
 - They have menopause and you get postmenopausal females.

1845
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,520
 And we're not really sure why this is,

1846
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,640
 why they have menopause.

1847
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,920
 But it has been found that postmenopausal female orcas

1848
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,080
 like to have sex with adolescent males.

1849
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,680
 - Oh, wow. - Young males.

1850
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,560
 - And there's one particular--

1851
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,960
 - The Coopers of the Sea.

1852
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,040
 - Exactly, yes.

1853
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,520
 And there's a woman called Deborah Giles,

1854
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,080
 who's Director of Research.

1855
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,820
 (laughing)

1856
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,340
 - Very hands-on research.

1857
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,480
 (laughing)

1858
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,880
 - So in case you're listening, I'm sure you don't do that.

1859
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,720
 You might do that.

1860
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,560
 It's fine if you do.

1861
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,280
 - Right in, right in the middle of the snow.

1862
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,720
 - Deborah has had nothing to do with any--

1863
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,960
 She's just Director of Research

1864
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,920
 at the Center for Whale Research.

1865
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,920
 And she explains, the reason the old ladies

1866
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,320
 are doing this to the young boys could be,

1867
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,400
 so it could be to provide them with sex ed,

1868
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,280
 show them the ropes, show them some good moves.

1869
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,360
 And also it's because females

1870
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,920
 who are looking for a sexually active male to copulate with,

1871
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,760
 they reject ones that they don't think are quite up to scratch.

1872
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,240
 And young males, when they get rejected by the female orcas,

1873
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,680
 get really upset and pissed off

1874
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,640
 much like a young 15-year-old boy

1875
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,720
 who has been embarrassed in front of his friends

1876
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,000
 when he asks out a girl.

1877
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,840
 And it causes tensions in the group

1878
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,520
 'cause these young males act out and they get disruptive.

1879
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,760
 So the older females who are post-menopausal,

1880
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,040
 so they can't, they go and have sex with them and--

1881
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,320
 - It's like a pity, a pity.

1882
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,920
 - It's pity sex, yeah.

1883
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,760
 - Wow.

1884
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,360
 - Yeah, it's Stifler's mum.

1885
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,200
 - Stifler's mum.

1886
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
 - It's not so much--

1887
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,040
 - Another 90s film reference for him.

1888
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,680
 (laughing)

1889
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,680
 - Killer Whales, they like changes in altitude.

1890
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,920
 (laughing)

1891
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,920
 So if you get big ships that are kind of trying

1892
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,720
 to catch fish at the bottom of the sea,

1893
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,120
 then it's an easy place to get some fish

1894
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,080
 if you're a killer whale.

1895
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,960
 Basically you go down to where they're catching it,

1896
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,920
 if they're dredging and you might get some good--

1897
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,760
 - Oh yeah.

1898
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,680
 - Some good Patagonian tooth fish.

1899
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,000
 And they found that quite recently

1900
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,120
 there was an adult female killer whale

1901
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,320
 who got to the depth of 1,087 meters

1902
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,480
 in order to get these fish.

1903
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,880
 Which is about as deep as Mount Snowden is high.

1904
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,200
 - Wow.

1905
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,240
 - So that's quite a big altitude difference.

1906
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,960
 - You say wow, it's way easier to go down than to go up.

1907
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,400
 - No, just as I said, I like fish.

1908
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,120
 - Okay, let's see you either walk to the top of Snowden,

1909
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,000
 well by the way, there's a train,

1910
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,760
 or go all the way 1,000 meters to the bottom of the ocean.

1911
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,040
 - Oh look, I may not have the whale anatomy

1912
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,440
 that makes it as easy as it is, but it's fast.

1913
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,400
 - Hannah, it's easier to come up,

1914
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
 it's easier to float to the surface than just to sink down.

1915
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,960
 You have to actively push against the force

1916
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,800
 of all that water.

1917
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,360
 - Think of the pressure down there.

1918
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,680
 - I'm finding it a bit hard though

1919
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,960
 to visualize the Snowden reference.

1920
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,280
 How many volumes of the Anaheim of the Judson Dynasty

1921
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,600
 are we talking?

1922
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,180
 (upbeat music)

1923
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:17,240
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.
