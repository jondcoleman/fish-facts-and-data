00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Hi everyone, just before we start this show,"
00:00:02,00:00:05,"I wanted to perform a tiny, tiny interview"
00:00:05,00:00:07,about a very exciting new book that's been released.
00:00:07,00:00:10,"It's a book called Impossible Things,"
00:00:10,00:00:13,unbelievable answers to the world's weirdest questions.
00:00:13,00:00:16,"And it's by renowned author and podcaster,"
00:00:16,00:00:18,"Dan Treiber, here with me today."
00:00:18,00:00:19,"- Hello, thank you for having me."
00:00:19,00:00:20,- It's a real pleasure.
00:00:20,00:00:23,How would you describe what this book is about?
00:00:23,00:00:26,- This is a book where I look into all the mysteries
00:00:26,00:00:28,that kids are fascinated by.
00:00:28,00:00:30,Are we being visited by aliens?
00:00:30,00:00:32,Are there ghosts out there in haunted houses?
00:00:32,00:00:33,Are there monsters in the lock?
00:00:33,00:00:35,Do time travelers visit us?
00:00:35,00:00:36,All that sort of stuff.
00:00:36,00:00:37,I've actually gone on 10 adventures
00:00:37,00:00:40,to investigate it on behalf of kids.
00:00:40,00:00:41,Getting to the bottom of the history
00:00:41,00:00:43,"of why we believe in this stuff,"
00:00:43,00:00:45,how it's changed the course of the world.
00:00:45,00:00:47,And it's also just a funny little adventure
00:00:47,00:00:49,that kids will hopefully enjoy.
00:00:49,00:00:52,"- Yes, if you are fans of this podcast at all,"
00:00:52,00:00:54,this book is basically bang in line with that.
00:00:54,00:00:57,"And when Dan's personality, it's full of amazing facts."
00:00:57,00:00:58,"It doesn't say wrong stuff,"
00:00:58,00:01:01,"even though it's about all these weird, mysterious phenomena."
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- Yeah, and it's as much written for adults as it is kids."
00:01:03,00:01:07,"Fish listeners, it would really be a huge, huge deal for me"
00:01:07,00:01:08,if you could go out and get a copy today.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"It's really, really incredibly hard to sell books,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,particularly kids' books.
00:01:12,00:01:14,And I would love to turn this into a series.
00:01:14,00:01:17,And I can only do that if it's a success.
00:01:17,00:01:19,And you are my best chance at that.
00:01:19,00:01:23,So please do pick up a copy online or in bookshots today.
00:01:23,00:01:24,"- Okay, on with the show."
00:01:24,00:01:25,- On with the show.
00:01:26,00:01:29,(alarm blaring)
00:01:29,00:01:41,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:43,00:01:47,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Dublin.
00:01:47,00:01:50,(audience cheering)
00:01:54,00:01:56,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:01:58,00:02:01,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:02:01,00:02:03,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:03,00:02:06,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:06,00:02:09,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:09,00:02:13,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:02:13,00:02:17,"- Okay, my fact this week is that mathematician Blaise Pascal"
00:02:17,00:02:22,once cured his toothache by thinking about maths.
00:02:22,00:02:23,(audience laughing)
00:02:23,00:02:27,- We went from like crazy rock and roll beginning to--
00:02:27,00:02:29,"- Excuse me, but there is nothing more rock and roll"
00:02:29,00:02:30,than maths.
00:02:30,00:02:31,- That's true.
00:02:31,00:02:34,- And especially 17th century French maths.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"- And Blaise Pascal, what a hot name."
00:02:36,00:02:38,"That's a rock star, I've never heard one."
00:02:38,00:02:40,"- You don't get enough Blaise these days, do you?"
00:02:40,00:02:40,- No.
00:02:40,00:02:41,- You need to come back.
00:02:41,00:02:43,So was this like one of those cures where if you've got
00:02:43,00:02:45,"a pain, subject yourself to something even worse?"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"Like you've got a toothache, shoot yourself in the foot,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,"and you'll forget about the toothache, apparently."
00:02:49,00:02:52,"- I see where you're going, but no, it's the exact opposite."
00:02:52,00:02:56,"- He was thinking about problems concerning the cycloid,"
00:02:56,00:03:00,which is a curve traced by a point on the edge of a circle.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"- Rock and roll, wow."
00:03:02,00:03:05,- His toothache disappeared and he decided that it was
00:03:05,00:03:08,"God that did it, and God was saying to him,"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"you need to carry on with the maths,"
00:03:10,00:03:12,and carry on with the maths he did.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"- Wow, that's good."
00:03:13,00:03:17,"So Pascal, the only thing I'd ever heard of Pascal"
00:03:17,00:03:19,"before researching this fact is Pascal's wager,"
00:03:19,00:03:22,"and the idea is that if you, what is the idea?"
00:03:22,00:03:25,"Is that if you, even if you think it's unlikely"
00:03:25,00:03:27,"that a vengeful God does exist,"
00:03:27,00:03:29,you may as well go through the motions
00:03:29,00:03:31,"as if a vengeful God does exist,"
00:03:31,00:03:34,because on the off chance that you're wrong
00:03:34,00:03:36,"and he does exist, it's much better to have."
00:03:36,00:03:37,- You're absolutely fucked.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:03:39,00:03:42,But I think actually God is going to know
00:03:42,00:03:43,"that you're doing that, right?"
00:03:43,00:03:45,Because God knows everything.
00:03:45,00:03:48,"So as soon as you say, oh yeah, I really believed you"
00:03:48,00:03:50,"all that time, he's going to go bullshit."
00:03:50,00:03:53,- Imagine if God turned out to be such a chump
00:03:53,00:03:55,that he didn't know when you truly believed in art.
00:03:55,00:03:57,"He said, yeah, you believed, I saw it at the end."
00:03:57,00:04:00,"You said, yes, come on in buddy, nice to see you."
00:04:00,00:04:01,"By the way, that's always presented"
00:04:01,00:04:03,"as if he was a non-believer,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,but he was very much into his religion.
00:04:05,00:04:07,So the idea of the wager did involve
00:04:07,00:04:09,you actually believing as well.
00:04:09,00:04:13,"It wasn't just like, oh yeah, on the side kind of thing."
00:04:13,00:04:15,"- Just quickly, in 2008, Paddy Power"
00:04:15,00:04:18,offered Odds of Four to One that God existed.
00:04:18,00:04:19,- Hey.
00:04:19,00:04:21,- That was a good bet you could have made at the time.
00:04:21,00:04:22,- Yeah.
00:04:22,00:04:22,- Have they had to pay out?
00:04:22,00:04:23,- Not yet.
00:04:23,00:04:25,"- Not yet, okay."
00:04:25,00:04:26,- They did say they would need
00:04:26,00:04:28,an independent authority to verify it.
00:04:28,00:04:31,"I don't know who, I don't know who that is."
00:04:31,00:04:33,- Who's going to be independent in that situation?
00:04:33,00:04:36,"Richard Dawkins, no he hasn't."
00:04:36,00:04:37,"- No, he's, yeah, yeah."
00:04:37,00:04:40,"- So this Blaise Pascal, he's such an interesting character."
00:04:40,00:04:43,"So he very sadly, he lost his mother"
00:04:43,00:04:44,when he was three years old.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"And his father, Etienne, basically decided"
00:04:46,00:04:48,that he was going to homeschool him.
00:04:48,00:04:51,And Etienne was himself an amateur mathematician.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"However, he thought math isn't for the young,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,like your brains are not ready when you're young.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"You need to do this when you're like 14, 15."
00:04:58,00:05:00,So he took all the math books in the house
00:05:00,00:05:02,and he locked them up in a cupboard.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"And he said, don't let me catch you,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,read in any math around here.
00:05:05,00:05:07,And so he became very curious about it
00:05:07,00:05:09,because he'd seen his father talk about it
00:05:09,00:05:10,with his friends and so on.
00:05:10,00:05:13,So basically Pascal had to discover math
00:05:13,00:05:17,"by thinking about it and landed on all the actual equations,"
00:05:17,00:05:18,which is extraordinary.
00:05:18,00:05:20,"- According to actually Pascal's sister,"
00:05:20,00:05:23,"the reason that his dad banned him from doing math,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"and he really did, and no one was allowed to mention math"
00:05:26,00:05:29,"in front of Blaise, she said that he did it because he knew,"
00:05:29,00:05:33,Etienne knew that math fills and greatly satisfies the mind
00:05:33,00:05:36,in such a huge way that he knew as soon as Blaise
00:05:36,00:05:38,"heard about math, he wouldn't be interested in classics"
00:05:38,00:05:40,or the humanities or anything like that.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"So he was like, I know you're going to get addicted"
00:05:42,00:05:43,as soon as you're exposed.
00:05:43,00:05:44,So I'm going to keep you away from it.
00:05:44,00:05:48,"But of course it piqued his interest so much, Blaise's interest."
00:05:48,00:05:49,"He was like, what is this mysterious thing?"
00:05:49,00:05:51,I'm not allowed to access.
00:05:51,00:05:54,And then it does sound like this incredible moment.
00:05:54,00:05:58,"A tear kind of came to my eye when I imagined Etienne,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"maths lover, as he was,"
00:06:00,00:06:04,"going up to his 12-year-old son's bedroom, opening the door."
00:06:04,00:06:05,- Don't come in.
00:06:05,00:06:06,I'm doing some math.
00:06:06,00:06:07,- I'm doing some math.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"- No, no, I'm masturbating, I'm masturbating."
00:06:09,00:06:12,"You're not masturbating, you're math debating."
00:06:12,00:06:14,(audience laughing)
00:06:14,00:06:15,"But he was right, that's what he was doing."
00:06:15,00:06:18,He was sitting there secretly drawing circles and triangles
00:06:18,00:06:21,and thinking about the relationship between angles.
00:06:21,00:06:24,"- I mean, he discovered amazing stuff."
00:06:24,00:06:25,"Well, it doesn't sound amazing to us."
00:06:25,00:06:27,He basically discovered that all the angles in a triangle
00:06:27,00:06:29,"add up to 180, duh."
00:06:29,00:06:32,"But we all studied maths, you see."
00:06:32,00:06:33,That's the difference.
00:06:33,00:06:35,Whereas this 12-year-old hadn't.
00:06:35,00:06:36,- He invented a calculator.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"Again, mid 17th century, not a lot of calculators."
00:06:39,00:06:41,"And it was called the pascaline,"
00:06:41,00:06:42,"named after him, obviously."
00:06:42,00:06:45,And he dedicated it to the French Chancellor.
00:06:45,00:06:46,And he got a patent of it.
00:06:46,00:06:48,"And then, most French move ever,"
00:06:48,00:06:49,"he said, ""No one else is allowed to make one,"
00:06:49,00:06:52,"""but me, I have to have total control over it"
00:06:52,00:06:53,"""so they didn't make any."""
00:06:53,00:06:54,(audience laughing)
00:06:54,00:06:55,"- It was for his dad, wasn't it?"
00:06:55,00:06:57,'Cause I think his dad worked in the sob
00:06:57,00:06:59,and kind of accounting thing.
00:06:59,00:07:01,And his dad was always tired and stuff.
00:07:01,00:07:02,"And he thought, ""If I make this calculator,"
00:07:02,00:07:03,"""it'll make his life easier."""
00:07:03,00:07:05,"- He used an abacus, his dad."
00:07:05,00:07:07,And he invented it to do away with the need.
00:07:07,00:07:08,- So sweet.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"And yet sort of so worrying in your child as well,"
00:07:11,00:07:11,if they've done that.
00:07:11,00:07:13,But mostly really sweet.
00:07:13,00:07:14,- I know.
00:07:14,00:07:15,- And it was essentially a calculator
00:07:15,00:07:17,"that allowed you to carry over,"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"which we all remember fondly,"
00:07:19,00:07:20,which abacus didn't allow you to do.
00:07:20,00:07:22,So his calculator automatically carried over.
00:07:22,00:07:23,"You know, carrying over."
00:07:23,00:07:24,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:24,00:07:26,"No one in the audience shouted, ""No, what?"""
00:07:26,00:07:27,- What is that?
00:07:27,00:07:29,- Is anyone here from the 1600s?
00:07:29,00:07:30,(audience laughing)
00:07:30,00:07:32,"- So yeah, it was amazing."
00:07:32,00:07:35,But he'd got this gig being an accountant.
00:07:35,00:07:37,It was a really good gig.
00:07:37,00:07:38,And it was in Normandy.
00:07:38,00:07:41,And he was actually managing the taxes of the whole area.
00:07:41,00:07:44,But he had fallen from grace massively
00:07:44,00:07:47,and come back into the grace of the French authorities.
00:07:47,00:07:49,"Not because of Blaise Pascal,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,but because of Blaise's sister.
00:07:51,00:07:52,So basically Etienne's there.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"He's pissed off Richelieu,"
00:07:54,00:07:55,who's the French prime minister.
00:07:55,00:07:58,And he's basically been exiled.
00:07:58,00:08:00,"So he's had to leave his three kids in Paris, Blaise,"
00:08:00,00:08:03,and then Jacqueline and Gilbert.
00:08:03,00:08:06,And Jacqueline turns out to be such a talented playwright
00:08:06,00:08:09,and actress at the age of 10 or something
00:08:09,00:08:12,that she performs for Cardinal Richelieu.
00:08:12,00:08:14,And he's so charmed by her
00:08:14,00:08:16,"that she goes up to him afterwards and says,"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"""Oh, I hope you like that."
00:08:17,00:08:18,"""By the way, would you mind forgiving my dad,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,"""not putting him in prison in the Bastille,"
00:08:20,00:08:21,"""not cutting his head off"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"""and giving him a good position instead?"""
00:08:23,00:08:25,"And Richelieu said, ""Yeah, right, you're cute."
00:08:25,00:08:26,"""I'll do that."""
00:08:26,00:08:27,(audience laughing)
00:08:27,00:08:28,- Precretious.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"- So then a bit later, Blaise Pascal,"
00:08:30,00:08:34,he was in a carriage and the horse is bolted
00:08:34,00:08:38,and they threw him into the Seine and he nearly died.
00:08:38,00:08:39,"- 'Cause it's very polluted, isn't it?"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"As we know from the Olympics, so was it?"
00:08:42,00:08:44,- But then he wrote an account of that accident
00:08:44,00:08:46,"and he had sort of like, God came to him"
00:08:46,00:08:48,while he was in the water
00:08:48,00:08:50,and that made him even more religious.
00:08:50,00:08:51,- It was called his Night of Fire
00:08:51,00:08:54,and he had a mystical moment and a realization
00:08:54,00:08:55,and he wrote this kind of poem
00:08:55,00:08:57,which apparently reads like a journal entry
00:08:57,00:08:59,and they only found it after he died.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"- And the religion was Janssenism, wasn't it?"
00:09:01,00:09:04,It was both him and his sister were Janssenists.
00:09:04,00:09:08,And the idea of Janssenism is we're all evil
00:09:08,00:09:10,and there's nothing you can do about it
00:09:10,00:09:11,and it's decided at the start
00:09:11,00:09:13,who's going to be saved by God
00:09:13,00:09:15,and who isn't going to be saved by God
00:09:15,00:09:17,and it really doesn't matter what you do while you're alive.
00:09:17,00:09:19,You're either fucked or not fucked.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"- Right, what's in it for me?"
00:09:21,00:09:22,Sorry.
00:09:22,00:09:23,(audience laughing)
00:09:23,00:09:25,"- I've got some bad news for you, Andy."
00:09:25,00:09:26,- Oh no.
00:09:26,00:09:28,- Which didn't make any sense and I'm sure it would
00:09:28,00:09:30,if we spent longer than a day reading up on this
00:09:30,00:09:33,"but to me, as James says, predestination,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,nothing you can do.
00:09:35,00:09:36,"But also, it's not like he went out"
00:09:36,00:09:38,and had a great time because of it.
00:09:38,00:09:39,He had a shit time.
00:09:39,00:09:41,"To be honest, I think he was a bore, Blaise Pascal."
00:09:41,00:09:44,He did the old classic mortifying himself.
00:09:44,00:09:47,It's called mortifying where he wore metal clothes
00:09:47,00:09:50,with spikes on the inside to hurt himself at all times.
00:09:50,00:09:51,So he could constantly be punished
00:09:51,00:09:55,and constantly banish vain and profane thoughts.
00:09:55,00:09:56,"You know, he was so devout."
00:09:56,00:09:58,He completely abandoned maths really
00:09:58,00:10:00,for the last 10 years of his life.
00:10:00,00:10:00,The fun thing.
00:10:00,00:10:02,- Is that your definition of boring?
00:10:02,00:10:03,- Someone who wears metal spikes.
00:10:03,00:10:05,(laughing)
00:10:05,00:10:07,"- If you have metal spikes facing outwards,"
00:10:07,00:10:08,"that's cool, that's SNN."
00:10:08,00:10:10,If the metal spikes are facing inwards.
00:10:10,00:10:12,(laughing)
00:10:12,00:10:15,- He always wore stockings soaked in brandy.
00:10:15,00:10:16,- Really?
00:10:16,00:10:16,"- Yeah, I heard that."
00:10:16,00:10:17,- What's that for?
00:10:17,00:10:18,- I heard it.
00:10:18,00:10:19,I heard it.
00:10:19,00:10:22,"Got some hot gauze, like I've read it in a document."
00:10:22,00:10:25,"- Yeah, he thought, well, he did have very bad circulation."
00:10:25,00:10:27,He was very sickly in his 30s
00:10:27,00:10:29,and he thought that his circulation would improve
00:10:29,00:10:30,if he wore.
00:10:30,00:10:33,"'Cause in those days, it was like, this is a hot thing."
00:10:33,00:10:34,Brandy is a hot thing.
00:10:34,00:10:36,It will improve the heat in your body.
00:10:36,00:10:37,It will help the circulation.
00:10:37,00:10:38,- It feels like it would do it.
00:10:38,00:10:39,"- I mean, and then..."
00:10:39,00:10:41,(laughing)
00:10:41,00:10:42,- Yeah.
00:10:42,00:10:44,- It might do it if it attracted people
00:10:44,00:10:45,to suckle at your tights.
00:10:45,00:10:46,(laughing)
00:10:46,00:10:47,As you well might.
00:10:47,00:10:48,(laughing)
00:10:48,00:10:49,- So he met Descartes.
00:10:49,00:10:51,This is hugely exciting in Paris in 1647.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"He'd been away, he'd been really ill."
00:10:53,00:10:54,He'd just got back.
00:10:54,00:10:55,And then he and Descartes were in the same room.
00:10:55,00:10:56,I think it's the only time--
00:10:56,00:10:58,- Are they both famous at this point?
00:10:58,00:10:59,- I think they're both pretty famous.
00:10:59,00:11:00,- Wow.
00:11:00,00:11:01,"- It's a huge, huge meeting of mind."
00:11:01,00:11:02,It's like--
00:11:02,00:11:04,"- It's like Comic-Con, but for the--"
00:11:04,00:11:05,"- Oh my God, yeah."
00:11:05,00:11:07,"It's like Comic-Con, but for the greatest thinkers"
00:11:07,00:11:09,of all time.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"And all the doctors have been suggesting to Pascal,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,"oh, you need to have more enemas and bloodlettings"
00:11:14,00:11:15,and purging.
00:11:15,00:11:18,"And Descartes said, have you just considered resting"
00:11:18,00:11:19,and having some soup?
00:11:19,00:11:21,"And it was a very, it went really badly."
00:11:21,00:11:22,- Right.
00:11:22,00:11:23,- So he didn't want the resting in the soup.
00:11:23,00:11:24,He wanted the enemas and purging.
00:11:24,00:11:25,- He wanted those.
00:11:25,00:11:26,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:11:26,00:11:27,- Right.
00:11:27,00:11:28,- Right.
00:11:28,00:11:28,- Weird guy.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"- You know, James, the headline fact."
00:11:30,00:11:32,So he thought about mathematics in order
00:11:32,00:11:34,to cure his toothache.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"Did the toothache, was it psychosomatic?"
00:11:37,00:11:38,Did it actually--
00:11:38,00:11:39,- Yeah.
00:11:39,00:11:40,- Did he then have a cure?
00:11:40,00:11:41,- I think what happened was it just went away.
00:11:41,00:11:42,(audience laughs)
00:11:42,00:11:43,- Yeah.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- Right.
00:11:44,00:11:45,- And perhaps the maths might not have had everything
00:11:45,00:11:46,to do with it.
00:11:46,00:11:46,Call me a skeptic.
00:11:46,00:11:48,(audience laughs)
00:11:48,00:11:50,"- But if you, you can take your mind off pain"
00:11:50,00:11:52,if you fill your mouth with saliva.
00:11:52,00:11:53,Does anyone else do that?
00:11:53,00:11:54,- Really?
00:11:54,00:11:56,"- Yeah, a few yeses and a few, more than a few."
00:11:56,00:11:57,- What?
00:11:57,00:11:58,"- Okay, but if you, it's just something else"
00:11:58,00:11:59,to focus on.
00:11:59,00:12:00,You just focus on filling your mouth with saliva.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"Right, I've got to get these saliva ducks flowing."
00:12:02,00:12:02,- What's hurting on you?
00:12:02,00:12:04,Is it your teeth or anything on your teeth?
00:12:04,00:12:05,"- Yeah, but not, I don't think this works"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"if you've broken your leg, for instance."
00:12:07,00:12:10,It only works in like a headache or something like that.
00:12:10,00:12:13,- It works for a limited amount of time on minor pains.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"- But on all pain, that's really interesting."
00:12:15,00:12:16,- I would say all pain.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- So you've done it to yourself.
00:12:17,00:12:18,- I'm constantly doing it.
00:12:18,00:12:19,- So when's the last time you did it?
00:12:19,00:12:20,(audience laughs)
00:12:20,00:12:21,- I don't know.
00:12:21,00:12:23,(audience laughs)
00:12:23,00:12:24,- Do you think this could be used
00:12:24,00:12:26,"in childbirth, for instance, Sandy?"
00:12:26,00:12:27,(audience laughs)
00:12:27,00:12:28,- I don't see why not.
00:12:28,00:12:29,- I've tried a lot of other stuff
00:12:29,00:12:31,"and it doesn't seem to have worked, so."
00:12:31,00:12:32,(audience laughs)
00:12:32,00:12:33,- Some of it does work.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"- It's just leading over to your wife, okay."
00:12:35,00:12:38,- Have you thought about thinking of math equations?
00:12:38,00:12:39,(audience laughs)
00:12:39,00:12:42,"- Look, just in your own time, what's six times 17?"
00:12:42,00:12:44,(audience laughs)
00:12:44,00:12:46,"- Hey, so do you know, toothache,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,one of the earliest ideas of what it might be
00:12:48,00:12:51,is that you were infected with a tooth worm.
00:12:51,00:12:52,- Oh yeah.
00:12:52,00:12:53,- Amazing idea.
00:12:53,00:12:55,They thought there was a living creature inside there
00:12:55,00:12:57,"that was wiggling around, trying to get out,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,"and that's what was causing all the pain inside,"
00:12:59,00:13:01,and so this is ancient.
00:13:01,00:13:03,- I think it might be the oldest misconception
00:13:03,00:13:07,"in humankind, the oldest that I've ever found anyway,"
00:13:07,00:13:08,'cause the Babylonians believed it.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- And it lasted forever, I mean,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,"it lasted until the 18th century, basically,"
00:13:12,00:13:16,"when it was roundly debunked by Pierre Fochard, a dentist,"
00:13:16,00:13:18,"but it was believed everywhere, wasn't it?"
00:13:18,00:13:20,"Like, from ancient Egypt to Mesoamerica,"
00:13:20,00:13:22,how are they getting hold of this idea?
00:13:22,00:13:24,"- I briefly believed it while I was researching this,"
00:13:24,00:13:28,"'cause I was in the 17th century,"
00:13:28,00:13:30,and I just didn't do the researching
00:13:30,00:13:32,"of what a toothache is until later on,"
00:13:32,00:13:36,"so for a few hours in 2024, someone believed in tooth worms."
00:13:36,00:13:38,- That tooth worms existed.
00:13:38,00:13:41,- Irish remedies for toothache.
00:13:41,00:13:44,So is the National Folklore Collection much discussed still?
00:13:44,00:13:48,"A little bit, okay, so it was school children,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,"they were sent out, sort of 10 to 14 year olds"
00:13:50,00:13:51,"were sent in their local area,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,they wrote up all the folklore they could gather
00:13:53,00:13:55,"from people who'd been alive,"
00:13:55,00:13:58,"so this was done, yeah, 1937, '38,"
00:13:58,00:13:59,"so the years it covered,"
00:13:59,00:14:00,"because of the age of the people they were talking to,"
00:14:00,00:14:02,"went back to the 1860s,"
00:14:02,00:14:07,"and a lot of the folklore was to do with how to cure,"
00:14:07,00:14:10,"it was warts, whooping cough, and toothache,"
00:14:10,00:14:14,"and the cures, I have to say, largely potato-based,"
00:14:14,00:14:17,"they were, I'm afraid."
00:14:17,00:14:21,- What do you do with said potato?
00:14:21,00:14:25,"- You go into the garden, get a potato pecked by a crow,"
00:14:25,00:14:27,"put it in your pocket, and never let it fall out."
00:14:27,00:14:28,(laughing)
00:14:28,00:14:29,- Okay.
00:14:29,00:14:30,- That'll do it.
00:14:30,00:14:31,- That's it.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"- And get a slice of raw potato, put it in your cheek,"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"it sounds fractionally more believable, you know?"
00:14:34,00:14:35,"- Yeah, that could work."
00:14:35,00:14:36,"- Yeah, but by far the most common,"
00:14:36,00:14:38,"actually it was not potato, but it was frog-based,"
00:14:38,00:14:40,"was to keep a live frog in your mouth for a few minutes,"
00:14:40,00:14:43,"the frog gets the, oh, come on, it's all right."
00:14:43,00:14:44,(laughing)
00:14:44,00:14:45,"Keep it in your mouth for a few minutes,"
00:14:45,00:14:46,"and then let it out, and it gets the toothache,"
00:14:46,00:14:50,"very sad for it, but it takes yours away."
00:14:50,00:14:52,And do you know this sign?
00:14:52,00:14:54,It's like you put an L on your forehead.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"- James is calling me a loser, yeah."
00:14:55,00:14:57,"- No, I'm not calling you a loser, so this sign,"
00:14:57,00:15:00,this according to Canadian Medical Hall of Fame member
00:15:00,00:15:03,"Ronald Meltzak, if you take the L sign"
00:15:03,00:15:05,"for calling someone a loser,"
00:15:05,00:15:09,"and then you rub an ice cube up and down the L,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"then that will get rid of your toothache,"
00:15:11,00:15:14,and it works in more than 50% of patients.
00:15:14,00:15:15,- Really?
00:15:15,00:15:17,"- Yeah, and his theory, and he's tried this,"
00:15:17,00:15:20,"and his theory is your body sort of feels the cold,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,"and it blocks some pathways, some pain pathways"
00:15:23,00:15:24,"to your brain, and so it stops the."
00:15:24,00:15:25,- Wow.
00:15:25,00:15:26,- Wow.
00:15:26,00:15:27,- According to him.
00:15:27,00:15:28,- Yeah.
00:15:28,00:15:29,- Give it a go.
00:15:29,00:15:31,- And he's in the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.
00:15:31,00:15:32,(laughing)
00:15:32,00:15:32,- Okay.
00:15:32,00:15:33,- That's pretty funny.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"- Not 17th Century Hall of Fame,"
00:15:34,00:15:35,the Modern Hall of Fame.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"- Modern Canada, but modern."
00:15:37,00:15:40,(laughing)
00:15:40,00:15:47,"- It is time for fact number two,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,and that is my fact.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"My fact this week is that it turns out,"
00:15:52,00:15:55,Stonehenge isn't a henge.
00:15:55,00:15:56,(laughing)
00:15:56,00:15:57,- Wow.
00:15:57,00:15:58,- Isn't that nuts?
00:15:58,00:16:00,The only henge we know about isn't an actual henge.
00:16:00,00:16:02,- So what's going on?
00:16:02,00:16:02,What is it?
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- Okay, this is according to English Heritage."
00:16:04,00:16:05,"If you go on their site,"
00:16:05,00:16:08,"they have a fantastic page all about henges,"
00:16:08,00:16:12,"and obviously Stonehenge leads the category there,"
00:16:12,00:16:13,but then you get to a little bit where it says
00:16:13,00:16:16,"it isn't officially a proper henge,"
00:16:16,00:16:20,as the main ditch is external to the main bank.
00:16:20,00:16:23,"So what it is, in fact, is a protohenge."
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Now here's the weird thing,"
00:16:25,00:16:28,henges are only called henges
00:16:28,00:16:30,because they're named after Stonehenge.
00:16:30,00:16:32,(laughing)
00:16:32,00:16:32,- Wow.
00:16:32,00:16:34,- This cat has eaten its own tail.
00:16:34,00:16:35,- Yeah.
00:16:35,00:16:35,- It is amazing.
00:16:35,00:16:38,- It's where the ditches and where the raised bank is.
00:16:38,00:16:40,- But it's also the size as well.
00:16:40,00:16:42,It has to be over 65 feet across
00:16:42,00:16:43,when you would do the ditches.
00:16:43,00:16:44,- Okay.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"- If they found loads of henges,"
00:16:46,00:16:48,"and they're all the same, apart from Stonehenge,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,"it feels like Stonehenge was assembled incorrectly,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,but basically the packet instructions
00:16:53,00:16:56,"clearly showed the ditch inside the bank or whatever,"
00:16:56,00:16:57,or else I don't care.
00:16:57,00:16:59,But do you know what I mean?
00:16:59,00:17:00,"Like, they just did it wrong."
00:17:00,00:17:01,'Cause I think there is a theory
00:17:01,00:17:05,that it was basically a reassembly from another site.
00:17:05,00:17:08,"- Oh, it's a second-hand henge, basically."
00:17:08,00:17:08,- Yeah.
00:17:08,00:17:09,- Yeah.
00:17:09,00:17:10,- It's basically--
00:17:10,00:17:11,"- It's a henge me down, basically."
00:17:11,00:17:15,"- Oh, lovely, lovely, very strong."
00:17:15,00:17:18,"- Don't boom it, that wasn't prepped, you know what I mean?"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"- You've been sat all day writing that joke, haven't you done?"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"Yeah, there's another site in Wales, isn't there,"
00:17:23,00:17:27,"where they've looked at what's missing from there,"
00:17:27,00:17:28,and what's in Stonehenge.
00:17:28,00:17:31,"And it almost comes together as a whole thing, yeah."
00:17:31,00:17:32,Because they also worked out
00:17:32,00:17:34,"that people were living there for ages,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,"and then they stopped living there,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"and then they came back later,"
00:17:38,00:17:38,and they stopped living there
00:17:38,00:17:41,about the same time as the stones left.
00:17:41,00:17:43,So it could be that they just decided to move to Salisbury
00:17:43,00:17:45,and took their big old stones with them.
00:17:45,00:17:48,- The baggage allowance must have been massive
00:17:48,00:17:49,in the olden days.
00:17:49,00:17:52,"- There's also another theory by Geoffrey of Monmouth,"
00:17:52,00:17:53,the 12th century author.
00:17:53,00:17:57,He says that Stonehenge was originally built in Ireland
00:17:57,00:17:59,by a group of giants from Africa.
00:17:59,00:18:01,- By a group of who?
00:18:01,00:18:02,- A group of giants from Africa.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"- Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:04,00:18:04,- Classic.
00:18:04,00:18:08,- And then Merlin took them over from Ireland to Britain.
00:18:08,00:18:10,- We're booing Merlin.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- We're booing Merlin.
00:18:11,00:18:13,- Wow.
00:18:13,00:18:15,- Don't you mention his name in this town.
00:18:15,00:18:16,(audience laughing)
00:18:16,00:18:17,He knows what he did.
00:18:17,00:18:21,- That's actually just very good etymological knowledge
00:18:21,00:18:22,from this audience.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"'Cause Merlin, of course, literally means shit,"
00:18:24,00:18:25,Merlin.
00:18:25,00:18:26,"It does, yeah."
00:18:26,00:18:28,"One of our earliest facts in Welsh, it meant shit."
00:18:28,00:18:30,And that's why we changed it to Merlin
00:18:30,00:18:32,'cause we thought the name shit was too embarrassing.
00:18:32,00:18:32,- It was embarrassing.
00:18:32,00:18:34,- But he did indeed.
00:18:34,00:18:37,I think these giants brought it all the way to Ireland
00:18:37,00:18:40,"from Africa, and then back to England."
00:18:40,00:18:41,"And this was the prevailing theory,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"or the most common popular theory, wasn't it,"
00:18:43,00:18:44,until the 19th century.
00:18:44,00:18:45,I don't think many people believed it.
00:18:45,00:18:47,- It qualifies as a theory.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"I don't know, there were lots of theories,"
00:18:48,00:18:50,and they all sort of reflect the times
00:18:50,00:18:51,in which they were espoused.
00:18:51,00:18:53,"So there's, you know, is it a calculator"
00:18:53,00:18:55,to work out the seasons?
00:18:55,00:18:56,Is it a healing place?
00:18:56,00:18:59,Is it a spacecraft landing pad?
00:18:59,00:19:04,"Is it a dating, literally a site for romance?"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"- Oh, not dating as in the data."
00:19:06,00:19:08,"- No, sorry, not carbon dating, just dating."
00:19:08,00:19:09,- Right.
00:19:09,00:19:11,- How would the dating work?
00:19:11,00:19:13,"- It's just a symbolic, sort of, meat meeting."
00:19:13,00:19:14,"- But you would meet them, like,"
00:19:14,00:19:17,let's go to Stonehenge and catch a...
00:19:17,00:19:18,- Catch something.
00:19:18,00:19:20,- Catch something.
00:19:20,00:19:21,"Well, that was really nice,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,'cause it would be a dating site called Henge.
00:19:23,00:19:24,That would be very pleasing.
00:19:24,00:19:25,"- Oh, yeah."
00:19:25,00:19:28,- Dan and I sitting right in that chair.
00:19:28,00:19:30,- Dan and I sitting next to each other on the plane.
00:19:30,00:19:31,What are you doing?
00:19:31,00:19:32,- Nothing.
00:19:32,00:19:35,- But one of the latest theories
00:19:35,00:19:36,"is that it was basically a meeting place,"
00:19:36,00:19:39,"and it was actually a sort of community centre, effectively."
00:19:39,00:19:43,"Like, it was an attempt to get people to come here,"
00:19:43,00:19:46,"get involved in a big project, work together,"
00:19:46,00:19:49,'cause it was a time of big population decline and dispersal.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"So it was just an attempt to kind of get people together,"
00:19:51,00:19:52,you know?
00:19:52,00:19:55,"- There's a lot of shit, isn't there, about Stonehenge?"
00:19:55,00:19:57,"But the nice thing is, there always has been."
00:19:57,00:20:00,"When you look back at early 1800s sources,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,people bitch about the fact that the number of theories
00:20:02,00:20:04,about where Stonehenge comes from
00:20:04,00:20:06,and why it's there are ridiculous.
00:20:06,00:20:08,So there was a whole spate of research
00:20:08,00:20:10,in the 1920s and 1930s.
00:20:10,00:20:12,There was an extremely authoritative account written
00:20:12,00:20:14,"called The Stones of Stonehenge,"
00:20:14,00:20:18,"and his name was Edward Herbert Stone, which is nice."
00:20:18,00:20:19,- Very nice.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"- There's Henry Brown as well, 1823."
00:20:21,00:20:23,"He wrote what was officially the guidebook,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,"that's the first guidebook to Stonehenge,"
00:20:25,00:20:26,"and the theory that he puts in there,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"which he kind of presents as fact,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,is that it survived Noah's flood.
00:20:30,00:20:34,- There was a very interesting debate between two excavators.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"Again, in the 20s and 30s,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,when people were starting to do serious archaeology
00:20:38,00:20:41,"about Stonehenge, rather than coming up with mad theories,"
00:20:41,00:20:44,"the two main explorers of it, and excavators of it,"
00:20:44,00:20:46,were a woman called Maude Cunnington
00:20:46,00:20:48,and a man called Alexander Kaler.
00:20:48,00:20:50,And I got really obsessed with them
00:20:50,00:20:52,because they sort of hated each other.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"Eventually, their rivalry came to center on this one stone,"
00:20:56,00:20:59,and it was a stone that Maude visited in 1911.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"So she'd gone to lift up another stone,"
00:21:01,00:21:02,which is called Adam.
00:21:02,00:21:05,"They give a couple of the stone's names, Adam and Eve, notably,"
00:21:05,00:21:08,"and she'd lifted up this other stone, which had fallen over."
00:21:08,00:21:11,- Was she a giant? Sorry.
00:21:11,00:21:12,"- Yeah, sorry. I should have made it clear"
00:21:12,00:21:16,that she brought quite a lot of heavy machinery with her.
00:21:16,00:21:19,A large number of other people lifted up the hen stone.
00:21:19,00:21:21,"Cunnington came to the site in the 30s,"
00:21:21,00:21:24,"when that idiot woman, she's put it the wrong way up,"
00:21:24,00:21:28,"was determined she put it the wrong way up, flipped it over,"
00:21:28,00:21:29,put it on its head.
00:21:29,00:21:30,"Now, as they've looked at the stones"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"and realized that he got it wrong,"
00:21:32,00:21:34,so there's this upside down stone there.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"- Brilliant. - That's messing it all up,"
00:21:35,00:21:38,solely the result of this rivalry between these two people.
00:21:38,00:21:40,- Wow. - Did they fall in love?
00:21:40,00:21:41,(audience laughing)
00:21:41,00:21:43,'Cause it sounds like everything you're saying is a rom-com.
00:21:43,00:21:45,- It does. I know.
00:21:45,00:21:47,"Yes, this is the beginning of ""You've got mail."""
00:21:47,00:21:49,"Yes, I didn't."
00:21:49,00:21:53,"- Other places that are modeled on Stonehenge,"
00:21:53,00:21:55,have you heard of a bonehenge?
00:21:55,00:21:57,Bonehenge is a--
00:21:57,00:21:58,- It's like an elephant graveyard kind of thing.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"- Yeah, it's a mammoth bone circle in Russia."
00:22:01,00:22:03,"- Oh, wow. - Made about 20,000 years ago."
00:22:03,00:22:04,Very cool. - Wow.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- Skonhenge.
00:22:05,00:22:07,(audience laughing)
00:22:07,00:22:09,- Is that as in scones?
00:22:09,00:22:11,"- It's pronounced Skonhenge, that's correct."
00:22:11,00:22:13,That's a restaurant in California.
00:22:13,00:22:14,(audience laughing)
00:22:14,00:22:16,There was the time when Queen Elizabeth
00:22:16,00:22:18,was beamed onto the stones for her jubilee.
00:22:18,00:22:19,"- What, is there a word for it?"
00:22:19,00:22:20,- Thronehenge.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"- Ah, damn it."
00:22:21,00:22:24,- And Ireland is home to a historic site
00:22:24,00:22:28,that was found by someone flying up an unmanned aerial vehicle.
00:22:28,00:22:29,(audience laughing)
00:22:29,00:22:30,- Would it by any chance be Dronehenge?
00:22:30,00:22:32,- Dronehenge!
00:22:32,00:22:33,- Amazing.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"- So it is, it's still a mystery, isn't it?"
00:22:35,00:22:36,"Stonehenge, where the stones come from."
00:22:36,00:22:37,There's always new reports.
00:22:37,00:22:41,They suddenly think that some of the stones are from Wales.
00:22:41,00:22:42,- I think they've always thought from Wales.
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- Sorry, from Scotland."
00:22:43,00:22:44,"- Yeah, that's the huge news, isn't it?"
00:22:44,00:22:46,"- That's the big news, but recently they thought,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,why don't we try and see if the method
00:22:48,00:22:51,of laying them down on sleds over logs
00:22:51,00:22:53,is something that is achievable?
00:22:53,00:22:54,And the result was they discovered
00:22:54,00:22:56,it's just incredibly easy to do that.
00:22:56,00:22:58,(audience laughing)
00:22:58,00:23:01,"10 people can pull the stones in a very,"
00:23:01,00:23:01,"it's a slow manner,"
00:23:01,00:23:04,but it's not as taxing as we thought it was.
00:23:04,00:23:06,- We've just given these guys so much credit
00:23:06,00:23:08,"for hundreds of years, it's piece of piss."
00:23:08,00:23:11,- Do you know we found the original tape measures
00:23:11,00:23:13,that were probably used for Stonehenge?
00:23:13,00:23:14,"- No, we don't."
00:23:14,00:23:15,"- We have, this is so cool, okay?"
00:23:15,00:23:16,- What?
00:23:16,00:23:18,"- They're called the Folkton Drums,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,"and they're big stone cylinders carved from solid chalk,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,"right, and they are massive."
00:23:23,00:23:25,"They're about 5,000 years old,"
00:23:25,00:23:26,"and each of them is a particular size,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,"so that if it goes around once, for example,"
00:23:28,00:23:32,"it's a number of multiples of 3.2 meters,"
00:23:32,00:23:33,"and that measurement crops up everywhere,"
00:23:33,00:23:36,so we think those are the sort of tape measures
00:23:36,00:23:39,"of the gods, and they could send off to Wales,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"saying, can you bring me a stone that's this big,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"according to the drums,"
00:23:43,00:23:43,and they'll send back something
00:23:43,00:23:45,that's the right size for you.
00:23:45,00:23:46,- How cool is that?
00:23:46,00:23:47,"- What if it was just like an earthquake,"
00:23:47,00:23:48,and they landed like that?
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Yeah.
00:23:49,00:23:51,(audience laughing)
00:23:51,00:23:52,"- Yeah, I mean, that's a good,"
00:23:52,00:23:55,"in many ways, an easier theory for us all, isn't it?"
00:23:55,00:23:56,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:56,00:23:59,- Older than Stonehenge is New Grange.
00:23:59,00:24:03,"In fact, I feel like your fact could have been"
00:24:03,00:24:05,"New Grange is not new, yeah."
00:24:05,00:24:06,"- Oh, right, yeah, it's very old."
00:24:06,00:24:08,"- But they've recently, yeah, very old,"
00:24:08,00:24:09,"older than Stonehenge,"
00:24:09,00:24:11,they've recently done some DNA tests.
00:24:11,00:24:12,- What is it for international?
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- Oh, sorry, for international listeners."
00:24:14,00:24:17,- And for those who maybe didn't do that better than reading?
00:24:17,00:24:18,(audience laughing)
00:24:18,00:24:20,"- It's a huge, like a huge barrow,"
00:24:20,00:24:23,"it's a huge earth mat under the middle of Ireland,"
00:24:23,00:24:25,"which was probably a burial site, we think,"
00:24:25,00:24:27,"'cause they found some bodies in there,"
00:24:27,00:24:28,"and they've done some DNA tests,"
00:24:28,00:24:32,and they found that there was a lot of incest going on.
00:24:32,00:24:33,"And what they reckon is,"
00:24:33,00:24:36,"it was a bit like, you know, in ancient Egypt,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,"how all the kings and queens married each other,"
00:24:38,00:24:39,"and then, you know,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,their children married each other and stuff like that.
00:24:41,00:24:44,They reckon there was a lot of that in Ireland at the time.
00:24:44,00:24:47,(audience laughing)
00:24:50,00:24:52,"- Just one person cheering,"
00:24:52,00:24:55,and a very worried-looking sister next to him.
00:24:55,00:24:58,(audience laughing)
00:24:58,00:25:02,"- His mum and his sister and his cousin have all come along,"
00:25:02,00:25:03,but thankfully they're all in the same seat.
00:25:03,00:25:05,(audience laughing)
00:25:05,00:25:06,- Sorry.
00:25:06,00:25:07,- Childish.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"- But yeah, it's really interesting now,"
00:25:08,00:25:12,because it implies a really elite system
00:25:12,00:25:15,of almost like pharaohs in Ireland.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"- Wow, cool."
00:25:16,00:25:18,"- And that's also where they found Dronehenge, isn't it?"
00:25:18,00:25:19,"- Yes, they found Dronehenge near thereabouts"
00:25:19,00:25:21,"where that bloke found Dronehenge,"
00:25:21,00:25:22,"and he's now published a book,"
00:25:22,00:25:25,"The Story Behind the Remarkable Neolithic Discovery,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"about the events following the day he found it,"
00:25:27,00:25:30,and how the world's media descended on him.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"And I encourage you to look up the accounts,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,because I don't know how much it was
00:25:34,00:25:35,"headline news all around the world,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,(audience laughing)
00:25:37,00:25:38,as is claimed in the book.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"- I got one last thing,"
00:25:41,00:25:44,which is that I've always wanted to go to Stonehenge.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"I've never been, and as part of this research,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,"I thought, oh, I wonder if it's on TripAdvisor."
00:25:49,00:25:50,"And it turns out it is,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,and it has a lot of one-star reviews.
00:25:52,00:25:54,- No. - Yeah.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"So this is one,"
00:25:56,00:25:59,this is one going as back as 2014.
00:25:59,00:26:02,I was disgusted to find that this was just
00:26:02,00:26:04,a few rocks to look at.
00:26:04,00:26:04,(audience laughing)
00:26:04,00:26:07,"Nothing to do, they should knock it down"
00:26:07,00:26:08,and build an arcade or a fun fair.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"Don't waste your time, what a silly place."
00:26:11,00:26:14,"And then, August of 2023, someone wrote,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,"""I expected so much more than just stones placed"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"""in a circle."
00:26:18,00:26:20,"""As a World Heritage site, at the very least,"
00:26:20,00:26:22,"""I would have expected an ice cream van."""
00:26:22,00:26:24,(audience laughing)
00:26:24,00:26:26,I didn't fight the war for this.
00:26:26,00:26:28,(audience laughing)
00:26:28,00:26:29,- Next review. - Next review.
00:26:29,00:26:31,- Not even a henge.
00:26:31,00:26:33,(audience laughing)
00:26:33,00:26:35,(upbeat music)
00:26:35,00:26:39,"- It is time for fact number three,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,and that is Anne.
00:26:41,00:26:43,- My fact this week is that
00:26:43,00:26:46,the sport with the highest rate of concussion
00:26:46,00:26:49,is synchronized swimming.
00:26:49,00:26:51,- Is that 'cause one of the swimmers bangs their head
00:26:51,00:26:52,and everyone has to copy them?
00:26:52,00:26:55,(audience laughing)
00:26:55,00:26:59,"- It's a funny line, James,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,but it's a fundamental misunderstanding
00:27:01,00:27:04,of synchronized swimming.
00:27:04,00:27:05,We'll come on to that.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"But I should caveat this by saying,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,this is based on my reading
00:27:09,00:27:12,and not actual academic comparative studies.
00:27:12,00:27:15,But I have surmised this
00:27:15,00:27:17,from a lot that I've read about synchronized swimming.
00:27:17,00:27:19,It's extremely dangerous.
00:27:19,00:27:22,"So I was reading an account of Bill Moreau,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,who was the Vice President of Sports Medicine
00:27:24,00:27:28,for the US Olympic Committee between 2009 and 2019.
00:27:28,00:27:31,And he supervised lots of sports
00:27:31,00:27:33,for safety and health concerns.
00:27:33,00:27:35,And he supervised synchronized swimming.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"And in a two week training camp,"
00:27:37,00:27:40,he said 50% of the team sustained a concussion.
00:27:40,00:27:43,And that surpassed NFL and Aussie rules football.
00:27:43,00:27:45,"- Are they, is that team just really shit?"
00:27:45,00:27:47,(audience laughing)
00:27:47,00:27:49,"Like, what are they, they must be,"
00:27:49,00:27:51,'cause they can't be hitting the bottom of the pool.
00:27:51,00:27:52,"- Okay, it's not allowed."
00:27:52,00:27:55,"- You're not allowed, it's just knocking heads, isn't it?"
00:27:55,00:27:56,- Yeah.
00:27:56,00:27:57,- It's crazy.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"Well, they keep on trying to make it better"
00:27:58,00:27:59,"and better and better and better and better,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,which means getting in tighter and tighter
00:28:01,00:28:02,and tighter to each other.
00:28:02,00:28:04,And you're flailing around
00:28:04,00:28:06,and you're upside down and you're kicking
00:28:06,00:28:09,and you just bang heads or kick each other
00:28:09,00:28:10,in the face all the time.
00:28:10,00:28:12,"- Absolutely, it's colliding with each other."
00:28:12,00:28:14,- Sometimes I read an account from one of them
00:28:14,00:28:17,"who, I think one of them broke another's nose accidentally"
00:28:17,00:28:20,"with a stray, you know, hand or foot or whatever"
00:28:20,00:28:22,and they didn't notice.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"- Well, 'cause you're so, they're so focused on the routine."
00:28:24,00:28:25,"- Yeah, you're doing your job."
00:28:25,00:28:26,Here's the thing.
00:28:26,00:28:27,(audience laughing)
00:28:27,00:28:30,"- Sorry, but if I punched you the nose right now,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,you wouldn't continue with this fact.
00:28:32,00:28:34,"- I'm a pro, I would continue on."
00:28:34,00:28:36,There's a photo for the audience at home
00:28:36,00:28:37,that's sitting behind us.
00:28:37,00:28:39,And what you can see on the photo here
00:28:39,00:28:41,is that the team is about to lob
00:28:41,00:28:44,one of their members up into the air right.
00:28:44,00:28:46,"And the thing is in synchronized swimming,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,you aren't allowed to touch the bottom right.
00:28:48,00:28:50,So the amount of kicking that you need to do
00:28:50,00:28:52,in order to get them up into the air
00:28:52,00:28:53,purely from swimming.
00:28:53,00:28:54,- It's insane.
00:28:54,00:28:55,"- It's nuts, yeah."
00:28:55,00:28:56,- I would think that they would breed
00:28:56,00:28:58,synchronized swimmers who are just very tall
00:28:58,00:28:59,so they can touch the bottom.
00:28:59,00:29:01,But that is apparently not how the sport works.
00:29:01,00:29:02,"- It's not, yeah."
00:29:02,00:29:03,"- No, it's against the rules."
00:29:03,00:29:06,They're completely pointless and you wouldn't work.
00:29:06,00:29:08,But this photo and the idea that they are kicking
00:29:08,00:29:12,madly underwater to sustain this beautiful performance
00:29:12,00:29:15,above the water is epitomized by Sarah Oek
00:29:15,00:29:17,who was a great synchronized swimmer
00:29:17,00:29:19,who actually got kicked in the head and concussed
00:29:19,00:29:22,and spent three years recuperating from that.
00:29:22,00:29:23,And so retired.
00:29:23,00:29:26,"But she said, ""We make it look pretty above the water"
00:29:26,00:29:28,"but below it's a battlefield."""
00:29:28,00:29:30,"And it is like underwater, it's mad."
00:29:30,00:29:33,And there are lots of studies into concussion
00:29:33,00:29:34,in other sports.
00:29:34,00:29:36,The rugby is often cited as the worst.
00:29:36,00:29:38,"That's three concussions per 1,000"
00:29:38,00:29:42,"kind of athletic exposures, which is one person in one game."
00:29:42,00:29:44,"But reading about synchronized swimming,"
00:29:44,00:29:47,"there was Miriam Glez, who is the chief executive"
00:29:47,00:29:50,"of USA Syncro, which is their national organizing body,"
00:29:50,00:29:53,"said, ""100% of my athletes will get a concussion"
00:29:53,00:29:55,"at some point."""
00:29:55,00:29:57,And it is just crashing into and falling on each other.
00:29:57,00:29:58,- They have helmets.
00:29:58,00:30:00,"- Well, they do in practice."
00:30:00,00:30:01,- But do they?
00:30:01,00:30:02,- They wear practice helmets.
00:30:02,00:30:03,"- Yeah, they're made of silicon"
00:30:03,00:30:07,and they've got like a honeycomb style make-up to them.
00:30:07,00:30:08,"Yeah, very tasty, right?"
00:30:08,00:30:09,Have a lick while you're down there.
00:30:09,00:30:11,(audience laughing)
00:30:11,00:30:16,"- Don't ever, don't ever, ever, ever say that again."
00:30:16,00:30:18,(audience laughing)
00:30:18,00:30:20,- Obviously you can't see what's going on
00:30:20,00:30:23,"under the water, but I don't think."
00:30:23,00:30:25,"- I think that's, the judges would come down"
00:30:25,00:30:25,very hard on that.
00:30:25,00:30:26,- Thanks.
00:30:26,00:30:27,(audience laughing)
00:30:27,00:30:31,"- As long as they have some jump-up, it's all right."
00:30:31,00:30:33,"- That is the thing, we're looking at the photo right now."
00:30:33,00:30:36,"Doesn't look very synchronized, does it, right?"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"And that's the thing, we're saying synchronized swimming."
00:30:38,00:30:40,It's artistic swimming.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"So it's not, synchronized has gone out as a term."
00:30:42,00:30:45,"- But also, you were never synchronized with each other."
00:30:45,00:30:47,You were synchronized with the music.
00:30:47,00:30:48,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:30:48,00:30:49,- Which is why you can have solo synchronized swimming.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"I have an opinion, which is that,"
00:30:52,00:30:54,I think this is a better sport under the water
00:30:54,00:30:55,than it is on top.
00:30:55,00:30:56,"- Ah, yes."
00:30:56,00:30:57,- Whoa.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"- Yeah, yeah, great."
00:30:58,00:30:59,- So you see the effort that goes in
00:30:59,00:31:00,and there are sometimes cameras under the water
00:31:00,00:31:03,and you can just see the furious effort that's going in.
00:31:03,00:31:04,And I think it's probably the only sport
00:31:04,00:31:07,"where if you film it in a different medium,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,"it's, I don't, I'm not sure what I'm trying to say."
00:31:09,00:31:11,"- I think it looks, it looks like shit."
00:31:11,00:31:12,- It's the only sport that takes place
00:31:12,00:31:15,"between two forms of matter, right?"
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- Well, half of you are all swimming."
00:31:16,00:31:17,- All swimming.
00:31:17,00:31:18,- All diving for sure.
00:31:18,00:31:19,- All swimming.
00:31:19,00:31:19,- All diving.
00:31:19,00:31:20,- Okay.
00:31:20,00:31:21,- Okay.
00:31:21,00:31:22,"- Now, gradually diving."
00:31:22,00:31:24,"- What's the one, water polo,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,where they've got the ball?
00:31:25,00:31:26,- Yeah.
00:31:26,00:31:27,- Yeah.
00:31:27,00:31:29,- That is crazy underneath
00:31:29,00:31:31,because they're literally like kicking and punching
00:31:31,00:31:33,"and yeah, everything."
00:31:33,00:31:34,"- I think to give Andy credit,"
00:31:34,00:31:35,I think diving isn't the same
00:31:35,00:31:37,"'cause diving ends once you enter the water, right?"
00:31:37,00:31:40,And synchronized swimming is constantly taking part
00:31:40,00:31:41,in both media.
00:31:41,00:31:42,- Thank you.
00:31:42,00:31:43,- And there you go.
00:31:43,00:31:44,"- So like, there's no sport"
00:31:44,00:31:47,where half of your body is encased in solid
00:31:47,00:31:49,and half of you is in plasma.
00:31:49,00:31:51,It just doesn't happen.
00:31:51,00:31:53,So I think that's what makes it interesting.
00:31:53,00:31:53,- That is true.
00:31:53,00:31:56,- And people pass out quite regularly
00:31:56,00:31:58,"'cause again, 'cause so much of it is under water,"
00:31:58,00:31:59,you have to be holding your breath
00:31:59,00:32:00,a huge amount of the time
00:32:00,00:32:01,and holding your breath
00:32:01,00:32:03,while exerting yourself enormously.
00:32:03,00:32:06,And this is another reason why the concussion issue
00:32:06,00:32:07,in synchronized swimming is such a thing
00:32:07,00:32:11,is that it's probably extremely under-reported
00:32:11,00:32:13,because the symptoms of concussion
00:32:13,00:32:16,are very similar to the symptoms of swimming upside down
00:32:16,00:32:17,whilst holding your breath
00:32:17,00:32:20,whilst having to fling people out of the air quite a lot.
00:32:20,00:32:21,So imagine doing that.
00:32:21,00:32:23,"You're there going, am I concussed or is this just"
00:32:23,00:32:25,how you feel when you're doing this mad thing?
00:32:25,00:32:26,- That's so funny.
00:32:26,00:32:27,- Yeah.
00:32:27,00:32:28,"- And then the training,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,"I mean, the training is incredibly stressful"
00:32:30,00:32:32,and there's a lot of it.
00:32:32,00:32:32,But one of the things they do
00:32:32,00:32:36,is they do crossfit workouts with their mouths taped
00:32:36,00:32:38,because they have to hold their breath under water
00:32:38,00:32:39,for like up to two minutes.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"And 'cause there's so much exertion,"
00:32:41,00:32:42,they have to not just get fit
00:32:42,00:32:45,but be able to do these things while holding their breath.
00:32:45,00:32:47,So they'll take the mouths and do some crossfit.
00:32:47,00:32:48,- I can breathe with my nose.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"So, in your face."
00:32:51,00:32:55,- I believe they probably take the nose as well.
00:32:55,00:32:56,- I think they probably do.
00:32:56,00:33:00,"- So, and this is another sort of like cruel intensity"
00:33:00,00:33:00,about it.
00:33:00,00:33:02,They're not allowed to wear swimming goggles.
00:33:02,00:33:03,- Yeah.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"- No, it's not in the final thing."
00:33:05,00:33:07,"- Yeah, 'cause the judges want to see their expression."
00:33:07,00:33:08,So the goggles aren't allowed to be there.
00:33:08,00:33:11,"And as a result, they get really irritated eyes."
00:33:11,00:33:14,And so a lot of synchronized or artistic swimmers
00:33:14,00:33:16,bathe their eyes in milk.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"'Cause apparently milk is very good for, yeah."
00:33:19,00:33:20,"- And is that, that's not recommended"
00:33:20,00:33:21,from the 17th century handbooks.
00:33:21,00:33:22,That's a genuine.
00:33:22,00:33:24,- That's Blaise Pascal says.
00:33:24,00:33:26,(laughing)
00:33:26,00:33:28,"Like you say, they want to see their eyes."
00:33:28,00:33:29,They want to see their expressions.
00:33:29,00:33:30,They want to see them smiling.
00:33:30,00:33:33,"And if you speak to any synchronized swimmer,"
00:33:33,00:33:35,they all say that the smile is fake.
00:33:35,00:33:39,And the reason they're smiling is to kind of height the pain.
00:33:39,00:33:40,It's kind of a grimace.
00:33:40,00:33:41,'Cause the pain is so bad.
00:33:41,00:33:43,"And they're like, ""Yeah, sure."""
00:33:43,00:33:44,(laughing)
00:33:44,00:33:46,"- I mean, all of these reports about how tough it is"
00:33:46,00:33:48,to come from synchronized swimmers.
00:33:48,00:33:49,- True.
00:33:49,00:33:50,"- Yeah, but I mean--"
00:33:50,00:33:50,- I'm just saying--
00:33:50,00:33:51,(laughing)
00:33:51,00:33:52,- How would the power left us?
00:33:52,00:33:53,No.
00:33:53,00:33:55,(laughing)
00:33:55,00:33:56,- It does obviously incredibly hard.
00:33:56,00:33:57,"And obviously, if you come out of the water,"
00:33:57,00:34:00,your natural instinct is to rub your face
00:34:00,00:34:01,and get the water out of your eyes.
00:34:01,00:34:02,And you're not allowed to do that
00:34:02,00:34:04,because you have to be looking at the judges.
00:34:04,00:34:07,And I think you meant to maintain eye contact
00:34:07,00:34:10,"with the judges, with water in your eyes,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,"'cause you're mostly blind,"
00:34:11,00:34:11,because you're not wearing your--
00:34:11,00:34:12,- It's crazy.
00:34:12,00:34:14,"- It's really, it is very hard."
00:34:14,00:34:15,I take back my comment.
00:34:15,00:34:16,Please don't email him.
00:34:16,00:34:17,(laughing)
00:34:17,00:34:20,"- And it, well, it is this very interesting thing,"
00:34:20,00:34:21,"which has a long history,"
00:34:21,00:34:25,sort of kicked off officially in the 1890s.
00:34:25,00:34:27,And was about looking good.
00:34:27,00:34:29,It was only men who were allowed to do it at first.
00:34:29,00:34:31,"And almost immediately,"
00:34:31,00:34:34,"people realized that women were much better candidates for it,"
00:34:34,00:34:37,"because A, we have much more fat on our body,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,so we're more buoyant.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"And B, people wanna look at women in swimsuits,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,doing really pretty things.
00:34:43,00:34:46,"And so, it's meant to be this display"
00:34:46,00:34:47,of aesthetic brilliance.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"But you do have these weird standards,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,"like the hair gel is amazing,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,that they have to wear on their hair
00:34:53,00:34:55,"to keep it looking completely,"
00:34:55,00:34:57,staying completely still in the water and looking great.
00:34:57,00:35:01,"So, the way they do their hair is called noxing,"
00:35:01,00:35:05,"with a K, K-N-O-X, and like, Fort Knox."
00:35:05,00:35:08,"And it's because it's using nox gelatin,"
00:35:08,00:35:12,which is a thing that's used to make jelly in cooking.
00:35:12,00:35:13,"- Especially in America, I think,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,it's like the main brand of gelatin.
00:35:16,00:35:16,- Is it?
00:35:16,00:35:19,"Okay, okay, so there you go."
00:35:19,00:35:20,"So it's like industrial strength,"
00:35:20,00:35:23,"and you spread this paste onto your head,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,"and it basically solidifies your hair,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,"so it can't move, and it's rock solid."
00:35:28,00:35:29,And then you go in.
00:35:29,00:35:33,"- Nox, by the way, was run by a woman called Rose Nox,"
00:35:33,00:35:34,who made this gelatin.
00:35:34,00:35:36,"She was married to another guy who died,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,and then she took over the business.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"The first day she took over,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,"she closed the back door of the factory,"
00:35:42,00:35:43,which previously all the women
00:35:43,00:35:45,"had to go into a different door than all the men,"
00:35:45,00:35:47,which was kind of a thing that did happen occasionally
00:35:47,00:35:49,in factories in America. - Really?
00:35:49,00:35:50,"- Yeah, 'cause they didn't want them mixing"
00:35:50,00:35:52,'cause they thought they wouldn't do any work
00:35:52,00:35:54,if they were flirting the whole time.
00:35:54,00:35:56,She made a five-day week for her workers
00:35:56,00:35:58,"and gave them two weeks of paid vacation,"
00:35:58,00:36:00,which really no one else was doing at the time.
00:36:00,00:36:02,And she wrote a book.
00:36:02,00:36:06,"Her book was called ""Seventy Easy Delicious Desserts"""
00:36:06,00:36:09,made from sparkling carb's foot gelatin.
00:36:09,00:36:10,- No way! - Really?
00:36:10,00:36:12,"- Sounds like a great book, though."
00:36:12,00:36:13,- So nice.
00:36:13,00:36:14,Did you guys hear of Esther Williams
00:36:14,00:36:15,in the course of the film?
00:36:15,00:36:17,- The movie star? - She was very cool.
00:36:17,00:36:20,She was a movie star who swam at the very elaborate routines.
00:36:20,00:36:21,"In the sort of '40s and '50s,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,there was a huge trend of aqua ballets
00:36:23,00:36:25,and the time it must be Barclay
00:36:25,00:36:28,and all of these amazing ballatic dance scenes.
00:36:28,00:36:29,She was great.
00:36:29,00:36:30,"Her films included Neptune's Daughter,"
00:36:30,00:36:34,"Million Dollar Mermaid, Dangerous When Wet."
00:36:34,00:36:36,"Just cool, cool films."
00:36:36,00:36:39,And she then had an unsuccessful move
00:36:39,00:36:41,into land-based acting.
00:36:41,00:36:44,And she was just flopping around.
00:36:46,00:36:47,"- Well, there's a comedian called Fanny Bryce"
00:36:47,00:36:49,"who said of her, ""Wet, she's a star."
00:36:49,00:36:50,"""Dry, she ain't."""
00:36:50,00:36:53,"And she was very self-deprecating, though."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"She said, ""If they ever teach a duck to act,"
00:36:55,00:36:56,"""I'm in big trouble."""
00:36:56,00:37:01,She's great.
00:37:01,00:37:02,She's so cool.
00:37:02,00:37:04,She once did a 35-metre dive in a film
00:37:04,00:37:05,playing another swimmer.
00:37:05,00:37:06,That was Million Dollar Mermaid.
00:37:06,00:37:07,She broke her neck.
00:37:07,00:37:09,She spent seven months in a body cast.
00:37:09,00:37:12,"- Was that one of the land-based ones, actually?"
00:37:12,00:37:15,(upbeat music)
00:37:15,00:37:21,"- It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,and that is Andy.
00:37:23,00:37:25,- My fact is that early phone boxes
00:37:25,00:37:26,came with a little man inside
00:37:26,00:37:28,"who would arrange the call for you,"
00:37:28,00:37:30,then wait outside until it was over.
00:37:30,00:37:32,- Aww.
00:37:32,00:37:33,- Very nice.
00:37:33,00:37:33,- That's lovely.
00:37:33,00:37:34,- Why did we get rid of it?
00:37:34,00:37:37,We could have had a really civilised time.
00:37:37,00:37:38,"- Well, I guess it was because"
00:37:38,00:37:39,everyone learned how to use phones.
00:37:39,00:37:40,- Yeah.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"That's true, and they didn't in the first place."
00:37:42,00:37:43,So this is really interesting.
00:37:43,00:37:44,This is from a book called--
00:37:44,00:37:46,"- Before you explain it,"
00:37:46,00:37:48,"when you say ""little man"" inside--"
00:37:48,00:37:49,"- Oh, yeah."
00:37:49,00:37:51,"- Like a borrower, right?"
00:37:51,00:37:52,"- Yeah, like a borrower."
00:37:52,00:37:53,- A little abution?
00:37:53,00:37:54,- No.
00:37:54,00:37:56,- He has to be small enough to fit in the phone box.
00:37:56,00:37:57,- Yeah.
00:37:57,00:37:59,"I mean, phone boxes, they're quite big."
00:37:59,00:38:02,- How little was the man?
00:38:02,00:38:04,- It's just a figure of speed.
00:38:04,00:38:05,Some of the men were probably normal
00:38:05,00:38:07,"or even above average size, all right?"
00:38:07,00:38:12,"- I also, for the show we're doing in Ireland,"
00:38:12,00:38:14,we have chosen the most quintessentially
00:38:14,00:38:16,English thing to talk about.
00:38:16,00:38:19,This will be 25 minutes on red phone boxes.
00:38:19,00:38:22,- I don't think it's any more English than Stonehenge.
00:38:22,00:38:29,- Very good.
00:38:29,00:38:31,"- Stonehenge, built by a giant."
00:38:31,00:38:33,These phone boxes contained a little man.
00:38:33,00:38:36,- This is from a book
00:38:36,00:38:39,"which, admittedly, is called Enigmatic England."
00:38:42,00:38:43,- And it's about...
00:38:43,00:38:46,"- No, your audience!"
00:38:46,00:38:50,- It's about these very early phone boxes.
00:38:50,00:38:52,So before you have the one person
00:38:52,00:38:54,"sort of booth, you know, TARDIS style phone boxes,"
00:38:54,00:38:58,"you had call stations, which are more like a garden shed."
00:38:58,00:39:00,And they first appeared in 1886.
00:39:00,00:39:01,They're incredibly old.
00:39:01,00:39:04,And there would be an attendant inside
00:39:04,00:39:07,"who would take your money, place the call,"
00:39:07,00:39:10,wait outside in whatever the weather until you've finished.
00:39:10,00:39:13,I read some reports as well that they would also lock you in
00:39:13,00:39:15,so that you couldn't escape without paying.
00:39:15,00:39:17,"- Oh, right, yeah."
00:39:17,00:39:18,"- I think that was the thing, wasn't it?"
00:39:18,00:39:20,"'Cause you had to pay for it,"
00:39:20,00:39:23,and they had no system of you just putting coins in
00:39:23,00:39:25,and it knowing that you put the right amount in
00:39:25,00:39:26,and then connecting you.
00:39:26,00:39:28,"So you had to give them the money,"
00:39:28,00:39:30,and then they would sort out all the connection part.
00:39:30,00:39:31,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:39:31,00:39:33,So they had to go to a phone exchange to an operator.
00:39:33,00:39:34,It was really complicated.
00:39:34,00:39:37,"And they would, I think, maybe time the call as well."
00:39:37,00:39:38,I don't know.
00:39:38,00:39:40,"- Well, the first ones, actually."
00:39:40,00:39:42,"So a lot of them were in post offices and shops,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,the ones that didn't have little men.
00:39:44,00:39:47,So you might have it in a place
00:39:47,00:39:48,where there was already someone there.
00:39:48,00:39:52,But the first ones were in Manchester and Liverpool in 1885.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"And in this one, you would give them the money,"
00:39:54,00:39:55,"they would set it off,"
00:39:55,00:39:58,"and then it said, this was from a newspaper article,"
00:39:58,00:40:02,"""A clockwork arrangement slowly moves an index finger"
00:40:02,00:40:06,"""visible to the user over a graduated arc."""
00:40:06,00:40:08,"So there's like a picture of someone's finger going,"
00:40:08,00:40:11,"""Like the countdown clock going do-do-do-do-do-do-do."""
00:40:11,00:40:13,(laughter)
00:40:13,00:40:14,- Really?
00:40:14,00:40:15,"- It's creepy, that, isn't it?"
00:40:15,00:40:16,- That's amazing.
00:40:16,00:40:17,"- Well, I noticed with your finger there is,"
00:40:17,00:40:18,"you did it anticlockwise to us,"
00:40:18,00:40:20,so it was clockwise for the audience.
00:40:20,00:40:21,Was that deliberate?
00:40:21,00:40:23,"- Oh, I've been working in Fierce for many years."
00:40:23,00:40:25,(laughter)
00:40:25,00:40:28,"- Oh, God, you've just reminded me of a toothache cure."
00:40:28,00:40:29,Sorry.
00:40:29,00:40:30,(laughter)
00:40:30,00:40:33,It was to put a dead person's finger in your mouth.
00:40:33,00:40:34,- Wow!
00:40:34,00:40:36,- And rub it on the tooth.
00:40:36,00:40:37,"Sorry, that's just..."
00:40:37,00:40:37,"- You reminded me, yeah."
00:40:37,00:40:39,- Was the finger connected to the dead person?
00:40:39,00:40:40,- I don't think it mattered.
00:40:40,00:40:41,- Or was it just--
00:40:41,00:40:42,(laughter)
00:40:42,00:40:44,"- But I think, for ease of use,"
00:40:44,00:40:45,you would probably disconnect it.
00:40:45,00:40:46,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:40:46,00:40:47,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:47,00:40:48,- When was this?
00:40:48,00:40:50,- This was the 1880s.
00:40:50,00:40:51,"- It was such an exciting time,"
00:40:51,00:40:53,"the 1880s, in phone land, wasn't it?"
00:40:53,00:40:54,Because it was--
00:40:54,00:40:55,- Show us.
00:40:55,00:40:56,- What was happening?
00:40:56,00:40:57,"- Well, so--"
00:40:57,00:40:58,"- The invention of the phone, pretty much."
00:40:58,00:40:59,(laughter)
00:40:59,00:41:01,"- That's a fairly seminal moment, yeah?"
00:41:01,00:41:02,- It was mostly that.
00:41:02,00:41:06,I like the fact that phone operators
00:41:06,00:41:08,"had to sort of know everyone in their area,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,because there were so few people
00:41:10,00:41:14,who were subscribed to the telephone exchange.
00:41:14,00:41:15,"As a phone operator, you'd call the operator,"
00:41:15,00:41:17,"and you'd say something like,"
00:41:17,00:41:20,"""Could you put me through to the doctor"
00:41:20,00:41:21,"""who specifically does knee stuff?"
00:41:21,00:41:22,"""I've got really sore knee."""
00:41:22,00:41:25,"And as an operator, you'd need to know that doctor"
00:41:25,00:41:27,"and which exchange point they were,"
00:41:27,00:41:29,and plug them into the right thing.
00:41:29,00:41:31,- Have you tried attaching a frog to the knee?
00:41:31,00:41:33,(laughter)
00:41:33,00:41:34,- Do you have a dead man with you?
00:41:34,00:41:36,(laughter)
00:41:36,00:41:38,"- Yeah, the first Irish telephone exchange"
00:41:38,00:41:39,"was set up in 1880,"
00:41:39,00:41:42,but it had just five customers at the time.
00:41:42,00:41:42,- Right.
00:41:42,00:41:44,- But you think there would be an even number
00:41:44,00:41:45,"so they could ring each other,"
00:41:45,00:41:48,but I guess that's not how it worked.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"- Do you know, I did check the phone book in Ireland"
00:41:50,00:41:52,"from that year, which is very short."
00:41:52,00:41:55,"As you say, it got to about 19 or 20 customers"
00:41:55,00:41:56,by the end of the year.
00:41:56,00:41:59,One of the customers was Messier's Guinness and Sons.
00:41:59,00:42:00,"- Oh, wow!"
00:42:00,00:42:01,"- Yeah, they got in there,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,"'cause if you need your Guinness, you need it now."
00:42:03,00:42:04,- Right.
00:42:04,00:42:05,- That's so funny.
00:42:05,00:42:08,"They had in 1885 an invention which was,"
00:42:08,00:42:12,it was like an out of office email for phones.
00:42:12,00:42:12,- Okay.
00:42:12,00:42:13,"- So if someone phoned you,"
00:42:13,00:42:15,you could let them know that you were out
00:42:15,00:42:16,and you'd be back later.
00:42:16,00:42:18,Can you guess how that would work?
00:42:18,00:42:19,"- Sorry, so you phoned them and--"
00:42:19,00:42:22,"- So you phoned me, I'm not in,"
00:42:22,00:42:24,but I know that I'm gonna be back at four p.m.
00:42:24,00:42:26,So I'm gonna let you know.
00:42:26,00:42:27,- So I'm in the booth.
00:42:27,00:42:29,The finger beckons.
00:42:29,00:42:30,(laughter)
00:42:30,00:42:31,Is that it?
00:42:32,00:42:33,- No fingers involved.
00:42:33,00:42:34,- Okay.
00:42:34,00:42:35,"- Oh, I know, I know,"
00:42:35,00:42:37,"'cause there weren't that many phones back then,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,we're saying.
00:42:38,00:42:40,So what you would do is you would call up the operator
00:42:40,00:42:42,"and say, ""Anyone who tries to call my phone,"
00:42:42,00:42:44,"""can you let them know I'm out till 4.30?"""
00:42:44,00:42:44,- Very good.
00:42:44,00:42:45,This is an invention.
00:42:45,00:42:47,It's a finger--
00:42:47,00:42:49,- So your phone is ringing on the desk
00:42:49,00:42:51,and I'm away from my desk.
00:42:51,00:42:54,So I need a mechanical claw to lift the phone
00:42:54,00:42:56,to a mechanical mouth.
00:42:56,00:42:58,"- No fingers, no claws."
00:42:58,00:43:01,"Employee boy, employee boy or girl?"
00:43:01,00:43:03,"- I don't think that's an invention, the boy."
00:43:03,00:43:04,- The boy.
00:43:04,00:43:06,This is when the boy was invented.
00:43:06,00:43:09,"- Wow, the 1880s really were amazing."
00:43:09,00:43:10,- Basically what you would do
00:43:10,00:43:11,"is if you're gonna be back at 4.00 p.m.,"
00:43:11,00:43:14,"as someone called, no one would answer it."
00:43:14,00:43:17,"It would just go click, click, click, click,"
00:43:17,00:43:18,and then would hang up.
00:43:18,00:43:21,And then they knew that you had to phone back at 4.00 p.m.
00:43:21,00:43:22,- Clever.
00:43:22,00:43:23,- Isn't that clever?
00:43:23,00:43:24,- That is.
00:43:24,00:43:24,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:43:24,00:43:25,- That's very cool.
00:43:25,00:43:26,"- The Bristol Mercury, I read about this invention,"
00:43:26,00:43:29,they said this will be the most useful invention
00:43:29,00:43:30,of the time.
00:43:30,00:43:31,- Right.
00:43:31,00:43:32,- They were sure.
00:43:32,00:43:33,"- This was a useful invention,"
00:43:33,00:43:36,"jumping a bit forward to 1905,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"and there was a guy who was called Almond Stroger,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,"and he ran a funeral home in Kansas City,"
00:43:40,00:43:43,"and he invented the Stroger Pop Belly candlestick phone,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,and he invented it.
00:43:45,00:43:47,- It's still a catchy name.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"- 'Cause the candlestick is where you have that bit,"
00:43:49,00:43:50,"you pull by your ear, and then you hang it up,"
00:43:50,00:43:52,and it sticks up by like a candlestick.
00:43:52,00:43:53,"- Yeah, if you look at it, it does look like a candlestick,"
00:43:53,00:43:56,"yeah, or a candlestick holder rather."
00:43:56,00:43:57,But the reason he invented it
00:43:57,00:43:59,"is because he worked in the funeral business,"
00:43:59,00:44:01,"and any time someone was calling up,"
00:44:01,00:44:03,there was an operator whose husband
00:44:03,00:44:06,"ran a rival funeral home,"
00:44:06,00:44:09,and she kept putting it through to their home.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"Yeah, and he was like, I'm losing all my business,"
00:44:11,00:44:12,"'cause she works on the inside,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,"she's feeding it to the wrong place,"
00:44:14,00:44:16,"so he's like, I'm gonna innovate the telephone,"
00:44:16,00:44:18,and he did with numbers.
00:44:18,00:44:22,"- Someone's stolen the finger from my husband, wasn't he?"
00:44:22,00:44:24,"- Hang on, 'cause I was about to say,"
00:44:24,00:44:26,"that's the best fact you've ever told me,"
00:44:26,00:44:28,"and were you about to say, so the story goes?"
00:44:28,00:44:29,- Yes.
00:44:29,00:44:32,(audience laughing)
00:44:32,00:44:34,- Why do you do this to us?
00:44:34,00:44:36,"- Well, no, because it's just covering my tracks, you know?"
00:44:36,00:44:40,"It's a, that is the story that that was the--"
00:44:40,00:44:41,- It's a fantastic story.
00:44:41,00:44:43,"- It's a great story. - Oh, dear."
00:44:43,00:44:45,"In 1915, a three-minute call"
00:44:45,00:44:47,between New York and San Francisco
00:44:47,00:44:51,cost the equivalent today of $500.
00:44:51,00:44:52,"- Wow. - Three, wow."
00:44:52,00:44:54,- Yeah.
00:44:54,00:44:56,"- These first ones, the ones that you were talking about"
00:44:56,00:44:58,were three pence for three minutes.
00:44:58,00:44:59,"- That's very good. - Yeah, yeah."
00:44:59,00:45:01,"- Well, a lot of, it was for business only,"
00:45:01,00:45:03,"that was the thing, phones were for business,"
00:45:03,00:45:05,they were for Guinness and Sons to place orders
00:45:05,00:45:07,"or talk to their merchants or whatever,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,and there were warnings in the early phone
00:45:09,00:45:11,"that I'm quoting now, a document that said,"
00:45:11,00:45:14,"""It should not be used for the exchange of twaddle"
00:45:14,00:45:15,"""between foolish women."""
00:45:15,00:45:16,(audience laughing)
00:45:16,00:45:18,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:45:18,00:45:21,"No, and again, in 1909, one phone company manager"
00:45:21,00:45:23,"found that 30% of all calls were idle gossip,"
00:45:23,00:45:26,"and this was very frowned on because phones were,"
00:45:26,00:45:27,"you know, rare and precious,"
00:45:27,00:45:29,"and so they should only be for business and all that,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,"and then gradually phone company bosses started realizing,"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"oh, well, probably quite useful if people are speaking"
00:45:34,00:45:35,on their phone for a long time.
00:45:35,00:45:37,"- I think also, 'cause it clogged up the lines, didn't it?"
00:45:37,00:45:40,"Basically, if you were talking your twaddle to someone,"
00:45:40,00:45:41,it meant that other people might not be able
00:45:41,00:45:43,to use the lines 'cause there weren't that many of them.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"Eventually, we got the automatic payphone"
00:45:45,00:45:47,where people could put coins in.
00:45:47,00:45:48,"- Oh, yeah."
00:45:48,00:45:50,- So we had bad news for the little men.
00:45:50,00:45:51,(audience laughing)
00:45:51,00:45:53,- A lot of little guys.
00:45:53,00:45:54,- Unimplied all around the country.
00:45:54,00:45:56,- Putting out little signs.
00:45:56,00:45:58,(audience laughing)
00:45:58,00:46:00,"- But this was invented by William Gray,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,and his original invention is very clever.
00:46:02,00:46:05,"So you have the thing that you talk into,"
00:46:05,00:46:08,"and there was a little bit of metal near the microphone,"
00:46:08,00:46:11,"and whenever you put the money in,"
00:46:11,00:46:12,the little bit of metal slid out of the way
00:46:12,00:46:14,"so you'd be able to talk,"
00:46:14,00:46:15,"and then as soon as your money ran out,"
00:46:15,00:46:17,"it would slide back into place,"
00:46:17,00:46:18,so you wouldn't be able to hear the many of them.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"- Ooh, nice little chat guillotine."
00:46:20,00:46:21,- Isn't that cool?
00:46:21,00:46:21,- That is cool.
00:46:21,00:46:23,- It's really cool.
00:46:23,00:46:25,- He also invented the chest protector
00:46:25,00:46:26,for baseball catchers.
00:46:26,00:46:29,"- Oh, that big, like, buff looking thing that they wear."
00:46:29,00:46:31,"- Yeah, the thing that protects the chest."
00:46:31,00:46:32,- Yeah.
00:46:32,00:46:33,(audience laughing)
00:46:33,00:46:35,"- It's just two weird things to invent, isn't it?"
00:46:35,00:46:36,- It is.
00:46:36,00:46:39,- Here's a little quiz from a California phone manual
00:46:39,00:46:40,in the early days.
00:46:40,00:46:42,I think this is the early 1900s.
00:46:42,00:46:45,Keep your what out of the opening of the phone?
00:46:45,00:46:47,(audience laughing)
00:46:47,00:46:48,- Keep your twaddle.
00:46:48,00:46:49,- Let's keep these.
00:46:49,00:46:51,- What's the opening of the phone?
00:46:51,00:46:52,- Whether your mouth is.
00:46:52,00:46:53,- Keep your tongue out?
00:46:53,00:46:54,- Oh.
00:46:54,00:46:55,- Keep your tongue out?
00:46:55,00:46:56,"Well, yes, but no."
00:46:56,00:46:58,"- I'm just thinking, like, what is close by."
00:46:58,00:46:59,- Who's using phones at this time?
00:46:59,00:47:00,"- Yeah, keep your nose out."
00:47:00,00:47:01,"- saliva, saliva."
00:47:01,00:47:04,(audience laughing)
00:47:04,00:47:06,"- Yeah, no, this is a manly thing."
00:47:06,00:47:07,"- Oh, it's a manly thing?"
00:47:07,00:47:08,- Yeah.
00:47:08,00:47:09,"- Okay, penis."
00:47:09,00:47:10,(audience laughing)
00:47:10,00:47:12,"- James, moustache."
00:47:12,00:47:16,(audience laughing)
00:47:16,00:47:17,Why on earth would you put your penis
00:47:17,00:47:19,into the mouthpiece?
00:47:19,00:47:21,(audience laughing)
00:47:21,00:47:22,- I can't help but think of a penis.
00:47:22,00:47:25,- I can't believe you would think of a penis.
00:47:25,00:47:26,That's disgraceful.
00:47:26,00:47:29,"Oh, James, I'm really disappointed."
00:47:29,00:47:32,(audience laughing)
00:47:32,00:47:33,- So that was a phone manual.
00:47:33,00:47:34,How to use a phone.
00:47:34,00:47:36,"I just had a thing on a phone book,"
00:47:36,00:47:38,"which is, you know, another phone-related book."
00:47:38,00:47:41,(audience laughing)
00:47:41,00:47:42,That's the link.
00:47:42,00:47:45,(audience laughing)
00:47:45,00:47:46,I just really like this.
00:47:46,00:47:49,This is someone found this randomly a few years ago.
00:47:49,00:47:51,"They lived in Idaho,"
00:47:51,00:47:53,and they wondered what would happen
00:47:53,00:47:55,if you looked up Adam West.
00:47:55,00:47:56,You remember Adam West?
00:47:56,00:47:57,- Batman.
00:47:57,00:47:57,- He died recently.
00:47:57,00:47:58,He was Batman.
00:47:58,00:47:59,- He died?
00:47:59,00:48:01,"- I'm just, God, this is a big moment."
00:48:01,00:48:01,- Did he?
00:48:01,00:48:03,(audience laughing)
00:48:03,00:48:04,"- Quite recently, the last couple of years, I think."
00:48:04,00:48:05,- Gosh.
00:48:05,00:48:07,- He was tied to a huge vat of acid.
00:48:07,00:48:10,(audience laughing)
00:48:10,00:48:14,"- Anyway, this random guy on the internet"
00:48:14,00:48:17,found out that he just idly looked up Adam West
00:48:17,00:48:18,in the phone book.
00:48:18,00:48:21,"And the message in the phone book read in Idaho,"
00:48:21,00:48:24,"'cause Adam West lived in Idaho when he died,"
00:48:24,00:48:29,"the message read, ""See Wayne, Bruce, Brackett's millionaire."""
00:48:29,00:48:30,"- No, literally."
00:48:30,00:48:33,"- And so, you went to that listing in the phone book,"
00:48:33,00:48:36,"and then it said, ""Please consult crime fighters"
00:48:36,00:48:38,"""in the yellow pages."""
00:48:38,00:48:39,"And then,"
00:48:39,00:48:40,(audience laughing)
00:48:40,00:48:42,"you went to that listing in the yellow pages,"
00:48:42,00:48:46,"and it said, ""See Batman, white pages."""
00:48:46,00:48:47,"And then you went to that listing,"
00:48:47,00:48:49,and it sent you back to Adam West in the phone book.
00:48:49,00:48:52,"- Oh, okay, I need to end us here."
00:48:52,00:48:55,And that is it for our show tonight.
00:48:55,00:48:58,"Thank you, Dublin, so much for being here."
00:48:58,00:48:59,(audience cheering)
00:48:59,00:49:00,That is all our facts.
00:49:00,00:49:03,We'll be back again next week with another episode.
00:49:03,00:49:05,We will see you then.
00:49:05,00:49:05,Good bye!
00:49:05,00:49:08,(audience cheering)
00:49:08,00:49:11,(upbeat music)
00:49:12,00:49:14,(upbeat music)
00:49:14,00:49:17,(upbeat music)
