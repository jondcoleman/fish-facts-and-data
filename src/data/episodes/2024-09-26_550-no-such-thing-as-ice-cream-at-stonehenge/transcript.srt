00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
 - Hi everyone, just before we start this show,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,680
 I wanted to perform a tiny, tiny interview

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,880
 about a very exciting new book that's been released.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,080
 It's a book called Impossible Things,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,320
 unbelievable answers to the world's weirdest questions.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,080
 And it's by renowned author and podcaster,

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,080
 Dan Treiber, here with me today.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,640
 - Hello, thank you for having me.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,760
 - It's a real pleasure.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,520
 How would you describe what this book is about?

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,640
 - This is a book where I look into all the mysteries

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,080
 that kids are fascinated by.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,000
 Are we being visited by aliens?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,480
 Are there ghosts out there in haunted houses?

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,760
 Are there monsters in the lock?

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,240
 Do time travelers visit us?

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 All that sort of stuff.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,960
 I've actually gone on 10 adventures

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,040
 to investigate it on behalf of kids.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,600
 Getting to the bottom of the history

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,160
 of why we believe in this stuff,

22
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,120
 how it's changed the course of the world.

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,880
 And it's also just a funny little adventure

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,760
 that kids will hopefully enjoy.

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,000
 - Yes, if you are fans of this podcast at all,

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,280
 this book is basically bang in line with that.

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,080
 And when Dan's personality, it's full of amazing facts.

28
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,280
 It doesn't say wrong stuff,

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,280
 even though it's about all these weird, mysterious phenomena.

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
 - Yeah, and it's as much written for adults as it is kids.

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,160
 Fish listeners, it would really be a huge, huge deal for me

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,600
 if you could go out and get a copy today.

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,960
 It's really, really incredibly hard to sell books,

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,920
 particularly kids' books.

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,960
 And I would love to turn this into a series.

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,080
 And I can only do that if it's a success.

37
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,400
 And you are my best chance at that.

38
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,280
 So please do pick up a copy online or in bookshots today.

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,760
 - Okay, on with the show.

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,600
 - On with the show.

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
 (alarm blaring)

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Dublin.

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,400
 (audience cheering)

46
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,160
 My name is Dan Shriver.

47
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,840
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,360
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,800
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,960
 And in no particular order, here we go.

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

53
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that mathematician Blaise Pascal

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,120
 once cured his toothache by thinking about maths.

55
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,880
 (audience laughing)

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,240
 - We went from like crazy rock and roll beginning to--

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,920
 - Excuse me, but there is nothing more rock and roll

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,760
 than maths.

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,600
 - That's true.

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,160
 - And especially 17th century French maths.

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 - And Blaise Pascal, what a hot name.

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,120
 That's a rock star, I've never heard one.

63
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,080
 - You don't get enough Blaise these days, do you?

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,920
 - No.

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
 - You need to come back.

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
 So was this like one of those cures where if you've got

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 a pain, subject yourself to something even worse?

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,640
 Like you've got a toothache, shoot yourself in the foot,

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,680
 and you'll forget about the toothache, apparently.

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,120
 - I see where you're going, but no, it's the exact opposite.

71
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,840
 - He was thinking about problems concerning the cycloid,

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,640
 which is a curve traced by a point on the edge of a circle.

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,680
 - Rock and roll, wow.

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,520
 - His toothache disappeared and he decided that it was

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,120
 God that did it, and God was saying to him,

76
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,400
 you need to carry on with the maths,

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,040
 and carry on with the maths he did.

78
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,800
 - Wow, that's good.

79
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,360
 So Pascal, the only thing I'd ever heard of Pascal

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,960
 before researching this fact is Pascal's wager,

81
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,680
 and the idea is that if you, what is the idea?

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,160
 Is that if you, even if you think it's unlikely

83
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,600
 that a vengeful God does exist,

84
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,480
 you may as well go through the motions

85
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,960
 as if a vengeful God does exist,

86
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,240
 because on the off chance that you're wrong

87
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,480
 and he does exist, it's much better to have.

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,600
 - You're absolutely fucked.

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,440
 - Yeah, exactly.

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,120
 But I think actually God is going to know

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,280
 that you're doing that, right?

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,160
 Because God knows everything.

93
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,280
 So as soon as you say, oh yeah, I really believed you

94
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,640
 all that time, he's going to go bullshit.

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,120
 - Imagine if God turned out to be such a chump

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,920
 that he didn't know when you truly believed in art.

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,400
 He said, yeah, you believed, I saw it at the end.

98
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,080
 You said, yes, come on in buddy, nice to see you.

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
 By the way, that's always presented

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080
 as if he was a non-believer,

101
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
 but he was very much into his religion.

102
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,440
 So the idea of the wager did involve

103
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,480
 you actually believing as well.

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,240
 It wasn't just like, oh yeah, on the side kind of thing.

105
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,800
 - Just quickly, in 2008, Paddy Power

106
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,440
 offered Odds of Four to One that God existed.

107
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
 - Hey.

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,280
 - That was a good bet you could have made at the time.

109
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,120
 - Yeah.

110
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
 - Have they had to pay out?

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
 - Not yet.

112
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,120
 - Not yet, okay.

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
 - They did say they would need

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
 an independent authority to verify it.

115
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,320
 I don't know who, I don't know who that is.

116
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,960
 - Who's going to be independent in that situation?

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,040
 Richard Dawkins, no he hasn't.

118
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,440
 - No, he's, yeah, yeah.

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,880
 - So this Blaise Pascal, he's such an interesting character.

120
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,200
 So he very sadly, he lost his mother

121
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,160
 when he was three years old.

122
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,480
 And his father, Etienne, basically decided

123
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,200
 that he was going to homeschool him.

124
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,600
 And Etienne was himself an amateur mathematician.

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,920
 However, he thought math isn't for the young,

126
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,880
 like your brains are not ready when you're young.

127
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
 You need to do this when you're like 14, 15.

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
 So he took all the math books in the house

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,040
 and he locked them up in a cupboard.

130
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
 And he said, don't let me catch you,

131
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,320
 read in any math around here.

132
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,800
 And so he became very curious about it

133
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,600
 because he'd seen his father talk about it

134
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,760
 with his friends and so on.

135
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,240
 So basically Pascal had to discover math

136
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,160
 by thinking about it and landed on all the actual equations,

137
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
 which is extraordinary.

138
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,360
 - According to actually Pascal's sister,

139
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,880
 the reason that his dad banned him from doing math,

140
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
 and he really did, and no one was allowed to mention math

141
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,520
 in front of Blaise, she said that he did it because he knew,

142
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,280
 Etienne knew that math fills and greatly satisfies the mind

143
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,280
 in such a huge way that he knew as soon as Blaise

144
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,760
 heard about math, he wouldn't be interested in classics

145
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,400
 or the humanities or anything like that.

146
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,280
 So he was like, I know you're going to get addicted

147
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,120
 as soon as you're exposed.

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
 So I'm going to keep you away from it.

149
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,080
 But of course it piqued his interest so much, Blaise's interest.

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,640
 He was like, what is this mysterious thing?

151
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
 I'm not allowed to access.

152
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,840
 And then it does sound like this incredible moment.

153
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,800
 A tear kind of came to my eye when I imagined Etienne,

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,920
 maths lover, as he was,

155
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,160
 going up to his 12-year-old son's bedroom, opening the door.

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
 - Don't come in.

157
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
 I'm doing some math.

158
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
 - I'm doing some math.

159
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,600
 - No, no, I'm masturbating, I'm masturbating.

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,120
 You're not masturbating, you're math debating.

161
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,000
 (audience laughing)

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
 But he was right, that's what he was doing.

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,640
 He was sitting there secretly drawing circles and triangles

164
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,640
 and thinking about the relationship between angles.

165
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,080
 - I mean, he discovered amazing stuff.

166
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,600
 Well, it doesn't sound amazing to us.

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,920
 He basically discovered that all the angles in a triangle

168
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,720
 add up to 180, duh.

169
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,800
 But we all studied maths, you see.

170
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
 That's the difference.

171
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,280
 Whereas this 12-year-old hadn't.

172
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,840
 - He invented a calculator.

173
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,560
 Again, mid 17th century, not a lot of calculators.

174
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,520
 And it was called the pascaline,

175
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,840
 named after him, obviously.

176
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,680
 And he dedicated it to the French Chancellor.

177
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
 And he got a patent of it.

178
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,240
 And then, most French move ever,

179
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,800
 he said, "No one else is allowed to make one,

180
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,280
 "but me, I have to have total control over it

181
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
 "so they didn't make any."

182
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,360
 (audience laughing)

183
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,680
 - It was for his dad, wasn't it?

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,320
 'Cause I think his dad worked in the sob

185
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,280
 and kind of accounting thing.

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,200
 And his dad was always tired and stuff.

187
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,760
 And he thought, "If I make this calculator,

188
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,880
 "it'll make his life easier."

189
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
 - He used an abacus, his dad.

190
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,520
 And he invented it to do away with the need.

191
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
 - So sweet.

192
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,040
 And yet sort of so worrying in your child as well,

193
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
 if they've done that.

194
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,400
 But mostly really sweet.

195
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
 - I know.

196
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,520
 - And it was essentially a calculator

197
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
 that allowed you to carry over,

198
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,040
 which we all remember fondly,

199
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,400
 which abacus didn't allow you to do.

200
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,640
 So his calculator automatically carried over.

201
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,480
 You know, carrying over.

202
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,760
 No one in the audience shouted, "No, what?"

204
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,800
 - What is that?

205
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,440
 - Is anyone here from the 1600s?

206
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,480
 (audience laughing)

207
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,200
 - So yeah, it was amazing.

208
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,880
 But he'd got this gig being an accountant.

209
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,120
 It was a really good gig.

210
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
 And it was in Normandy.

211
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,120
 And he was actually managing the taxes of the whole area.

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,360
 But he had fallen from grace massively

213
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,720
 and come back into the grace of the French authorities.

214
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
 Not because of Blaise Pascal,

215
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,240
 but because of Blaise's sister.

216
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,600
 So basically Etienne's there.

217
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,160
 He's pissed off Richelieu,

218
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,920
 who's the French prime minister.

219
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,200
 And he's basically been exiled.

220
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,640
 So he's had to leave his three kids in Paris, Blaise,

221
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,000
 and then Jacqueline and Gilbert.

222
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,440
 And Jacqueline turns out to be such a talented playwright

223
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,280
 and actress at the age of 10 or something

224
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,600
 that she performs for Cardinal Richelieu.

225
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
 And he's so charmed by her

226
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
 that she goes up to him afterwards and says,

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 "Oh, I hope you like that.

228
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,680
 "By the way, would you mind forgiving my dad,

229
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,480
 "not putting him in prison in the Bastille,

230
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,640
 "not cutting his head off

231
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
 "and giving him a good position instead?"

232
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,800
 And Richelieu said, "Yeah, right, you're cute.

233
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,640
 "I'll do that."

234
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,480
 (audience laughing)

235
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
 - Precretious.

236
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,960
 - So then a bit later, Blaise Pascal,

237
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
 he was in a carriage and the horse is bolted

238
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
 and they threw him into the Seine and he nearly died.

239
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,800
 - 'Cause it's very polluted, isn't it?

240
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,600
 As we know from the Olympics, so was it?

241
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,640
 - But then he wrote an account of that accident

242
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,840
 and he had sort of like, God came to him

243
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,280
 while he was in the water

244
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,120
 and that made him even more religious.

245
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,800
 - It was called his Night of Fire

246
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,120
 and he had a mystical moment and a realization

247
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
 and he wrote this kind of poem

248
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,800
 which apparently reads like a journal entry

249
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
 and they only found it after he died.

250
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,720
 - And the religion was Janssenism, wasn't it?

251
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,800
 It was both him and his sister were Janssenists.

252
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,480
 And the idea of Janssenism is we're all evil

253
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
 and there's nothing you can do about it

254
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
 and it's decided at the start

255
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,560
 who's going to be saved by God

256
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,200
 and who isn't going to be saved by God

257
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,640
 and it really doesn't matter what you do while you're alive.

258
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,880
 You're either fucked or not fucked.

259
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,680
 - Right, what's in it for me?

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,520
 Sorry.

261
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,840
 (audience laughing)

262
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,200
 - I've got some bad news for you, Andy.

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,540
 - Oh no.

264
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,480
 - Which didn't make any sense and I'm sure it would

265
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,800
 if we spent longer than a day reading up on this

266
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,520
 but to me, as James says, predestination,

267
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,040
 nothing you can do.

268
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,760
 But also, it's not like he went out

269
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,080
 and had a great time because of it.

270
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,360
 He had a shit time.

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,320
 To be honest, I think he was a bore, Blaise Pascal.

272
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,360
 He did the old classic mortifying himself.

273
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,480
 It's called mortifying where he wore metal clothes

274
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,440
 with spikes on the inside to hurt himself at all times.

275
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,960
 So he could constantly be punished

276
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,200
 and constantly banish vain and profane thoughts.

277
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
 You know, he was so devout.

278
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,360
 He completely abandoned maths really

279
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,100
 for the last 10 years of his life.

280
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,940
 The fun thing.

281
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,080
 - Is that your definition of boring?

282
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
 - Someone who wears metal spikes.

283
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,800
 (laughing)

284
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
 - If you have metal spikes facing outwards,

285
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,920
 that's cool, that's SNN.

286
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,620
 If the metal spikes are facing inwards.

287
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,200
 (laughing)

288
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,160
 - He always wore stockings soaked in brandy.

289
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,000
 - Really?

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
 - Yeah, I heard that.

291
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
 - What's that for?

292
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,520
 - I heard it.

293
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
 I heard it.

294
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,740
 Got some hot gauze, like I've read it in a document.

295
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,720
 - Yeah, he thought, well, he did have very bad circulation.

296
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,880
 He was very sickly in his 30s

297
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,840
 and he thought that his circulation would improve

298
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,960
 if he wore.

299
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,360
 'Cause in those days, it was like, this is a hot thing.

300
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,760
 Brandy is a hot thing.

301
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,440
 It will improve the heat in your body.

302
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
 It will help the circulation.

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
 - It feels like it would do it.

304
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,760
 - I mean, and then...

305
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,740
 (laughing)

306
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,580
 - Yeah.

307
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,080
 - It might do it if it attracted people

308
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
 to suckle at your tights.

309
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
 (laughing)

310
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,840
 As you well might.

311
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,680
 (laughing)

312
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
 - So he met Descartes.

313
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
 This is hugely exciting in Paris in 1647.

314
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
 He'd been away, he'd been really ill.

315
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,120
 He'd just got back.

316
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,800
 And then he and Descartes were in the same room.

317
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,640
 I think it's the only time--

318
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,280
 - Are they both famous at this point?

319
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,480
 - I think they're both pretty famous.

320
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,320
 - Wow.

321
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,840
 - It's a huge, huge meeting of mind.

322
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,680
 It's like--

323
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
 - It's like Comic-Con, but for the--

324
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
 - Oh my God, yeah.

325
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,960
 It's like Comic-Con, but for the greatest thinkers

326
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
 of all time.

327
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,280
 And all the doctors have been suggesting to Pascal,

328
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,680
 oh, you need to have more enemas and bloodlettings

329
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
 and purging.

330
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
 And Descartes said, have you just considered resting

331
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,200
 and having some soup?

332
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,240
 And it was a very, it went really badly.

333
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,280
 - Right.

334
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,920
 - So he didn't want the resting in the soup.

335
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
 He wanted the enemas and purging.

336
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
 - He wanted those.

337
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,440
 - Yeah, absolutely.

338
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
 - Right.

339
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,120
 - Right.

340
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,940
 - Weird guy.

341
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,600
 - You know, James, the headline fact.

342
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,920
 So he thought about mathematics in order

343
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,760
 to cure his toothache.

344
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,200
 Did the toothache, was it psychosomatic?

345
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
 Did it actually--

346
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,160
 - Yeah.

347
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,000
 - Did he then have a cure?

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,840
 - I think what happened was it just went away.

349
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
 (audience laughs)

350
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,520
 - Yeah.

351
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
 - Right.

352
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,180
 - And perhaps the maths might not have had everything

353
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,020
 to do with it.

354
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,860
 Call me a skeptic.

355
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,280
 (audience laughs)

356
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,120
 - But if you, you can take your mind off pain

357
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,080
 if you fill your mouth with saliva.

358
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,120
 Does anyone else do that?

359
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,200
 - Really?

360
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,300
 - Yeah, a few yeses and a few, more than a few.

361
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,120
 - What?

362
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,680
 - Okay, but if you, it's just something else

363
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
 to focus on.

364
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,500
 You just focus on filling your mouth with saliva.

365
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,060
 Right, I've got to get these saliva ducks flowing.

366
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,900
 - What's hurting on you?

367
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,240
 Is it your teeth or anything on your teeth?

368
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,820
 - Yeah, but not, I don't think this works

369
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,980
 if you've broken your leg, for instance.

370
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,500
 It only works in like a headache or something like that.

371
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,340
 - It works for a limited amount of time on minor pains.

372
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,620
 - But on all pain, that's really interesting.

373
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
 - I would say all pain.

374
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,660
 - So you've done it to yourself.

375
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,500
 - I'm constantly doing it.

376
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,900
 - So when's the last time you did it?

377
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,740
 (audience laughs)

378
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,580
 - I don't know.

379
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,060
 (audience laughs)

380
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,380
 - Do you think this could be used

381
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,220
 in childbirth, for instance, Sandy?

382
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,580
 (audience laughs)

383
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,420
 - I don't see why not.

384
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,320
 - I've tried a lot of other stuff

385
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,100
 and it doesn't seem to have worked, so.

386
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
 (audience laughs)

387
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,940
 - Some of it does work.

388
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,700
 - It's just leading over to your wife, okay.

389
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,040
 - Have you thought about thinking of math equations?

390
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,020
 (audience laughs)

391
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,340
 - Look, just in your own time, what's six times 17?

392
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,700
 (audience laughs)

393
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,580
 - Hey, so do you know, toothache,

394
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,660
 one of the earliest ideas of what it might be

395
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,700
 is that you were infected with a tooth worm.

396
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
 - Oh yeah.

397
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,380
 - Amazing idea.

398
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,500
 They thought there was a living creature inside there

399
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 that was wiggling around, trying to get out,

400
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,740
 and that's what was causing all the pain inside,

401
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,340
 and so this is ancient.

402
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,820
 - I think it might be the oldest misconception

403
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,020
 in humankind, the oldest that I've ever found anyway,

404
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,500
 'cause the Babylonians believed it.

405
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,100
 - And it lasted forever, I mean,

406
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,820
 it lasted until the 18th century, basically,

407
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,500
 when it was roundly debunked by Pierre Fochard, a dentist,

408
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,340
 but it was believed everywhere, wasn't it?

409
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,620
 Like, from ancient Egypt to Mesoamerica,

410
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,020
 how are they getting hold of this idea?

411
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,260
 - I briefly believed it while I was researching this,

412
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,700
 'cause I was in the 17th century,

413
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,180
 and I just didn't do the researching

414
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,060
 of what a toothache is until later on,

415
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,460
 so for a few hours in 2024, someone believed in tooth worms.

416
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,700
 - That tooth worms existed.

417
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,140
 - Irish remedies for toothache.

418
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,820
 So is the National Folklore Collection much discussed still?

419
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,180
 A little bit, okay, so it was school children,

420
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,380
 they were sent out, sort of 10 to 14 year olds

421
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,620
 were sent in their local area,

422
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,860
 they wrote up all the folklore they could gather

423
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,540
 from people who'd been alive,

424
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,060
 so this was done, yeah, 1937, '38,

425
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,500
 so the years it covered,

426
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,980
 because of the age of the people they were talking to,

427
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,900
 went back to the 1860s,

428
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,100
 and a lot of the folklore was to do with how to cure,

429
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,460
 it was warts, whooping cough, and toothache,

430
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,620
 and the cures, I have to say, largely potato-based,

431
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,380
 they were, I'm afraid.

432
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,860
 - What do you do with said potato?

433
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,180
 - You go into the garden, get a potato pecked by a crow,

434
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,460
 put it in your pocket, and never let it fall out.

435
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,500
 (laughing)

436
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,340
 - Okay.

437
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,180
 - That'll do it.

438
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,020
 - That's it.

439
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,900
 - And get a slice of raw potato, put it in your cheek,

440
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,740
 it sounds fractionally more believable, you know?

441
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,580
 - Yeah, that could work.

442
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,660
 - Yeah, but by far the most common,

443
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,580
 actually it was not potato, but it was frog-based,

444
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,940
 was to keep a live frog in your mouth for a few minutes,

445
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,220
 the frog gets the, oh, come on, it's all right.

446
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,140
 (laughing)

447
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,180
 Keep it in your mouth for a few minutes,

448
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,900
 and then let it out, and it gets the toothache,

449
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,540
 very sad for it, but it takes yours away.

450
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,380
 And do you know this sign?

451
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,060
 It's like you put an L on your forehead.

452
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,580
 - James is calling me a loser, yeah.

453
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,620
 - No, I'm not calling you a loser, so this sign,

454
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,820
 this according to Canadian Medical Hall of Fame member

455
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,940
 Ronald Meltzak, if you take the L sign

456
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,540
 for calling someone a loser,

457
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,100
 and then you rub an ice cube up and down the L,

458
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,460
 then that will get rid of your toothache,

459
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,540
 and it works in more than 50% of patients.

460
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,380
 - Really?

461
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,260
 - Yeah, and his theory, and he's tried this,

462
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,380
 and his theory is your body sort of feels the cold,

463
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,380
 and it blocks some pathways, some pain pathways

464
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,860
 to your brain, and so it stops the.

465
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,700
 - Wow.

466
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,540
 - Wow.

467
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,380
 - According to him.

468
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,220
 - Yeah.

469
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,060
 - Give it a go.

470
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,180
 - And he's in the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

471
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,020
 (laughing)

472
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,860
 - Okay.

473
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,700
 - That's pretty funny.

474
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,660
 - Not 17th Century Hall of Fame,

475
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,900
 the Modern Hall of Fame.

476
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,980
 - Modern Canada, but modern.

477
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,220
 (laughing)

478
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:47,620
 - It is time for fact number two,

479
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,060
 and that is my fact.

480
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,020
 My fact this week is that it turns out,

481
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,100
 Stonehenge isn't a henge.

482
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,180
 (laughing)

483
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,020
 - Wow.

484
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
 - Isn't that nuts?

485
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,940
 The only henge we know about isn't an actual henge.

486
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,020
 - So what's going on?

487
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,860
 What is it?

488
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,740
 - Okay, this is according to English Heritage.

489
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,700
 If you go on their site,

490
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,660
 they have a fantastic page all about henges,

491
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,020
 and obviously Stonehenge leads the category there,

492
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,700
 but then you get to a little bit where it says

493
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,220
 it isn't officially a proper henge,

494
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,140
 as the main ditch is external to the main bank.

495
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,660
 So what it is, in fact, is a protohenge.

496
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,540
 Now here's the weird thing,

497
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,060
 henges are only called henges

498
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,300
 because they're named after Stonehenge.

499
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,100
 (laughing)

500
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,940
 - Wow.

501
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,260
 - This cat has eaten its own tail.

502
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,100
 - Yeah.

503
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,940
 - It is amazing.

504
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,260
 - It's where the ditches and where the raised bank is.

505
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,020
 - But it's also the size as well.

506
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,780
 It has to be over 65 feet across

507
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,620
 when you would do the ditches.

508
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,460
 - Okay.

509
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,420
 - If they found loads of henges,

510
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,860
 and they're all the same, apart from Stonehenge,

511
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,940
 it feels like Stonehenge was assembled incorrectly,

512
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,900
 but basically the packet instructions

513
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,180
 clearly showed the ditch inside the bank or whatever,

514
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,660
 or else I don't care.

515
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,980
 But do you know what I mean?

516
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,900
 Like, they just did it wrong.

517
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,940
 'Cause I think there is a theory

518
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,180
 that it was basically a reassembly from another site.

519
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,140
 - Oh, it's a second-hand henge, basically.

520
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,980
 - Yeah.

521
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,820
 - Yeah.

522
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,660
 - It's basically--

523
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,500
 - It's a henge me down, basically.

524
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,740
 - Oh, lovely, lovely, very strong.

525
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,740
 - Don't boom it, that wasn't prepped, you know what I mean?

526
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,780
 - You've been sat all day writing that joke, haven't you done?

527
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,860
 Yeah, there's another site in Wales, isn't there,

528
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,460
 where they've looked at what's missing from there,

529
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,780
 and what's in Stonehenge.

530
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,460
 And it almost comes together as a whole thing, yeah.

531
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,780
 Because they also worked out

532
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
 that people were living there for ages,

533
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,500
 and then they stopped living there,

534
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,060
 and then they came back later,

535
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,940
 and they stopped living there

536
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,060
 about the same time as the stones left.

537
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,700
 So it could be that they just decided to move to Salisbury

538
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
 and took their big old stones with them.

539
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,460
 - The baggage allowance must have been massive

540
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,300
 in the olden days.

541
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,060
 - There's also another theory by Geoffrey of Monmouth,

542
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,460
 the 12th century author.

543
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,260
 He says that Stonehenge was originally built in Ireland

544
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,740
 by a group of giants from Africa.

545
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,180
 - By a group of who?

546
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,700
 - A group of giants from Africa.

547
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,020
 - Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,860
 - Classic.

549
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,780
 - And then Merlin took them over from Ireland to Britain.

550
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,620
 - We're booing Merlin.

551
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,740
 - We're booing Merlin.

552
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,060
 - Wow.

553
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,260
 - Don't you mention his name in this town.

554
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,540
 (audience laughing)

555
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,780
 He knows what he did.

556
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,340
 - That's actually just very good etymological knowledge

557
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,180
 from this audience.

558
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,540
 'Cause Merlin, of course, literally means shit,

559
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,380
 Merlin.

560
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,220
 It does, yeah.

561
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,780
 One of our earliest facts in Welsh, it meant shit.

562
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,140
 And that's why we changed it to Merlin

563
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
 'cause we thought the name shit was too embarrassing.

564
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,980
 - It was embarrassing.

565
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,500
 - But he did indeed.

566
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,980
 I think these giants brought it all the way to Ireland

567
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,100
 from Africa, and then back to England.

568
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,460
 And this was the prevailing theory,

569
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
 or the most common popular theory, wasn't it,

570
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,300
 until the 19th century.

571
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,700
 I don't think many people believed it.

572
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,180
 - It qualifies as a theory.

573
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,900
 I don't know, there were lots of theories,

574
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,300
 and they all sort of reflect the times

575
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,420
 in which they were espoused.

576
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,940
 So there's, you know, is it a calculator

577
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,140
 to work out the seasons?

578
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,660
 Is it a healing place?

579
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,260
 Is it a spacecraft landing pad?

580
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,260
 Is it a dating, literally a site for romance?

581
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,340
 - Oh, not dating as in the data.

582
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,380
 - No, sorry, not carbon dating, just dating.

583
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,220
 - Right.

584
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,260
 - How would the dating work?

585
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,740
 - It's just a symbolic, sort of, meat meeting.

586
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,580
 - But you would meet them, like,

587
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,340
 let's go to Stonehenge and catch a...

588
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,180
 - Catch something.

589
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,020
 - Catch something.

590
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,540
 Well, that was really nice,

591
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,220
 'cause it would be a dating site called Henge.

592
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,460
 That would be very pleasing.

593
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,300
 - Oh, yeah.

594
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,460
 - Dan and I sitting right in that chair.

595
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,380
 - Dan and I sitting next to each other on the plane.

596
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,220
 What are you doing?

597
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,060
 - Nothing.

598
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,140
 - But one of the latest theories

599
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,900
 is that it was basically a meeting place,

600
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,860
 and it was actually a sort of community centre, effectively.

601
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,340
 Like, it was an attempt to get people to come here,

602
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,020
 get involved in a big project, work together,

603
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,140
 'cause it was a time of big population decline and dispersal.

604
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,620
 So it was just an attempt to kind of get people together,

605
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,460
 you know?

606
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,340
 - There's a lot of shit, isn't there, about Stonehenge?

607
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,460
 But the nice thing is, there always has been.

608
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,340
 When you look back at early 1800s sources,

609
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,820
 people bitch about the fact that the number of theories

610
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,380
 about where Stonehenge comes from

611
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,220
 and why it's there are ridiculous.

612
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,620
 So there was a whole spate of research

613
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,820
 in the 1920s and 1930s.

614
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,700
 There was an extremely authoritative account written

615
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,740
 called The Stones of Stonehenge,

616
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,300
 and his name was Edward Herbert Stone, which is nice.

617
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,620
 - Very nice.

618
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,460
 - There's Henry Brown as well, 1823.

619
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,500
 He wrote what was officially the guidebook,

620
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,020
 that's the first guidebook to Stonehenge,

621
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,460
 and the theory that he puts in there,

622
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,100
 which he kind of presents as fact,

623
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,260
 is that it survived Noah's flood.

624
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,820
 - There was a very interesting debate between two excavators.

625
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,340
 Again, in the 20s and 30s,

626
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,220
 when people were starting to do serious archaeology

627
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,020
 about Stonehenge, rather than coming up with mad theories,

628
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,260
 the two main explorers of it, and excavators of it,

629
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,620
 were a woman called Maude Cunnington

630
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,820
 and a man called Alexander Kaler.

631
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,260
 And I got really obsessed with them

632
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,220
 because they sort of hated each other.

633
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,300
 Eventually, their rivalry came to center on this one stone,

634
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,820
 and it was a stone that Maude visited in 1911.

635
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,740
 So she'd gone to lift up another stone,

636
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,740
 which is called Adam.

637
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,820
 They give a couple of the stone's names, Adam and Eve, notably,

638
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,860
 and she'd lifted up this other stone, which had fallen over.

639
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,180
 - Was she a giant? Sorry.

640
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,580
 - Yeah, sorry. I should have made it clear

641
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,220
 that she brought quite a lot of heavy machinery with her.

642
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,980
 A large number of other people lifted up the hen stone.

643
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,860
 Cunnington came to the site in the 30s,

644
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,980
 when that idiot woman, she's put it the wrong way up,

645
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,140
 was determined she put it the wrong way up, flipped it over,

646
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,340
 put it on its head.

647
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,980
 Now, as they've looked at the stones

648
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,700
 and realized that he got it wrong,

649
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,540
 so there's this upside down stone there.

650
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,740
 - Brilliant. - That's messing it all up,

651
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,740
 solely the result of this rivalry between these two people.

652
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,100
 - Wow. - Did they fall in love?

653
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,460
 (audience laughing)

654
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,860
 'Cause it sounds like everything you're saying is a rom-com.

655
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,340
 - It does. I know.

656
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,500
 Yes, this is the beginning of "You've got mail."

657
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,340
 Yes, I didn't.

658
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,260
 - Other places that are modeled on Stonehenge,

659
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,940
 have you heard of a bonehenge?

660
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,340
 Bonehenge is a--

661
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,940
 - It's like an elephant graveyard kind of thing.

662
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,380
 - Yeah, it's a mammoth bone circle in Russia.

663
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,300
 - Oh, wow. - Made about 20,000 years ago.

664
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,340
 Very cool. - Wow.

665
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,660
 - Skonhenge.

666
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,460
 (audience laughing)

667
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,060
 - Is that as in scones?

668
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,660
 - It's pronounced Skonhenge, that's correct.

669
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,260
 That's a restaurant in California.

670
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,580
 (audience laughing)

671
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,100
 There was the time when Queen Elizabeth

672
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,340
 was beamed onto the stones for her jubilee.

673
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,340
 - What, is there a word for it?

674
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,180
 - Thronehenge.

675
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,500
 - Ah, damn it.

676
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,460
 - And Ireland is home to a historic site

677
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,380
 that was found by someone flying up an unmanned aerial vehicle.

678
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,220
 (audience laughing)

679
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,940
 - Would it by any chance be Dronehenge?

680
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,820
 - Dronehenge!

681
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,660
 - Amazing.

682
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,140
 - So it is, it's still a mystery, isn't it?

683
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,940
 Stonehenge, where the stones come from.

684
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
 There's always new reports.

685
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,380
 They suddenly think that some of the stones are from Wales.

686
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,740
 - I think they've always thought from Wales.

687
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,700
 - Sorry, from Scotland.

688
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,740
 - Yeah, that's the huge news, isn't it?

689
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,620
 - That's the big news, but recently they thought,

690
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,780
 why don't we try and see if the method

691
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,220
 of laying them down on sleds over logs

692
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,300
 is something that is achievable?

693
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,900
 And the result was they discovered

694
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,860
 it's just incredibly easy to do that.

695
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,180
 (audience laughing)

696
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,140
 10 people can pull the stones in a very,

697
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,980
 it's a slow manner,

698
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,180
 but it's not as taxing as we thought it was.

699
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,580
 - We've just given these guys so much credit

700
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,820
 for hundreds of years, it's piece of piss.

701
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,580
 - Do you know we found the original tape measures

702
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,260
 that were probably used for Stonehenge?

703
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,100
 - No, we don't.

704
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,540
 - We have, this is so cool, okay?

705
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,380
 - What?

706
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,460
 - They're called the Folkton Drums,

707
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,340
 and they're big stone cylinders carved from solid chalk,

708
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,420
 right, and they are massive.

709
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,060
 They're about 5,000 years old,

710
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,900
 and each of them is a particular size,

711
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,980
 so that if it goes around once, for example,

712
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,300
 it's a number of multiples of 3.2 meters,

713
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,860
 and that measurement crops up everywhere,

714
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,940
 so we think those are the sort of tape measures

715
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,700
 of the gods, and they could send off to Wales,

716
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,400
 saying, can you bring me a stone that's this big,

717
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,020
 according to the drums,

718
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,940
 and they'll send back something

719
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,220
 that's the right size for you.

720
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,060
 - How cool is that?

721
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,420
 - What if it was just like an earthquake,

722
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,500
 and they landed like that?

723
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,340
 - Yeah.

724
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
 (audience laughing)

725
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,940
 - Yeah, I mean, that's a good,

726
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,100
 in many ways, an easier theory for us all, isn't it?

727
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,260
 - Yeah, yeah.

728
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,620
 - Older than Stonehenge is New Grange.

729
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,340
 In fact, I feel like your fact could have been

730
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,460
 New Grange is not new, yeah.

731
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,580
 - Oh, right, yeah, it's very old.

732
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,260
 - But they've recently, yeah, very old,

733
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
 older than Stonehenge,

734
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,460
 they've recently done some DNA tests.

735
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,300
 - What is it for international?

736
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,460
 - Oh, sorry, for international listeners.

737
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,140
 - And for those who maybe didn't do that better than reading?

738
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,540
 (audience laughing)

739
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,380
 - It's a huge, like a huge barrow,

740
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,780
 it's a huge earth mat under the middle of Ireland,

741
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,580
 which was probably a burial site, we think,

742
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,100
 'cause they found some bodies in there,

743
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,940
 and they've done some DNA tests,

744
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,780
 and they found that there was a lot of incest going on.

745
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,980
 And what they reckon is,

746
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,580
 it was a bit like, you know, in ancient Egypt,

747
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,740
 how all the kings and queens married each other,

748
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,580
 and then, you know,

749
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,980
 their children married each other and stuff like that.

750
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,900
 They reckon there was a lot of that in Ireland at the time.

751
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,900
 (audience laughing)

752
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,860
 - Just one person cheering,

753
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,500
 and a very worried-looking sister next to him.

754
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 (audience laughing)

755
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,100
 - His mum and his sister and his cousin have all come along,

756
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,940
 but thankfully they're all in the same seat.

757
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,260
 (audience laughing)

758
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,580
 - Sorry.

759
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,540
 - Childish.

760
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,620
 - But yeah, it's really interesting now,

761
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,180
 because it implies a really elite system

762
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,220
 of almost like pharaohs in Ireland.

763
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,060
 - Wow, cool.

764
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,100
 - And that's also where they found Dronehenge, isn't it?

765
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,740
 - Yes, they found Dronehenge near thereabouts

766
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,220
 where that bloke found Dronehenge,

767
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,620
 and he's now published a book,

768
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,340
 The Story Behind the Remarkable Neolithic Discovery,

769
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,860
 about the events following the day he found it,

770
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,260
 and how the world's media descended on him.

771
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,020
 And I encourage you to look up the accounts,

772
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,060
 because I don't know how much it was

773
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,700
 headline news all around the world,

774
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,260
 (audience laughing)

775
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,820
 as is claimed in the book.

776
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,220
 - I got one last thing,

777
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,060
 which is that I've always wanted to go to Stonehenge.

778
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,260
 I've never been, and as part of this research,

779
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,340
 I thought, oh, I wonder if it's on TripAdvisor.

780
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,660
 And it turns out it is,

781
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,940
 and it has a lot of one-star reviews.

782
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,500
 - No. - Yeah.

783
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,820
 So this is one,

784
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,940
 this is one going as back as 2014.

785
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,460
 I was disgusted to find that this was just

786
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,140
 a few rocks to look at.

787
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,980
 (audience laughing)

788
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,060
 Nothing to do, they should knock it down

789
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,660
 and build an arcade or a fun fair.

790
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,380
 Don't waste your time, what a silly place.

791
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,060
 And then, August of 2023, someone wrote,

792
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,980
 "I expected so much more than just stones placed

793
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,180
 "in a circle.

794
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,740
 "As a World Heritage site, at the very least,

795
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,940
 "I would have expected an ice cream van."

796
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,820
 (audience laughing)

797
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,960
 I didn't fight the war for this.

798
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,140
 (audience laughing)

799
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,460
 - Next review. - Next review.

800
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,180
 - Not even a henge.

801
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,180
 (audience laughing)

802
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,760
 (upbeat music)

803
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,940
 - It is time for fact number three,

804
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,980
 and that is Anne.

805
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,700
 - My fact this week is that

806
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,820
 the sport with the highest rate of concussion

807
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,260
 is synchronized swimming.

808
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,180
 - Is that 'cause one of the swimmers bangs their head

809
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,460
 and everyone has to copy them?

810
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,460
 (audience laughing)

811
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,740
 - It's a funny line, James,

812
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,860
 but it's a fundamental misunderstanding

813
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,020
 of synchronized swimming.

814
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,380
 We'll come on to that.

815
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,740
 But I should caveat this by saying,

816
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,180
 this is based on my reading

817
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,740
 and not actual academic comparative studies.

818
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,420
 But I have surmised this

819
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,300
 from a lot that I've read about synchronized swimming.

820
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,060
 It's extremely dangerous.

821
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,620
 So I was reading an account of Bill Moreau,

822
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,500
 who was the Vice President of Sports Medicine

823
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,860
 for the US Olympic Committee between 2009 and 2019.

824
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,500
 And he supervised lots of sports

825
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,940
 for safety and health concerns.

826
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,700
 And he supervised synchronized swimming.

827
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,380
 And in a two week training camp,

828
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,780
 he said 50% of the team sustained a concussion.

829
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,500
 And that surpassed NFL and Aussie rules football.

830
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,920
 - Are they, is that team just really shit?

831
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,700
 (audience laughing)

832
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,220
 Like, what are they, they must be,

833
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,340
 'cause they can't be hitting the bottom of the pool.

834
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,180
 - Okay, it's not allowed.

835
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,660
 - You're not allowed, it's just knocking heads, isn't it?

836
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,500
 - Yeah.

837
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,320
 - It's crazy.

838
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,340
 Well, they keep on trying to make it better

839
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,700
 and better and better and better and better,

840
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,460
 which means getting in tighter and tighter

841
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,700
 and tighter to each other.

842
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,420
 And you're flailing around

843
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,460
 and you're upside down and you're kicking

844
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,180
 and you just bang heads or kick each other

845
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,540
 in the face all the time.

846
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,700
 - Absolutely, it's colliding with each other.

847
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,660
 - Sometimes I read an account from one of them

848
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,900
 who, I think one of them broke another's nose accidentally

849
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,260
 with a stray, you know, hand or foot or whatever

850
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,020
 and they didn't notice.

851
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,340
 - Well, 'cause you're so, they're so focused on the routine.

852
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,300
 - Yeah, you're doing your job.

853
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,140
 Here's the thing.

854
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,740
 (audience laughing)

855
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,420
 - Sorry, but if I punched you the nose right now,

856
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,020
 you wouldn't continue with this fact.

857
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,740
 - I'm a pro, I would continue on.

858
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,380
 There's a photo for the audience at home

859
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,300
 that's sitting behind us.

860
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,140
 And what you can see on the photo here

861
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,620
 is that the team is about to lob

862
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,140
 one of their members up into the air right.

863
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,380
 And the thing is in synchronized swimming,

864
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
 you aren't allowed to touch the bottom right.

865
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
 So the amount of kicking that you need to do

866
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,220
 in order to get them up into the air

867
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,620
 purely from swimming.

868
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,460
 - It's insane.

869
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,300
 - It's nuts, yeah.

870
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,860
 - I would think that they would breed

871
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,700
 synchronized swimmers who are just very tall

872
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,980
 so they can touch the bottom.

873
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,580
 But that is apparently not how the sport works.

874
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,420
 - It's not, yeah.

875
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,660
 - No, it's against the rules.

876
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,180
 They're completely pointless and you wouldn't work.

877
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,940
 But this photo and the idea that they are kicking

878
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,180
 madly underwater to sustain this beautiful performance

879
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,060
 above the water is epitomized by Sarah Oek

880
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,740
 who was a great synchronized swimmer

881
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,980
 who actually got kicked in the head and concussed

882
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,300
 and spent three years recuperating from that.

883
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,460
 And so retired.

884
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,260
 But she said, "We make it look pretty above the water

885
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
 but below it's a battlefield."

886
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,860
 And it is like underwater, it's mad.

887
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,260
 And there are lots of studies into concussion

888
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,500
 in other sports.

889
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,420
 The rugby is often cited as the worst.

890
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,740
 That's three concussions per 1,000

891
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,780
 kind of athletic exposures, which is one person in one game.

892
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,380
 But reading about synchronized swimming,

893
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,900
 there was Miriam Glez, who is the chief executive

894
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,740
 of USA Syncro, which is their national organizing body,

895
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,940
 said, "100% of my athletes will get a concussion

896
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,060
 at some point."

897
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,700
 And it is just crashing into and falling on each other.

898
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,700
 - They have helmets.

899
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,220
 - Well, they do in practice.

900
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,060
 - But do they?

901
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,020
 - They wear practice helmets.

902
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,580
 - Yeah, they're made of silicon

903
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,580
 and they've got like a honeycomb style make-up to them.

904
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,620
 Yeah, very tasty, right?

905
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,940
 Have a lick while you're down there.

906
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,300
 (audience laughing)

907
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,300
 - Don't ever, don't ever, ever, ever say that again.

908
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,700
 (audience laughing)

909
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,500
 - Obviously you can't see what's going on

910
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,300
 under the water, but I don't think.

911
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,140
 - I think that's, the judges would come down

912
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,980
 very hard on that.

913
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,820
 - Thanks.

914
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,660
 (audience laughing)

915
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,140
 - As long as they have some jump-up, it's all right.

916
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,420
 - That is the thing, we're looking at the photo right now.

917
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,020
 Doesn't look very synchronized, does it, right?

918
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,300
 And that's the thing, we're saying synchronized swimming.

919
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,060
 It's artistic swimming.

920
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,500
 So it's not, synchronized has gone out as a term.

921
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,820
 - But also, you were never synchronized with each other.

922
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,580
 You were synchronized with the music.

923
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,420
 - Yeah, that's right.

924
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,980
 - Which is why you can have solo synchronized swimming.

925
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,380
 I have an opinion, which is that,

926
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,460
 I think this is a better sport under the water

927
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,700
 than it is on top.

928
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,540
 - Ah, yes.

929
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,380
 - Whoa.

930
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,220
 - Yeah, yeah, great.

931
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,260
 - So you see the effort that goes in

932
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,740
 and there are sometimes cameras under the water

933
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,140
 and you can just see the furious effort that's going in.

934
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,500
 And I think it's probably the only sport

935
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,180
 where if you film it in a different medium,

936
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,620
 it's, I don't, I'm not sure what I'm trying to say.

937
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,260
 - I think it looks, it looks like shit.

938
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,340
 - It's the only sport that takes place

939
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,180
 between two forms of matter, right?

940
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,620
 - Well, half of you are all swimming.

941
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,460
 - All swimming.

942
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,300
 - All diving for sure.

943
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,140
 - All swimming.

944
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,980
 - All diving.

945
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,820
 - Okay.

946
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,660
 - Okay.

947
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,500
 - Now, gradually diving.

948
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,860
 - What's the one, water polo,

949
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,780
 where they've got the ball?

950
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,620
 - Yeah.

951
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,460
 - Yeah.

952
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,060
 - That is crazy underneath

953
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,780
 because they're literally like kicking and punching

954
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,180
 and yeah, everything.

955
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,700
 - I think to give Andy credit,

956
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,820
 I think diving isn't the same

957
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,860
 'cause diving ends once you enter the water, right?

958
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,020
 And synchronized swimming is constantly taking part

959
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,820
 in both media.

960
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,660
 - Thank you.

961
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,780
 - And there you go.

962
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,740
 - So like, there's no sport

963
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,540
 where half of your body is encased in solid

964
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,700
 and half of you is in plasma.

965
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,500
 It just doesn't happen.

966
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,100
 So I think that's what makes it interesting.

967
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,940
 - That is true.

968
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,220
 - And people pass out quite regularly

969
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,300
 'cause again, 'cause so much of it is under water,

970
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
 you have to be holding your breath

971
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,700
 a huge amount of the time

972
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,540
 and holding your breath

973
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,580
 while exerting yourself enormously.

974
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,220
 And this is another reason why the concussion issue

975
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,940
 in synchronized swimming is such a thing

976
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,220
 is that it's probably extremely under-reported

977
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,100
 because the symptoms of concussion

978
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,480
 are very similar to the symptoms of swimming upside down

979
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,580
 whilst holding your breath

980
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,380
 whilst having to fling people out of the air quite a lot.

981
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,540
 So imagine doing that.

982
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,980
 You're there going, am I concussed or is this just

983
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,900
 how you feel when you're doing this mad thing?

984
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,820
 - That's so funny.

985
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,660
 - Yeah.

986
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,500
 - And then the training,

987
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,900
 I mean, the training is incredibly stressful

988
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,140
 and there's a lot of it.

989
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,980
 But one of the things they do

990
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,040
 is they do crossfit workouts with their mouths taped

991
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,060
 because they have to hold their breath under water

992
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,220
 for like up to two minutes.

993
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,100
 And 'cause there's so much exertion,

994
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,820
 they have to not just get fit

995
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,260
 but be able to do these things while holding their breath.

996
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,660
 So they'll take the mouths and do some crossfit.

997
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,700
 - I can breathe with my nose.

998
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,540
 So, in your face.

999
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,980
 - I believe they probably take the nose as well.

1000
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,820
 - I think they probably do.

1001
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,020
 - So, and this is another sort of like cruel intensity

1002
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,860
 about it.

1003
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,340
 They're not allowed to wear swimming goggles.

1004
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,180
 - Yeah.

1005
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,020
 - No, it's not in the final thing.

1006
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,300
 - Yeah, 'cause the judges want to see their expression.

1007
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,860
 So the goggles aren't allowed to be there.

1008
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,380
 And as a result, they get really irritated eyes.

1009
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,580
 And so a lot of synchronized or artistic swimmers

1010
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,540
 bathe their eyes in milk.

1011
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,020
 'Cause apparently milk is very good for, yeah.

1012
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,380
 - And is that, that's not recommended

1013
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,820
 from the 17th century handbooks.

1014
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,980
 That's a genuine.

1015
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,500
 - That's Blaise Pascal says.

1016
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,620
 (laughing)

1017
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,300
 Like you say, they want to see their eyes.

1018
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
 They want to see their expressions.

1019
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,860
 They want to see them smiling.

1020
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,580
 And if you speak to any synchronized swimmer,

1021
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,860
 they all say that the smile is fake.

1022
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,180
 And the reason they're smiling is to kind of height the pain.

1023
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,260
 It's kind of a grimace.

1024
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,460
 'Cause the pain is so bad.

1025
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,220
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure."

1026
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,780
 (laughing)

1027
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,300
 - I mean, all of these reports about how tough it is

1028
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,340
 to come from synchronized swimmers.

1029
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,180
 - True.

1030
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,020
 - Yeah, but I mean--

1031
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,860
 - I'm just saying--

1032
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,700
 (laughing)

1033
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,620
 - How would the power left us?

1034
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,460
 No.

1035
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,060
 (laughing)

1036
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,100
 - It does obviously incredibly hard.

1037
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,940
 And obviously, if you come out of the water,

1038
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,020
 your natural instinct is to rub your face

1039
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,340
 and get the water out of your eyes.

1040
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,740
 And you're not allowed to do that

1041
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,460
 because you have to be looking at the judges.

1042
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,340
 And I think you meant to maintain eye contact

1043
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,020
 with the judges, with water in your eyes,

1044
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
 'cause you're mostly blind,

1045
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,980
 because you're not wearing your--

1046
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,820
 - It's crazy.

1047
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,260
 - It's really, it is very hard.

1048
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,460
 I take back my comment.

1049
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,500
 Please don't email him.

1050
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,820
 (laughing)

1051
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,260
 - And it, well, it is this very interesting thing,

1052
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,860
 which has a long history,

1053
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,460
 sort of kicked off officially in the 1890s.

1054
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,700
 And was about looking good.

1055
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,820
 It was only men who were allowed to do it at first.

1056
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,300
 And almost immediately,

1057
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,780
 people realized that women were much better candidates for it,

1058
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,180
 because A, we have much more fat on our body,

1059
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,460
 so we're more buoyant.

1060
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,740
 And B, people wanna look at women in swimsuits,

1061
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,540
 doing really pretty things.

1062
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,500
 And so, it's meant to be this display

1063
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,740
 of aesthetic brilliance.

1064
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,660
 But you do have these weird standards,

1065
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,780
 like the hair gel is amazing,

1066
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,140
 that they have to wear on their hair

1067
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,780
 to keep it looking completely,

1068
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,940
 staying completely still in the water and looking great.

1069
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,540
 So, the way they do their hair is called noxing,

1070
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,660
 with a K, K-N-O-X, and like, Fort Knox.

1071
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,780
 And it's because it's using nox gelatin,

1072
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,500
 which is a thing that's used to make jelly in cooking.

1073
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,780
 - Especially in America, I think,

1074
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,020
 it's like the main brand of gelatin.

1075
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,860
 - Is it?

1076
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,180
 Okay, okay, so there you go.

1077
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,620
 So it's like industrial strength,

1078
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,660
 and you spread this paste onto your head,

1079
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,780
 and it basically solidifies your hair,

1080
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,460
 so it can't move, and it's rock solid.

1081
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,460
 And then you go in.

1082
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,020
 - Nox, by the way, was run by a woman called Rose Nox,

1083
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,500
 who made this gelatin.

1084
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
 She was married to another guy who died,

1085
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,580
 and then she took over the business.

1086
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,060
 The first day she took over,

1087
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,020
 she closed the back door of the factory,

1088
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,420
 which previously all the women

1089
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,500
 had to go into a different door than all the men,

1090
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,860
 which was kind of a thing that did happen occasionally

1091
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,100
 in factories in America. - Really?

1092
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,700
 - Yeah, 'cause they didn't want them mixing

1093
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,060
 'cause they thought they wouldn't do any work

1094
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,220
 if they were flirting the whole time.

1095
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,300
 She made a five-day week for her workers

1096
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,180
 and gave them two weeks of paid vacation,

1097
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,820
 which really no one else was doing at the time.

1098
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,700
 And she wrote a book.

1099
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,100
 Her book was called "Seventy Easy Delicious Desserts"

1100
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,300
 made from sparkling carb's foot gelatin.

1101
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,860
 - No way! - Really?

1102
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,380
 - Sounds like a great book, though.

1103
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,220
 - So nice.

1104
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,500
 Did you guys hear of Esther Williams

1105
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,340
 in the course of the film?

1106
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,020
 - The movie star? - She was very cool.

1107
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,420
 She was a movie star who swam at the very elaborate routines.

1108
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,900
 In the sort of '40s and '50s,

1109
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,980
 there was a huge trend of aqua ballets

1110
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,460
 and the time it must be Barclay

1111
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,180
 and all of these amazing ballatic dance scenes.

1112
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,020
 She was great.

1113
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,740
 Her films included Neptune's Daughter,

1114
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,460
 Million Dollar Mermaid, Dangerous When Wet.

1115
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,780
 Just cool, cool films.

1116
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,780
 And she then had an unsuccessful move

1117
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,340
 into land-based acting.

1118
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,740
 And she was just flopping around.

1119
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,660
 - Well, there's a comedian called Fanny Bryce

1120
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,420
 who said of her, "Wet, she's a star.

1121
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,860
 "Dry, she ain't."

1122
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,380
 And she was very self-deprecating, though.

1123
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,500
 She said, "If they ever teach a duck to act,

1124
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,860
 "I'm in big trouble."

1125
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,700
 She's great.

1126
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,540
 She's so cool.

1127
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,940
 She once did a 35-metre dive in a film

1128
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,900
 playing another swimmer.

1129
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,820
 That was Million Dollar Mermaid.

1130
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,660
 She broke her neck.

1131
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,620
 She spent seven months in a body cast.

1132
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,780
 - Was that one of the land-based ones, actually?

1133
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,380
 (upbeat music)

1134
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:21,660
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

1135
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,580
 and that is Andy.

1136
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,460
 - My fact is that early phone boxes

1137
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,940
 came with a little man inside

1138
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,300
 who would arrange the call for you,

1139
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,420
 then wait outside until it was over.

1140
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,260
 - Aww.

1141
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,100
 - Very nice.

1142
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,940
 - That's lovely.

1143
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,780
 - Why did we get rid of it?

1144
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,060
 We could have had a really civilised time.

1145
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,100
 - Well, I guess it was because

1146
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,660
 everyone learned how to use phones.

1147
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,900
 - Yeah.

1148
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,460
 That's true, and they didn't in the first place.

1149
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,420
 So this is really interesting.

1150
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,940
 This is from a book called--

1151
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,100
 - Before you explain it,

1152
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,700
 when you say "little man" inside--

1153
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,900
 - Oh, yeah.

1154
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,220
 - Like a borrower, right?

1155
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,060
 - Yeah, like a borrower.

1156
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,660
 - A little abution?

1157
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,500
 - No.

1158
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,380
 - He has to be small enough to fit in the phone box.

1159
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,220
 - Yeah.

1160
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,340
 I mean, phone boxes, they're quite big.

1161
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,260
 - How little was the man?

1162
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,060
 - It's just a figure of speed.

1163
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,300
 Some of the men were probably normal

1164
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,260
 or even above average size, all right?

1165
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,340
 - I also, for the show we're doing in Ireland,

1166
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,620
 we have chosen the most quintessentially

1167
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,700
 English thing to talk about.

1168
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,380
 This will be 25 minutes on red phone boxes.

1169
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,340
 - I don't think it's any more English than Stonehenge.

1170
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:29,300
 - Very good.

1171
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,420
 - Stonehenge, built by a giant.

1172
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,580
 These phone boxes contained a little man.

1173
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,980
 - This is from a book

1174
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,980
 which, admittedly, is called Enigmatic England.

1175
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,380
 - And it's about...

1176
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,700
 - No, your audience!

1177
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,220
 - It's about these very early phone boxes.

1178
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,100
 So before you have the one person

1179
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,940
 sort of booth, you know, TARDIS style phone boxes,

1180
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,220
 you had call stations, which are more like a garden shed.

1181
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,420
 And they first appeared in 1886.

1182
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,740
 They're incredibly old.

1183
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,500
 And there would be an attendant inside

1184
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
 who would take your money, place the call,

1185
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
 wait outside in whatever the weather until you've finished.

1186
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,340
 I read some reports as well that they would also lock you in

1187
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,700
 so that you couldn't escape without paying.

1188
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,820
 - Oh, right, yeah.

1189
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,860
 - I think that was the thing, wasn't it?

1190
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,140
 'Cause you had to pay for it,

1191
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,020
 and they had no system of you just putting coins in

1192
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,060
 and it knowing that you put the right amount in

1193
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,340
 and then connecting you.

1194
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,020
 So you had to give them the money,

1195
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,380
 and then they would sort out all the connection part.

1196
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,220
 - Yeah, exactly.

1197
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,580
 So they had to go to a phone exchange to an operator.

1198
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,860
 It was really complicated.

1199
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,540
 And they would, I think, maybe time the call as well.

1200
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,380
 I don't know.

1201
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,020
 - Well, the first ones, actually.

1202
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,940
 So a lot of them were in post offices and shops,

1203
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,660
 the ones that didn't have little men.

1204
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,260
 So you might have it in a place

1205
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,820
 where there was already someone there.

1206
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,140
 But the first ones were in Manchester and Liverpool in 1885.

1207
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,380
 And in this one, you would give them the money,

1208
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,500
 they would set it off,

1209
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,540
 and then it said, this was from a newspaper article,

1210
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,260
 "A clockwork arrangement slowly moves an index finger

1211
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,100
 "visible to the user over a graduated arc."

1212
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,580
 So there's like a picture of someone's finger going,

1213
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,820
 "Like the countdown clock going do-do-do-do-do-do-do."

1214
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,260
 (laughter)

1215
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,100
 - Really?

1216
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,260
 - It's creepy, that, isn't it?

1217
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,100
 - That's amazing.

1218
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,500
 - Well, I noticed with your finger there is,

1219
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,980
 you did it anticlockwise to us,

1220
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,900
 so it was clockwise for the audience.

1221
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,980
 Was that deliberate?

1222
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,740
 - Oh, I've been working in Fierce for many years.

1223
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,820
 (laughter)

1224
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,820
 - Oh, God, you've just reminded me of a toothache cure.

1225
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,660
 Sorry.

1226
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,500
 (laughter)

1227
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,980
 It was to put a dead person's finger in your mouth.

1228
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,820
 - Wow!

1229
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,260
 - And rub it on the tooth.

1230
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,100
 Sorry, that's just...

1231
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,940
 - You reminded me, yeah.

1232
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,900
 - Was the finger connected to the dead person?

1233
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,740
 - I don't think it mattered.

1234
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,580
 - Or was it just--

1235
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,420
 (laughter)

1236
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,020
 - But I think, for ease of use,

1237
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,740
 you would probably disconnect it.

1238
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,580
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1239
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1240
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,740
 - When was this?

1241
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,300
 - This was the 1880s.

1242
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,700
 - It was such an exciting time,

1243
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,820
 the 1880s, in phone land, wasn't it?

1244
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
 Because it was--

1245
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,660
 - Show us.

1246
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,500
 - What was happening?

1247
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,340
 - Well, so--

1248
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,780
 - The invention of the phone, pretty much.

1249
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,620
 (laughter)

1250
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,140
 - That's a fairly seminal moment, yeah?

1251
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,660
 - It was mostly that.

1252
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,100
 I like the fact that phone operators

1253
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,540
 had to sort of know everyone in their area,

1254
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,340
 because there were so few people

1255
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,260
 who were subscribed to the telephone exchange.

1256
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,980
 As a phone operator, you'd call the operator,

1257
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,820
 and you'd say something like,

1258
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,100
 "Could you put me through to the doctor

1259
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,860
 "who specifically does knee stuff?

1260
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,940
 "I've got really sore knee."

1261
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,620
 And as an operator, you'd need to know that doctor

1262
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,780
 and which exchange point they were,

1263
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,180
 and plug them into the right thing.

1264
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,300
 - Have you tried attaching a frog to the knee?

1265
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,260
 (laughter)

1266
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,940
 - Do you have a dead man with you?

1267
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,860
 (laughter)

1268
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,500
 - Yeah, the first Irish telephone exchange

1269
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,540
 was set up in 1880,

1270
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,020
 but it had just five customers at the time.

1271
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,860
 - Right.

1272
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,020
 - But you think there would be an even number

1273
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,100
 so they could ring each other,

1274
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,780
 but I guess that's not how it worked.

1275
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,740
 - Do you know, I did check the phone book in Ireland

1276
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,780
 from that year, which is very short.

1277
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,460
 As you say, it got to about 19 or 20 customers

1278
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,300
 by the end of the year.

1279
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,300
 One of the customers was Messier's Guinness and Sons.

1280
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,140
 - Oh, wow!

1281
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,700
 - Yeah, they got in there,

1282
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,780
 'cause if you need your Guinness, you need it now.

1283
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,620
 - Right.

1284
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,460
 - That's so funny.

1285
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,700
 They had in 1885 an invention which was,

1286
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,020
 it was like an out of office email for phones.

1287
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,860
 - Okay.

1288
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,780
 - So if someone phoned you,

1289
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,460
 you could let them know that you were out

1290
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,460
 and you'd be back later.

1291
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,380
 Can you guess how that would work?

1292
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,980
 - Sorry, so you phoned them and--

1293
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,500
 - So you phoned me, I'm not in,

1294
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,980
 but I know that I'm gonna be back at four p.m.

1295
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,220
 So I'm gonna let you know.

1296
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,860
 - So I'm in the booth.

1297
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,700
 The finger beckons.

1298
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,860
 (laughter)

1299
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,700
 Is that it?

1300
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,860
 - No fingers involved.

1301
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
 - Okay.

1302
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,700
 - Oh, I know, I know,

1303
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,540
 'cause there weren't that many phones back then,

1304
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,380
 we're saying.

1305
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,260
 So what you would do is you would call up the operator

1306
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
 and say, "Anyone who tries to call my phone,

1307
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,100
 "can you let them know I'm out till 4.30?"

1308
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,940
 - Very good.

1309
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,940
 This is an invention.

1310
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,020
 It's a finger--

1311
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,180
 - So your phone is ringing on the desk

1312
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,100
 and I'm away from my desk.

1313
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,940
 So I need a mechanical claw to lift the phone

1314
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,420
 to a mechanical mouth.

1315
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,500
 - No fingers, no claws.

1316
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,060
 Employee boy, employee boy or girl?

1317
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,340
 - I don't think that's an invention, the boy.

1318
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,500
 - The boy.

1319
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,260
 This is when the boy was invented.

1320
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,300
 - Wow, the 1880s really were amazing.

1321
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,220
 - Basically what you would do

1322
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,940
 is if you're gonna be back at 4.00 p.m.,

1323
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,220
 as someone called, no one would answer it.

1324
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,580
 It would just go click, click, click, click,

1325
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,820
 and then would hang up.

1326
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,540
 And then they knew that you had to phone back at 4.00 p.m.

1327
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,380
 - Clever.

1328
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,220
 - Isn't that clever?

1329
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,060
 - That is.

1330
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,900
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

1331
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,740
 - That's very cool.

1332
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,900
 - The Bristol Mercury, I read about this invention,

1333
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,260
 they said this will be the most useful invention

1334
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,660
 of the time.

1335
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,620
 - Right.

1336
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,740
 - They were sure.

1337
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,860
 - This was a useful invention,

1338
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,060
 jumping a bit forward to 1905,

1339
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
 and there was a guy who was called Almond Stroger,

1340
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,420
 and he ran a funeral home in Kansas City,

1341
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,740
 and he invented the Stroger Pop Belly candlestick phone,

1342
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,580
 and he invented it.

1343
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,020
 - It's still a catchy name.

1344
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,080
 - 'Cause the candlestick is where you have that bit,

1345
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,780
 you pull by your ear, and then you hang it up,

1346
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,420
 and it sticks up by like a candlestick.

1347
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,620
 - Yeah, if you look at it, it does look like a candlestick,

1348
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,060
 yeah, or a candlestick holder rather.

1349
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,300
 But the reason he invented it

1350
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,260
 is because he worked in the funeral business,

1351
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,500
 and any time someone was calling up,

1352
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,860
 there was an operator whose husband

1353
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,740
 ran a rival funeral home,

1354
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,260
 and she kept putting it through to their home.

1355
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,460
 Yeah, and he was like, I'm losing all my business,

1356
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,740
 'cause she works on the inside,

1357
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,060
 she's feeding it to the wrong place,

1358
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,640
 so he's like, I'm gonna innovate the telephone,

1359
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,620
 and he did with numbers.

1360
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,540
 - Someone's stolen the finger from my husband, wasn't he?

1361
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,340
 - Hang on, 'cause I was about to say,

1362
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,740
 that's the best fact you've ever told me,

1363
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,980
 and were you about to say, so the story goes?

1364
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,820
 - Yes.

1365
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,820
 (audience laughing)

1366
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,620
 - Why do you do this to us?

1367
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,860
 - Well, no, because it's just covering my tracks, you know?

1368
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,060
 It's a, that is the story that that was the--

1369
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,620
 - It's a fantastic story.

1370
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,380
 - It's a great story. - Oh, dear.

1371
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,540
 In 1915, a three-minute call

1372
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,620
 between New York and San Francisco

1373
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,140
 cost the equivalent today of $500.

1374
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,340
 - Wow. - Three, wow.

1375
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,180
 - Yeah.

1376
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,060
 - These first ones, the ones that you were talking about

1377
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,580
 were three pence for three minutes.

1378
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,900
 - That's very good. - Yeah, yeah.

1379
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,460
 - Well, a lot of, it was for business only,

1380
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,100
 that was the thing, phones were for business,

1381
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,620
 they were for Guinness and Sons to place orders

1382
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,740
 or talk to their merchants or whatever,

1383
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,620
 and there were warnings in the early phone

1384
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,460
 that I'm quoting now, a document that said,

1385
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,300
 "It should not be used for the exchange of twaddle

1386
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,760
 "between foolish women."

1387
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,900
 (audience laughing)

1388
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,300
 - Wow. - Yeah.

1389
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,020
 No, and again, in 1909, one phone company manager

1390
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,780
 found that 30% of all calls were idle gossip,

1391
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,500
 and this was very frowned on because phones were,

1392
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,820
 you know, rare and precious,

1393
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,860
 and so they should only be for business and all that,

1394
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,300
 and then gradually phone company bosses started realizing,

1395
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,480
 oh, well, probably quite useful if people are speaking

1396
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,320
 on their phone for a long time.

1397
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,700
 - I think also, 'cause it clogged up the lines, didn't it?

1398
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,060
 Basically, if you were talking your twaddle to someone,

1399
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,580
 it meant that other people might not be able

1400
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,740
 to use the lines 'cause there weren't that many of them.

1401
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,580
 Eventually, we got the automatic payphone

1402
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,220
 where people could put coins in.

1403
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,060
 - Oh, yeah.

1404
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,140
 - So we had bad news for the little men.

1405
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,700
 (audience laughing)

1406
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,100
 - A lot of little guys.

1407
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,820
 - Unimplied all around the country.

1408
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,420
 - Putting out little signs.

1409
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,020
 (audience laughing)

1410
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,220
 - But this was invented by William Gray,

1411
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,820
 and his original invention is very clever.

1412
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,300
 So you have the thing that you talk into,

1413
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,820
 and there was a little bit of metal near the microphone,

1414
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,060
 and whenever you put the money in,

1415
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,860
 the little bit of metal slid out of the way

1416
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,360
 so you'd be able to talk,

1417
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,820
 and then as soon as your money ran out,

1418
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,300
 it would slide back into place,

1419
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,580
 so you wouldn't be able to hear the many of them.

1420
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,260
 - Ooh, nice little chat guillotine.

1421
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,100
 - Isn't that cool?

1422
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,940
 - That is cool.

1423
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,020
 - It's really cool.

1424
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,140
 - He also invented the chest protector

1425
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,860
 for baseball catchers.

1426
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,500
 - Oh, that big, like, buff looking thing that they wear.

1427
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,220
 - Yeah, the thing that protects the chest.

1428
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,060
 - Yeah.

1429
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,580
 (audience laughing)

1430
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,980
 - It's just two weird things to invent, isn't it?

1431
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,820
 - It is.

1432
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,580
 - Here's a little quiz from a California phone manual

1433
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,420
 in the early days.

1434
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,340
 I think this is the early 1900s.

1435
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,480
 Keep your what out of the opening of the phone?

1436
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,660
 (audience laughing)

1437
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,660
 - Keep your twaddle.

1438
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,800
 - Let's keep these.

1439
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,260
 - What's the opening of the phone?

1440
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,980
 - Whether your mouth is.

1441
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,820
 - Keep your tongue out?

1442
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,660
 - Oh.

1443
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,500
 - Keep your tongue out?

1444
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,340
 Well, yes, but no.

1445
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,220
 - I'm just thinking, like, what is close by.

1446
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,540
 - Who's using phones at this time?

1447
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,700
 - Yeah, keep your nose out.

1448
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,980
 - saliva, saliva.

1449
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,100
 (audience laughing)

1450
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,660
 - Yeah, no, this is a manly thing.

1451
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,500
 - Oh, it's a manly thing?

1452
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,340
 - Yeah.

1453
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,180
 - Okay, penis.

1454
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,300
 (audience laughing)

1455
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,780
 - James, moustache.

1456
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,100
 (audience laughing)

1457
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,820
 Why on earth would you put your penis

1458
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,100
 into the mouthpiece?

1459
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,080
 (audience laughing)

1460
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,420
 - I can't help but think of a penis.

1461
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,000
 - I can't believe you would think of a penis.

1462
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,080
 That's disgraceful.

1463
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,580
 Oh, James, I'm really disappointed.

1464
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,040
 (audience laughing)

1465
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,400
 - So that was a phone manual.

1466
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,480
 How to use a phone.

1467
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
 I just had a thing on a phone book,

1468
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,880
 which is, you know, another phone-related book.

1469
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,680
 (audience laughing)

1470
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,700
 That's the link.

1471
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,200
 (audience laughing)

1472
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,240
 I just really like this.

1473
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,000
 This is someone found this randomly a few years ago.

1474
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,120
 They lived in Idaho,

1475
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,680
 and they wondered what would happen

1476
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,320
 if you looked up Adam West.

1477
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,160
 You remember Adam West?

1478
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,000
 - Batman.

1479
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,820
 - He died recently.

1480
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,640
 He was Batman.

1481
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,640
 - He died?

1482
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,080
 - I'm just, God, this is a big moment.

1483
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,920
 - Did he?

1484
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,080
 (audience laughing)

1485
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,740
 - Quite recently, the last couple of years, I think.

1486
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,580
 - Gosh.

1487
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,320
 - He was tied to a huge vat of acid.

1488
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,320
 (audience laughing)

1489
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,840
 - Anyway, this random guy on the internet

1490
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,680
 found out that he just idly looked up Adam West

1491
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,680
 in the phone book.

1492
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,440
 And the message in the phone book read in Idaho,

1493
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,200
 'cause Adam West lived in Idaho when he died,

1494
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,800
 the message read, "See Wayne, Bruce, Brackett's millionaire."

1495
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,640
 - No, literally.

1496
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,480
 - And so, you went to that listing in the phone book,

1497
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,320
 and then it said, "Please consult crime fighters

1498
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
 "in the yellow pages."

1499
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,160
 And then,

1500
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,720
 (audience laughing)

1501
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,920
 you went to that listing in the yellow pages,

1502
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,440
 and it said, "See Batman, white pages."

1503
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,440
 And then you went to that listing,

1504
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,960
 and it sent you back to Adam West in the phone book.

1505
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,800
 - Oh, okay, I need to end us here.

1506
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,800
 And that is it for our show tonight.

1507
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,480
 Thank you, Dublin, so much for being here.

1508
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,320
 (audience cheering)

1509
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,960
 That is all our facts.

1510
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,840
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1511
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,080
 We will see you then.

1512
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,920
 Good bye!

1513
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,920
 (audience cheering)

1514
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,500
 (upbeat music)

1515
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,840
 (upbeat music)

1516
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,420
 (upbeat music)

1517
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:27,420
