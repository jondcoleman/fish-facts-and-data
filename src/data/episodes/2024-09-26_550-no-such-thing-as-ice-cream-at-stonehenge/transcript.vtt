00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 - Hi everyone, just before we start this show,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.680
 I wanted to perform a tiny, tiny interview

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.880
 about a very exciting new book that's been released.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.080
 It's a book called Impossible Things,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320
 unbelievable answers to the world's weirdest questions.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.080
 And it's by renowned author and podcaster,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080
 Dan Treiber, here with me today.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.640
 - Hello, thank you for having me.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.760
 - It's a real pleasure.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.520
 How would you describe what this book is about?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.640
 - This is a book where I look into all the mysteries

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.080
 that kids are fascinated by.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.000
 Are we being visited by aliens?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.480
 Are there ghosts out there in haunted houses?

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.760
 Are there monsters in the lock?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.240
 Do time travelers visit us?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.240
 All that sort of stuff.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.960
 I've actually gone on 10 adventures

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.040
 to investigate it on behalf of kids.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.600
 Getting to the bottom of the history

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.160
 of why we believe in this stuff,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 how it's changed the course of the world.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.880
 And it's also just a funny little adventure

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.760
 that kids will hopefully enjoy.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.000
 - Yes, if you are fans of this podcast at all,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.280
 this book is basically bang in line with that.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.080
 And when Dan's personality, it's full of amazing facts.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.280
 It doesn't say wrong stuff,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 even though it's about all these weird, mysterious phenomena.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.760
 - Yeah, and it's as much written for adults as it is kids.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.160
 Fish listeners, it would really be a huge, huge deal for me

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.600
 if you could go out and get a copy today.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.960
 It's really, really incredibly hard to sell books,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.920
 particularly kids' books.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.960
 And I would love to turn this into a series.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.080
 And I can only do that if it's a success.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 And you are my best chance at that.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.280
 So please do pick up a copy online or in bookshots today.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.760
 - Okay, on with the show.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.600
 - On with the show.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.200
 (alarm blaring)

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Dublin.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 (audience cheering)

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.160
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.840
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.360
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.680
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.800
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.960
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that mathematician Blaise Pascal

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.120
 once cured his toothache by thinking about maths.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.880
 (audience laughing)

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.240
 - We went from like crazy rock and roll beginning to--

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.920
 - Excuse me, but there is nothing more rock and roll

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.760
 than maths.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.600
 - That's true.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.160
 - And especially 17th century French maths.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
 - And Blaise Pascal, what a hot name.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.120
 That's a rock star, I've never heard one.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.080
 - You don't get enough Blaise these days, do you?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.920
 - No.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 - You need to come back.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.440
 So was this like one of those cures where if you've got

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 a pain, subject yourself to something even worse?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.640
 Like you've got a toothache, shoot yourself in the foot,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.680
 and you'll forget about the toothache, apparently.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.120
 - I see where you're going, but no, it's the exact opposite.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.840
 - He was thinking about problems concerning the cycloid,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.640
 which is a curve traced by a point on the edge of a circle.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.680
 - Rock and roll, wow.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.520
 - His toothache disappeared and he decided that it was

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.120
 God that did it, and God was saying to him,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.400
 you need to carry on with the maths,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.040
 and carry on with the maths he did.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.800
 - Wow, that's good.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.360
 So Pascal, the only thing I'd ever heard of Pascal

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.960
 before researching this fact is Pascal's wager,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.680
 and the idea is that if you, what is the idea?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.160
 Is that if you, even if you think it's unlikely

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.600
 that a vengeful God does exist,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.480
 you may as well go through the motions

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.960
 as if a vengeful God does exist,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.240
 because on the off chance that you're wrong

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.480
 and he does exist, it's much better to have.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.600
 - You're absolutely fucked.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.440
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.120
 But I think actually God is going to know

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.280
 that you're doing that, right?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.160
 Because God knows everything.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.280
 So as soon as you say, oh yeah, I really believed you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.640
 all that time, he's going to go bullshit.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120
 - Imagine if God turned out to be such a chump

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.920
 that he didn't know when you truly believed in art.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.400
 He said, yeah, you believed, I saw it at the end.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.080
 You said, yes, come on in buddy, nice to see you.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.840
 By the way, that's always presented

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.080
 as if he was a non-believer,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.080
 but he was very much into his religion.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.440
 So the idea of the wager did involve

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.480
 you actually believing as well.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.240
 It wasn't just like, oh yeah, on the side kind of thing.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.800
 - Just quickly, in 2008, Paddy Power

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.440
 offered Odds of Four to One that God existed.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440
 - Hey.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.280
 - That was a good bet you could have made at the time.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 - Yeah.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.960
 - Have they had to pay out?

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.800
 - Not yet.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.120
 - Not yet, okay.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.040
 - They did say they would need

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.040
 an independent authority to verify it.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.320
 I don't know who, I don't know who that is.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.960
 - Who's going to be independent in that situation?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.040
 Richard Dawkins, no he hasn't.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.440
 - No, he's, yeah, yeah.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.880
 - So this Blaise Pascal, he's such an interesting character.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.200
 So he very sadly, he lost his mother

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.160
 when he was three years old.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.480
 And his father, Etienne, basically decided

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.200
 that he was going to homeschool him.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.600
 And Etienne was himself an amateur mathematician.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.920
 However, he thought math isn't for the young,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.880
 like your brains are not ready when you're young.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.880
 You need to do this when you're like 14, 15.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.560
 So he took all the math books in the house

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.040
 and he locked them up in a cupboard.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.440
 And he said, don't let me catch you,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.320
 read in any math around here.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.800
 And so he became very curious about it

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.600
 because he'd seen his father talk about it

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.760
 with his friends and so on.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.240
 So basically Pascal had to discover math

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.160
 by thinking about it and landed on all the actual equations,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.400
 which is extraordinary.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.360
 - According to actually Pascal's sister,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.880
 the reason that his dad banned him from doing math,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.040
 and he really did, and no one was allowed to mention math

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.520
 in front of Blaise, she said that he did it because he knew,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.280
 Etienne knew that math fills and greatly satisfies the mind

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.280
 in such a huge way that he knew as soon as Blaise

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.760
 heard about math, he wouldn't be interested in classics

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.400
 or the humanities or anything like that.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.280
 So he was like, I know you're going to get addicted

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.120
 as soon as you're exposed.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.920
 So I'm going to keep you away from it.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.080
 But of course it piqued his interest so much, Blaise's interest.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.640
 He was like, what is this mysterious thing?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.240
 I'm not allowed to access.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.840
 And then it does sound like this incredible moment.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.800
 A tear kind of came to my eye when I imagined Etienne,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.920
 maths lover, as he was,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.160
 going up to his 12-year-old son's bedroom, opening the door.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.400
 - Don't come in.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.240
 I'm doing some math.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.200
 - I'm doing some math.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.600
 - No, no, I'm masturbating, I'm masturbating.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.120
 You're not masturbating, you're math debating.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.000
 (audience laughing)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.440
 But he was right, that's what he was doing.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.640
 He was sitting there secretly drawing circles and triangles

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.640
 and thinking about the relationship between angles.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.080
 - I mean, he discovered amazing stuff.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.600
 Well, it doesn't sound amazing to us.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.920
 He basically discovered that all the angles in a triangle

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.720
 add up to 180, duh.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.800
 But we all studied maths, you see.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.920
 That's the difference.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.280
 Whereas this 12-year-old hadn't.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.840
 - He invented a calculator.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.560
 Again, mid 17th century, not a lot of calculators.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.520
 And it was called the pascaline,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.840
 named after him, obviously.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.680
 And he dedicated it to the French Chancellor.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.520
 And he got a patent of it.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.240
 And then, most French move ever,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.800
 he said, "No one else is allowed to make one,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.280
 "but me, I have to have total control over it

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.520
 "so they didn't make any."

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.360
 (audience laughing)

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.680
 - It was for his dad, wasn't it?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.320
 'Cause I think his dad worked in the sob

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.280
 and kind of accounting thing.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.200
 And his dad was always tired and stuff.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.760
 And he thought, "If I make this calculator,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.880
 "it'll make his life easier."

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.600
 - He used an abacus, his dad.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.520
 And he invented it to do away with the need.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.640
 - So sweet.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.040
 And yet sort of so worrying in your child as well,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.880
 if they've done that.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.400
 But mostly really sweet.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.240
 - I know.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.520
 - And it was essentially a calculator

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.680
 that allowed you to carry over,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.040
 which we all remember fondly,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.400
 which abacus didn't allow you to do.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.640
 So his calculator automatically carried over.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.480
 You know, carrying over.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.760
 No one in the audience shouted, "No, what?"

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.800
 - What is that?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.440
 - Is anyone here from the 1600s?

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.480
 (audience laughing)

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.200
 - So yeah, it was amazing.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.880
 But he'd got this gig being an accountant.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.120
 It was a really good gig.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120
 And it was in Normandy.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.120
 And he was actually managing the taxes of the whole area.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.360
 But he had fallen from grace massively

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.720
 and come back into the grace of the French authorities.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.040
 Not because of Blaise Pascal,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.240
 but because of Blaise's sister.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.600
 So basically Etienne's there.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.160
 He's pissed off Richelieu,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.920
 who's the French prime minister.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.200
 And he's basically been exiled.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.640
 So he's had to leave his three kids in Paris, Blaise,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.000
 and then Jacqueline and Gilbert.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.440
 And Jacqueline turns out to be such a talented playwright

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.280
 and actress at the age of 10 or something

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.600
 that she performs for Cardinal Richelieu.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.400
 And he's so charmed by her

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.000
 that she goes up to him afterwards and says,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 "Oh, I hope you like that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.680
 "By the way, would you mind forgiving my dad,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.480
 "not putting him in prison in the Bastille,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.640
 "not cutting his head off

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.640
 "and giving him a good position instead?"

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.800
 And Richelieu said, "Yeah, right, you're cute.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.640
 "I'll do that."

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.480
 (audience laughing)

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.320
 - Precretious.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.960
 - So then a bit later, Blaise Pascal,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.880
 he was in a carriage and the horse is bolted

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.640
 and they threw him into the Seine and he nearly died.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.800
 - 'Cause it's very polluted, isn't it?

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.600
 As we know from the Olympics, so was it?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.640
 - But then he wrote an account of that accident

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.840
 and he had sort of like, God came to him

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.280
 while he was in the water

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.120
 and that made him even more religious.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.800
 - It was called his Night of Fire

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.120
 and he had a mystical moment and a realization

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.280
 and he wrote this kind of poem

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.800
 which apparently reads like a journal entry

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.200
 and they only found it after he died.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.720
 - And the religion was Janssenism, wasn't it?

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.800
 It was both him and his sister were Janssenists.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.480
 And the idea of Janssenism is we're all evil

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.320
 and there's nothing you can do about it

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.920
 and it's decided at the start

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.560
 who's going to be saved by God

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.200
 and who isn't going to be saved by God

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.640
 and it really doesn't matter what you do while you're alive.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.880
 You're either fucked or not fucked.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.680
 - Right, what's in it for me?

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.520
 Sorry.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.840
 (audience laughing)

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.200
 - I've got some bad news for you, Andy.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.540
 - Oh no.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.480
 - Which didn't make any sense and I'm sure it would

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.800
 if we spent longer than a day reading up on this

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.520
 but to me, as James says, predestination,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.040
 nothing you can do.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.760
 But also, it's not like he went out

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.080
 and had a great time because of it.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.360
 He had a shit time.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.320
 To be honest, I think he was a bore, Blaise Pascal.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.360
 He did the old classic mortifying himself.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.480
 It's called mortifying where he wore metal clothes

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.440
 with spikes on the inside to hurt himself at all times.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.960
 So he could constantly be punished

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.200
 and constantly banish vain and profane thoughts.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.760
 You know, he was so devout.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.360
 He completely abandoned maths really

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.100
 for the last 10 years of his life.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.940
 The fun thing.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.080
 - Is that your definition of boring?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.680
 - Someone who wears metal spikes.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.800
 (laughing)

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.600
 - If you have metal spikes facing outwards,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.920
 that's cool, that's SNN.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.620
 If the metal spikes are facing inwards.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.200
 (laughing)

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.160
 - He always wore stockings soaked in brandy.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.000
 - Really?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.840
 - Yeah, I heard that.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.680
 - What's that for?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.520
 - I heard it.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.360
 I heard it.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.740
 Got some hot gauze, like I've read it in a document.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.720
 - Yeah, he thought, well, he did have very bad circulation.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.880
 He was very sickly in his 30s

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.840
 and he thought that his circulation would improve

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.960
 if he wore.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.360
 'Cause in those days, it was like, this is a hot thing.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.760
 Brandy is a hot thing.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.440
 It will improve the heat in your body.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.440
 It will help the circulation.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440
 - It feels like it would do it.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.760
 - I mean, and then...

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.740
 (laughing)

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.580
 - Yeah.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.080
 - It might do it if it attracted people

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.840
 to suckle at your tights.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.680
 (laughing)

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.840
 As you well might.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.680
 (laughing)

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680
 - So he met Descartes.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.920
 This is hugely exciting in Paris in 1647.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.280
 He'd been away, he'd been really ill.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.120
 He'd just got back.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.800
 And then he and Descartes were in the same room.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.640
 I think it's the only time--

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.280
 - Are they both famous at this point?

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.480
 - I think they're both pretty famous.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.320
 - Wow.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.840
 - It's a huge, huge meeting of mind.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.680
 It's like--

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.680
 - It's like Comic-Con, but for the--

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.520
 - Oh my God, yeah.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.960
 It's like Comic-Con, but for the greatest thinkers

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.160
 of all time.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.280
 And all the doctors have been suggesting to Pascal,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.680
 oh, you need to have more enemas and bloodlettings

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.680
 and purging.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.160
 And Descartes said, have you just considered resting

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.200
 and having some soup?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.240
 And it was a very, it went really badly.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.280
 - Right.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.920
 - So he didn't want the resting in the soup.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.760
 He wanted the enemas and purging.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.600
 - He wanted those.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.440
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.280
 - Right.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.120
 - Right.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.940
 - Weird guy.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.600
 - You know, James, the headline fact.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.920
 So he thought about mathematics in order

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.760
 to cure his toothache.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.200
 Did the toothache, was it psychosomatic?

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.320
 Did it actually--

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.160
 - Yeah.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.000
 - Did he then have a cure?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.840
 - I think what happened was it just went away.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.680
 (audience laughs)

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.520
 - Yeah.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.360
 - Right.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.180
 - And perhaps the maths might not have had everything

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.020
 to do with it.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.860
 Call me a skeptic.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.280
 (audience laughs)

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.120
 - But if you, you can take your mind off pain

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.080
 if you fill your mouth with saliva.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.120
 Does anyone else do that?

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.200
 - Really?

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.300
 - Yeah, a few yeses and a few, more than a few.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.120
 - What?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.680
 - Okay, but if you, it's just something else

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.520
 to focus on.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.500
 You just focus on filling your mouth with saliva.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.060
 Right, I've got to get these saliva ducks flowing.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.900
 - What's hurting on you?

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.240
 Is it your teeth or anything on your teeth?

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.820
 - Yeah, but not, I don't think this works

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.980
 if you've broken your leg, for instance.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.500
 It only works in like a headache or something like that.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.340
 - It works for a limited amount of time on minor pains.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.620
 - But on all pain, that's really interesting.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.460
 - I would say all pain.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.660
 - So you've done it to yourself.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.500
 - I'm constantly doing it.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.900
 - So when's the last time you did it?

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.740
 (audience laughs)

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.580
 - I don't know.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.060
 (audience laughs)

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.380
 - Do you think this could be used

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.220
 in childbirth, for instance, Sandy?

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.580
 (audience laughs)

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.420
 - I don't see why not.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.320
 - I've tried a lot of other stuff

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.100
 and it doesn't seem to have worked, so.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.100
 (audience laughs)

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.940
 - Some of it does work.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.700
 - It's just leading over to your wife, okay.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.040
 - Have you thought about thinking of math equations?

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.020
 (audience laughs)

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.340
 - Look, just in your own time, what's six times 17?

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.700
 (audience laughs)

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.580
 - Hey, so do you know, toothache,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.660
 one of the earliest ideas of what it might be

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.700
 is that you were infected with a tooth worm.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.540
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.380
 - Amazing idea.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.500
 They thought there was a living creature inside there

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.500
 that was wiggling around, trying to get out,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.740
 and that's what was causing all the pain inside,

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.340
 and so this is ancient.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.820
 - I think it might be the oldest misconception

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.020
 in humankind, the oldest that I've ever found anyway,

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.500
 'cause the Babylonians believed it.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.100
 - And it lasted forever, I mean,

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.820
 it lasted until the 18th century, basically,

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.500
 when it was roundly debunked by Pierre Fochard, a dentist,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.340
 but it was believed everywhere, wasn't it?

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.620
 Like, from ancient Egypt to Mesoamerica,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.020
 how are they getting hold of this idea?

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.260
 - I briefly believed it while I was researching this,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.700
 'cause I was in the 17th century,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.180
 and I just didn't do the researching

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.060
 of what a toothache is until later on,

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.460
 so for a few hours in 2024, someone believed in tooth worms.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.700
 - That tooth worms existed.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.140
 - Irish remedies for toothache.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.820
 So is the National Folklore Collection much discussed still?

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.180
 A little bit, okay, so it was school children,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.380
 they were sent out, sort of 10 to 14 year olds

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.620
 were sent in their local area,

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.860
 they wrote up all the folklore they could gather

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.540
 from people who'd been alive,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.060
 so this was done, yeah, 1937, '38,

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.500
 so the years it covered,

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.980
 because of the age of the people they were talking to,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.900
 went back to the 1860s,

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.100
 and a lot of the folklore was to do with how to cure,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.460
 it was warts, whooping cough, and toothache,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.620
 and the cures, I have to say, largely potato-based,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.380
 they were, I'm afraid.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.860
 - What do you do with said potato?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.180
 - You go into the garden, get a potato pecked by a crow,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.460
 put it in your pocket, and never let it fall out.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.500
 (laughing)

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.340
 - Okay.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.180
 - That'll do it.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.020
 - That's it.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.900
 - And get a slice of raw potato, put it in your cheek,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.740
 it sounds fractionally more believable, you know?

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.580
 - Yeah, that could work.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.660
 - Yeah, but by far the most common,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.580
 actually it was not potato, but it was frog-based,

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.940
 was to keep a live frog in your mouth for a few minutes,

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.220
 the frog gets the, oh, come on, it's all right.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.140
 (laughing)

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.180
 Keep it in your mouth for a few minutes,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.900
 and then let it out, and it gets the toothache,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.540
 very sad for it, but it takes yours away.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.380
 And do you know this sign?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.060
 It's like you put an L on your forehead.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.580
 - James is calling me a loser, yeah.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.620
 - No, I'm not calling you a loser, so this sign,

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.820
 this according to Canadian Medical Hall of Fame member

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.940
 Ronald Meltzak, if you take the L sign

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.540
 for calling someone a loser,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.100
 and then you rub an ice cube up and down the L,

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.460
 then that will get rid of your toothache,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.540
 and it works in more than 50% of patients.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.380
 - Really?

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.260
 - Yeah, and his theory, and he's tried this,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.380
 and his theory is your body sort of feels the cold,

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.380
 and it blocks some pathways, some pain pathways

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.860
 to your brain, and so it stops the.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.700
 - Wow.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.540
 - Wow.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.380
 - According to him.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.220
 - Yeah.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.060
 - Give it a go.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.180
 - And he's in the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.020
 (laughing)

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.860
 - Okay.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.700
 - That's pretty funny.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.660
 - Not 17th Century Hall of Fame,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.900
 the Modern Hall of Fame.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.980
 - Modern Canada, but modern.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.220
 (laughing)

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:47.620
 - It is time for fact number two,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.060
 and that is my fact.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.020
 My fact this week is that it turns out,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.100
 Stonehenge isn't a henge.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.180
 (laughing)

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.020
 - Wow.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.020
 - Isn't that nuts?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.940
 The only henge we know about isn't an actual henge.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.020
 - So what's going on?

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.860
 What is it?

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.740
 - Okay, this is according to English Heritage.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.700
 If you go on their site,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.660
 they have a fantastic page all about henges,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.020
 and obviously Stonehenge leads the category there,

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.700
 but then you get to a little bit where it says

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.220
 it isn't officially a proper henge,

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.140
 as the main ditch is external to the main bank.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.660
 So what it is, in fact, is a protohenge.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.540
 Now here's the weird thing,

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.060
 henges are only called henges

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.300
 because they're named after Stonehenge.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.100
 (laughing)

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:32.940
 - Wow.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.260
 - This cat has eaten its own tail.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.100
 - Yeah.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.940
 - It is amazing.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.260
 - It's where the ditches and where the raised bank is.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.020
 - But it's also the size as well.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.780
 It has to be over 65 feet across

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.620
 when you would do the ditches.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.460
 - Okay.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.420
 - If they found loads of henges,

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.860
 and they're all the same, apart from Stonehenge,

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.940
 it feels like Stonehenge was assembled incorrectly,

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.900
 but basically the packet instructions

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.180
 clearly showed the ditch inside the bank or whatever,

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.660
 or else I don't care.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.980
 But do you know what I mean?

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.900
 Like, they just did it wrong.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.940
 'Cause I think there is a theory

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.180
 that it was basically a reassembly from another site.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.140
 - Oh, it's a second-hand henge, basically.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.980
 - Yeah.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.820
 - Yeah.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.660
 - It's basically--

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.500
 - It's a henge me down, basically.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.740
 - Oh, lovely, lovely, very strong.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.740
 - Don't boom it, that wasn't prepped, you know what I mean?

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.780
 - You've been sat all day writing that joke, haven't you done?

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.860
 Yeah, there's another site in Wales, isn't there,

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.460
 where they've looked at what's missing from there,

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.780
 and what's in Stonehenge.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.460
 And it almost comes together as a whole thing, yeah.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.780
 Because they also worked out

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.780
 that people were living there for ages,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.500
 and then they stopped living there,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.060
 and then they came back later,

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.940
 and they stopped living there

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.060
 about the same time as the stones left.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.700
 So it could be that they just decided to move to Salisbury

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.700
 and took their big old stones with them.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.460
 - The baggage allowance must have been massive

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.300
 in the olden days.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.060
 - There's also another theory by Geoffrey of Monmouth,

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.460
 the 12th century author.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.260
 He says that Stonehenge was originally built in Ireland

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.740
 by a group of giants from Africa.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.180
 - By a group of who?

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.700
 - A group of giants from Africa.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.020
 - Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.860
 - Classic.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.780
 - And then Merlin took them over from Ireland to Britain.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.620
 - We're booing Merlin.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.740
 - We're booing Merlin.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.060
 - Wow.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.260
 - Don't you mention his name in this town.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.540
 (audience laughing)

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.780
 He knows what he did.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.340
 - That's actually just very good etymological knowledge

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.180
 from this audience.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.540
 'Cause Merlin, of course, literally means shit,

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.380
 Merlin.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.220
 It does, yeah.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.780
 One of our earliest facts in Welsh, it meant shit.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.140
 And that's why we changed it to Merlin

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.140
 'cause we thought the name shit was too embarrassing.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:32.980
 - It was embarrassing.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.500
 - But he did indeed.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.980
 I think these giants brought it all the way to Ireland

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.100
 from Africa, and then back to England.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.460
 And this was the prevailing theory,

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.460
 or the most common popular theory, wasn't it,

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.300
 until the 19th century.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.700
 I don't think many people believed it.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.180
 - It qualifies as a theory.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.900
 I don't know, there were lots of theories,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.300
 and they all sort of reflect the times

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.420
 in which they were espoused.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.940
 So there's, you know, is it a calculator

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.140
 to work out the seasons?

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.660
 Is it a healing place?

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.260
 Is it a spacecraft landing pad?

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:04.260
 Is it a dating, literally a site for romance?

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.340
 - Oh, not dating as in the data.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.380
 - No, sorry, not carbon dating, just dating.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.220
 - Right.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.260
 - How would the dating work?

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.740
 - It's just a symbolic, sort of, meat meeting.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.580
 - But you would meet them, like,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.340
 let's go to Stonehenge and catch a...

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.180
 - Catch something.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.020
 - Catch something.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.540
 Well, that was really nice,

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.220
 'cause it would be a dating site called Henge.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.460
 That would be very pleasing.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.300
 - Oh, yeah.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.460
 - Dan and I sitting right in that chair.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.380
 - Dan and I sitting next to each other on the plane.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.220
 What are you doing?

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.060
 - Nothing.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.140
 - But one of the latest theories

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.900
 is that it was basically a meeting place,

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.860
 and it was actually a sort of community centre, effectively.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.340
 Like, it was an attempt to get people to come here,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.020
 get involved in a big project, work together,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.140
 'cause it was a time of big population decline and dispersal.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.620
 So it was just an attempt to kind of get people together,

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.460
 you know?

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.340
 - There's a lot of shit, isn't there, about Stonehenge?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.460
 But the nice thing is, there always has been.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.340
 When you look back at early 1800s sources,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.820
 people bitch about the fact that the number of theories

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.380
 about where Stonehenge comes from

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.220
 and why it's there are ridiculous.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.620
 So there was a whole spate of research

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.820
 in the 1920s and 1930s.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.700
 There was an extremely authoritative account written

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.740
 called The Stones of Stonehenge,

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.300
 and his name was Edward Herbert Stone, which is nice.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.620
 - Very nice.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.460
 - There's Henry Brown as well, 1823.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.500
 He wrote what was officially the guidebook,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.020
 that's the first guidebook to Stonehenge,

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.460
 and the theory that he puts in there,

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.100
 which he kind of presents as fact,

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.260
 is that it survived Noah's flood.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.820
 - There was a very interesting debate between two excavators.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.340
 Again, in the 20s and 30s,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.220
 when people were starting to do serious archaeology

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.020
 about Stonehenge, rather than coming up with mad theories,

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.260
 the two main explorers of it, and excavators of it,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.620
 were a woman called Maude Cunnington

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.820
 and a man called Alexander Kaler.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.260
 And I got really obsessed with them

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.220
 because they sort of hated each other.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.300
 Eventually, their rivalry came to center on this one stone,

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.820
 and it was a stone that Maude visited in 1911.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.740
 So she'd gone to lift up another stone,

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.740
 which is called Adam.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.820
 They give a couple of the stone's names, Adam and Eve, notably,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.860
 and she'd lifted up this other stone, which had fallen over.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.180
 - Was she a giant? Sorry.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.580
 - Yeah, sorry. I should have made it clear

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.220
 that she brought quite a lot of heavy machinery with her.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.980
 A large number of other people lifted up the hen stone.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.860
 Cunnington came to the site in the 30s,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.980
 when that idiot woman, she's put it the wrong way up,

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.140
 was determined she put it the wrong way up, flipped it over,

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.340
 put it on its head.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.980
 Now, as they've looked at the stones

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.700
 and realized that he got it wrong,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.540
 so there's this upside down stone there.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.740
 - Brilliant. - That's messing it all up,

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.740
 solely the result of this rivalry between these two people.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.100
 - Wow. - Did they fall in love?

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.460
 (audience laughing)

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.860
 'Cause it sounds like everything you're saying is a rom-com.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.340
 - It does. I know.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.500
 Yes, this is the beginning of "You've got mail."

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.340
 Yes, I didn't.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:53.260
 - Other places that are modeled on Stonehenge,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.940
 have you heard of a bonehenge?

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.340
 Bonehenge is a--

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.940
 - It's like an elephant graveyard kind of thing.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.380
 - Yeah, it's a mammoth bone circle in Russia.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.300
 - Oh, wow. - Made about 20,000 years ago.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.340
 Very cool. - Wow.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.660
 - Skonhenge.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.460
 (audience laughing)

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.060
 - Is that as in scones?

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.660
 - It's pronounced Skonhenge, that's correct.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.260
 That's a restaurant in California.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.580
 (audience laughing)

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.100
 There was the time when Queen Elizabeth

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.340
 was beamed onto the stones for her jubilee.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.340
 - What, is there a word for it?

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.180
 - Thronehenge.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.500
 - Ah, damn it.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.460
 - And Ireland is home to a historic site

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.380
 that was found by someone flying up an unmanned aerial vehicle.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.220
 (audience laughing)

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.940
 - Would it by any chance be Dronehenge?

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.820
 - Dronehenge!

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.660
 - Amazing.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.140
 - So it is, it's still a mystery, isn't it?

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.940
 Stonehenge, where the stones come from.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.940
 There's always new reports.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.380
 They suddenly think that some of the stones are from Wales.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.740
 - I think they've always thought from Wales.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.700
 - Sorry, from Scotland.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.740
 - Yeah, that's the huge news, isn't it?

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.620
 - That's the big news, but recently they thought,

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.780
 why don't we try and see if the method

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.220
 of laying them down on sleds over logs

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.300
 is something that is achievable?

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.900
 And the result was they discovered

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.860
 it's just incredibly easy to do that.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.180
 (audience laughing)

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.140
 10 people can pull the stones in a very,

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.980
 it's a slow manner,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.180
 but it's not as taxing as we thought it was.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.580
 - We've just given these guys so much credit

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.820
 for hundreds of years, it's piece of piss.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.580
 - Do you know we found the original tape measures

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.260
 that were probably used for Stonehenge?

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.100
 - No, we don't.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.540
 - We have, this is so cool, okay?

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.380
 - What?

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.460
 - They're called the Folkton Drums,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.340
 and they're big stone cylinders carved from solid chalk,

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.420
 right, and they are massive.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.060
 They're about 5,000 years old,

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.900
 and each of them is a particular size,

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.980
 so that if it goes around once, for example,

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.300
 it's a number of multiples of 3.2 meters,

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.860
 and that measurement crops up everywhere,

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.940
 so we think those are the sort of tape measures

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.700
 of the gods, and they could send off to Wales,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.400
 saying, can you bring me a stone that's this big,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.020
 according to the drums,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.940
 and they'll send back something

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.220
 that's the right size for you.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.060
 - How cool is that?

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.420
 - What if it was just like an earthquake,

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.500
 and they landed like that?

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.340
 - Yeah.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.340
 (audience laughing)

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.940
 - Yeah, I mean, that's a good,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.100
 in many ways, an easier theory for us all, isn't it?

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.260
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.620
 - Older than Stonehenge is New Grange.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.340
 In fact, I feel like your fact could have been

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.460
 New Grange is not new, yeah.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.580
 - Oh, right, yeah, it's very old.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.260
 - But they've recently, yeah, very old,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.260
 older than Stonehenge,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.460
 they've recently done some DNA tests.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.300
 - What is it for international?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.460
 - Oh, sorry, for international listeners.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.140
 - And for those who maybe didn't do that better than reading?

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.540
 (audience laughing)

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.380
 - It's a huge, like a huge barrow,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.780
 it's a huge earth mat under the middle of Ireland,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.580
 which was probably a burial site, we think,

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.100
 'cause they found some bodies in there,

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.940
 and they've done some DNA tests,

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.780
 and they found that there was a lot of incest going on.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.980
 And what they reckon is,

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.580
 it was a bit like, you know, in ancient Egypt,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.740
 how all the kings and queens married each other,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.580
 and then, you know,

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.980
 their children married each other and stuff like that.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.900
 They reckon there was a lot of that in Ireland at the time.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.900
 (audience laughing)

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.860
 - Just one person cheering,

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.500
 and a very worried-looking sister next to him.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.500
 (audience laughing)

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.100
 - His mum and his sister and his cousin have all come along,

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.940
 but thankfully they're all in the same seat.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.260
 (audience laughing)

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.580
 - Sorry.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.540
 - Childish.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.620
 - But yeah, it's really interesting now,

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:12.180
 because it implies a really elite system

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.220
 of almost like pharaohs in Ireland.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.060
 - Wow, cool.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.100
 - And that's also where they found Dronehenge, isn't it?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.740
 - Yes, they found Dronehenge near thereabouts

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.220
 where that bloke found Dronehenge,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.620
 and he's now published a book,

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.340
 The Story Behind the Remarkable Neolithic Discovery,

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.860
 about the events following the day he found it,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.260
 and how the world's media descended on him.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.020
 And I encourage you to look up the accounts,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.060
 because I don't know how much it was

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.700
 headline news all around the world,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.260
 (audience laughing)

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.820
 as is claimed in the book.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.220
 - I got one last thing,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.060
 which is that I've always wanted to go to Stonehenge.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.260
 I've never been, and as part of this research,

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.340
 I thought, oh, I wonder if it's on TripAdvisor.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.660
 And it turns out it is,

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.940
 and it has a lot of one-star reviews.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.500
 - No. - Yeah.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.820
 So this is one,

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.940
 this is one going as back as 2014.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.460
 I was disgusted to find that this was just

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.140
 a few rocks to look at.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.980
 (audience laughing)

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.060
 Nothing to do, they should knock it down

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.660
 and build an arcade or a fun fair.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.380
 Don't waste your time, what a silly place.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.060
 And then, August of 2023, someone wrote,

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.980
 "I expected so much more than just stones placed

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.180
 "in a circle.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.740
 "As a World Heritage site, at the very least,

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.940
 "I would have expected an ice cream van."

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.820
 (audience laughing)

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.960
 I didn't fight the war for this.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.140
 (audience laughing)

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.460
 - Next review. - Next review.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.180
 - Not even a henge.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.180
 (audience laughing)

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.760
 (upbeat music)

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.940
 - It is time for fact number three,

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.980
 and that is Anne.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.700
 - My fact this week is that

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.820
 the sport with the highest rate of concussion

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.260
 is synchronized swimming.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.180
 - Is that 'cause one of the swimmers bangs their head

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.460
 and everyone has to copy them?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.460
 (audience laughing)

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.740
 - It's a funny line, James,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.860
 but it's a fundamental misunderstanding

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.020
 of synchronized swimming.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.380
 We'll come on to that.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.740
 But I should caveat this by saying,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.180
 this is based on my reading

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.740
 and not actual academic comparative studies.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.420
 But I have surmised this

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.300
 from a lot that I've read about synchronized swimming.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.060
 It's extremely dangerous.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.620
 So I was reading an account of Bill Moreau,

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.500
 who was the Vice President of Sports Medicine

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.860
 for the US Olympic Committee between 2009 and 2019.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.500
 And he supervised lots of sports

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.940
 for safety and health concerns.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.700
 And he supervised synchronized swimming.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.380
 And in a two week training camp,

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.780
 he said 50% of the team sustained a concussion.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.500
 And that surpassed NFL and Aussie rules football.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.920
 - Are they, is that team just really shit?

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.700
 (audience laughing)

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.220
 Like, what are they, they must be,

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.340
 'cause they can't be hitting the bottom of the pool.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.180
 - Okay, it's not allowed.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.660
 - You're not allowed, it's just knocking heads, isn't it?

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.500
 - Yeah.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.320
 - It's crazy.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.340
 Well, they keep on trying to make it better

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.700
 and better and better and better and better,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.460
 which means getting in tighter and tighter

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.700
 and tighter to each other.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.420
 And you're flailing around

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.460
 and you're upside down and you're kicking

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.180
 and you just bang heads or kick each other

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.540
 in the face all the time.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.700
 - Absolutely, it's colliding with each other.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.660
 - Sometimes I read an account from one of them

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.900
 who, I think one of them broke another's nose accidentally

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.260
 with a stray, you know, hand or foot or whatever

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.020
 and they didn't notice.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.340
 - Well, 'cause you're so, they're so focused on the routine.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.300
 - Yeah, you're doing your job.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.140
 Here's the thing.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.740
 (audience laughing)

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.420
 - Sorry, but if I punched you the nose right now,

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.020
 you wouldn't continue with this fact.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.740
 - I'm a pro, I would continue on.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.380
 There's a photo for the audience at home

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.300
 that's sitting behind us.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.140
 And what you can see on the photo here

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.620
 is that the team is about to lob

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.140
 one of their members up into the air right.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.380
 And the thing is in synchronized swimming,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.380
 you aren't allowed to touch the bottom right.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.380
 So the amount of kicking that you need to do

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.220
 in order to get them up into the air

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.620
 purely from swimming.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.460
 - It's insane.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.300
 - It's nuts, yeah.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.860
 - I would think that they would breed

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.700
 synchronized swimmers who are just very tall

00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.980
 so they can touch the bottom.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.580
 But that is apparently not how the sport works.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.420
 - It's not, yeah.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.660
 - No, it's against the rules.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.180
 They're completely pointless and you wouldn't work.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.940
 But this photo and the idea that they are kicking

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.180
 madly underwater to sustain this beautiful performance

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.060
 above the water is epitomized by Sarah Oek

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.740
 who was a great synchronized swimmer

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.980
 who actually got kicked in the head and concussed

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.300
 and spent three years recuperating from that.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.460
 And so retired.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.260
 But she said, "We make it look pretty above the water

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.260
 but below it's a battlefield."

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.860
 And it is like underwater, it's mad.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.260
 And there are lots of studies into concussion

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.500
 in other sports.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.420
 The rugby is often cited as the worst.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.740
 That's three concussions per 1,000

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.780
 kind of athletic exposures, which is one person in one game.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.380
 But reading about synchronized swimming,

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.900
 there was Miriam Glez, who is the chief executive

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.740
 of USA Syncro, which is their national organizing body,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.940
 said, "100% of my athletes will get a concussion

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.060
 at some point."

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.700
 And it is just crashing into and falling on each other.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.700
 - They have helmets.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.220
 - Well, they do in practice.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.060
 - But do they?

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.020
 - They wear practice helmets.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.580
 - Yeah, they're made of silicon

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.580
 and they've got like a honeycomb style make-up to them.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.620
 Yeah, very tasty, right?

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.940
 Have a lick while you're down there.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.300
 (audience laughing)

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:16.300
 - Don't ever, don't ever, ever, ever say that again.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.700
 (audience laughing)

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.500
 - Obviously you can't see what's going on

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.300
 under the water, but I don't think.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.140
 - I think that's, the judges would come down

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.980
 very hard on that.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.820
 - Thanks.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.660
 (audience laughing)

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.140
 - As long as they have some jump-up, it's all right.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.420
 - That is the thing, we're looking at the photo right now.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.020
 Doesn't look very synchronized, does it, right?

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.300
 And that's the thing, we're saying synchronized swimming.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.060
 It's artistic swimming.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.500
 So it's not, synchronized has gone out as a term.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.820
 - But also, you were never synchronized with each other.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.580
 You were synchronized with the music.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.420
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.980
 - Which is why you can have solo synchronized swimming.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.380
 I have an opinion, which is that,

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.460
 I think this is a better sport under the water

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.700
 than it is on top.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.540
 - Ah, yes.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.380
 - Whoa.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.220
 - Yeah, yeah, great.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.260
 - So you see the effort that goes in

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.740
 and there are sometimes cameras under the water

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.140
 and you can just see the furious effort that's going in.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.500
 And I think it's probably the only sport

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.180
 where if you film it in a different medium,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.620
 it's, I don't, I'm not sure what I'm trying to say.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.260
 - I think it looks, it looks like shit.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.340
 - It's the only sport that takes place

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.180
 between two forms of matter, right?

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.620
 - Well, half of you are all swimming.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.460
 - All swimming.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.300
 - All diving for sure.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.140
 - All swimming.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.980
 - All diving.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.820
 - Okay.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.660
 - Okay.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.500
 - Now, gradually diving.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.860
 - What's the one, water polo,

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:25.780
 where they've got the ball?

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.620
 - Yeah.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.460
 - Yeah.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.060
 - That is crazy underneath

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.780
 because they're literally like kicking and punching

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.180
 and yeah, everything.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.700
 - I think to give Andy credit,

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.820
 I think diving isn't the same

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.860
 'cause diving ends once you enter the water, right?

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.020
 And synchronized swimming is constantly taking part

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.820
 in both media.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:42.660
 - Thank you.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.780
 - And there you go.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.740
 - So like, there's no sport

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.540
 where half of your body is encased in solid

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.700
 and half of you is in plasma.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.500
 It just doesn't happen.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.100
 So I think that's what makes it interesting.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.940
 - That is true.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.220
 - And people pass out quite regularly

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.300
 'cause again, 'cause so much of it is under water,

00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.300
 you have to be holding your breath

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.700
 a huge amount of the time

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.540
 and holding your breath

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.580
 while exerting yourself enormously.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.220
 And this is another reason why the concussion issue

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.940
 in synchronized swimming is such a thing

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.220
 is that it's probably extremely under-reported

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.100
 because the symptoms of concussion

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.480
 are very similar to the symptoms of swimming upside down

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.580
 whilst holding your breath

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.380
 whilst having to fling people out of the air quite a lot.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.540
 So imagine doing that.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.980
 You're there going, am I concussed or is this just

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.900
 how you feel when you're doing this mad thing?

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.820
 - That's so funny.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.660
 - Yeah.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.500
 - And then the training,

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.900
 I mean, the training is incredibly stressful

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.140
 and there's a lot of it.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:32.980
 But one of the things they do

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.040
 is they do crossfit workouts with their mouths taped

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.060
 because they have to hold their breath under water

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.220
 for like up to two minutes.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.100
 And 'cause there's so much exertion,

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.820
 they have to not just get fit

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.260
 but be able to do these things while holding their breath.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.660
 So they'll take the mouths and do some crossfit.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.700
 - I can breathe with my nose.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.540
 So, in your face.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.980
 - I believe they probably take the nose as well.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.820
 - I think they probably do.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.020
 - So, and this is another sort of like cruel intensity

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:00.860
 about it.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.340
 They're not allowed to wear swimming goggles.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.180
 - Yeah.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.020
 - No, it's not in the final thing.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.300
 - Yeah, 'cause the judges want to see their expression.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.860
 So the goggles aren't allowed to be there.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.380
 And as a result, they get really irritated eyes.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.580
 And so a lot of synchronized or artistic swimmers

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.540
 bathe their eyes in milk.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.020
 'Cause apparently milk is very good for, yeah.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.380
 - And is that, that's not recommended

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.820
 from the 17th century handbooks.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.980
 That's a genuine.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.500
 - That's Blaise Pascal says.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.620
 (laughing)

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.300
 Like you say, they want to see their eyes.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.300
 They want to see their expressions.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.860
 They want to see them smiling.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.580
 And if you speak to any synchronized swimmer,

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.860
 they all say that the smile is fake.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.180
 And the reason they're smiling is to kind of height the pain.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.260
 It's kind of a grimace.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.460
 'Cause the pain is so bad.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.220
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure."

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.780
 (laughing)

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.300
 - I mean, all of these reports about how tough it is

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.340
 to come from synchronized swimmers.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.180
 - True.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.020
 - Yeah, but I mean--

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.860
 - I'm just saying--

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.700
 (laughing)

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.620
 - How would the power left us?

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.460
 No.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.060
 (laughing)

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.100
 - It does obviously incredibly hard.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.940
 And obviously, if you come out of the water,

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.020
 your natural instinct is to rub your face

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.340
 and get the water out of your eyes.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.740
 And you're not allowed to do that

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.460
 because you have to be looking at the judges.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.340
 And I think you meant to maintain eye contact

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.020
 with the judges, with water in your eyes,

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.020
 'cause you're mostly blind,

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.980
 because you're not wearing your--

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.820
 - It's crazy.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.260
 - It's really, it is very hard.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.460
 I take back my comment.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.500
 Please don't email him.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.820
 (laughing)

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.260
 - And it, well, it is this very interesting thing,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.860
 which has a long history,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.460
 sort of kicked off officially in the 1890s.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.700
 And was about looking good.

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.820
 It was only men who were allowed to do it at first.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.300
 And almost immediately,

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.780
 people realized that women were much better candidates for it,

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.180
 because A, we have much more fat on our body,

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.460
 so we're more buoyant.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.740
 And B, people wanna look at women in swimsuits,

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.540
 doing really pretty things.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.500
 And so, it's meant to be this display

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.740
 of aesthetic brilliance.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.660
 But you do have these weird standards,

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.780
 like the hair gel is amazing,

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.140
 that they have to wear on their hair

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.780
 to keep it looking completely,

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.940
 staying completely still in the water and looking great.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.540
 So, the way they do their hair is called noxing,

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:05.660
 with a K, K-N-O-X, and like, Fort Knox.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.780
 And it's because it's using nox gelatin,

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.500
 which is a thing that's used to make jelly in cooking.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.780
 - Especially in America, I think,

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.020
 it's like the main brand of gelatin.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.860
 - Is it?

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.180
 Okay, okay, so there you go.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.620
 So it's like industrial strength,

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.660
 and you spread this paste onto your head,

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.780
 and it basically solidifies your hair,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.460
 so it can't move, and it's rock solid.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.460
 And then you go in.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:33.020
 - Nox, by the way, was run by a woman called Rose Nox,

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.500
 who made this gelatin.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.500
 She was married to another guy who died,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.580
 and then she took over the business.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.060
 The first day she took over,

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.020
 she closed the back door of the factory,

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.420
 which previously all the women

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.500
 had to go into a different door than all the men,

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.860
 which was kind of a thing that did happen occasionally

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.100
 in factories in America. - Really?

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.700
 - Yeah, 'cause they didn't want them mixing

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.060
 'cause they thought they wouldn't do any work

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.220
 if they were flirting the whole time.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.300
 She made a five-day week for her workers

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.180
 and gave them two weeks of paid vacation,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.820
 which really no one else was doing at the time.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.700
 And she wrote a book.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.100
 Her book was called "Seventy Easy Delicious Desserts"

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.300
 made from sparkling carb's foot gelatin.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.860
 - No way! - Really?

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.380
 - Sounds like a great book, though.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.220
 - So nice.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.500
 Did you guys hear of Esther Williams

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.340
 in the course of the film?

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.020
 - The movie star? - She was very cool.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.420
 She was a movie star who swam at the very elaborate routines.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.900
 In the sort of '40s and '50s,

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.980
 there was a huge trend of aqua ballets

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.460
 and the time it must be Barclay

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.180
 and all of these amazing ballatic dance scenes.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.020
 She was great.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.740
 Her films included Neptune's Daughter,

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.460
 Million Dollar Mermaid, Dangerous When Wet.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.780
 Just cool, cool films.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.780
 And she then had an unsuccessful move

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.340
 into land-based acting.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.740
 And she was just flopping around.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.660
 - Well, there's a comedian called Fanny Bryce

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.420
 who said of her, "Wet, she's a star.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.860
 "Dry, she ain't."

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.380
 And she was very self-deprecating, though.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.500
 She said, "If they ever teach a duck to act,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.860
 "I'm in big trouble."

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.700
 She's great.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.540
 She's so cool.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.940
 She once did a 35-metre dive in a film

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.900
 playing another swimmer.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.820
 That was Million Dollar Mermaid.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.660
 She broke her neck.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.620
 She spent seven months in a body cast.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.780
 - Was that one of the land-based ones, actually?

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.380
 (upbeat music)

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:21.660
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.580
 and that is Andy.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.460
 - My fact is that early phone boxes

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.940
 came with a little man inside

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.300
 who would arrange the call for you,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.420
 then wait outside until it was over.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.260
 - Aww.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.100
 - Very nice.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.940
 - That's lovely.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:34.780
 - Why did we get rid of it?

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.060
 We could have had a really civilised time.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.100
 - Well, I guess it was because

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.660
 everyone learned how to use phones.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.900
 - Yeah.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.460
 That's true, and they didn't in the first place.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.420
 So this is really interesting.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.940
 This is from a book called--

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.100
 - Before you explain it,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.700
 when you say "little man" inside--

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.900
 - Oh, yeah.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.220
 - Like a borrower, right?

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.060
 - Yeah, like a borrower.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.660
 - A little abution?

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.500
 - No.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.380
 - He has to be small enough to fit in the phone box.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.220
 - Yeah.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.340
 I mean, phone boxes, they're quite big.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.260
 - How little was the man?

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.060
 - It's just a figure of speed.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.300
 Some of the men were probably normal

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.260
 or even above average size, all right?

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.340
 - I also, for the show we're doing in Ireland,

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.620
 we have chosen the most quintessentially

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.700
 English thing to talk about.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.380
 This will be 25 minutes on red phone boxes.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.340
 - I don't think it's any more English than Stonehenge.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:29.300
 - Very good.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.420
 - Stonehenge, built by a giant.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.580
 These phone boxes contained a little man.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.980
 - This is from a book

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.980
 which, admittedly, is called Enigmatic England.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.380
 - And it's about...

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.700
 - No, your audience!

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.220
 - It's about these very early phone boxes.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.100
 So before you have the one person

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.940
 sort of booth, you know, TARDIS style phone boxes,

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.220
 you had call stations, which are more like a garden shed.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.420
 And they first appeared in 1886.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.740
 They're incredibly old.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.500
 And there would be an attendant inside

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.500
 who would take your money, place the call,

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.500
 wait outside in whatever the weather until you've finished.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.340
 I read some reports as well that they would also lock you in

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.700
 so that you couldn't escape without paying.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.820
 - Oh, right, yeah.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.860
 - I think that was the thing, wasn't it?

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.140
 'Cause you had to pay for it,

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.020
 and they had no system of you just putting coins in

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.060
 and it knowing that you put the right amount in

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.340
 and then connecting you.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.020
 So you had to give them the money,

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.380
 and then they would sort out all the connection part.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.220
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.580
 So they had to go to a phone exchange to an operator.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.860
 It was really complicated.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.540
 And they would, I think, maybe time the call as well.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.380
 I don't know.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.020
 - Well, the first ones, actually.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.940
 So a lot of them were in post offices and shops,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.660
 the ones that didn't have little men.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.260
 So you might have it in a place

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.820
 where there was already someone there.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.140
 But the first ones were in Manchester and Liverpool in 1885.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.380
 And in this one, you would give them the money,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.500
 they would set it off,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.540
 and then it said, this was from a newspaper article,

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.260
 "A clockwork arrangement slowly moves an index finger

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.100
 "visible to the user over a graduated arc."

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.580
 So there's like a picture of someone's finger going,

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.820
 "Like the countdown clock going do-do-do-do-do-do-do."

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.260
 (laughter)

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.100
 - Really?

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.260
 - It's creepy, that, isn't it?

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.100
 - That's amazing.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.500
 - Well, I noticed with your finger there is,

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.980
 you did it anticlockwise to us,

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.900
 so it was clockwise for the audience.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:21.980
 Was that deliberate?

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.740
 - Oh, I've been working in Fierce for many years.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.820
 (laughter)

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.820
 - Oh, God, you've just reminded me of a toothache cure.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.660
 Sorry.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.500
 (laughter)

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.980
 It was to put a dead person's finger in your mouth.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.820
 - Wow!

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.260
 - And rub it on the tooth.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.100
 Sorry, that's just...

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:37.940
 - You reminded me, yeah.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.900
 - Was the finger connected to the dead person?

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.740
 - I don't think it mattered.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.580
 - Or was it just--

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.420
 (laughter)

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.020
 - But I think, for ease of use,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.740
 you would probably disconnect it.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.580
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.740
 - When was this?

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.300
 - This was the 1880s.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.700
 - It was such an exciting time,

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.820
 the 1880s, in phone land, wasn't it?

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.820
 Because it was--

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.660
 - Show us.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.500
 - What was happening?

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.340
 - Well, so--

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.780
 - The invention of the phone, pretty much.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.620
 (laughter)

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.140
 - That's a fairly seminal moment, yeah?

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.660
 - It was mostly that.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.100
 I like the fact that phone operators

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.540
 had to sort of know everyone in their area,

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.340
 because there were so few people

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.260
 who were subscribed to the telephone exchange.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.980
 As a phone operator, you'd call the operator,

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.820
 and you'd say something like,

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.100
 "Could you put me through to the doctor

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.860
 "who specifically does knee stuff?

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.940
 "I've got really sore knee."

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.620
 And as an operator, you'd need to know that doctor

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.780
 and which exchange point they were,

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.180
 and plug them into the right thing.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.300
 - Have you tried attaching a frog to the knee?

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.260
 (laughter)

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.940
 - Do you have a dead man with you?

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.860
 (laughter)

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.500
 - Yeah, the first Irish telephone exchange

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.540
 was set up in 1880,

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.020
 but it had just five customers at the time.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.860
 - Right.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.020
 - But you think there would be an even number

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.100
 so they could ring each other,

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.780
 but I guess that's not how it worked.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.740
 - Do you know, I did check the phone book in Ireland

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.780
 from that year, which is very short.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.460
 As you say, it got to about 19 or 20 customers

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.300
 by the end of the year.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.300
 One of the customers was Messier's Guinness and Sons.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.140
 - Oh, wow!

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.700
 - Yeah, they got in there,

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.780
 'cause if you need your Guinness, you need it now.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:04.620
 - Right.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.460
 - That's so funny.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.700
 They had in 1885 an invention which was,

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.020
 it was like an out of office email for phones.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.860
 - Okay.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.780
 - So if someone phoned you,

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.460
 you could let them know that you were out

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.460
 and you'd be back later.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.380
 Can you guess how that would work?

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.980
 - Sorry, so you phoned them and--

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.500
 - So you phoned me, I'm not in,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.980
 but I know that I'm gonna be back at four p.m.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.220
 So I'm gonna let you know.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.860
 - So I'm in the booth.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.700
 The finger beckons.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.860
 (laughter)

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.700
 Is that it?

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:33.860
 - No fingers involved.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.860
 - Okay.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.700
 - Oh, I know, I know,

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.540
 'cause there weren't that many phones back then,

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.380
 we're saying.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.260
 So what you would do is you would call up the operator

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.260
 and say, "Anyone who tries to call my phone,

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.100
 "can you let them know I'm out till 4.30?"

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.940
 - Very good.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:45.940
 This is an invention.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.020
 It's a finger--

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.180
 - So your phone is ringing on the desk

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.100
 and I'm away from my desk.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.940
 So I need a mechanical claw to lift the phone

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.420
 to a mechanical mouth.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.500
 - No fingers, no claws.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.060
 Employee boy, employee boy or girl?

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.340
 - I don't think that's an invention, the boy.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.500
 - The boy.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.260
 This is when the boy was invented.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.300
 - Wow, the 1880s really were amazing.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.220
 - Basically what you would do

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.940
 is if you're gonna be back at 4.00 p.m.,

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.220
 as someone called, no one would answer it.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.580
 It would just go click, click, click, click,

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.820
 and then would hang up.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.540
 And then they knew that you had to phone back at 4.00 p.m.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.380
 - Clever.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.220
 - Isn't that clever?

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.060
 - That is.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:24.900
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.740
 - That's very cool.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.900
 - The Bristol Mercury, I read about this invention,

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.260
 they said this will be the most useful invention

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.660
 of the time.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.620
 - Right.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:32.740
 - They were sure.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.860
 - This was a useful invention,

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.060
 jumping a bit forward to 1905,

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.060
 and there was a guy who was called Almond Stroger,

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.420
 and he ran a funeral home in Kansas City,

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.740
 and he invented the Stroger Pop Belly candlestick phone,

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.580
 and he invented it.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.020
 - It's still a catchy name.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.080
 - 'Cause the candlestick is where you have that bit,

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.780
 you pull by your ear, and then you hang it up,

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.420
 and it sticks up by like a candlestick.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.620
 - Yeah, if you look at it, it does look like a candlestick,

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.060
 yeah, or a candlestick holder rather.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.300
 But the reason he invented it

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.260
 is because he worked in the funeral business,

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.500
 and any time someone was calling up,

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.860
 there was an operator whose husband

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.740
 ran a rival funeral home,

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.260
 and she kept putting it through to their home.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.460
 Yeah, and he was like, I'm losing all my business,

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.740
 'cause she works on the inside,

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.060
 she's feeding it to the wrong place,

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.640
 so he's like, I'm gonna innovate the telephone,

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.620
 and he did with numbers.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.540
 - Someone's stolen the finger from my husband, wasn't he?

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.340
 - Hang on, 'cause I was about to say,

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.740
 that's the best fact you've ever told me,

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.980
 and were you about to say, so the story goes?

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:29.820
 - Yes.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.820
 (audience laughing)

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.620
 - Why do you do this to us?

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.860
 - Well, no, because it's just covering my tracks, you know?

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.060
 It's a, that is the story that that was the--

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.620
 - It's a fantastic story.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.380
 - It's a great story. - Oh, dear.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.540
 In 1915, a three-minute call

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.620
 between New York and San Francisco

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.140
 cost the equivalent today of $500.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.340
 - Wow. - Three, wow.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.180
 - Yeah.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.060
 - These first ones, the ones that you were talking about

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.580
 were three pence for three minutes.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.900
 - That's very good. - Yeah, yeah.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.460
 - Well, a lot of, it was for business only,

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.100
 that was the thing, phones were for business,

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.620
 they were for Guinness and Sons to place orders

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.740
 or talk to their merchants or whatever,

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.620
 and there were warnings in the early phone

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.460
 that I'm quoting now, a document that said,

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.300
 "It should not be used for the exchange of twaddle

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.760
 "between foolish women."

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.900
 (audience laughing)

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.300
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.020
 No, and again, in 1909, one phone company manager

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.780
 found that 30% of all calls were idle gossip,

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.500
 and this was very frowned on because phones were,

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.820
 you know, rare and precious,

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.860
 and so they should only be for business and all that,

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.300
 and then gradually phone company bosses started realizing,

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.480
 oh, well, probably quite useful if people are speaking

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.320
 on their phone for a long time.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.700
 - I think also, 'cause it clogged up the lines, didn't it?

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.060
 Basically, if you were talking your twaddle to someone,

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.580
 it meant that other people might not be able

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.740
 to use the lines 'cause there weren't that many of them.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.580
 Eventually, we got the automatic payphone

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.220
 where people could put coins in.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.060
 - Oh, yeah.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.140
 - So we had bad news for the little men.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.700
 (audience laughing)

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.100
 - A lot of little guys.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.820
 - Unimplied all around the country.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.420
 - Putting out little signs.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.020
 (audience laughing)

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.220
 - But this was invented by William Gray,

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.820
 and his original invention is very clever.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.300
 So you have the thing that you talk into,

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.820
 and there was a little bit of metal near the microphone,

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.060
 and whenever you put the money in,

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.860
 the little bit of metal slid out of the way

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.360
 so you'd be able to talk,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.820
 and then as soon as your money ran out,

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.300
 it would slide back into place,

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.580
 so you wouldn't be able to hear the many of them.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.260
 - Ooh, nice little chat guillotine.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.100
 - Isn't that cool?

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:21.940
 - That is cool.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.020
 - It's really cool.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.140
 - He also invented the chest protector

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.860
 for baseball catchers.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.500
 - Oh, that big, like, buff looking thing that they wear.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.220
 - Yeah, the thing that protects the chest.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.060
 - Yeah.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.580
 (audience laughing)

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:35.980
 - It's just two weird things to invent, isn't it?

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.820
 - It is.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.580
 - Here's a little quiz from a California phone manual

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.420
 in the early days.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.340
 I think this is the early 1900s.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.480
 Keep your what out of the opening of the phone?

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.660
 (audience laughing)

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.660
 - Keep your twaddle.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.800
 - Let's keep these.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.260
 - What's the opening of the phone?

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.980
 - Whether your mouth is.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.820
 - Keep your tongue out?

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.660
 - Oh.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.500
 - Keep your tongue out?

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.340
 Well, yes, but no.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.220
 - I'm just thinking, like, what is close by.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.540
 - Who's using phones at this time?

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.700
 - Yeah, keep your nose out.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.980
 - saliva, saliva.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.100
 (audience laughing)

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.660
 - Yeah, no, this is a manly thing.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.500
 - Oh, it's a manly thing?

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.340
 - Yeah.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.180
 - Okay, penis.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.300
 (audience laughing)

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.780
 - James, moustache.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:16.100
 (audience laughing)

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.820
 Why on earth would you put your penis

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.100
 into the mouthpiece?

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.080
 (audience laughing)

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.420
 - I can't help but think of a penis.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.000
 - I can't believe you would think of a penis.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.080
 That's disgraceful.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.580
 Oh, James, I'm really disappointed.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.040
 (audience laughing)

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.400
 - So that was a phone manual.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.480
 How to use a phone.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.480
 I just had a thing on a phone book,

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.880
 which is, you know, another phone-related book.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.680
 (audience laughing)

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.700
 That's the link.

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.200
 (audience laughing)

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.240
 I just really like this.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.000
 This is someone found this randomly a few years ago.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.120
 They lived in Idaho,

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.680
 and they wondered what would happen

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.320
 if you looked up Adam West.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.160
 You remember Adam West?

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.000
 - Batman.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:57.820
 - He died recently.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.640
 He was Batman.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.640
 - He died?

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.080
 - I'm just, God, this is a big moment.

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:01.920
 - Did he?

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.080
 (audience laughing)

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.740
 - Quite recently, the last couple of years, I think.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.580
 - Gosh.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.320
 - He was tied to a huge vat of acid.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.320
 (audience laughing)

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.840
 - Anyway, this random guy on the internet

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.680
 found out that he just idly looked up Adam West

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.680
 in the phone book.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.440
 And the message in the phone book read in Idaho,

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.200
 'cause Adam West lived in Idaho when he died,

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:29.800
 the message read, "See Wayne, Bruce, Brackett's millionaire."

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:30.640
 - No, literally.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.480
 - And so, you went to that listing in the phone book,

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.320
 and then it said, "Please consult crime fighters

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.320
 "in the yellow pages."

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.160
 And then,

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.720
 (audience laughing)

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.920
 you went to that listing in the yellow pages,

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.440
 and it said, "See Batman, white pages."

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.440
 And then you went to that listing,

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.960
 and it sent you back to Adam West in the phone book.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.800
 - Oh, okay, I need to end us here.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.800
 And that is it for our show tonight.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.480
 Thank you, Dublin, so much for being here.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.320
 (audience cheering)

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.960
 That is all our facts.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.840
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.080
 We will see you then.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:05.920
 Good bye!

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.920
 (audience cheering)

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.500
 (upbeat music)

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.840
 (upbeat music)

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.420
 (upbeat music)

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:27.420
