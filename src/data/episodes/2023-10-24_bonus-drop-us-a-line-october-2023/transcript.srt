1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 [phone ringing]

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,000
 [music playing]

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 [music playing]

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Hi!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 No, James, you can't just jump in and say hi.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Why not?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Because it's my thing.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Oh.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 I'm saying hi.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Sorry.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 It's my thing.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [laughter]

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 If you ever see Andy in the street, don't say hi to him.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Because he'll get very offended and say, "That's my thing."

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 You wait.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'll say hi to you.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [laughter]

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hi, everybody.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Welcome to Drop Us Align, the regular audience feedback section of No Such Thing as a Fish,

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 where we hear you.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You know, normally you hear us, and this is us hearing you, your voices.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 [laughter]

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So that's-- and what they've mostly got to say is, "You're wrong about these things."

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 We're recording in the morning again.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I don't know if any listeners can tell.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 [laughter]

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We are.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 [laughter]

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 They're probably like, "Oh, was that the sound of the milkman coming past?"

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 In that silence that we are left.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Weirdly, I genuinely paused to listen to if there was someone to go, "Yeah, we could notice."

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Like, a clock strikes at six, but in a way that shows that it's six in the morning, not

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 six in the evening.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Dan, it's not the morning where you are.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Exactly.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I'm time-travelling here, because actually, I'm recording at seven p.m. in the evening,

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 because I'm in Sydney, Australia.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I'm back home.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 This is our first cross-hemispheric edition of Drop Us Align.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 That's exciting.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 True.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Can we start with an email from Lauren Philpot?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Oh, yeah.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 That's an old name.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 That's a familiar name.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 We know Lauren.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Yeah.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Lauren says, "Hey, fish team.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I have just found out a thing I think you might appreciate.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Tortoise's drink through their dicks."

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Right.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,120
 And she goes on, "I remember a conversation on your podcast about Buddhist monks doing

53
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
 that.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,640
 Brackets, Dan, maybe on more than one occasion.

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,000
 Now, I don't remember us ever making that claim."

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,240
 I mean, it sounds like something I would have said, but I can't quite place it.

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,600
 I don't think we have said that, actually.

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,760
 My memory doesn't stretch to it anyway.

59
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,920
 Do you know what I want to suggest that maybe what Lauren is thinking is we've often mentioned

60
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,600
 facts about how the navigation of, where is it, James?

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
 Oh, the South Pacific Islands.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,600
 Yeah, is how they would dip their testicles into the current, into the water as a way

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,880
 of finding their way in a direction.

64
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,160
 I just wonder if, because we've mentioned that a couple of times.

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,440
 And anyway, Lauren goes, "I was just researching tortoise bathing because I have two of my

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,680
 own, and I wanted to make sure I'm doing it right, and I've had them for 18 months, and

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,000
 this is definitely not the first time I've researched bathing them, but I found a WikiHell

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,400
 article saying they rehydrate in the bath by absorbing water through their cloaca."

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,640
 Oh, that's good.

70
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
 Yeah.

71
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,360
 So, to argue a cloaca is not the same as a dick.

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,080
 It's a genital opening, isn't it?

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
 Oh, yeah.

74
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
 Yeah.

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
 It's definitely that.

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
 They've got that in common.

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,840
 I wonder if, because I think we've said, maybe we haven't said before, but maybe if we haven't

78
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 said it before, Lauren's probably not basing it on this, but if we have, then she might

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
 be.

80
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,400
 We've talked about Buddhist monks who have the ability to control their body temperature

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,360
 to such an extent that they can drive their own laundry by sitting under a wet sheet, and

82
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
 it starts to steam because they've got such mental control.

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,440
 That's a big leap to then get to drinking through your dick.

84
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,440
 I think we're trying very hard to work out what that could possibly be.

85
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,840
 That's a real thing, by the way, isn't it?

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,680
 They literally raise their temperature up so that you could hang a wet sock on them,

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
 and an hour later, it'll be dry.

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,800
 It will be disrespectful to their religion, I think.

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,680
 But yes, unless they've gone into business with it, unless this is a new system.

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,000
 I'm not sure how true it is.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,400
 I don't think the one hour would work.

92
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,560
 I don't think they can raise their temperature to, let's say, 65 degrees.

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
 That's a quick amount.

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,520
 I think they can probably raise it to about the maximum that human temperature could go.

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,680
 You'd need a super monk for the hour.

96
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,920
 It's getting colder in the UK at the moment, because winter's coming.

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
 The laundry is starting to take appreciably longer to dry.

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,720
 I think we've had our last really good drying weather of the year, and it would be amazing

99
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,080
 to just sit under all your wet laundry and go, "Ugh!"

100
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,640
 Or bring a monk in, just grab a monk, since the dissolution of the monasteries, they've

101
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
 not got anywhere else to go.

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,000
 Do you think the Franciscans also could do it, and the Benedictines and all of that lot?

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,960
 Yeah, it feels like a holy thing to do.

104
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,440
 It's all monks could do it.

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,840
 I'm not saying that one religion is the correct religion.

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,480
 But you are saying that all monks can dry laundry on themselves, and actually that's

107
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
 nicely balanced.

108
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
 Yeah, exactly.

109
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
 All right.

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
 Well, thank you, Lauren.

111
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
 I think we've got to the bottom of that one.

112
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
 Pretty clearly.

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
 No, we don't know.

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 I'm sorry.

115
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,080
 I don't think we said monks could drink through their penises.

116
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,520
 No, I think one of the three of us would remember it, if we did.

117
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,440
 But maybe because we all memorise different parts of the history of fish, maybe it's

118
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,680
 one of the things that Anna remembers, but I don't think we did do that.

119
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
 Imagine bath time at the monastery.

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
 You don't need to let the plugs out.

121
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
 You just...

122
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,880
 Well, half the water's boiling away, and the other half has been sucked up the decks.

123
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,440
 If you don't want to drink bath water, no one does that, regardless, let alone through

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,520
 your dick, unless there's a filtration system.

125
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
 Well, yeah.

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
 I think it's fine.

127
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 I think it's healthy.

128
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,040
 Anyway, right, we should go on to the next email.

129
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,240
 Have we talked about the Hamilton thing on Drop As A Line Before?

130
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,520
 As in the musical, I believe we haven't.

131
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,320
 As in that we predicted the musical.

132
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,560
 So, well, just in case we haven't, if we have, just kind of ignore this bit, we've got an

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,160
 email from Melly Foster saying, "I don't know if this is spicy meat or a whole new category.

134
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,040
 On low days, I listen to old episodes.

135
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,560
 Take from that what you will."

136
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,520
 That's completely fine.

137
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,680
 In the episode called No Such Thing as a Magic Camel Filter, 23rd minute, James mentions

138
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,600
 Hamilton, Ohio.

139
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,400
 Hamilton has an exclamation mark, to which Andy replies, "It sounds like a musical."

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,920
 This episode is dated 14th August, 2014.

141
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,120
 Hamilton, exclamation mark, a hit musical, premiered on the 17th of February, 2015.

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,960
 Is esteemed composer and lyricist Lin Manuel Miranda in Club Fish, or are you all actually

143
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,520
 the team behind the hits?

144
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,400
 Have I blown this shit wide open by Ellie?

145
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,520
 Yeah, we did know about that.

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,960
 And I think we've been on record in interviews saying that we actually predicted Hamilton

147
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,400
 the musical, even though our musical was about a small town in Ohio and Lin Manuel Miranda

148
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
 said something about it.

149
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,940
 Imagine the success he could have had had he got the right Hamilton musical instead

150
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,160
 of this Alexander guy.

151
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
 Yeah.

152
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,320
 Well, we all know as well that he chose the wrong founding father, didn't he, for his

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 musical.

154
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,600
 Definitely, the right person would have been Gouverneur Morris, who died after putting

155
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 a whale bone up his penis.

156
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
 It was actually going to dislodge some bathwater.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 That was the thing.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 That was the problem.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 He mistook it for a straw.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 He thought it was his straw.

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,640
 He was trying to suck out the rest of his cocktail.

162
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,080
 But like that, very obviously, would be a better musical.

163
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 I don't know why he went for Hamilton.

164
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,560
 Oh, that was great.

165
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,080
 Yeah, no, I think we were aware of that.

166
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,520
 I don't know if it is spicy meat, just to go back to the category.

167
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,560
 I think if it is spicy meat, it's very, very old spicy meat.

168
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,760
 Yeah, I actually don't remember what spicy meat means.

169
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
 Me too.

170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
 It just words to me now.

171
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
 Me too.

172
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
 What does it mean anything?

173
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
 No.

174
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
 No.

175
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,420
 I've put such love and care into this categorization system.

176
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,200
 Every email gets its own category.

177
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,360
 I'm up to like 900 categories now because they don't all fit it neatly.

178
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
 Right.

179
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,880
 Spicy meat, I think, is controversy.

180
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,280
 Ooh, you know, it's where maybe there's a disagreement between us or between us and

181
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,400
 the facts or there's some element of, you know, personal, I think I got it from beef,

182
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
 you know, personal beef.

183
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
 Yeah.

184
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,680
 Here's one thing to say about this Hamilton musical thing, because it has come up a few

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,520
 times, which is for the sake of just throwing facts into this argument, Lin-Manuel Miranda

186
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,200
 premiered the song Alexander Hamilton, which opens the musical at the White House in front

187
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
 of Obama in 2009.

188
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,620
 And he said he was working on an album, but in the background he was working on the musical.

189
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,600
 So the origins of the musical go as far back as 2009.

190
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,400
 I think what we're saying here, though, is that he hadn't told anyone and we predicted

191
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,320
 that a musical on Hamilton would be a great musical.

192
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 We're not saying we voted.

193
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,240
 I'm saying that he actually used us as the idea, as the inspiration behind it.

194
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
 Okay.

195
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
 So he pivoted away.

196
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
 I don't care about your timeline.

197
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,400
 Well, James and I have been suing Lin-Manuel Miranda for like five years now and it's,

198
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,000
 we didn't want to tell you, Dan, because we wanted to, like, present you all the net

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,360
 box office receipts from Hamilton since it opened when we win them.

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,200
 It's going well, I think.

201
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,160
 Here's an email from Iceland.

202
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,240
 It's from, I'm going to try really hard to get the name right, I was going through Magnus

203
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
 Dotir.

204
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
 Wow.

205
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
 It sounded great.

206
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,800
 I actually consulted on Icelandic health about the pronunciation of that.

207
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 Why?

208
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 Sorry, why did you insult them?

209
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 They said, that's not how you pronounce it, and you said-

210
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
 Consulted?

211
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 Yes, it fucking is.

212
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 I'll consult it, sorry.

213
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,280
 And then insulted them saying, oh, thanks a lot for that pronunciation.

214
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
 Nerd.

215
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,080
 Yeah, Magnus Dotir, of course, is right, because that's daughter of Magnus, right?

216
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
 Yeah.

217
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,040
 I think I got the first one right, too.

218
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:09,640
 Anyway, Asgurther writes, hail long-time listener, first-time complainer, uh-oh.

219
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,080
 In your most recent episode, you talked a bit about Iceland, as you have done many times

220
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,600
 before, that's not the complaint.

221
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,520
 Up until now, the stuff you have said about Iceland and Icelanders has been mostly correct,

222
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,160
 which is kind of surprising, as there are so many misconceptions about the country.

223
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,760
 So far, things are going pretty well in this email, in episode 499, though, there was talk

224
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,160
 of a dating app that Icelanders use to ensure they're not dating their cousins.

225
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,000
 This is not true, and it's one of the most long-lasting untrue rumors Icelanders have

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,080
 to deal with.

227
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,920
 The app you're talking about is actually a genealogy website used by people looking

228
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 up their ancestors or historians doing research, rather than people trying to see if they're

229
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,480
 looking up with their cousins.

230
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:57,120
 Okay, well, you know, obviously, it was the "Lou Sanders" episode, and Lou had been in

231
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,960
 Iceland recently and had been told this, or possibly she might have heard it on an earlier

232
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,640
 episode of "Fish", because I think we actually have mentioned that previously, as well.

233
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
 Yeah, still do.

234
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
 Okay, that was me.

235
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
 Lou said it.

236
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
 Yeah, Lou said it.

237
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
 Lou said it this time.

238
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
 I think we have said it before.

239
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
 We have, yeah.

240
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
 Okay.

241
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,240
 Because I think we have a slight policy on Dropsline of not slamming the guests.

242
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,600
 If the guests come on and say they're usual, you know, rubbish, then we try not to read

243
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,960
 out too many emails criticizing or saying that.

244
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,400
 So no, but that's nice of you, James, to point out that we, I think, I think we have got

245
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
 that wrong in the past.

246
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 Yeah, we have.

247
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 Yeah.

248
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,680
 Okay, yeah, fair enough, Dan, do you want to, if it was you who said that?

249
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
 I'm not sure it was, but...

250
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,200
 I just sometimes think when there's a really funny gag about your country, lean into it

251
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,240
 and be part of it and just know that it's fine, there's no consequences to it.

252
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
 I think...

253
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
 Do you think...

254
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
 It's a great gag.

255
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,620
 I agree, and I do think Australians cheat at cricket all the time when you go into Sydney

256
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,920
 Town Square with a billboard on your front and embrace that joke.

257
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
 That's just not a great gag.

258
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,080
 That's the issue with that one.

259
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
 This is...

260
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,760
 I'd like the fact that Asgutha says this is one of the most long-lasting untrue rumors

261
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
 Icelanders have to deal with.

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 It's not...

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 That's...

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It can't be that long-lasting.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,360
 It only dates from the period of the app, which is recent.

266
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,240
 Well, I read recently the Vikings didn't found Iceland.

267
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,280
 That feels like the longest-running falsehood.

268
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,680
 That's true.

269
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 Given his dates to their founding, but it's a slight technicality in that the people who

270
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,360
 went to Iceland were farmers rather than ponderers.

271
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 Pillagers.

272
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,480
 So, yeah, pillagers were Vikings, but if you weren't doing any pillaging, you technically

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
 weren't Viking.

274
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,720
 I don't know if that's true.

275
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,200
 Maybe MsMagnus.ac can let us know.

276
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 I think that sounds...

277
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,960
 I mean, I think that sounds completely plausible.

278
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,240
 I do wonder whether that's stretching the definition of a rumour, as in that feels more

279
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,600
 like a historiographical problem to solve rather than some exciting goss.

280
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
 Do you think?

281
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 Okay.

282
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,840
 Yeah, that's fair enough.

283
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
 All right.

284
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,840
 So, apologies for that corrected.

285
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
 Let's have another guest slam.

286
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,320
 John Lewis writes...

287
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
 Come to my shop.

288
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
 Right?

289
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,640
 No, he must get that all the time.

290
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 He must.

291
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,200
 Do you know there's a footballer called Lenel John Lewis?

292
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
 No.

293
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 Okay.

294
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 And they sing, "Lenel John Lewis, his name is a shop."

295
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
 That's his song that they always sing to him.

296
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
 Does it only go two lines, that song?

297
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,600
 No, but the rest is unimportant.

298
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 Boring.

299
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
 Yeah.

300
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 Okay.

301
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,800
 John writes, "I believe that Anna made an error upon her return to the podcast in

302
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 episode 500."

303
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 Brilliant.

304
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,720
 "She talks about a low-pressure vacuum as being crap.

305
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,280
 I think that a low-pressure vacuum would have more 'suck' in quotes.

306
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,320
 Please ensure if you mention this on your podcast you pronounce the quotation marks

307
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,240
 as I know that vacuums do not suck because a full vacuum has a pressure of zero bar absolute

308
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,520
 and therefore a crap vacuum would have a higher pressure."

309
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 This is brilliant.

310
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
 Studying.

311
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,440
 I've never thought of it like that before, but of course that is true.

312
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,920
 So is that a vacuum in space or a vacuum in your house?

313
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,280
 If you, well, let's assume your vacuum cleaner uses a vacuum as in it creates an absence

314
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,420
 of air in one place so that the air rushes from somewhere else into that space.

315
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,280
 Then the lower that pressure is, the better the vacuum would be and the more that stuff

316
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,080
 would get quotation marks sucked into it.

317
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
 I see.

318
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,500
 And we're all pronouncing the quotation marks because we know that vacuums do not

319
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 suck.

320
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 Mmm.

321
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,120
 I'm more distracted by the fact that you called Anna a guest.

322
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,760
 You're dead meat when she's back if she hears this.

323
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,560
 I'm trying to sow the seeds of some spicy meat for when Anna's back.

324
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
 Great.

325
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
 That's what I'm trying to do.

326
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
 You know?

327
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
 That's a good idea.

328
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
 Do you think Anna has listened to any of these droppers of light?

329
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,600
 I don't think she's listened to the main show since about late 2014.

330
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,060
 I must have it because I've talked to Anna quite a lot in the recent weeks because of

331
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,820
 our book that's come out, "Everything to Play For", the QI book of sports available in all

332
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
 shops right now.

333
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,500
 Plunk corner, format point, ding, ding, ding.

334
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
 Excellent.

335
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,540
 And I told her about the next guest that's coming on who I won't mention here in case

336
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,540
 it's in the future, but in episode 502.

337
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,740
 And she said, "Oh, I might listen to that one."

338
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,420
 So that tells you all you need to know about whether she's listened to the previous ones.

339
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,840
 So apologies, John, and we'll have a word with Anna.

340
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,880
 Is that Anna Tyshinski, author of "Everything to Play For", the QI book of sports available

341
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,480
 in all bookshops now?

342
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
 That one.

343
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 Is that one?

344
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,040
 That's your second strike on Plunk Corner.

345
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
 That's fine.

346
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,200
 It's nice to have a second.

347
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
 That's two Plunk Corner.

348
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,920
 You've now completed half of a Plunk Square.

349
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,560
 So I think you can do it before the end of this recording.

350
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,240
 I'd go for a Plug Dodecai, John.

351
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
 No seriously, James.

352
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
 It sounds like a marvellous book.

353
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,680
 So let's back out of Plug Car now.

354
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
 OK.

355
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,860
 Well, let's back into yet a third guest slam.

356
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,120
 Well, more slams of guests?

357
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
 Just one more.

358
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
 One more.

359
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
 One more.

360
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,040
 And these are slam technicalities rather than slam, you know, complete disasters.

361
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,840
 Stu Randall writes, "Hannah, Hannah Fry, stated that the amount of gold on Earth is constant.

362
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,760
 However, this is not quite true.

363
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,960
 New atoms of gold are accidentally created by the persistent new Trump bombardment of

364
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,520
 the lead shielding surrounding nuclear reactors and particle accelerators."

365
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,200
 Oh, this is high quality pen and tree this week.

366
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,720
 Hannah, you idiot.

367
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,720
 You're out by an atom in your calculation.

368
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,440
 I'd love to be that guy who comes over into the audience, "Why do you call this holding

369
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
 an atom?"

370
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,680
 That is such a good fact.

371
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
 It is.

372
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,840
 I didn't know that already, but I'm so glad that I learned it and I'm going to use it

373
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,520
 whenever anyone says that fact about the amount of gold being constant.

374
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,680
 I'm 100% going to say that.

375
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,520
 Here's an audience factor of the week from Fraser Palmer, and this is a great one.

376
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
 I'm really sorry.

377
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
 I'm just going to blow my nose.

378
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,240
 Why didn't he write that in an email?

379
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,520
 He could have just blown his nose and then written the rest of the email.

380
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,280
 What a strange thing to say.

381
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,920
 Fraser writes, "Ah, that's better.

382
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,160
 Now I can type more clearly."

383
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
 Fraser and Ryan do that.

384
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,320
 "Thought I'd write in with a fact that might interest you.

385
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,520
 Recently, the winners of the Woodbridge Disflect Open Tournament, a game where partners throw

386
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,320
 Frisbees to each other to try and knock it into a bucket."

387
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,400
 I guess trying to get the Frisbee into a bucket?

388
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,360
 We'll try and knock something else into a bucket.

389
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,880
 Anyway, it was won by John Ling and Terry Malloy.

390
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,120
 Now, what's interesting about these two is that they absolutely hate each other.

391
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,720
 Supposedly, they haven't spoken to one another outside of the game since 2013, but their

392
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,080
 chemistry with the Frisbee was just too strong to break up.

393
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,000
 It's basically now a blood feud between their two families with the exception that they're

394
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,320
 really good at Disflect when they play together.

395
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,040
 It's as if Agassi and Samperas only played doubles and only played together.

396
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,120
 Isn't that good?

397
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
 That's brilliant.

398
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
 That's amazing.

399
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,120
 That's a Netflix documentary waiting to be made, isn't it?

400
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
 It so is.

401
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
 It's so is.

402
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
 I just love it.

403
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,520
 It's like a Will Ferrell movie, you know?

404
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,360
 One of those "take a sport."

405
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
 Like "Dodgeball."

406
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
 Yeah.

407
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,440
 Perhaps part of their chemistry is that one of them absolutely launches it at the other

408
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,120
 one's head because he hates them so much, and then that just means that his accuracy

409
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
 is way, way greater.

410
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
 Yes, yes.

411
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,720
 That's such a good way of doing it.

412
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
 Oh, yeah.

413
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 It's a really good sports fact.

414
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,600
 I wonder if there's anywhere else that people can get a collection of facts about interesting

415
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,120
 sports and, you know, a guide to human behavior, maybe, through the medium of sport.

416
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
 That would be interesting.

417
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,560
 I don't know of any of those.

418
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:16,480
 I only know about dystopian novels and books about weirdos.

419
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,760
 Just to stop the pylon of letters in your inbox, Andy, "Dodgeball" was Ben Stiller,

420
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
 not Will Ferrell.

421
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,080
 I'm thinking of the ice skating one which I watched, Blades of Glory, I think that was

422
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
 good.

423
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
 Blades of Glory.

424
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
 Yeah.

425
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
 Right, here we go.

426
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,480
 Here's Demian Stimpson, "Love the podcast, so I feel bad that my first contact is about

427
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
 something wrong."

428
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,980
 Oh, no.

429
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,400
 In today's episode, this is a few weeks ago, someone claimed, albeit probably repeating

430
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,960
 the study they referenced, that in Finland there is no discussion of weather.

431
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,000
 I have lived in Finland for almost a decade and speak Finnish to a reasonable standard.

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Sorry, James.

433
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,160
 You were about to say what the context of this was.

434
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:03,800
 No, only that we discussed a book by Kate Fox, I think, and she mentioned about how

435
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:10,840
 regularly people mention the weather in the UK and how even in Finland, if people are

436
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,560
 digging their way out of the snow and it's 10 foot deep snow, people don't even mention

437
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
 it.

438
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,880
 Like, what have you been doing for the last hour and a half?

439
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
 Oh, nothing.

440
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
 Well, Demian writes, "There are at least two Finnish people at work who will discuss the

441
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,920
 weather with me every day.

442
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,280
 My in-laws discuss the weather with me every time I see them.

443
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,760
 Conversations about weather in Finland are almost as common as in the UK, just less likely

444
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,840
 to be about the rain."

445
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
 Oh.

446
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
 Okay.

447
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
 Sick bird.

448
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,960
 What it sounds like to me is that Demian is British.

449
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,920
 He keeps mentioning how much it's talked about in the UK.

450
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,360
 He's now living in Finland.

451
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,320
 They're probably thinking, "This guy's missing his regular conversation.

452
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,800
 Let's start chatting weather to him because that's what he knows.

453
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
 He's British."

454
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,720
 And he's not getting a proper authentic Finnish conversation.

455
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
 This is just a theory.

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,800
 I'm not going to say it's true.

457
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
 It's a good theory.

458
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,040
 No, I agree, actually.

459
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,200
 When I was in Romania in 2016 and all people wanted to say to me is, "What do you think

460
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
 about Brexit?"

461
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,040
 But I doubt they went home, all of them, and talked about Brexit between themselves.

462
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,880
 They were just like, "Here's a weirdo English person.

463
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,760
 Let's ask him what he thinks about Brexit."

464
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,560
 And Brexit is much like weather in that it's everywhere and it's mostly bad.

465
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,440
 A little bit of satire for you there.

466
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,440
 Satire can't ask.

467
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,320
 Do you think we've been doing Drops of the Line for a year?

468
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,120
 I don't feel like a year, but do you think we've actually been recording it for, I think

469
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
 we might have done?

470
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
 Yeah, maybe.

471
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
 Have we?

472
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,840
 Because Anna was on the first few episodes of Drops of the Line.

473
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
 Oh, yeah.

474
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,920
 Must be Modna, yeah, then.

475
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,520
 So, now she's nearly back from her matinee, so, yeah.

476
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
 Okay.

477
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,880
 Are we going to do anything for our first birthday or not?

478
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,800
 I don't think so.

479
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
 Okay.

480
00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:00,360
 Imagine if we did a huge O2 arena gig just for Drops of the Line instead of our 10-year

481
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,760
 anniversary, that'll be great.

482
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,400
 Just 15 minutes of lukewarm batter.

483
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,920
 Yeah.

484
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,840
 We could build an actual spicy meat lounge or a plug corner that we go into on different

485
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
 bits of the stage.

486
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
 It's got to be epic.

487
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,000
 What do you think a spicy meat lounge is?

488
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,440
 A lounge that gives you spicy meat, sells it, or is it a lounge which is made of spicy

489
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
 meat?

490
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
 Of a latter.

491
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
 Definitely.

492
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 Oh, yeah.

493
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
 Absolutely.

495
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,480
 You've got a, like a giant pepperoni foot stool.

496
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,440
 A pepperami, chaise-long.

497
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
 Yeah.

498
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
 Yeah.

499
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
 Or a lovely pepperami, chaise-long.

500
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
 Yeah.

501
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,120
 I'd sit in that lounge.

502
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
 Great.

503
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,840
 Do you know, that's the limit of my spicy meat knowledge.

504
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,240
 Are there more?

505
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
 Biltong?

506
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
 Biltong.

507
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
 Interesting.

508
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
 Biltong can be spicy.

509
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
 It can be spiced.

510
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
 Anyway.

511
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
 Here's another.

512
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
 Yeah.

513
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
 Simon Richardson writes, just enjoying your No Such Thing as Ocean's Eleven with Puffin's

514
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 episode.

515
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 That's good.

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Oh, Craig Jenner.

517
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Yeah.

518
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,760
 And wanted to correct you ever so slightly on the Lance Armstrong fact.

519
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 Oh.

520
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
 Yeah.

521
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,520
 It was about how someone bought 10,000 of his books or something the day before he got

522
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
 done for being a drugs cheater.

523
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 Yes.

524
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,960
 And they were then left with all these books they couldn't sell.

525
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
 Yeah.

526
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,040
 Well, Simon writes, "It wasn't books the gentleman bought, it was DVDs.

527
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,200
 And the reason I know this is that he bought them from us."

528
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 Oh.

529
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,560
 And it turns out Simon Richardson is the editor of Cycling Weekly Magazine.

530
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
 That's amazing.

531
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
 That's Weekly with Two E's.

532
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,920
 It's not Cycling Weekly Magazine.

533
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,160
 He's packed up a very shallow hill.

534
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
 Yeah.

535
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
 So that's nice.

536
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,560
 It's good to know we've got illustrious listeners like that.

537
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,720
 No, that's amazing.

538
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
 Yeah, it's huge.

539
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,000
 And also, I mean, it's a double slam, isn't it?

540
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,520
 Because like obviously Lance Armstrong was cancelled, but also people don't really use

541
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
 DVDs anymore.

542
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
 So.

543
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
 So this is it.

544
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,400
 And I wrote back to Simon because I wanted more details.

545
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,720
 I was intrigued by this.

546
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,760
 And he says, "I can't remember how many it was."

547
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,560
 I asked him, "How many did this guy buy?"

548
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,280
 But we're talking in the thousands of these DVDs.

549
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,000
 We weren't shifting them because we knew what was coming, where he Armstrong, brackets

550
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,880
 everyone in Cycling knew what was coming.

551
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,280
 We were shifting them as DVDs were no longer selling.

552
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,440
 So the person who bought them not only backed the wrong rider, he backed the wrong tech

553
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
 too.

554
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
 Wow.

555
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
 I know.

556
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
 Yeah.

557
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
 It seems like a scam to me.

558
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,920
 Like as in, he knew what was coming and they got rid of them.

559
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,300
 Even if you, yeah, I don't know, like, is this the same guy who sold me those Russell

560
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,600
 Brand Beta Maxs' last week?

561
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 That's it.

562
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 Yep.

563
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
 That's it.

564
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:47,480
 Cycling Weekly, they're online shoppers, a lot of really bizarre stuff, actually.

565
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,800
 Oh, dear.

566
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 Yeah.

567
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 Yeah.

568
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 Fair enough.

569
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,040
 I've read that thing about the books in lots of different places.

570
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,480
 I feel like I've never heard of the DVDs before.

571
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
 That's really interesting.

572
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,080
 It's from the Straight from the Horses saddle, as it were.

573
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
 Yeah.

574
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,480
 Now I'm actually wondering about all those, um, those Dapper Laugh cassette tapes I bought

575
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
 from the same source.

576
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
 Dapper Laugh.

577
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
 Dapper Laugh.

578
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 Is that the best cancelled person you could think of?

579
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:25,440
 I think about Dapper Laugh quite a lot.

580
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,360
 I actually think, you know, sometimes we mentioned someone from like the 19th century

581
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,240
 and we're like, oh, maybe we're going to have to explain who they are because not everyone's

582
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
 going to know.

583
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,600
 I think Dapper Laugh is 100% a person that you're going to have to explain who they

584
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
 are.

585
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 For international listeners.

586
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
 I don't know how.

587
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
 Just for listeners.

588
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,680
 Dapper Laugh was a, he was a guy who was a comedian and then it turned out he'd recorded

589
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,840
 some rather, rather ripe stuff and it wasn't, hmm, it was all a bit, hmm, not sure about

590
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
 that.

591
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
 Yeah.

592
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,680
 It was all because of Michael Barrymore laser discs.

593
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:07,280
 This is a lovely game of matching people who've been cancelled to technologies we can't quite

594
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,680
 remember.

595
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,560
 Oh, God.

596
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,720
 Here's a riddle to end on.

597
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
 Oh, okay.

598
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,440
 Well, it's more of a mystery.

599
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,280
 It's from Mark Colfifi.

600
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,840
 Discovered your show recently and love it was listening to many episodes on our 14 hour

601
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,240
 drive from Boston to the Outer Banks in North Carolina.

602
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,480
 Oh, feels like a long drive.

603
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
 It is.

604
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,440
 In episode 488 there is a discussion on furbies.

605
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,280
 So have you or your panel ever heard of The Long Furby?

606
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 The Long Furby.

607
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
 Yeah.

608
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
 No.

609
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 Okay.

610
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
 No, I don't know.

611
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
 Is it a movie?

612
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
 Like The Long?

613
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 Goodbye.

614
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
 It's a never ending story.

615
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
 Is that?

616
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
 Yeah.

617
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
 No, it's not that.

618
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,880
 It's a natural furby that was long, like in the shape of a caterpillar or a snake or something.

619
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
 Yeah.

620
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 It's a long furby.

621
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,400
 And I think people started making their own weird long furbies.

622
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
 Okay.

623
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,480
 It's sort of a subculture online of people who make like five foot long furbies.

624
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,640
 So they still got the normal face and then it's just fluff all the way down.

625
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
 Oh, okay.

626
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,840
 That is weird.

627
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
 The dragon and never ending story looks a bit like a long furby when I picture him now.

628
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
 A luck dragon.

629
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
 Yeah.

630
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
 You're absolutely right.

631
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,320
 And it's pretty horrifying that I would say the Long Furby.

632
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 Why?

633
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
 Why?

634
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,320
 Why?

635
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
 Why Andy?

636
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
 Why did they do this?

637
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
 I'm just reading now.

638
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,200
 Long Furby is a self-proclaimed cult in quotes that is often flaunted online and sometimes

639
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,880
 practice publicly in real life.

640
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
 What is that?

641
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 Hmm.

642
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,160
 As in people like dancing around the fire with long furbies.

643
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
 Oh God.

644
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
 There's all sorts of categorizations.

645
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,360
 There's a giraffe furby which has four feet at the bottom.

646
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,520
 There's a low furby which is a bit shorter and fatter.

647
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,560
 There's a mobius which has two heads on either side of the body.

648
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
 That's incredible.

649
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
 It's distressing.

650
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,400
 If you want to distress yourself, you look up the photos of long furbies because they're

651
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
 very weird.

652
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,720
 I've got one bit of correspondence here.

653
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,920
 This was sent in actually into the public domain as a question written in by Zoe Williams.

654
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:21,040
 The question is, a list of the UK's top podcasts poses the questions, what is it with all the

655
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
 bros?

656
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:30,320
 So Zoe, Zoe would like to know why no such thing as a fish is so bro-ey.

657
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,320
 She published this in The Guardian.

658
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,020
 She wants to know why is it that if a woman is allowed, allowed onto our show, they are

659
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,640
 only there to talk about their children and relationships, preferably with their husbands

660
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
 or children.

661
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,780
 So I mean, yes, we are very laddy, Zoe.

662
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,280
 We know that.

663
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,040
 We talk about monks suckin' drinks up through the dicks.

664
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,540
 We know.

665
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,740
 That is lad.

666
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,160
 Zoe has never clearly listened to an episode of the main show.

667
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,200
 The chance that she's listening to this bit of the show is absolutely infinitesimal.

668
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,520
 Now I would say this is spicy meat.

669
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,160
 This is us being slightly slammed by, in an article in The Guardian, it's sort of drive-by

670
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,800
 slamming saying we're bros.

671
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,680
 And Dan, you really took it to heart, didn't you?

672
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,880
 Because you don't think we're bro-ey.

673
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 Oh, no.

674
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,640
 I wish we were more bro-ey.

675
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,720
 I'm just ashamed that we were so far down her list of bro-ey podcasts.

676
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,160
 No, of course we're not bro-ey.

677
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,080
 We're the least bro-ey podcast out there.

678
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,480
 Well, not the least, but...

679
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,240
 What about all of our episodes where we compare different barbecue sauces and see how many

680
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
 spicy wings we can eat?

681
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,200
 That's pretty bro-ey.

682
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,360
 I never released those ones, but we record them.

683
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,040
 We do record them.

684
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,920
 There was someone defending us on Twitter the other week when this came out.

685
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
 Oh, no.

686
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
 They said...

687
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,920
 I know what this is going to be.

688
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
 They said...

689
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
 Dan has taken this...

690
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
 I'm still furious.

691
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
 I'm still furious.

692
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,480
 Dan has taken this so much to heart, and is so upset about it.

693
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,960
 This person defended us saying they're not lads, they're not bros.

694
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,960
 Shriverland, my Twitter handle, in particular, gives off major wife-guy energy.

695
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,760
 That's who I am to them.

696
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,680
 Dan, I kid you not, anyone listening to this, this is about the fourth time I've heard Dan

697
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,320
 complaining about having been described as a wife-guy on Twitter.

698
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,560
 Can I just say to anyone listening to this, think of the person that you know in your

699
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:33,320
 friend group who is the most of a wife-guy, Dan, it just trumps them out of existence.

700
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,640
 He's the most wife-guy person you've ever met, but it just means that you love your

701
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
 wife, don't you?

702
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
 Not like me and James.

703
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
 He complains bitterly about our wives.

704
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,840
 We have to edit out so much from me and James grassing about our wives.

705
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,800
 The only thing that ever stops me from munching on a chicken wing full of barbecue sauce is

706
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
 complaining about my wife.

707
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,680
 We do our review episodes of Nuts and Zoo Magazine.

708
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:05,680
 It's a big feature of the bro episodes we do.

709
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,320
 It's a nice thing to be a wife, it's a lovely thing to be.

710
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,280
 It's nice to have never been so insulted in all my life.

711
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
 Your mistress was absolutely furious.

712
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,720
 Oh my gosh, she was fuming.

713
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
 There we go.

714
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,920
 Well, if you've got that out of your system, Dan, the complaint about our bro-iness.

715
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
 Yes.

716
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
 Yeah.

717
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
 Thank you.

718
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
 Thanks for letting me hear that.

719
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,640
 Thanks everybody next time because we're going to be comparing our Hot Wheels vehicles

720
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,000
 and taking them for a spin.

721
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,120
 We're going to be at the Monster Truck Festival.

722
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,920
 Then after that, it's gun show November.

723
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,980
 Looking forward to that.

724
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,720
 And throwing like horseshoes around little sticks.

725
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,200
 That's what they do, isn't it?

726
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 What bros?

727
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 Oh shit.

728
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
 Gun shows.

729
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
 Don't give us away.

730
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
 Is this one of your sports?

731
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
 They throw horseshoes.

732
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
 Is this one of your sports?

733
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
 Yeah.

734
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
 Brilliant new book.

735
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,040
 Everything to play for the QI Book of Sports, James.

736
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,760
 Written by the two bros themselves, James Harkin and Anatochinsky.

737
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,880
 And guest Anatochinsky, guesting in this book.

738
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,480
 That's the only thing is that Andrew is the most bro-y out of any of us.

739
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
 Oh yeah.

740
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
 Yeah.

741
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
 But thanks everybody.

742
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,840
 Thank you for listening to yourselves as reflected in our dark mirror.

743
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,080
 We'll be back in a month with another of these episodes.

744
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,320
 And we look forward to it and to hearing from you in the meantime, which you can ensure

745
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,560
 that you do by writing to podcast@QI.com.

746
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
 Bye.

747
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,060
 Slick.

748

749
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
 [Music]

750
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,060
 [Music]

751
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,640
 (upbeat music)

752
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,700
 you
