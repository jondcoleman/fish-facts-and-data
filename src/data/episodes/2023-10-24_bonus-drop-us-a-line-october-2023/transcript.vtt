 [phone ringing]

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.000
 [music playing]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 [music playing]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Hi!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 No, James, you can't just jump in and say hi.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Why not?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Because it's my thing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Oh.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 I'm saying hi.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Sorry.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 It's my thing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 [laughter]

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 If you ever see Andy in the street, don't say hi to him.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Because he'll get very offended and say, "That's my thing."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 You wait.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 I'll say hi to you.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 [laughter]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Hi, everybody.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Welcome to Drop Us Align, the regular audience feedback section of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 where we hear you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 You know, normally you hear us, and this is us hearing you, your voices.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 [laughter]

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 So that's-- and what they've mostly got to say is, "You're wrong about these things."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 We're recording in the morning again.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I don't know if any listeners can tell.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 [laughter]

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 We are.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 [laughter]

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 They're probably like, "Oh, was that the sound of the milkman coming past?"

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 In that silence that we are left.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Weirdly, I genuinely paused to listen to if there was someone to go, "Yeah, we could notice."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Like, a clock strikes at six, but in a way that shows that it's six in the morning, not

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 six in the evening.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Dan, it's not the morning where you are.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Exactly.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 I'm time-travelling here, because actually, I'm recording at seven p.m. in the evening,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 because I'm in Sydney, Australia.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I'm back home.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 This is our first cross-hemispheric edition of Drop Us Align.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 That's exciting.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 True.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Can we start with an email from Lauren Philpot?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 That's an old name.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 That's a familiar name.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 We know Lauren.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Yeah.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Lauren says, "Hey, fish team.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I have just found out a thing I think you might appreciate.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Tortoise's drink through their dicks."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Right.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.120
 And she goes on, "I remember a conversation on your podcast about Buddhist monks doing

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120
 that.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.640
 Brackets, Dan, maybe on more than one occasion.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.000
 Now, I don't remember us ever making that claim."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.240
 I mean, it sounds like something I would have said, but I can't quite place it.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.600
 I don't think we have said that, actually.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.760
 My memory doesn't stretch to it anyway.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.920
 Do you know what I want to suggest that maybe what Lauren is thinking is we've often mentioned

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.600
 facts about how the navigation of, where is it, James?

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.000
 Oh, the South Pacific Islands.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.600
 Yeah, is how they would dip their testicles into the current, into the water as a way

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.880
 of finding their way in a direction.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.160
 I just wonder if, because we've mentioned that a couple of times.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.440
 And anyway, Lauren goes, "I was just researching tortoise bathing because I have two of my

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.680
 own, and I wanted to make sure I'm doing it right, and I've had them for 18 months, and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.000
 this is definitely not the first time I've researched bathing them, but I found a WikiHell

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.400
 article saying they rehydrate in the bath by absorbing water through their cloaca."

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.640
 Oh, that's good.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.640
 Yeah.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.360
 So, to argue a cloaca is not the same as a dick.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.080
 It's a genital opening, isn't it?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080
 Yeah.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080
 It's definitely that.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080
 They've got that in common.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.840
 I wonder if, because I think we've said, maybe we haven't said before, but maybe if we haven't

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 said it before, Lauren's probably not basing it on this, but if we have, then she might

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
 be.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.400
 We've talked about Buddhist monks who have the ability to control their body temperature

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.360
 to such an extent that they can drive their own laundry by sitting under a wet sheet, and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680
 it starts to steam because they've got such mental control.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.440
 That's a big leap to then get to drinking through your dick.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.440
 I think we're trying very hard to work out what that could possibly be.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.840
 That's a real thing, by the way, isn't it?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.680
 They literally raise their temperature up so that you could hang a wet sock on them,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.400
 and an hour later, it'll be dry.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.800
 It will be disrespectful to their religion, I think.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.680
 But yes, unless they've gone into business with it, unless this is a new system.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.000
 I'm not sure how true it is.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.400
 I don't think the one hour would work.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.560
 I don't think they can raise their temperature to, let's say, 65 degrees.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 That's a quick amount.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.520
 I think they can probably raise it to about the maximum that human temperature could go.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.680
 You'd need a super monk for the hour.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.920
 It's getting colder in the UK at the moment, because winter's coming.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.120
 The laundry is starting to take appreciably longer to dry.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.720
 I think we've had our last really good drying weather of the year, and it would be amazing

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.080
 to just sit under all your wet laundry and go, "Ugh!"

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.640
 Or bring a monk in, just grab a monk, since the dissolution of the monasteries, they've

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.280
 not got anywhere else to go.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.000
 Do you think the Franciscans also could do it, and the Benedictines and all of that lot?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.960
 Yeah, it feels like a holy thing to do.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.440
 It's all monks could do it.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.840
 I'm not saying that one religion is the correct religion.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.480
 But you are saying that all monks can dry laundry on themselves, and actually that's

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.480
 nicely balanced.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480
 All right.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.480
 Well, thank you, Lauren.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.560
 I think we've got to the bottom of that one.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.560
 Pretty clearly.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.560
 No, we don't know.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560
 I'm sorry.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.080
 I don't think we said monks could drink through their penises.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.520
 No, I think one of the three of us would remember it, if we did.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.440
 But maybe because we all memorise different parts of the history of fish, maybe it's

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.680
 one of the things that Anna remembers, but I don't think we did do that.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.680
 Imagine bath time at the monastery.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.080
 You don't need to let the plugs out.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.080
 You just...

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.880
 Well, half the water's boiling away, and the other half has been sucked up the decks.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.440
 If you don't want to drink bath water, no one does that, regardless, let alone through

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.520
 your dick, unless there's a filtration system.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.960
 Well, yeah.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.960
 I think it's fine.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 I think it's healthy.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.040
 Anyway, right, we should go on to the next email.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.240
 Have we talked about the Hamilton thing on Drop As A Line Before?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.520
 As in the musical, I believe we haven't.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.320
 As in that we predicted the musical.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.560
 So, well, just in case we haven't, if we have, just kind of ignore this bit, we've got an

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.160
 email from Melly Foster saying, "I don't know if this is spicy meat or a whole new category.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.040
 On low days, I listen to old episodes.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.560
 Take from that what you will."

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.520
 That's completely fine.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.680
 In the episode called No Such Thing as a Magic Camel Filter, 23rd minute, James mentions

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.600
 Hamilton, Ohio.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.400
 Hamilton has an exclamation mark, to which Andy replies, "It sounds like a musical."

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.920
 This episode is dated 14th August, 2014.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.120
 Hamilton, exclamation mark, a hit musical, premiered on the 17th of February, 2015.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.960
 Is esteemed composer and lyricist Lin Manuel Miranda in Club Fish, or are you all actually

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.520
 the team behind the hits?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.400
 Have I blown this shit wide open by Ellie?

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.520
 Yeah, we did know about that.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.960
 And I think we've been on record in interviews saying that we actually predicted Hamilton

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.400
 the musical, even though our musical was about a small town in Ohio and Lin Manuel Miranda

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400
 said something about it.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.940
 Imagine the success he could have had had he got the right Hamilton musical instead

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.160
 of this Alexander guy.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
 Yeah.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.320
 Well, we all know as well that he chose the wrong founding father, didn't he, for his

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320
 musical.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.600
 Definitely, the right person would have been Gouverneur Morris, who died after putting

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.600
 a whale bone up his penis.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.000
 It was actually going to dislodge some bathwater.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 That was the thing.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 That was the problem.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 He mistook it for a straw.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 He thought it was his straw.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.640
 He was trying to suck out the rest of his cocktail.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.080
 But like that, very obviously, would be a better musical.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.080
 I don't know why he went for Hamilton.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.560
 Oh, that was great.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.080
 Yeah, no, I think we were aware of that.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.520
 I don't know if it is spicy meat, just to go back to the category.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.560
 I think if it is spicy meat, it's very, very old spicy meat.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.760
 Yeah, I actually don't remember what spicy meat means.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760
 Me too.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760
 It just words to me now.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760
 Me too.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.760
 What does it mean anything?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760
 No.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.760
 No.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.420
 I've put such love and care into this categorization system.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.200
 Every email gets its own category.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.360
 I'm up to like 900 categories now because they don't all fit it neatly.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360
 Right.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.880
 Spicy meat, I think, is controversy.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.280
 Ooh, you know, it's where maybe there's a disagreement between us or between us and

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.400
 the facts or there's some element of, you know, personal, I think I got it from beef,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.400
 you know, personal beef.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400
 Yeah.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.680
 Here's one thing to say about this Hamilton musical thing, because it has come up a few

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:37.520
 times, which is for the sake of just throwing facts into this argument, Lin-Manuel Miranda

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.200
 premiered the song Alexander Hamilton, which opens the musical at the White House in front

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.920
 of Obama in 2009.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.620
 And he said he was working on an album, but in the background he was working on the musical.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.600
 So the origins of the musical go as far back as 2009.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.400
 I think what we're saying here, though, is that he hadn't told anyone and we predicted

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.320
 that a musical on Hamilton would be a great musical.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.320
 We're not saying we voted.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.240
 I'm saying that he actually used us as the idea, as the inspiration behind it.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.240
 Okay.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240
 So he pivoted away.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240
 I don't care about your timeline.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.400
 Well, James and I have been suing Lin-Manuel Miranda for like five years now and it's,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.000
 we didn't want to tell you, Dan, because we wanted to, like, present you all the net

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.360
 box office receipts from Hamilton since it opened when we win them.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.200
 It's going well, I think.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.160
 Here's an email from Iceland.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.240
 It's from, I'm going to try really hard to get the name right, I was going through Magnus

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240
 Dotir.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240
 Wow.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240
 It sounded great.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.800
 I actually consulted on Icelandic health about the pronunciation of that.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 Why?

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800
 Sorry, why did you insult them?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.800
 They said, that's not how you pronounce it, and you said-

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 Consulted?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800
 Yes, it fucking is.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800
 I'll consult it, sorry.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.280
 And then insulted them saying, oh, thanks a lot for that pronunciation.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.280
 Nerd.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.080
 Yeah, Magnus Dotir, of course, is right, because that's daughter of Magnus, right?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080
 Yeah.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.040
 I think I got the first one right, too.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:09.640
 Anyway, Asgurther writes, hail long-time listener, first-time complainer, uh-oh.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.080
 In your most recent episode, you talked a bit about Iceland, as you have done many times

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.600
 before, that's not the complaint.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.520
 Up until now, the stuff you have said about Iceland and Icelanders has been mostly correct,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.160
 which is kind of surprising, as there are so many misconceptions about the country.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.760
 So far, things are going pretty well in this email, in episode 499, though, there was talk

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.160
 of a dating app that Icelanders use to ensure they're not dating their cousins.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.000
 This is not true, and it's one of the most long-lasting untrue rumors Icelanders have

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.080
 to deal with.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.920
 The app you're talking about is actually a genealogy website used by people looking

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.920
 up their ancestors or historians doing research, rather than people trying to see if they're

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.480
 looking up with their cousins.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:57.120
 Okay, well, you know, obviously, it was the "Lou Sanders" episode, and Lou had been in

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.960
 Iceland recently and had been told this, or possibly she might have heard it on an earlier

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.640
 episode of "Fish", because I think we actually have mentioned that previously, as well.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.640
 Yeah, still do.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640
 Okay, that was me.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640
 Lou said it.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.640
 Yeah, Lou said it.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.640
 Lou said it this time.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.640
 I think we have said it before.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.640
 We have, yeah.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.640
 Okay.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.240
 Because I think we have a slight policy on Dropsline of not slamming the guests.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.600
 If the guests come on and say they're usual, you know, rubbish, then we try not to read

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.960
 out too many emails criticizing or saying that.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.400
 So no, but that's nice of you, James, to point out that we, I think, I think we have got

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400
 that wrong in the past.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400
 Yeah, we have.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400
 Yeah.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.680
 Okay, yeah, fair enough, Dan, do you want to, if it was you who said that?

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.680
 I'm not sure it was, but...

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.200
 I just sometimes think when there's a really funny gag about your country, lean into it

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.240
 and be part of it and just know that it's fine, there's no consequences to it.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240
 I think...

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240
 Do you think...

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240
 It's a great gag.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.620
 I agree, and I do think Australians cheat at cricket all the time when you go into Sydney

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.920
 Town Square with a billboard on your front and embrace that joke.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920
 That's just not a great gag.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.080
 That's the issue with that one.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080
 This is...

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.760
 I'd like the fact that Asgutha says this is one of the most long-lasting untrue rumors

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.000
 Icelanders have to deal with.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 It's not...

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 That's...

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 It can't be that long-lasting.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.360
 It only dates from the period of the app, which is recent.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.240
 Well, I read recently the Vikings didn't found Iceland.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.280
 That feels like the longest-running falsehood.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.680
 That's true.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.680
 Given his dates to their founding, but it's a slight technicality in that the people who

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.360
 went to Iceland were farmers rather than ponderers.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360
 Pillagers.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.480
 So, yeah, pillagers were Vikings, but if you weren't doing any pillaging, you technically

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480
 weren't Viking.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.720
 I don't know if that's true.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.200
 Maybe MsMagnus.ac can let us know.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 I think that sounds...

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.960
 I mean, I think that sounds completely plausible.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.240
 I do wonder whether that's stretching the definition of a rumour, as in that feels more

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:55.600
 like a historiographical problem to solve rather than some exciting goss.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.600
 Do you think?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 Okay.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.840
 Yeah, that's fair enough.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840
 All right.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.840
 So, apologies for that corrected.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.760
 Let's have another guest slam.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.320
 John Lewis writes...

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.320
 Come to my shop.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.320
 Right?

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.640
 No, he must get that all the time.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.640
 He must.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.200
 Do you know there's a footballer called Lenel John Lewis?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200
 No.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
 Okay.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 And they sing, "Lenel John Lewis, his name is a shop."

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.200
 That's his song that they always sing to him.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.000
 Does it only go two lines, that song?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.600
 No, but the rest is unimportant.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600
 Boring.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.600
 Yeah.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 Okay.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.800
 John writes, "I believe that Anna made an error upon her return to the podcast in

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.800
 episode 500."

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.800
 Brilliant.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.720
 "She talks about a low-pressure vacuum as being crap.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:51.280
 I think that a low-pressure vacuum would have more 'suck' in quotes.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.320
 Please ensure if you mention this on your podcast you pronounce the quotation marks

00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:01.240
 as I know that vacuums do not suck because a full vacuum has a pressure of zero bar absolute

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.520
 and therefore a crap vacuum would have a higher pressure."

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.520
 This is brilliant.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520
 Studying.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.440
 I've never thought of it like that before, but of course that is true.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.920
 So is that a vacuum in space or a vacuum in your house?

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.280
 If you, well, let's assume your vacuum cleaner uses a vacuum as in it creates an absence

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.420
 of air in one place so that the air rushes from somewhere else into that space.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:30.280
 Then the lower that pressure is, the better the vacuum would be and the more that stuff

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.080
 would get quotation marks sucked into it.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.080
 I see.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.500
 And we're all pronouncing the quotation marks because we know that vacuums do not

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.500
 suck.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.500
 Mmm.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.120
 I'm more distracted by the fact that you called Anna a guest.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.760
 You're dead meat when she's back if she hears this.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.560
 I'm trying to sow the seeds of some spicy meat for when Anna's back.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560
 Great.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.560
 That's what I'm trying to do.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.560
 You know?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.560
 That's a good idea.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.560
 Do you think Anna has listened to any of these droppers of light?

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:03.600
 I don't think she's listened to the main show since about late 2014.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.060
 I must have it because I've talked to Anna quite a lot in the recent weeks because of

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.820
 our book that's come out, "Everything to Play For", the QI book of sports available in all

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.820
 shops right now.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.500
 Plunk corner, format point, ding, ding, ding.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.500
 Excellent.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.540
 And I told her about the next guest that's coming on who I won't mention here in case

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.540
 it's in the future, but in episode 502.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.740
 And she said, "Oh, I might listen to that one."

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.420
 So that tells you all you need to know about whether she's listened to the previous ones.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.840
 So apologies, John, and we'll have a word with Anna.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.880
 Is that Anna Tyshinski, author of "Everything to Play For", the QI book of sports available

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.480
 in all bookshops now?

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480
 That one.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480
 Is that one?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.040
 That's your second strike on Plunk Corner.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040
 That's fine.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.200
 It's nice to have a second.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.200
 That's two Plunk Corner.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.920
 You've now completed half of a Plunk Square.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.560
 So I think you can do it before the end of this recording.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.240
 I'd go for a Plug Dodecai, John.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.240
 No seriously, James.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.240
 It sounds like a marvellous book.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.680
 So let's back out of Plug Car now.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.680
 OK.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.860
 Well, let's back into yet a third guest slam.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.120
 Well, more slams of guests?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.120
 Just one more.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.120
 One more.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.120
 One more.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.040
 And these are slam technicalities rather than slam, you know, complete disasters.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.840
 Stu Randall writes, "Hannah, Hannah Fry, stated that the amount of gold on Earth is constant.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.760
 However, this is not quite true.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.960
 New atoms of gold are accidentally created by the persistent new Trump bombardment of

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.520
 the lead shielding surrounding nuclear reactors and particle accelerators."

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:42.200
 Oh, this is high quality pen and tree this week.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.720
 Hannah, you idiot.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.720
 You're out by an atom in your calculation.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.440
 I'd love to be that guy who comes over into the audience, "Why do you call this holding

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440
 an atom?"

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.680
 That is such a good fact.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680
 It is.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.840
 I didn't know that already, but I'm so glad that I learned it and I'm going to use it

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.520
 whenever anyone says that fact about the amount of gold being constant.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.680
 I'm 100% going to say that.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.520
 Here's an audience factor of the week from Fraser Palmer, and this is a great one.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.520
 I'm really sorry.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.520
 I'm just going to blow my nose.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:25.240
 Why didn't he write that in an email?

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.520
 He could have just blown his nose and then written the rest of the email.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.280
 What a strange thing to say.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.920
 Fraser writes, "Ah, that's better.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.160
 Now I can type more clearly."

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160
 Fraser and Ryan do that.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.320
 "Thought I'd write in with a fact that might interest you.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.520
 Recently, the winners of the Woodbridge Disflect Open Tournament, a game where partners throw

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.320
 Frisbees to each other to try and knock it into a bucket."

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.400
 I guess trying to get the Frisbee into a bucket?

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.360
 We'll try and knock something else into a bucket.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.880
 Anyway, it was won by John Ling and Terry Malloy.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.120
 Now, what's interesting about these two is that they absolutely hate each other.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.720
 Supposedly, they haven't spoken to one another outside of the game since 2013, but their

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.080
 chemistry with the Frisbee was just too strong to break up.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.000
 It's basically now a blood feud between their two families with the exception that they're

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.320
 really good at Disflect when they play together.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.040
 It's as if Agassi and Samperas only played doubles and only played together.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.120
 Isn't that good?

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120
 That's brilliant.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.120
 That's amazing.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.120
 That's a Netflix documentary waiting to be made, isn't it?

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120
 It so is.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120
 It's so is.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120
 I just love it.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.520
 It's like a Will Ferrell movie, you know?

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.360
 One of those "take a sport."

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360
 Like "Dodgeball."

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360
 Yeah.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.440
 Perhaps part of their chemistry is that one of them absolutely launches it at the other

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:50.120
 one's head because he hates them so much, and then that just means that his accuracy

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120
 is way, way greater.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.120
 Yes, yes.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.720
 That's such a good way of doing it.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720
 It's a really good sports fact.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.600
 I wonder if there's anywhere else that people can get a collection of facts about interesting

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:06.120
 sports and, you know, a guide to human behavior, maybe, through the medium of sport.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120
 That would be interesting.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.560
 I don't know of any of those.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:16.480
 I only know about dystopian novels and books about weirdos.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.760
 Just to stop the pylon of letters in your inbox, Andy, "Dodgeball" was Ben Stiller,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760
 not Will Ferrell.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:28.080
 I'm thinking of the ice skating one which I watched, Blades of Glory, I think that was

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.080
 good.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.080
 Blades of Glory.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.080
 Yeah.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080
 Right, here we go.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.480
 Here's Demian Stimpson, "Love the podcast, so I feel bad that my first contact is about

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480
 something wrong."

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.980
 Oh, no.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.400
 In today's episode, this is a few weeks ago, someone claimed, albeit probably repeating

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.960
 the study they referenced, that in Finland there is no discussion of weather.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.000
 I have lived in Finland for almost a decade and speak Finnish to a reasonable standard.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Sorry, James.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.160
 You were about to say what the context of this was.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:03.800
 No, only that we discussed a book by Kate Fox, I think, and she mentioned about how

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:10.840
 regularly people mention the weather in the UK and how even in Finland, if people are

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.560
 digging their way out of the snow and it's 10 foot deep snow, people don't even mention

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560
 it.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.880
 Like, what have you been doing for the last hour and a half?

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880
 Oh, nothing.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.720
 Well, Demian writes, "There are at least two Finnish people at work who will discuss the

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.920
 weather with me every day.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.280
 My in-laws discuss the weather with me every time I see them.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.760
 Conversations about weather in Finland are almost as common as in the UK, just less likely

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.840
 to be about the rain."

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.840
 Oh.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.840
 Okay.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840
 Sick bird.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.960
 What it sounds like to me is that Demian is British.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.920
 He keeps mentioning how much it's talked about in the UK.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.360
 He's now living in Finland.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.320
 They're probably thinking, "This guy's missing his regular conversation.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.800
 Let's start chatting weather to him because that's what he knows.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.800
 He's British."

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.720
 And he's not getting a proper authentic Finnish conversation.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720
 This is just a theory.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.800
 I'm not going to say it's true.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 It's a good theory.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.040
 No, I agree, actually.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.200
 When I was in Romania in 2016 and all people wanted to say to me is, "What do you think

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200
 about Brexit?"

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.040
 But I doubt they went home, all of them, and talked about Brexit between themselves.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.880
 They were just like, "Here's a weirdo English person.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.760
 Let's ask him what he thinks about Brexit."

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.560
 And Brexit is much like weather in that it's everywhere and it's mostly bad.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.440
 A little bit of satire for you there.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.440
 Satire can't ask.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.320
 Do you think we've been doing Drops of the Line for a year?

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.120
 I don't feel like a year, but do you think we've actually been recording it for, I think

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120
 we might have done?

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120
 Yeah, maybe.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120
 Have we?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.840
 Because Anna was on the first few episodes of Drops of the Line.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.920
 Must be Modna, yeah, then.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.520
 So, now she's nearly back from her matinee, so, yeah.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520
 Okay.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.880
 Are we going to do anything for our first birthday or not?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.800
 I don't think so.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.800
 Okay.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:00.360
 Imagine if we did a huge O2 arena gig just for Drops of the Line instead of our 10-year

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.760
 anniversary, that'll be great.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.400
 Just 15 minutes of lukewarm batter.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.920
 Yeah.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.840
 We could build an actual spicy meat lounge or a plug corner that we go into on different

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.840
 bits of the stage.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.840
 It's got to be epic.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.000
 What do you think a spicy meat lounge is?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.440
 A lounge that gives you spicy meat, sells it, or is it a lounge which is made of spicy

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440
 meat?

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.440
 Of a latter.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440
 Definitely.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.440
 Absolutely.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.480
 You've got a, like a giant pepperoni foot stool.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.440
 A pepperami, chaise-long.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440
 Yeah.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440
 Yeah.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440
 Or a lovely pepperami, chaise-long.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440
 Yeah.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.120
 I'd sit in that lounge.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.120
 Great.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.840
 Do you know, that's the limit of my spicy meat knowledge.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.240
 Are there more?

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.240
 Biltong?

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.240
 Biltong.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240
 Interesting.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240
 Biltong can be spicy.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240
 It can be spiced.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240
 Anyway.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240
 Here's another.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240
 Yeah.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.000
 Simon Richardson writes, just enjoying your No Such Thing as Ocean's Eleven with Puffin's

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 episode.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 That's good.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Oh, Craig Jenner.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Yeah.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.760
 And wanted to correct you ever so slightly on the Lance Armstrong fact.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760
 Oh.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.760
 Yeah.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.520
 It was about how someone bought 10,000 of his books or something the day before he got

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.840
 done for being a drugs cheater.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.840
 Yes.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.960
 And they were then left with all these books they couldn't sell.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960
 Yeah.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.040
 Well, Simon writes, "It wasn't books the gentleman bought, it was DVDs.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.200
 And the reason I know this is that he bought them from us."

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 Oh.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.560
 And it turns out Simon Richardson is the editor of Cycling Weekly Magazine.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.560
 That's amazing.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.560
 That's Weekly with Two E's.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.920
 It's not Cycling Weekly Magazine.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.160
 He's packed up a very shallow hill.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160
 Yeah.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
 So that's nice.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.560
 It's good to know we've got illustrious listeners like that.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.720
 No, that's amazing.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720
 Yeah, it's huge.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.000
 And also, I mean, it's a double slam, isn't it?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.520
 Because like obviously Lance Armstrong was cancelled, but also people don't really use

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.520
 DVDs anymore.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520
 So.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520
 So this is it.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.400
 And I wrote back to Simon because I wanted more details.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.720
 I was intrigued by this.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.760
 And he says, "I can't remember how many it was."

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.560
 I asked him, "How many did this guy buy?"

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.280
 But we're talking in the thousands of these DVDs.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.000
 We weren't shifting them because we knew what was coming, where he Armstrong, brackets

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.880
 everyone in Cycling knew what was coming.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.280
 We were shifting them as DVDs were no longer selling.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.440
 So the person who bought them not only backed the wrong rider, he backed the wrong tech

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.440
 too.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440
 Wow.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440
 I know.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440
 Yeah.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440
 It seems like a scam to me.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.920
 Like as in, he knew what was coming and they got rid of them.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.300
 Even if you, yeah, I don't know, like, is this the same guy who sold me those Russell

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.600
 Brand Beta Maxs' last week?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.600
 That's it.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 Yep.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.600
 That's it.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:47.480
 Cycling Weekly, they're online shoppers, a lot of really bizarre stuff, actually.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.800
 Oh, dear.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800
 Yeah.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.800
 Yeah.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.800
 Fair enough.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.040
 I've read that thing about the books in lots of different places.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.480
 I feel like I've never heard of the DVDs before.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480
 That's really interesting.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.080
 It's from the Straight from the Horses saddle, as it were.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.080
 Yeah.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.480
 Now I'm actually wondering about all those, um, those Dapper Laugh cassette tapes I bought

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480
 from the same source.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.480
 Dapper Laugh.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.480
 Dapper Laugh.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.480
 Is that the best cancelled person you could think of?

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:25.440
 I think about Dapper Laugh quite a lot.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.360
 I actually think, you know, sometimes we mentioned someone from like the 19th century

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.240
 and we're like, oh, maybe we're going to have to explain who they are because not everyone's

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.240
 going to know.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.600
 I think Dapper Laugh is 100% a person that you're going to have to explain who they

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600
 are.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600
 For international listeners.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.600
 I don't know how.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600
 Just for listeners.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.680
 Dapper Laugh was a, he was a guy who was a comedian and then it turned out he'd recorded

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.840
 some rather, rather ripe stuff and it wasn't, hmm, it was all a bit, hmm, not sure about

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.840
 that.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.840
 Yeah.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:59.680
 It was all because of Michael Barrymore laser discs.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:07.280
 This is a lovely game of matching people who've been cancelled to technologies we can't quite

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.680
 remember.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.560
 Oh, God.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.720
 Here's a riddle to end on.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720
 Oh, okay.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.440
 Well, it's more of a mystery.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.280
 It's from Mark Colfifi.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.840
 Discovered your show recently and love it was listening to many episodes on our 14 hour

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.240
 drive from Boston to the Outer Banks in North Carolina.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.480
 Oh, feels like a long drive.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480
 It is.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.440
 In episode 488 there is a discussion on furbies.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.280
 So have you or your panel ever heard of The Long Furby?

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.280
 The Long Furby.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.280
 Yeah.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280
 No.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280
 Okay.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.280
 No, I don't know.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280
 Is it a movie?

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280
 Like The Long?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280
 Goodbye.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.280
 It's a never ending story.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.280
 Is that?

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.280
 Yeah.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.280
 No, it's not that.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.880
 It's a natural furby that was long, like in the shape of a caterpillar or a snake or something.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.880
 Yeah.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.880
 It's a long furby.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.400
 And I think people started making their own weird long furbies.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.400
 Okay.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.480
 It's sort of a subculture online of people who make like five foot long furbies.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.640
 So they still got the normal face and then it's just fluff all the way down.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640
 Oh, okay.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.840
 That is weird.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.840
 The dragon and never ending story looks a bit like a long furby when I picture him now.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.840
 A luck dragon.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840
 Yeah.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840
 You're absolutely right.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.320
 And it's pretty horrifying that I would say the Long Furby.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320
 Why?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320
 Why?

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.320
 Why?

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.320
 Why Andy?

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.320
 Why did they do this?

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.520
 I'm just reading now.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.200
 Long Furby is a self-proclaimed cult in quotes that is often flaunted online and sometimes

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.880
 practice publicly in real life.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.880
 What is that?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.880
 Hmm.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.160
 As in people like dancing around the fire with long furbies.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.160
 Oh God.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160
 There's all sorts of categorizations.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.360
 There's a giraffe furby which has four feet at the bottom.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.520
 There's a low furby which is a bit shorter and fatter.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.560
 There's a mobius which has two heads on either side of the body.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560
 That's incredible.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.560
 It's distressing.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.400
 If you want to distress yourself, you look up the photos of long furbies because they're

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400
 very weird.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.720
 I've got one bit of correspondence here.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:14.920
 This was sent in actually into the public domain as a question written in by Zoe Williams.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:21.040
 The question is, a list of the UK's top podcasts poses the questions, what is it with all the

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040
 bros?

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:30.320
 So Zoe, Zoe would like to know why no such thing as a fish is so bro-ey.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.320
 She published this in The Guardian.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.020
 She wants to know why is it that if a woman is allowed, allowed onto our show, they are

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.640
 only there to talk about their children and relationships, preferably with their husbands

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.640
 or children.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.780
 So I mean, yes, we are very laddy, Zoe.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.280
 We know that.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.040
 We talk about monks suckin' drinks up through the dicks.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.540
 We know.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.740
 That is lad.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.160
 Zoe has never clearly listened to an episode of the main show.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.200
 The chance that she's listening to this bit of the show is absolutely infinitesimal.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.520
 Now I would say this is spicy meat.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.160
 This is us being slightly slammed by, in an article in The Guardian, it's sort of drive-by

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.800
 slamming saying we're bros.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.680
 And Dan, you really took it to heart, didn't you?

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.880
 Because you don't think we're bro-ey.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.880
 Oh, no.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.640
 I wish we were more bro-ey.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.720
 I'm just ashamed that we were so far down her list of bro-ey podcasts.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.160
 No, of course we're not bro-ey.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.080
 We're the least bro-ey podcast out there.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.480
 Well, not the least, but...

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.240
 What about all of our episodes where we compare different barbecue sauces and see how many

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.760
 spicy wings we can eat?

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.200
 That's pretty bro-ey.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.360
 I never released those ones, but we record them.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.040
 We do record them.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.920
 There was someone defending us on Twitter the other week when this came out.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.920
 Oh, no.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.920
 They said...

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.920
 I know what this is going to be.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.920
 They said...

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920
 Dan has taken this...

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920
 I'm still furious.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.920
 I'm still furious.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:01.480
 Dan has taken this so much to heart, and is so upset about it.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.960
 This person defended us saying they're not lads, they're not bros.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.960
 Shriverland, my Twitter handle, in particular, gives off major wife-guy energy.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.760
 That's who I am to them.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:17.680
 Dan, I kid you not, anyone listening to this, this is about the fourth time I've heard Dan

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.320
 complaining about having been described as a wife-guy on Twitter.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.560
 Can I just say to anyone listening to this, think of the person that you know in your

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:33.320
 friend group who is the most of a wife-guy, Dan, it just trumps them out of existence.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:38.640
 He's the most wife-guy person you've ever met, but it just means that you love your

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640
 wife, don't you?

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.640
 Not like me and James.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.080
 He complains bitterly about our wives.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.840
 We have to edit out so much from me and James grassing about our wives.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.800
 The only thing that ever stops me from munching on a chicken wing full of barbecue sauce is

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.800
 complaining about my wife.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.680
 We do our review episodes of Nuts and Zoo Magazine.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:05.680
 It's a big feature of the bro episodes we do.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.320
 It's a nice thing to be a wife, it's a lovely thing to be.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.280
 It's nice to have never been so insulted in all my life.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.280
 Your mistress was absolutely furious.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.720
 Oh my gosh, she was fuming.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.720
 There we go.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.920
 Well, if you've got that out of your system, Dan, the complaint about our bro-iness.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.920
 Yes.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.920
 Yeah.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.920
 Thank you.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.920
 Thanks for letting me hear that.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.640
 Thanks everybody next time because we're going to be comparing our Hot Wheels vehicles

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.000
 and taking them for a spin.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.120
 We're going to be at the Monster Truck Festival.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.920
 Then after that, it's gun show November.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.980
 Looking forward to that.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.720
 And throwing like horseshoes around little sticks.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.200
 That's what they do, isn't it?

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200
 What bros?

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.200
 Oh shit.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.200
 Gun shows.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.200
 Don't give us away.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200
 Is this one of your sports?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.200
 They throw horseshoes.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.200
 Is this one of your sports?

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200
 Yeah.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.200
 Brilliant new book.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.040
 Everything to play for the QI Book of Sports, James.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.760
 Written by the two bros themselves, James Harkin and Anatochinsky.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.880
 And guest Anatochinsky, guesting in this book.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.480
 That's the only thing is that Andrew is the most bro-y out of any of us.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.480
 Oh yeah.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.480
 Yeah.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480
 But thanks everybody.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.840
 Thank you for listening to yourselves as reflected in our dark mirror.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.080
 We'll be back in a month with another of these episodes.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:30.320
 And we look forward to it and to hearing from you in the meantime, which you can ensure

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.560
 that you do by writing to podcast@QI.com.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.560
 Bye.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.060
 Slick.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:45.060
 [Music]

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.060
 [Music]

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.060
 [Music]

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.640
 (upbeat music)

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.700
 you
