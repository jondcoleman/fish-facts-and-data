00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Chesterfield.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.680
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.360
 >> My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.240
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.800
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.280
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.360
 >> My fact is that one Japanese slang term for

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.120
 a retired husband is soraigomi, which literally translates as bulky waist.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.000
 >> That is two on the nose.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.240
 >> It's a lot, it's a lot.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.760
 >> Do you know this man affectionately or less affectionately?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.080
 >> I think tone of voice counts for a lot in these scenarios.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.840
 I don't think it's a completely affectionate term.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.400
 It's a phrase that I think maybe older people will know more than younger people

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.440
 in Japan today.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.880
 I think it first came to prominence in the 90s and it was basically there at

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.080
 certainly at the time in Japan the very, very strong culture of working very hard.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.640
 A lot of quite traditional gender roles at the time.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.600
 So you'd have, a husband might be working sort of 16 hours a day for 40 years.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.000
 And then suddenly, he's retired and he's here all the time.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.560
 And this was the phrase that arose as a result of that.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 >> Another one that they use is nureochiba, which means wet fallen leaves.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.080
 And the idea is that if you have wet fallen leaves,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.120
 they just stick to your shoes all the time and the husband is just sticking to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.840
 his wife annoyingly and she can't get rid of him.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.280
 >> That's so funny.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.520
 This is horrible.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.760
 >> So Japan has a very high population that is sitting above the sort of 90s even.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.680
 Like they have the second largest number of centenarians in their country.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.240
 That came out so weird out of my mouth.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.760
 Because I was saying centenarians and then I thought centaurs.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.400
 And I thought, which one is it?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.960
 And I got stuck halfway through.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.560
 >> It's both actually in Japan.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.520
 >> Yeah, a lot of old centaurs in Japan.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.720
 Yeah, which is amazing.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.960
 >> What's the highest?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.560
 >> America has the most.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.680
 So America has, from the article that I read, it was 97,000.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.840
 This is a few years old, this article.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.840
 Japan with 79,000.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.920
 So Japan, it's six people for every 10,000 people in Japan.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.080
 We'll make it to 100 and above.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.760
 >> Okay, is that high, yeah.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.480
 >> So proportionally, I think it's Japan, surely?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.440
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.400
 >> Fortunately, Japan's got the highest number.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.120
 >> Thing is though, centaurs do live long.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.320
 So it's not really as impressive as you think.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.080
 >> But it does lead to, I mean, there's a lot of retirement about it in Japan.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.240
 And basically, there are a lot of free hours to fill after you hit 65 or 70.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.800
 >> Well, you can always go to the leisure center.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.160
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.720
 >> I did not deserve even that sarcastic rather.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.880
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.480
 >> But they have lots of activities.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.600
 So for example, Japan loves rugby, there's a hugely popular sport there.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.640
 But they have 120,000 rugby players, give or take.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.360
 10,000 of them are over the edge of 40, which impressive enough as a contact sport.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.640
 There was one rugby club in Japan which has three over 90-year-old players.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.520
 >> Come on.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.840
 >> Genuinely, genuinely.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.520
 >> No way.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.080
 >> There was an interview with a few of them.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.760
 One of them was called Ryuichi Nagayama.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.480
 And he said he found it an enormous amount of fun.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.080
 He said, since I joined, I have broken ribs many times and broke my collarbone too.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.520
 I can't stand not playing.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.040
 He said it would kill him if he stopped playing because he loves it so much.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.120
 Well, it sounds like it would kill him if he keeps playing.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.560
 >> Yeah, I'm just picturing a crumbled heap of bones right now.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.600
 >> It's very impressive.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.840
 >> Yeah, there was a story which I imagine,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.280
 it sounds like one of those stories that must slightly be fake.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.480
 But from what I can read is true, which is that the sales of adult nappies

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.760
 are overtaking the sales of children's nappies.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.600
 >> They are, that's definitely true.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.160
 >> Which is amazing, that's just, there's your indication about the difference

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.920
 in population in Japan, more adults and nappies than babies.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.880
 >> And it's not just the old ones, sometimes it's just convenient, you know?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.600
 >> How do you think we lasted an hour up here?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.280
 >> Yeah.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.840
 >> They do have a Japan problem with dementia, as lots of countries do,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.360
 but Japan particularly obviously with its massively aging population.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.080
 And there's been some kind of cool initiatives to deal with that.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.920
 So one of them is that there is a restaurant in Tokyo called

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.080
 The Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.720
 And it's where the waiting staff is comprised entirely of people suffering

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.800
 from dementia, and so- >> What?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.160
 >> My God.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.120
 >> It's great, the restaurant openly says that you as a customer may or

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.640
 may not get what you order.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.560
 >> Wow.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.080
 >> We guarantee it's delicious.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.920
 Yeah, the chefs do not have dementia.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.800
 >> Right.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.640
 >> Yeah, it's great, and it's so good.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.360
 And it just allows people, it's sort of based on this idea that there's a lot

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.600
 of misunderstanding of dementia, people think you're incapable of doing anything.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.000
 Whereas actually, people are capable of doing lots of stuff.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.400
 They just can't remember a lot.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.080
 And so it encourages a lot of open discussion about it and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.920
 gives them something to occupy them.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.880
 >> Yeah, it's a great idea, but probably not for

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.760
 whoever runs a business, right?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.680
 It doesn't feel like- >> Well, people love it.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.640
 >> Yeah. >> I bloody love it.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.360
 I hate having to choose what I want in a restaurant.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.560
 If I could know that, I could just say a random thing on the menu and

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.440
 it didn't make a blind bit of difference, I'd go there.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.840
 >> I read about these three women in Japan that called the monkey busters.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.840
 Did you come across those guys?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.200
 So there are a lot of areas of Japan, especially in the rural areas where you

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.440
 get the monkeys and they will come down and try and steal stuff from people and

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.760
 all that kind of thing.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:09.000
 And so this group of three women, 174, 168 and 167, have formed the monkey buster group.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.360
 And if you see the monkeys coming along, if they're trying to damage your

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.040
 fields and stuff or whatever, then you call the monkey busters and they come down.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.640
 >> How quickly do they come down?

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.800
 >> Well, nearby then quickly, if they're down the road, it might take a few minutes.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.040
 >> Right, so funny, and when they get there, do they shoot the monkeys?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.920
 Do they trap the monkeys?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.680
 >> They don't shoot the monkeys, they shoot over the monkeys' heads.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.120
 >> Wow. >> Like they do warning shots to the monkeys.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.320
 Firecrackers is the other thing they use sometimes.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.120
 >> Oh, nice, that's great.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.800
 >> That's a great thing to do once you retire, just go around scaring monkeys.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.000
 >> I'd like it as a career, monkey busting.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.240
 I'm sure someone would pay me for that.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.160
 >> You guys heard of Yui Chiromura.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.040
 >> No, he's not. >> So he is a sportsman, he's Japanese,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.040
 and he is interesting partly because of what he's done since your classic retirement age.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.800
 He was the oldest person in the world to climb Mount Everest, he climbed to age 70.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.040
 Then five years after that, he did it again at the age of 75.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.280
 He's done it again at the age of 80.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.040
 So he's become the oldest person to climb Everest three times in a row.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.760
 >> Wow. >> The high point of his career,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.320
 I reckon, in his 40s, he skied down Mount Everest with a parachute on his back

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.280
 so he could slow himself down. >> Okay, wow.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.760
 >> It's unbelievable, there was a film made about it in 1975.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.400
 I don't think we've mentioned this before, but I've never heard of it before.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.600
 >> No, did he go from the top?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.280
 >> He went from very, very high up. >> Okay.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.080
 >> I don't know if you went from the exact, I don't know if you went, I think he did.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.440
 >> I thought it was. >> It can't be the top, no, it's too.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.240
 >> It's too much. >> There's too much going on there.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.280
 >> There are lots of crevasses, he nearly died many times on the way down.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.840
 He went 160 kilometers an hour on the way down.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.480
 >> Wow. >> The parachute didn't work at first.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.320
 >> He was sliding towards this huge crevass, and eventually the parachute kind of kicked in.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.760
 >> My God. >> He's a hero.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.080
 >> But I love, because you go past all the crevasses going, fucking, come on, parachute.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.400
 When it finally does deploy, parachutes, of course, rip you back.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.280
 >> Coming to do all the crevasses all the way down.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.160
 >> I don't think it sails you back up to the top.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.920
 >> He's still there, he's still there, just on a loop, yeah.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.360
 >> Because they have such an aging population, they have a problem with elderly drivers.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.840
 And they're trying to do a thing where they're trying to get older people to hand back the driving licence.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.120
 There's a few ways they've tried to do this.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.240
 There was a 97-year-old Buddhist priest who handed over his driving licence.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.040
 The idea was, if he did it, maybe he would encourage other people to do it.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.960
 There's some areas where they'll give you cheap ramen, 15% off your ramen,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.880
 if you hand in your driving licence.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.680
 >> It's good, ironically, it'll stop you ramen anyone else with your car.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.880
 >> Aah.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.120
 >> Very uncertain about that, just to fit.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.560
 >> And there's also a funeral home in Tokyo that's offering a 15% discount

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.560
 on the cost of a funeral if you hand in your driving licence.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.000
 >> Aah, that's very good.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.320
 >> Yeah, we're gonna have to move on in a sec, sorry, next sec.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.280
 >> I'll give you a couple of sayings or phrases in Japanese

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280
 if you can guess what they mean.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.040
 >> OK.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.160
 >> Bakudo hage, which means barcode baldy.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.440
 Do you know what that means?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.920
 >> Is that someone with a comb-over who's...

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.080
 >> He's got it, yeah.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.440
 Really obvious comb-over, you're a barcode baldy.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.360
 By the window tribe, do you know what they are?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.560
 >> By the window tribe.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.440
 >> That is Madogiwa Zoku.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.120
 >> By the window tribe.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.840
 >> People who are underemployed, nosy parkers,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.520
 sit by their windows spying on their neighbours.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.160
 >> Underemployed was close.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.600
 So it's people who've been promoted to quite a senior level,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.360
 but they don't really do anything decent.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.840
 So they just sit there by the window looking out of the window.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.120
 And here's one more.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:00.920
 Kairo no sura ni shomben, which means piss on a frog's face.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.040
 >> That's just good advice.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.960
 >> Is it like a frog's face is bad enough?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.320
 The piss on it is even worse.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.600
 If you're piss on a frog's face, do the lowest of the low.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.520
 >> That's a good guess.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.880
 It's someone who is a little bit slow and isn't affected by anything.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.880
 So whatever you say to them, they'll just sit there going,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.280
 "Yeah, fine, whatever."

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.840
 And this is due to a theory, which I don't think is true,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.800
 that if you piss on a frog, it just sits there.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.880
 >> My neighbour has tadpoles in their garden

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.920
 that are just turning into frogs.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.960
 And I am going to try that.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.640
 I'm going to be squashing over the fence next week.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.880
 >> OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.280
 My fact this week is that in 1969, Samuel Beckett wrote a play

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:50.440
 that lasts 35 seconds long and features no actors or any dialogue.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.920
 The play is still performed today

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.080
 and has even been adapted into a movie.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.480
 This is an amazing thing.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.640
 Samuel Beckett, waiting for Godot,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.440
 one of the great playwrights and novelists,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.360
 he was called upon by Kenneth Tynan,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.920
 who was an amazing journalist and writer, critic in London,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.840
 famously first person to say, "Fuck!" on television.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.320
 >> Dan. >> Sorry.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.360
 >> That's all right.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.240
 >> First person to say anything, fucking Chesterfield.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.760
 >> Dan.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.680
 >> So in 1969, he was putting on a play called "O Calcutta,"

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.080
 and the idea was he wanted to invite a lot of very famous people

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.120
 to contribute to this play, but he was going to keep them anonymous.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.080
 So he wrote to Samuel Beckett. Samuel Beckett agreed to do it.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.960
 And the story goes is that he wrote this entire play,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.320
 which lasts 35 seconds long, onto a postcard and mailed it to him.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.280
 So he received the entire play on this postcard.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.440
 And then it was put on, but Beckett was very upset

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.840
 because when the play was eventually put on by Tynan,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.680
 he added extra stuff into the 35-second-long play.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.240
 And he was like, "Don't touch my play, you dick!"

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.360
 And yeah.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.000
 >> So what happened was "O Calcutta" was an erotic review.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.160
 So there were going to be loads of these little mini plays

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.960
 that were kind of erotic plays.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.920
 And when Beckett sent this stuff to Tynan on the postcard,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.720
 it was basically just a load of clutter on the stage.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.640
 The lights go on, off, on, off,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.000
 and there's breathing that goes with the on and off.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.240
 And then at the end, there's a little bit of baby crying.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.720
 That's it. And the whole point of it is it's a joke

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.360
 because everyone's expecting something really sexy

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.560
 and you get something really lame. That's the whole point.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.920
 But what they decided to do was to add some naked people into it.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.240
 >> Well, it's an erotic review.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.720
 Let's just have all of that stuff,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.360
 but with some naked people on stage.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.640
 And yeah, he was absolutely furious, wasn't he?

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.800
 >> Yeah, that's so annoying, to face the objects.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.120
 >> Exactly. Beckett's very difficult, I have to say.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.680
 >> Yeah, I agree.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.520
 >> Really, really difficult to understand.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.360
 >> You need an interval. Was there an interval in this one?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.480
 [laughter]

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.240
 >> It was part of the sketch within a bigger thing.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.760
 So there was lots of different places going on.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.800
 When it's now performed on stage, it's a two-hander.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.000
 So it's like when we tour live, we do a first half to our show.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.120
 We do close to 50 minutes.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.720
 Beckett's is 35 seconds.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720
 And then there's an intermission for beers

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.320
 and then you get a full play on the second half.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.000
 >> Oh, you get a Beckett in the second half?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.520
 >> Yeah. Beckett was maybe the most Beckett.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.640
 The most famous Beckett.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.920
 >> Andy! Sorry.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.960
 >> Andy was the first person to say Beckett on TV, wasn't he?

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.280
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.920
 It was my father's terrible audition tape.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.960
 Didn't get it.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.480
 >> Maybe the most famous play of his, "Waiting for Godot"

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.160
 famously described as a play in which nothing happens twice,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.280
 which is kind of true.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.280
 And it was written in French, which I didn't know.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.000
 He was a very international writer.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.320
 He traveled around a lot, lived in France for decades.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.480
 But it was first produced in Blackpool in 1956.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.000
 And it's a pretty aggressively modernist play now.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.480
 And Blackpool in 1956 was not ready for it.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.800
 [laughter]

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.040
 Incredible. This was still an era where all British plays

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.480
 had to go through the Lord Chamberlain's office,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.720
 the official censor of all theatre.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.320
 And an agent called C.W. Herriot

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.200
 saw it on behalf of the Lord Chamberlain

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.840
 to say which bits shouldn't, shouldn't be allowed.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.560
 And said he had been through two hours of angry boredom.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.720
 The man next to him had fled the theatre saying,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.240
 "Let me out of this."

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.280
 Several women were apologising to their escorts

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.480
 for having suggested a visit to such a piece.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.000
 And he also requested that they cut the bit

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.720
 where Estragon's trousers fall down.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.040
 [laughter]

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.560
 He actually, it's quite interesting reading his notes.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.120
 'Cause I kind of warmed to him, to Herriot.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.720
 'Cause he basically is saying it's really boring and pointless.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.040
 Not that it's too crude.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.360
 And actually with Estragon's trousers to be fair to him,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.000
 he says, "On the business of letting down Estragon's trousers,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.800
 "I suppose that may be a right. Better keep."

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.280
 You know, he thinks that's a bit fucking weird, but whatever.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.840
 I thought this was quite learned of him.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:56.160
 He censored the words 'Gono Kokus' and 'Spiru Cayete', which, yeah.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.560
 - What's 'Gono Kokus'? - It's some kind of magic trick, doesn't it?

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.760
 'Gono Kokus' does not sound like a magic trick, does it?

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.600
 It sounds like a spell from Harry Potter, doesn't it?

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.840
 'Gono Kokus'!

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.240
 I think you're demanding a Derren Brown refund

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.320
 if he's done 'Gono Kokus' on you.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.680
 It's presumably a bacterium of some kind.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.640
 They're both microbes.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.360
 So it's the micro, the bacterium of gonorrhea is one of them

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.440
 and the bacterium of syphilis is the other.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.680
 But he went to the trouble of looking in a dictionary

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.200
 to check up on those words.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.120
 - Right. - It's a good on-in.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.120
 Do you know you can get a Godot action figure?

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.520
 - Oh, cool. - Yeah, except it's on Etsy

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.360
 and it's just an empty package.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.080
 - Cos you've got to... - You've already written, it never arrives.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.000
 That's it! It's all got five-star reviews on Etsy,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.800
 apart from one person who says, "I paid for expedited shipping

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.040
 "and I still have not received the item."

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.040
 Brilliant. I love that.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.160
 Those, he was once asked by the director, Alan Schneider.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.400
 Beckett was once asked, "Who is Godot?"

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.440
 And Beckett answered, "If I knew, I would have said so in the play."

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.160
 - Wow. - That's great.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.200
 - How does that mystery, wasn't he? - Yeah.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.440
 Just genuinely, a very mysterious man.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.440
 He won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.240
 You'd think he'd be happy about that.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.640
 He said it was a catastrophe. His wife said it was a catastrophe.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.160
 He refused to go to the prize-giving because he was on holiday.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.120
 And his publisher wrote, "Dear Sam and Suzanne."

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.120
 That was his wife. "In spite of everything,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.760
 "they have given you the Nobel Prize. I advise you to go into hiding."

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.800
 And it's the most eminent prize in the world.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.240
 Anyway, he seemed absolutely furious about it,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.080
 although someone did write to him a message from a Mr. George Godot,

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.680
 got in touch with him and said, "Sorry to keep you waiting."

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.360
 - Hey! - Which he must have hated.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.360
 I bet he cracked a secret smile at that.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.760
 And then just hated himself for it.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.880
 He's famously the only Nobel Prize winner to have played first-class cricket.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.400
 That's a quiz question that comes up quite a lot.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.000
 He played for Dublin University against Northamptonshire,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.600
 and he played two games.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.680
 And for some reason, there was just this arbitrary thing where they said,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.880
 "Okay, this is a proper professional game now,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.400
 "and all these other games aren't proper professional games."

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.040
 And that's why it counts that he played first-class cricket.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.880
 But actually, when you read the articles about the matches,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.000
 it turns out that his team were absolutely shit.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.560
 And there's no reason at all they should have been a first-class team.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.360
 Like, the first game they played,

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.040
 the article begins with, "The university men are by no means a first-class side.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.800
 "They are keen and enthusiastic, but their batting was poor,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.800
 "their bowling presented no terrors,

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.800
 "and their fielding would have been improved by alertness."

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.520
 - Right. - Right.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.200
 In the second game they played, a year later, it said in the newspaper,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.680
 "They are weak in all departments of the game,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.280
 "and the university were outclassed from start to finish."

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.240
 Maybe he liked that. He hated the good reviews.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.960
 Maybe he loved the absolute subject.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.760
 We're going to have to move on in a sec to our next item.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.160
 We haven't mentioned that he was friends with James Joyce

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.280
 and used to wear shoes that were too small for him

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.440
 because he wanted to be like James Joyce.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.960
 We haven't mentioned that he was in the resistance

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.880
 during the Second World War and almost got killed by the Nazis.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.280
 We haven't mentioned the fact that he was stabbed by a pimp in Paris.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.160
 All this stuff. We've got to move on.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.920
 - Was he wearing shoes that were the same size as James Joyce's shoes?

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.720
 Or did James Joyce also wear shoes that were too small for him?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.320
 - Same thing. - Same thing.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.520
 - That's my question. - That's why he is.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.000
 He wanted to wear the same shoes as James Joyce.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.200
 James Joyce had very narrow feet,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.560
 and so he wore these shoes that were really, really narrow,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.200
 even though they didn't fit him.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.280
 He also, like, would only drink white wine

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.120
 because James Joyce drunk white wine

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.840
 and just wanted to be like James Joyce.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.240
 Because that's so needy.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.120
 Imagine how oppressed you'd feel if your mate was like that.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.640
 You know, you dump them.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.240
 I think they had it falling out, and it's probably because of that.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.400
 They claimed it was because James Joyce's daughter fancied him

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.560
 and he didn't return her affections.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.680
 But I think it was the weird wine-drinking shoe-wearing shit.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.480
 - I think you might be right. - Can I tell you quickly?

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.200
 Just back to O'Calcutta, the play that Beckett submitted,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.560
 this breathe it was called, the play to,

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.680
 Kenneth Tinnon wrote to a lot of famous people

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.080
 to try and get them to submit a thing.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.080
 And one of the people he wrote to was John Lennon.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.280
 And again, it was meant to be all anonymous,

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.040
 but apparently this is known that John Lennon did submit a sketch.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.840
 So he wrote a sketch about masturbation,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.200
 and it was based on his time when he used to masturbate

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.200
 amongst his friends at a party.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.440
 - This is the sketch right now. - Okay.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.440
 Paul McCartney verifies this story

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.680
 because in a biography on Paul McCartney,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.520
 called "Many Years From Now", this is what he says.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.880
 Apologies for whatever that to say.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.640
 We used to have wanking sessions

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.120
 when we were young at Nigel Wally's house in Walton.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.440
 We'd stay over night and we'd sit in armchairs

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.600
 and we'd put out all the lights and being teenage pubescent boys,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.600
 we'd all wank.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.040
 What we used to do, someone would say, "Bridge at Bardot.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.640
 Ooh, that would keep everyone on par."

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.920
 Then somebody probably, John, would say, "Winston Churchill.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.080
 Oh, no!"

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.440
 And it would completely ruin everyone's concentration.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.600
 So, John, yeah, submitted a wanking play to old Calcutta.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.800
 - That actually does sound like a really fun game. - Yeah.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.600
 - So, the wanking bit. - Yeah.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.240
 I only wish I knew any Beatles songs

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.240
 because there must be some puns in that summer.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.240
 Yeah, come together.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:28.480
 Okay, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.840
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.680
 Okay, my fact this week is that the European road, called E-404,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.680
 doesn't exist.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.680
 Have you searched for it?

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.520
 Yes, I have. It definitely doesn't exist.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.880
 It was in 1995, the European Parliament decided

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.360
 they were going to build the E-404.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.680
 It was near Zebrugge in Belgium,

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.240
 and they decided they were going to build it, and they just never did.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.120
 And so now, if you try to go onto the E-404, plug it into your sat-nav,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.800
 it will just give you an error message.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.800
 - That's brilliant. - So good.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.400
 Do you know if it predates the E-404 message?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.200
 - 1995, it would not just about it. - But it's closed.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.800
 - It's there and thereabouts, yeah. - Yeah, it's closed.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.720
 So, the E-404 message, which is where you go on the computer

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.000
 and you search for a website and it's not there,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.280
 that was invented by Tim Berners-Lee around the start of the internet,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.200
 so that will be around the late 80s and the 90s, something like that.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.520
 - So, it probably doesn't, yeah. - Yeah.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.160
 There's a rumor that it was because there was a room at CERN

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.360
 where they were working on the worldwide web called Room E-404,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.720
 but it's not true.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.400
 - No. - And one of the founders, Robert Caillio,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.400
 Tim Berners-Lee's colleague, was asked about it, that thing, the room,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.000
 and he said, "I don't even have a hunch about the E-404 fascination,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.840
 "and frankly, I don't give a damn.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.560
 "The sort of creativity that goes into E-404, the response pages, is fairly useless.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.160
 "The mythology is probably due to the irrationality

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.400
 "deny of evidence and preference for the fairytale over reality

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.880
 "that is quite common in the human species."

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.000
 - Oh, my God! - Wow!

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 - But actually, like, barrel of lard. - Actually, like, barrel of lard.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.480
 - Robert Caillio, isn't he? - Oh, what fun.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.240
 Four or four pages are really important at the start of the internet

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.920
 because it meant that you could search for something

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.160
 and if you've got the wrong thing, it would just give you something basic.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.560
 You knew what you were going to get, otherwise it could go in some kind of weird loop

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.680
 and you never, you know, it was a really, really important part

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.040
 when they were kind of putting the networks together.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.920
 - Right. - It's not puppy-interesting, James, that's his point.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.120
 And the fact that you're bothering to discuss it is a waste of his time and yours.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.320
 Look, the number four was always used at the start of errors

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.600
 when they were user-created errors and they would have four or one, four or two.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.160
 Are you trying to make this? Isn't it interesting?

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.480
 I find that very interesting and there's a better theory about where four or four comes from,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.120
 which is that in 1989 they were working on this.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.680
 There was a flight, Flight 404, that went missing and it was never found.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.360
 And so they may have heard on the radio the four or fours might be found.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.000
 And yes, in 1990 there was another Flight 404 which crashed.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.880
 So there were two Flight 404s which went wrong.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.080
 - And so... - Coincidence?

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.040
 - Yes. - Possibly, yes.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.200
 - Yes. - Yes.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:17.240
 See, I grew up in Hong Kong and four is a very unlucky number in Asia.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.280
 - It means death or something? - Yeah, four "s" sounds like it.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.520
 Which means death and yes, it's the same sound.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.360
 So room 404 in any hotel does not exist.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.000
 - Let's say for a hotel room 404s. - Oh, yeah.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.840
 And it's really interesting because 404 doesn't exist.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.760
 So obviously the whole of four doesn't exist.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.320
 So you lose floor four.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.640
 You would lose floor 13 as well.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.280
 But you also, because 13, for any foreign people who are coming in,

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.480
 they keep to the superstition for foreign builders.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.640
 - You got one, two, three, five through to 12. - Yeah.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.840
 But then you would also lose any floors that would have four in the number itself.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.720
 So 24, 34.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.840
 - In a 100-floor building, it's actually only about 80 floors

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.560
 once you minus all the floors. - Does it go from 12 to 15?

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.320
 - Because 14 has a floor in it? - Yes, it does.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.520
 Are they cheating? You know how they claim to have,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.000
 in that part of the world, a lot of the tallest buildings in the world,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.960
 do you think that they're actually quite squat?

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.840
 - Yes. - They're just skipped out loads of floors.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.560
 - The Sturge Alcalifa is actually only three floors high.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.200
 - It's a bungalow, isn't it? - Yeah.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.920
 Also 87 is bad luck in Australia, I think.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.760
 - Is it right? - It's 100 minus 13.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.080
 - Yeah. - So you lose that.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.800
 - So I don't know about that, but in... - Who's annoyed about 87?

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.840
 - Because it's 100 minus 13. - Look, Australian cricketers hate 87.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.800
 - Really? - And if they ever got that high against England,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.800
 they would be really upset about it.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.480
 - Yeah, there's some sledding. - Um, the year 404?

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.600
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.000
 - What a year. - AD, what is it?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.280
 - 404 AD. - Did it not exist?

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.320
 - It did exist. - Ah, OK.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.520
 - Last gladiator fight in Rome. - Really?

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.320
 - Apparently. - And it was alleged that St. Telemachus

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.880
 tried to stop the fight, the gladiator fight from happening,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.280
 and was stoned to death by the crowd.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.480
 - Oh. - And that...

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.080
 But supposedly that was the last fight that ever happened there.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.480
 I don't understand why it would be the last fight that happened there,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.920
 because they've just stoned someone to death.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.760
 - They're clearly very passionate about having the fight still. - Yeah? Yes.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.040
 Maybe too passionate, you know?

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.360
 You don't like football hooligans,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.240
 maybe they didn't like gladiator hooligans back then.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.720
 - Yeah. - It's like, "All right, we're gonna stop letting you watch this."

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.120
 - That's how you react. - There's a car called the Bristol 404.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.040
 - Oh, yeah? - Yep. - Does it exist?

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.560
 - Yes. But there are only nine. - Oh!

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.120
 - Okay. How come? - It's very old.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.200
 But there are still nine registered on British roads.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.840
 So if you try and search for that, you may find it.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.160
 But they're really expensive and they're mostly in private hands,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.960
 so I don't think you will find it.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.360
 I appreciate it. I've gone through the ball and the threshold here.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.400
 - Any more follow-ups? - Andy, before we went on stage night,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.640
 said, "I have a fact so boring

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.080
 "that I need to build up the bravery to say, 'Have we got to it yet?'"

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.720
 - No, we haven't got to it yet. - Oh, yeah?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:57.240
 - I'm sorry. - Talk a lot, people.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.840
 - There is a... - Just...

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.320
 James, you were talking about number E404, the road.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, E numbers in food.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.360
 - Oh, yeah, like additives. - Additives. There is an E404.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.800
 - Oh, yeah? - Does it exist?

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.240
 - Yes, it exists. - Right.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.520
 - I'm about to tell you in punishing detail what it is.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.320
 It's calcium alginate.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.120
 And it's a gelatinous, creamy substance derived from seaweed

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.880
 and used to dress wounds.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.280
 - OK. - And that's not the ball of flesh!

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.800
 Just wait!

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.480
 It sounds like something you might get at a Beatles party, that.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.040
 I think you should be dressing wounds with that.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.920
 - God, thank you. - How many? You haven't got 404 of these, have you?

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.040
 I haven't. I think I may be out of 404.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.800
 Maybe I'll talk about something else for a bit.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.600
 - You look crying, Shane. - OK.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.880
 - Shall we do what? Roads? - Oh, OK, yeah.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.120
 Cool. So, weird roads.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.200
 Hawaii has lots of roads that sort of only half exist,

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.360
 because they keep getting covered in lava.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.480
 - Oh! - And this is...

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.360
 I didn't actually realise that Mount Kilauea has been erupting

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.680
 basically solidly since 1983 in Hawaii.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.600
 So, it's just been spewing out lava.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.960
 It's had, like, a little break in 2018.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.640
 But then, in 2018, it suddenly had this, you know,

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.320
 it took a little break and then suddenly had this huge spew

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:23.320
 and ejected enough lava to fill 320,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.680
 - It buried an area half the size of Manhattan. - Wow.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.800
 And that includes quite a lot of roads.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.600
 And the road that suffers the most seems to be this road

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.880
 called the Chain of Craters Road,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.840
 which should have known what it was doing when it called itself that.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.880
 But, hang on, surely... I mean, sorry, layperson on roads here,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.160
 but don't you just leave the road for a bit and then paint over it

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.680
 and then you can drive along the top of the lava?

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.120
 I think if you're driving over, like, craters and boulders and stuff...

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.040
 Right, but a dried lava. Dried lava is not what you're making of.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.000
 It's quite bumpy. It's a bumpy road.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.160
 Have you ever been to a lava field where the lava's dried?

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.400
 - Absolutely not. - Oh, well...

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.040
 You wouldn't cycle over it and put it that way.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.320
 Also, they don't just paint roads.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.160
 It's like, let's get the paintbrush out and paint us a new road.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.600
 It's a lot that goes into it.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.160
 It just feels like lava would dry like asphalt.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.000
 - It doesn't... - I'm clearly wrong.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.720
 It's very lumpy. You'd need extremely good suspension.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.040
 Maybe in a monster truck or something, you can get gallivanting over it.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.240
 Right. Just put up a sign, "monster truck's only on this road."

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.160
 I was actually driving in Hawaii, I remembered,

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.400
 and there's a sign that says, "Beware, invisible cows."

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.040
 - Cool. - Isn't that cool?

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.360
 - But not ghost cows. - Not ghost cows, no.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.280
 Cows that are hiding in the... Is it the landscape underlates?

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.960
 I fear this might be a lot more boring than your guess.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.760
 It's basically a guess very misty there,

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.440
 and there's lots of cows that walk over the road,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.240
 so you can hit them without seeing them.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.600
 That's great. They could maybe change the terminology

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.720
 just to make you understand what you're looking out for.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.040
 - I agree with that. - Buckle up, kids.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.120
 There's some spooky ghost cows.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.800
 I got such a good email a few months ago from someone called Tom Wrecked.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.640
 So thanks for this, but he said, and I think he's just spotted this,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.560
 the road to Armageddon is...

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.480
 To drive to Armageddon, you have to go on roads 6, 6 and 6.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.680
 So Armageddon comes from Ha Megiddo, which means Mount Megiddo,

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.360
 and that's a place in Israel, Mount Megiddo,

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.000
 and if you drive there from Jerusalem or Tel Aviv or most places in Israel,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.720
 then you take, just by complete coincidence, take Route 6,

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.320
 and then you change onto Route 66.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.960
 - Amazing. - Isn't that cool?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.080
 - That is cool. - Does that mean anything?

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.720
 - Does that mean the world is going to end there? - I'll refer you to Robert Kylo,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.480
 who says the sort of creativity that goes into this is useless.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.200
 The mythology is due to the irrationality, denial of evidence,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.280
 and preference of the fairy tale over reality that is common in a human species.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.840
 - I'll say. - Thanks, Bob.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.720
 I found a few random road names, so like error 404, I was thinking, what else?

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.960
 So there's a road in Alabama called the St. Tit Road.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.760
 There's a place called Error Place, which is in Cincinnati, as well,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.480
 and then I got distracted because there were places like Wiener Cut-Off Road.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.240
 And then this is my favorite, Far From Poopin Road.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.800
 And this is a real road, and it's in a township called Fanny in America,

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.840
 and Fanny, obviously, meaning a bum in America, so Far From Poopin Road,

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.360
 and the reason it's called that is because it's the closest road

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.840
 that gets you to a place called Constipation Ridge.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.160
 And I went on Google Maps, and it's all there. It's all real.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.600
 - These are real places. - Any ideas why it's called that?

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.600
 The road is always blocked at Constipation Ridge.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.440
 All right, listen, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.800
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.120
 My fact this week is that in 2001 in Newfoundland,

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.000
 a golden retriever chased after a coyote and was never seen again.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.920
 Now, Newfoundland has its own population of white coyotes.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:06.400
 - What are you saying about this? - What am I implying?

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.160
 This was some research done by someone called Carl Zimmer,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.680
 who was looking into these amazing white coyotes in Newfoundland.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.440
 They don't exist anywhere else. They've sort of just appeared.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.520
 And they're not albino. They've still got pigment in their skin and in their eyes.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.760
 They've just got white fur, and they've looked at their genes,

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.920
 and they've found that they've got this specific mutation on a gene,

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.880
 and the other place, the other significant place,

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.360
 that this mutation on this specific gene exists, is in golden retrievers.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.520
 And it's what makes them yellow.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.120
 And in the same way it's what's making these coyotes white.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.560
 And Zimmer realised that in Newfoundland in March 2001,

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.120
 there are news reports of a guy whose golden retriever

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.480
 went galloping off down a hill after a coyote.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.000
 - It's beautiful. - It's quite sweet.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.560
 It could be a Disney film, couldn't it?

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.240
 They're called coy dogs, aren't they, when a coyote has sex with a dog?

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.880
 - Yeah. - And that's what they create.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.040
 And a coy carp, of course, is when a coyote has sex with a carp.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:05.480
 I only prized.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:14.360
 And in Mexico, they used to breed coy dogs on purpose in Teotihuacan,

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.000
 which is one of the main cities that they had in the Mayan area.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.920
 They would have the coyote and the dogs, they would make them together,

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.160
 and it meant that they had them as guardian animals.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.960
 So they were really fierce, but they were also loyal.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.280
 Oh, so it's a way of domestication, but crossing a domestic breed was something.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.920
 Yeah, so you still have something that's really fierce, like a coyote,

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.600
 but then you have the kind of domestic side of the dog.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.040
 - That's very clever. - Yeah, it's clever.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.120
 Nice.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.280
 You want to make sure you don't breed something that's like really pathetic,

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.120
 but also really fickle.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.280
 How do you know you're not going to get the opposite of both?

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.560
 - Yes. - Yeah, I am.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.480
 - That's the rescue take. - Yeah.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.000
 There's the coy wolf as well.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.760
 So that's a coyote wolf, obviously.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.960
 And wolf populations are dwindling,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.440
 and it seems like wolves basically got a bit less choosy

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.760
 in who they were mating with, and coyotes were spreading.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.480
 And it's also known as the eastern coyote, but it's definitely a cross.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.400
 It's 10% dog, 25% wolf, and the remainder is coyote, and they're big.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.320
 They're twice the size of a coyote, which is a fox size-ish.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.680
 Yeah, they basically coyotes kind of fill the plate.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.360
 In the UK, we get foxes kind of going in cities

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.240
 and kind of going in bins and stuff, and coyotes in America,

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.520
 especially North America, they kind of do that same thing there, don't they?

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.880
 Yeah, they're so good at navigating cities

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.520
 and generally adapting to human expansion.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.040
 I think they're the only carnivore that's growing.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.560
 Like, his populations are really growing exponentially everywhere,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.680
 even though Americans are trying to exterminate them

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.360
 because they're thought of as pests.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.640
 But, yeah, they do really well in cities, maybe even better than birds,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.360
 and they do this thing where they navigate the traffic brilliantly.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.920
 So they look both ways before crossing the street, very impressive.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.240
 They'll run across half a road and then stop in the middle

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.400
 because, you know, the traffic's coming the other direction,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.120
 sprint across the other way, and they even know if they come to a one-way street,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.920
 they only look in the direction that the traffic's coming from.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.040
 Also, just in terms of, like, let's say their populations are going up,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.000
 they do this crazy thing coyotes,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.640
 which is that they have the ability to change the number of the litter

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.080
 that they're going to give birth to based on the howls of a coyote.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.280
 So this is a thing where, let's say there are coyotes where they're being culled

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.080
 or they're being reduced by natural predators or because of humans,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.080
 they can do a call-out, so a male will be like, "Coyote call!"

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.800
 I can't remember how they speak, but...

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.800
 It's like that howl? Howl?

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.480
 - Yeah, I think they howl. - Coyote call!

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.360
 - Okay. - Like that.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.320
 So, yeah, so they do the howl.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.320
 And once they do that, they can understand, based on responses,

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.320
 what the population size is within the community.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.680
 - Oh, how interesting. - And so, if you, let's say,

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.360
 you were culling the coyote communities by 70%

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.920
 by the next time that they had given birth as in the time frame that they would need,

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.000
 they would be back up to the population size

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.360
 because they can jump from five to six litter that they would usually have

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.480
 up to 12 to 16.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.680
 This call causes an autogenic response, basically,

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.040
 and they can just up the numbers.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.440
 - It's unbelievable. - It's not interesting.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.360
 - It's unbelievable how clever they are. - Wow, it's magic.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.480
 It's like a hydra.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.360
 You just chop off its head and 17 more heads appear.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.520
 - Pretty much is, yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.480
 And they're very crafty, too. They're extremely wily.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.240
 So, wily coyote, obviously, cartoon character, but genuinely, they're wily.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.880
 So, there was a biologist called John Way

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.360
 who was trying to trap some for research purposes,

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.280
 and he found they would take the meat off the trap.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.280
 And they wouldn't spring it. Incredibly annoying.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.760
 Another scientist called Robert Crabtree was trying to find one in the late '90s,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.280
 and he had his own personal Moby Dick coyote which he could never get.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.200
 So annoying. It would dig up the trap and flip it over and then leave it alone.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.160
 That's how, you know...

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.120
 Or it would scrape off the dirt that he'd laid carefully on the trap.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.800
 It would poo on the trap and then leave it alone.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.080
 There's one time where I don't understand this fully.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.440
 Crabtree was in a helicopter trying to drop a net on this one specific coyote.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.760
 And it jumped up, tried to bite the helicopter, and then just ran away.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.520
 And he never caught it. He never caught it.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.960
 Is it that this coyote is really smart, or that this guy is pretty dumb?

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.840
 - Robert Crabtree. - If Robert Crabtree ever came up against a roadrunner, for instance, he's fucked.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.920
 Wily coyote. A lot of misconceptions in that cartoon, for example,

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.240
 coyotes can outrun roadrunners by twice the speed.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.200
 Makes no sense. It should be the other way round.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.280
 Who would have thought that wasn't a David Attenborough documentary I was watching?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.840
 OK, what do you think the E in Wily Coyote's name stands for?

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.560
 Oh, is it like, is it the European additives?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.680
 Yeah, E-404, calcium alginate is what?

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.440
 - No, it's actually Ethelred. - Edith.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.400
 Oh, so close. Ethelbert.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.520
 Oh, yeah, just, you know, it's not interesting, but worth it. Yeah, Ethelbert.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:13.120
 So the thing about them being Wily or Crabtree is just a conception of coyotes that's been around forever.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.320
 And so if you go, if you look back at Native American law, almost across America,

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.880
 before Europeans arrived there, they're known as kind of tricksters.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.760
 And they're probably the most important animal to a lot of Native American tribes.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.960
 One of the most important. And yeah, they're like this cheeky trickster.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.440
 Exactly the same as kind of Loki or Mercury.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.280
 I find it really interesting that in all mythology, we always have this naughty boy who's doing bad stuff.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.240
 He is a very naughty boy, though, the coyote in some Native American stories.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:48.320
 - Yeah. - There's a book called Tales of Coyote, The Trickster, American Indian Folklore.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.000
 And I read the reviews of it.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.960
 Someone said, "We bought this book for our fourth graders who are learning about folklore."

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.200
 We read reviews saying, "Great for all ages, but one quick peek into the book

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.760
 and you will quickly agree that is not great for all ages."

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:07.160
 There is literally a whole section about coyotes' amorous adventures.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.680
 The amount of times the word penis, vagina and horny,

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.600
 and other inappropriate euphemisms show up in this book, is alarming.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.240
 Four stars.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:23.200
 Killed the time very nicely while waiting for my god-o to arrive.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.400
 This doesn't sound like the traditional Native American historic coyote shout.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.720
 He had a detachable penis that he would send around to have sex with people, the coyote.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.040
 - Oh, the coyote, really? - Yeah.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.160
 - Candy. - Gosh.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.560
 There's one very cool story in Chinookun, which are people from Oregon, a tale,

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.320
 which is about how coyote learned to catch salmon.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:48.680
 And coyote... So coyote was actually a kind of half-person, half-coyote, sort of god-like figure.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.320
 And coyote defecates while trying to catch salmon,

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.400
 and his own feces start mocking him and laughing at him for how shit he is at fishing.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.560
 And he's like, "You're shit. No, you're shit."

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.720
 "I'm supposed to be."

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.240
 And then this blumber poo takes pity, offers him advice for how to catch,

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:12.240
 and how to cook salmon, which I don't know if you take culinary tips from a poo.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.400
 But he does, and then he succeeds for a while, then he fails again.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.800
 And so, as before, he thinks, "What am I going to do? Does another big poo?"

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.360
 And his poo tell gives him some more in-depth instructions this time

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.880
 for exactly how to fish and where to fish.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.800
 And, you know, that's how the coyote learned to fish.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.520
 - Wow, that sounds cool. - That sounds great. That's incredible.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.800
 There was another thing called coyote way, which was like coyote illness.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.480
 And the idea was that if you killed a coyote, or even if you touched a coyote,

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.240
 you could get this kind of weird illness.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.520
 Is it where cooties come from?

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.480
 No. I don't think.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.960
 I mean, I'm guessing that it's not, because that would be amazing.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.800
 But it's basically, if you touched this coyote, you would get this real illness.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.120
 The various things that could happen to you,

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.760
 you get a twisted mouth, cross-eyed vision,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.280
 loss of memory, fainting, mania, and prostitution.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:10.720
 - A bit of a cop twist at the end there. - Oh, no.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.480
 It's not my fault, Officer.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.840
 I touched a coyote earlier today.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.160
 I'm sure you can understand.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.440
 Mr. Hugh Grant, you're not...

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.600
 Coyotes have a lot of encounters with celebrities.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.520
 There are rashes of stories.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.960
 Yeah, rashes of stories about celebrity coyote encounters.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:37.200
 So, for example, in 2010, Rick Perry, who stood for president in 2016,

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.040
 he shot a coyote while on a jog, because it was threatening his puppy,

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.960
 and apparently he carries a pistol sometimes when going for a jog.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.680
 Is that like a coyote and Rick Perry having an...

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.760
 You know, it's an altercation rather than the meeting each other, isn't it?

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.680
 It's true. Yeah, it's not much of an encounter.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.040
 Well, in 2009, Ozzy Osbourne's pet Pomeranian dog was eaten by a coyote.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.680
 - No. - And he didn't hear it,

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.920
 because he was watching a Michael Jackson memorial show on TV.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.360
 Right. Oh, and that was live.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.640
 So, which means, if you're watching it, we all know where we were

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.520
 when Ozzy Osbourne's dog was eaten by a coyote.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.360
 - Exactly. - Where were you?

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.720
 I think very... Does anyone in this audience know where they were

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.000
 the day that Michael Jackson documentary has brought us life?

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.360
 No, exactly.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.200
 Okay, one more, one more.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:30.320
 In 2015, Steven Spielberg's sister Nancy was briefly spooked by a coyote.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.920
 And that is the boring fact.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:45.320
 All right, on that absolute solid piece of gold we are going to wrap up.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.160
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.640

 that we are currently mowing through.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.360
 It's the Nerd Immunity Tour.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.080
