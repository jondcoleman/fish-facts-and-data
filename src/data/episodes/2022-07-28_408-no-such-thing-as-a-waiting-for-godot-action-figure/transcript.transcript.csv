00:00:12,00:00:17,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:22,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Chesterfield.
00:00:22,00:00:27,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:27,00:00:29,>> My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:29,00:00:34,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:37,00:00:43,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:43,00:00:47,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:47,00:00:50,>> My fact is that one Japanese slang term for
00:00:50,00:00:56,"a retired husband is soraigomi, which literally translates as bulky waist."
00:00:56,00:00:59,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:59,00:01:01,>> That is two on the nose.
00:01:01,00:01:03,">> It's a lot, it's a lot."
00:01:03,00:01:06,>> Do you know this man affectionately or less affectionately?
00:01:06,00:01:10,>> I think tone of voice counts for a lot in these scenarios.
00:01:10,00:01:12,I don't think it's a completely affectionate term.
00:01:12,00:01:16,It's a phrase that I think maybe older people will know more than younger people
00:01:16,00:01:17,in Japan today.
00:01:17,00:01:20,I think it first came to prominence in the 90s and it was basically there at
00:01:20,00:01:25,"certainly at the time in Japan the very, very strong culture of working very hard."
00:01:25,00:01:27,A lot of quite traditional gender roles at the time.
00:01:27,00:01:31,"So you'd have, a husband might be working sort of 16 hours a day for 40 years."
00:01:31,00:01:35,"And then suddenly, he's retired and he's here all the time."
00:01:35,00:01:38,And this was the phrase that arose as a result of that.
00:01:38,00:01:43,">> Another one that they use is nureochiba, which means wet fallen leaves."
00:01:43,00:01:46,"And the idea is that if you have wet fallen leaves,"
00:01:46,00:01:50,they just stick to your shoes all the time and the husband is just sticking to
00:01:50,00:01:52,his wife annoyingly and she can't get rid of him.
00:01:52,00:01:54,>> That's so funny.
00:01:54,00:01:55,This is horrible.
00:01:55,00:02:02,>> So Japan has a very high population that is sitting above the sort of 90s even.
00:02:02,00:02:07,Like they have the second largest number of centenarians in their country.
00:02:07,00:02:10,That came out so weird out of my mouth.
00:02:10,00:02:13,Because I was saying centenarians and then I thought centaurs.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"And I thought, which one is it?"
00:02:15,00:02:16,And I got stuck halfway through.
00:02:16,00:02:18,>> It's both actually in Japan.
00:02:18,00:02:22,">> Yeah, a lot of old centaurs in Japan."
00:02:22,00:02:23,"Yeah, which is amazing."
00:02:23,00:02:24,>> What's the highest?
00:02:24,00:02:26,>> America has the most.
00:02:26,00:02:29,"So America has, from the article that I read, it was 97,000."
00:02:29,00:02:31,"This is a few years old, this article."
00:02:31,00:02:33,"Japan with 79,000."
00:02:33,00:02:39,"So Japan, it's six people for every 10,000 people in Japan."
00:02:39,00:02:42,We'll make it to 100 and above.
00:02:42,00:02:43,">> Okay, is that high, yeah."
00:02:43,00:02:46,">> So proportionally, I think it's Japan, surely?"
00:02:46,00:02:47,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:47,00:02:49,">> Fortunately, Japan's got the highest number."
00:02:49,00:02:51,">> Thing is though, centaurs do live long."
00:02:51,00:02:54,So it's not really as impressive as you think.
00:02:54,00:02:57,">> But it does lead to, I mean, there's a lot of retirement about it in Japan."
00:02:57,00:03:01,"And basically, there are a lot of free hours to fill after you hit 65 or 70."
00:03:01,00:03:02,">> Well, you can always go to the leisure center."
00:03:02,00:03:09,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:09,00:03:11,>> I did not deserve even that sarcastic rather.
00:03:11,00:03:13,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:13,00:03:15,>> But they have lots of activities.
00:03:15,00:03:19,"So for example, Japan loves rugby, there's a hugely popular sport there."
00:03:19,00:03:22,"But they have 120,000 rugby players, give or take."
00:03:22,00:03:27,"10,000 of them are over the edge of 40, which impressive enough as a contact sport."
00:03:27,00:03:31,There was one rugby club in Japan which has three over 90-year-old players.
00:03:31,00:03:32,>> Come on.
00:03:32,00:03:33,">> Genuinely, genuinely."
00:03:33,00:03:34,>> No way.
00:03:34,00:03:36,>> There was an interview with a few of them.
00:03:36,00:03:38,One of them was called Ryuichi Nagayama.
00:03:38,00:03:40,And he said he found it an enormous amount of fun.
00:03:40,00:03:45,"He said, since I joined, I have broken ribs many times and broke my collarbone too."
00:03:45,00:03:46,I can't stand not playing.
00:03:46,00:03:50,He said it would kill him if he stopped playing because he loves it so much.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"Well, it sounds like it would kill him if he keeps playing."
00:03:52,00:03:55,">> Yeah, I'm just picturing a crumbled heap of bones right now."
00:03:55,00:03:57,>> It's very impressive.
00:03:57,00:04:00,">> Yeah, there was a story which I imagine,"
00:04:00,00:04:03,it sounds like one of those stories that must slightly be fake.
00:04:03,00:04:08,"But from what I can read is true, which is that the sales of adult nappies"
00:04:08,00:04:10,are overtaking the sales of children's nappies.
00:04:10,00:04:12,">> They are, that's definitely true."
00:04:12,00:04:16,">> Which is amazing, that's just, there's your indication about the difference"
00:04:16,00:04:19,"in population in Japan, more adults and nappies than babies."
00:04:19,00:04:23,">> And it's not just the old ones, sometimes it's just convenient, you know?"
00:04:23,00:04:25,>> How do you think we lasted an hour up here?
00:04:25,00:04:29,>> Yeah.
00:04:29,00:04:32,">> They do have a Japan problem with dementia, as lots of countries do,"
00:04:32,00:04:36,but Japan particularly obviously with its massively aging population.
00:04:36,00:04:41,And there's been some kind of cool initiatives to deal with that.
00:04:41,00:04:44,So one of them is that there is a restaurant in Tokyo called
00:04:44,00:04:47,The Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.
00:04:47,00:04:51,And it's where the waiting staff is comprised entirely of people suffering
00:04:51,00:04:55,"from dementia, and so- >> What?"
00:04:55,00:04:59,>> My God.
00:04:59,00:05:03,">> It's great, the restaurant openly says that you as a customer may or"
00:05:03,00:05:04,may not get what you order.
00:05:04,00:05:07,>> Wow.
00:05:07,00:05:09,>> We guarantee it's delicious.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"Yeah, the chefs do not have dementia."
00:05:11,00:05:12,>> Right.
00:05:12,00:05:14,">> Yeah, it's great, and it's so good."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"And it just allows people, it's sort of based on this idea that there's a lot"
00:05:17,00:05:21,"of misunderstanding of dementia, people think you're incapable of doing anything."
00:05:21,00:05:24,"Whereas actually, people are capable of doing lots of stuff."
00:05:24,00:05:25,They just can't remember a lot.
00:05:25,00:05:28,And so it encourages a lot of open discussion about it and
00:05:28,00:05:30,gives them something to occupy them.
00:05:30,00:05:33,">> Yeah, it's a great idea, but probably not for"
00:05:33,00:05:35,"whoever runs a business, right?"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"It doesn't feel like- >> Well, people love it."
00:05:37,00:05:38,>> Yeah. >> I bloody love it.
00:05:38,00:05:40,I hate having to choose what I want in a restaurant.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"If I could know that, I could just say a random thing on the menu and"
00:05:42,00:05:45,"it didn't make a blind bit of difference, I'd go there."
00:05:45,00:05:50,>> I read about these three women in Japan that called the monkey busters.
00:05:50,00:05:52,Did you come across those guys?
00:05:52,00:05:56,"So there are a lot of areas of Japan, especially in the rural areas where you"
00:05:56,00:06:00,get the monkeys and they will come down and try and steal stuff from people and
00:06:00,00:06:01,all that kind of thing.
00:06:01,00:06:09,"And so this group of three women, 174, 168 and 167, have formed the monkey buster group."
00:06:09,00:06:12,"And if you see the monkeys coming along, if they're trying to damage your"
00:06:12,00:06:17,"fields and stuff or whatever, then you call the monkey busters and they come down."
00:06:17,00:06:18,>> How quickly do they come down?
00:06:18,00:06:24,">> Well, nearby then quickly, if they're down the road, it might take a few minutes."
00:06:24,00:06:28,">> Right, so funny, and when they get there, do they shoot the monkeys?"
00:06:28,00:06:28,Do they trap the monkeys?
00:06:28,00:06:31,">> They don't shoot the monkeys, they shoot over the monkeys' heads."
00:06:31,00:06:34,>> Wow. >> Like they do warning shots to the monkeys.
00:06:34,00:06:36,Firecrackers is the other thing they use sometimes.
00:06:36,00:06:38,">> Oh, nice, that's great."
00:06:38,00:06:41,">> That's a great thing to do once you retire, just go around scaring monkeys."
00:06:41,00:06:44,">> I'd like it as a career, monkey busting."
00:06:44,00:06:45,I'm sure someone would pay me for that.
00:06:45,00:06:49,>> You guys heard of Yui Chiromura.
00:06:49,00:06:52,">> No, he's not. >> So he is a sportsman, he's Japanese,"
00:06:52,00:06:58,and he is interesting partly because of what he's done since your classic retirement age.
00:06:58,00:07:01,"He was the oldest person in the world to climb Mount Everest, he climbed to age 70."
00:07:01,00:07:05,"Then five years after that, he did it again at the age of 75."
00:07:05,00:07:07,He's done it again at the age of 80.
00:07:07,00:07:10,So he's become the oldest person to climb Everest three times in a row.
00:07:10,00:07:11,">> Wow. >> The high point of his career,"
00:07:11,00:07:19,"I reckon, in his 40s, he skied down Mount Everest with a parachute on his back"
00:07:19,00:07:22,"so he could slow himself down. >> Okay, wow."
00:07:22,00:07:24,">> It's unbelievable, there was a film made about it in 1975."
00:07:24,00:07:27,"I don't think we've mentioned this before, but I've never heard of it before."
00:07:27,00:07:28,">> No, did he go from the top?"
00:07:28,00:07:32,">> He went from very, very high up. >> Okay."
00:07:32,00:07:36,">> I don't know if you went from the exact, I don't know if you went, I think he did."
00:07:36,00:07:38,">> I thought it was. >> It can't be the top, no, it's too."
00:07:38,00:07:41,>> It's too much. >> There's too much going on there.
00:07:41,00:07:44,">> There are lots of crevasses, he nearly died many times on the way down."
00:07:44,00:07:47,He went 160 kilometers an hour on the way down.
00:07:47,00:07:50,>> Wow. >> The parachute didn't work at first.
00:07:50,00:07:51,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:51,00:07:57,">> He was sliding towards this huge crevass, and eventually the parachute kind of kicked in."
00:07:57,00:07:59,>> My God. >> He's a hero.
00:07:59,00:08:03,">> But I love, because you go past all the crevasses going, fucking, come on, parachute."
00:08:03,00:08:06,"When it finally does deploy, parachutes, of course, rip you back."
00:08:06,00:08:07,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:07,00:08:10,>> Coming to do all the crevasses all the way down.
00:08:10,00:08:13,>> I don't think it sails you back up to the top.
00:08:13,00:08:17,">> He's still there, he's still there, just on a loop, yeah."
00:08:17,00:08:23,">> Because they have such an aging population, they have a problem with elderly drivers."
00:08:23,00:08:28,And they're trying to do a thing where they're trying to get older people to hand back the driving licence.
00:08:28,00:08:30,There's a few ways they've tried to do this.
00:08:30,00:08:34,There was a 97-year-old Buddhist priest who handed over his driving licence.
00:08:34,00:08:38,"The idea was, if he did it, maybe he would encourage other people to do it."
00:08:38,00:08:41,"There's some areas where they'll give you cheap ramen, 15% off your ramen,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,if you hand in your driving licence.
00:08:43,00:08:47,">> It's good, ironically, it'll stop you ramen anyone else with your car."
00:08:47,00:08:48,>> Aah.
00:08:48,00:08:52,">> Very uncertain about that, just to fit."
00:08:52,00:08:58,>> And there's also a funeral home in Tokyo that's offering a 15% discount
00:08:58,00:09:01,on the cost of a funeral if you hand in your driving licence.
00:09:01,00:09:04,">> Aah, that's very good."
00:09:04,00:09:07,">> Yeah, we're gonna have to move on in a sec, sorry, next sec."
00:09:07,00:09:11,>> I'll give you a couple of sayings or phrases in Japanese
00:09:11,00:09:12,if you can guess what they mean.
00:09:12,00:09:13,>> OK.
00:09:13,00:09:16,">> Bakudo hage, which means barcode baldy."
00:09:16,00:09:17,Do you know what that means?
00:09:17,00:09:20,>> Is that someone with a comb-over who's...
00:09:20,00:09:23,">> He's got it, yeah."
00:09:23,00:09:26,"Really obvious comb-over, you're a barcode baldy."
00:09:26,00:09:29,"By the window tribe, do you know what they are?"
00:09:29,00:09:30,>> By the window tribe.
00:09:30,00:09:32,>> That is Madogiwa Zoku.
00:09:32,00:09:33,>> By the window tribe.
00:09:33,00:09:37,">> People who are underemployed, nosy parkers,"
00:09:37,00:09:40,sit by their windows spying on their neighbours.
00:09:40,00:09:43,>> Underemployed was close.
00:09:43,00:09:46,"So it's people who've been promoted to quite a senior level,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,but they don't really do anything decent.
00:09:48,00:09:52,So they just sit there by the window looking out of the window.
00:09:52,00:09:54,And here's one more.
00:09:54,00:10:00,"Kairo no sura ni shomben, which means piss on a frog's face."
00:10:00,00:10:02,>> That's just good advice.
00:10:02,00:10:03,>> Is it like a frog's face is bad enough?
00:10:03,00:10:05,The piss on it is even worse.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"If you're piss on a frog's face, do the lowest of the low."
00:10:07,00:10:08,>> That's a good guess.
00:10:08,00:10:12,It's someone who is a little bit slow and isn't affected by anything.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"So whatever you say to them, they'll just sit there going,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"""Yeah, fine, whatever."""
00:10:16,00:10:19,"And this is due to a theory, which I don't think is true,"
00:10:19,00:10:22,"that if you piss on a frog, it just sits there."
00:10:22,00:10:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:26,00:10:28,>> My neighbour has tadpoles in their garden
00:10:28,00:10:29,that are just turning into frogs.
00:10:29,00:10:30,And I am going to try that.
00:10:30,00:10:33,I'm going to be squashing over the fence next week.
00:10:33,00:10:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:35,00:10:38,">> OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:10:38,00:10:44,"My fact this week is that in 1969, Samuel Beckett wrote a play"
00:10:44,00:10:50,that lasts 35 seconds long and features no actors or any dialogue.
00:10:50,00:10:51,The play is still performed today
00:10:51,00:10:55,and has even been adapted into a movie.
00:10:55,00:10:56,This is an amazing thing.
00:10:56,00:10:58,"Samuel Beckett, waiting for Godot,"
00:10:58,00:11:01,"one of the great playwrights and novelists,"
00:11:01,00:11:04,"he was called upon by Kenneth Tynan,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"who was an amazing journalist and writer, critic in London,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,"famously first person to say, ""Fuck!"" on television."
00:11:10,00:11:12,>> Dan. >> Sorry.
00:11:12,00:11:13,>> That's all right.
00:11:13,00:11:15,">> First person to say anything, fucking Chesterfield."
00:11:15,00:11:16,>> Dan.
00:11:16,00:11:20,">> So in 1969, he was putting on a play called ""O Calcutta,"""
00:11:20,00:11:24,and the idea was he wanted to invite a lot of very famous people
00:11:24,00:11:27,"to contribute to this play, but he was going to keep them anonymous."
00:11:27,00:11:30,So he wrote to Samuel Beckett. Samuel Beckett agreed to do it.
00:11:30,00:11:32,"And the story goes is that he wrote this entire play,"
00:11:32,00:11:37,"which lasts 35 seconds long, onto a postcard and mailed it to him."
00:11:37,00:11:41,So he received the entire play on this postcard.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"And then it was put on, but Beckett was very upset"
00:11:44,00:11:46,"because when the play was eventually put on by Tynan,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,he added extra stuff into the 35-second-long play.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"And he was like, ""Don't touch my play, you dick!"""
00:11:52,00:11:53,And yeah.
00:11:53,00:11:57,">> So what happened was ""O Calcutta"" was an erotic review."
00:11:57,00:11:59,So there were going to be loads of these little mini plays
00:11:59,00:12:00,that were kind of erotic plays.
00:12:00,00:12:04,"And when Beckett sent this stuff to Tynan on the postcard,"
00:12:04,00:12:07,it was basically just a load of clutter on the stage.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"The lights go on, off, on, off,"
00:12:09,00:12:12,and there's breathing that goes with the on and off.
00:12:12,00:12:14,"And then at the end, there's a little bit of baby crying."
00:12:14,00:12:16,That's it. And the whole point of it is it's a joke
00:12:16,00:12:19,because everyone's expecting something really sexy
00:12:19,00:12:21,and you get something really lame. That's the whole point.
00:12:21,00:12:25,But what they decided to do was to add some naked people into it.
00:12:25,00:12:27,">> Well, it's an erotic review."
00:12:27,00:12:28,"Let's just have all of that stuff,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,but with some naked people on stage.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"And yeah, he was absolutely furious, wasn't he?"
00:12:32,00:12:34,">> Yeah, that's so annoying, to face the objects."
00:12:34,00:12:38,">> Exactly. Beckett's very difficult, I have to say."
00:12:38,00:12:39,">> Yeah, I agree."
00:12:39,00:12:41,">> Really, really difficult to understand."
00:12:41,00:12:44,>> You need an interval. Was there an interval in this one?
00:12:44,00:12:46,[laughter]
00:12:46,00:12:49,>> It was part of the sketch within a bigger thing.
00:12:49,00:12:51,So there was lots of different places going on.
00:12:51,00:12:54,"When it's now performed on stage, it's a two-hander."
00:12:54,00:12:59,"So it's like when we tour live, we do a first half to our show."
00:12:59,00:13:01,We do close to 50 minutes.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Beckett's is 35 seconds.
00:13:02,00:13:04,And then there's an intermission for beers
00:13:04,00:13:06,and then you get a full play on the second half.
00:13:06,00:13:08,">> Oh, you get a Beckett in the second half?"
00:13:08,00:13:10,>> Yeah. Beckett was maybe the most Beckett.
00:13:10,00:13:12,The most famous Beckett.
00:13:12,00:13:13,>> Andy! Sorry.
00:13:13,00:13:16,">> Andy was the first person to say Beckett on TV, wasn't he?"
00:13:16,00:13:18,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:18,00:13:20,It was my father's terrible audition tape.
00:13:20,00:13:22,Didn't get it.
00:13:22,00:13:26,">> Maybe the most famous play of his, ""Waiting for Godot"""
00:13:26,00:13:29,"famously described as a play in which nothing happens twice,"
00:13:29,00:13:30,which is kind of true.
00:13:30,00:13:33,"And it was written in French, which I didn't know."
00:13:33,00:13:35,He was a very international writer.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"He traveled around a lot, lived in France for decades."
00:13:37,00:13:40,But it was first produced in Blackpool in 1956.
00:13:40,00:13:44,And it's a pretty aggressively modernist play now.
00:13:44,00:13:46,And Blackpool in 1956 was not ready for it.
00:13:46,00:13:48,[laughter]
00:13:48,00:13:52,Incredible. This was still an era where all British plays
00:13:52,00:13:54,"had to go through the Lord Chamberlain's office,"
00:13:54,00:13:56,the official censor of all theatre.
00:13:56,00:13:59,And an agent called C.W. Herriot
00:13:59,00:14:01,saw it on behalf of the Lord Chamberlain
00:14:01,00:14:03,"to say which bits shouldn't, shouldn't be allowed."
00:14:03,00:14:07,And said he had been through two hours of angry boredom.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"The man next to him had fled the theatre saying,"
00:14:09,00:14:12,"""Let me out of this."""
00:14:12,00:14:14,Several women were apologising to their escorts
00:14:14,00:14:17,for having suggested a visit to such a piece.
00:14:17,00:14:20,And he also requested that they cut the bit
00:14:20,00:14:21,where Estragon's trousers fall down.
00:14:21,00:14:24,[laughter]
00:14:24,00:14:26,"He actually, it's quite interesting reading his notes."
00:14:26,00:14:29,"'Cause I kind of warmed to him, to Herriot."
00:14:29,00:14:33,'Cause he basically is saying it's really boring and pointless.
00:14:33,00:14:35,Not that it's too crude.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"And actually with Estragon's trousers to be fair to him,"
00:14:37,00:14:41,"he says, ""On the business of letting down Estragon's trousers,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"""I suppose that may be a right. Better keep."""
00:14:43,00:14:47,"You know, he thinks that's a bit fucking weird, but whatever."
00:14:47,00:14:49,I thought this was quite learned of him.
00:14:49,00:14:56,"He censored the words 'Gono Kokus' and 'Spiru Cayete', which, yeah."
00:14:56,00:15:00,"- What's 'Gono Kokus'? - It's some kind of magic trick, doesn't it?"
00:15:00,00:15:03,"'Gono Kokus' does not sound like a magic trick, does it?"
00:15:03,00:15:06,"It sounds like a spell from Harry Potter, doesn't it?"
00:15:06,00:15:07,'Gono Kokus'!
00:15:07,00:15:11,I think you're demanding a Derren Brown refund
00:15:11,00:15:14,if he's done 'Gono Kokus' on you.
00:15:14,00:15:16,It's presumably a bacterium of some kind.
00:15:16,00:15:18,They're both microbes.
00:15:18,00:15:21,"So it's the micro, the bacterium of gonorrhea is one of them"
00:15:21,00:15:23,and the bacterium of syphilis is the other.
00:15:23,00:15:25,But he went to the trouble of looking in a dictionary
00:15:25,00:15:27,to check up on those words.
00:15:27,00:15:29,- Right. - It's a good on-in.
00:15:29,00:15:31,Do you know you can get a Godot action figure?
00:15:31,00:15:33,"- Oh, cool. - Yeah, except it's on Etsy"
00:15:33,00:15:35,and it's just an empty package.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"- Cos you've got to... - You've already written, it never arrives."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"That's it! It's all got five-star reviews on Etsy,"
00:15:42,00:15:44,"apart from one person who says, ""I paid for expedited shipping"
00:15:44,00:15:48,"""and I still have not received the item."""
00:15:48,00:15:50,Brilliant. I love that.
00:15:50,00:15:54,"Those, he was once asked by the director, Alan Schneider."
00:15:54,00:15:56,"Beckett was once asked, ""Who is Godot?"""
00:15:56,00:16:00,"And Beckett answered, ""If I knew, I would have said so in the play."""
00:16:00,00:16:02,- Wow. - That's great.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- How does that mystery, wasn't he? - Yeah."
00:16:04,00:16:06,"Just genuinely, a very mysterious man."
00:16:06,00:16:08,He won the Nobel Prize for Literature.
00:16:08,00:16:10,You'd think he'd be happy about that.
00:16:10,00:16:12,He said it was a catastrophe. His wife said it was a catastrophe.
00:16:12,00:16:16,He refused to go to the prize-giving because he was on holiday.
00:16:16,00:16:19,"And his publisher wrote, ""Dear Sam and Suzanne."""
00:16:19,00:16:21,"That was his wife. ""In spite of everything,"
00:16:21,00:16:24,"""they have given you the Nobel Prize. I advise you to go into hiding."""
00:16:24,00:16:28,And it's the most eminent prize in the world.
00:16:28,00:16:31,"Anyway, he seemed absolutely furious about it,"
00:16:31,00:16:35,"although someone did write to him a message from a Mr. George Godot,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"got in touch with him and said, ""Sorry to keep you waiting."""
00:16:37,00:16:40,- Hey! - Which he must have hated.
00:16:40,00:16:43,I bet he cracked a secret smile at that.
00:16:43,00:16:45,And then just hated himself for it.
00:16:45,00:16:50,He's famously the only Nobel Prize winner to have played first-class cricket.
00:16:50,00:16:53,That's a quiz question that comes up quite a lot.
00:16:53,00:16:58,"He played for Dublin University against Northamptonshire,"
00:16:58,00:16:59,and he played two games.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"And for some reason, there was just this arbitrary thing where they said,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"""Okay, this is a proper professional game now,"
00:17:04,00:17:07,"""and all these other games aren't proper professional games."""
00:17:07,00:17:10,And that's why it counts that he played first-class cricket.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"But actually, when you read the articles about the matches,"
00:17:12,00:17:16,it turns out that his team were absolutely shit.
00:17:16,00:17:19,And there's no reason at all they should have been a first-class team.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"Like, the first game they played,"
00:17:21,00:17:26,"the article begins with, ""The university men are by no means a first-class side."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"""They are keen and enthusiastic, but their batting was poor,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"""their bowling presented no terrors,"
00:17:30,00:17:33,"""and their fielding would have been improved by alertness."""
00:17:33,00:17:35,- Right. - Right.
00:17:35,00:17:39,"In the second game they played, a year later, it said in the newspaper,"
00:17:39,00:17:41,"""They are weak in all departments of the game,"
00:17:41,00:17:45,"""and the university were outclassed from start to finish."""
00:17:45,00:17:47,Maybe he liked that. He hated the good reviews.
00:17:47,00:17:49,Maybe he loved the absolute subject.
00:17:49,00:17:52,We're going to have to move on in a sec to our next item.
00:17:52,00:17:55,We haven't mentioned that he was friends with James Joyce
00:17:55,00:17:57,and used to wear shoes that were too small for him
00:17:57,00:17:59,because he wanted to be like James Joyce.
00:17:59,00:18:01,We haven't mentioned that he was in the resistance
00:18:01,00:18:05,during the Second World War and almost got killed by the Nazis.
00:18:05,00:18:09,We haven't mentioned the fact that he was stabbed by a pimp in Paris.
00:18:09,00:18:11,All this stuff. We've got to move on.
00:18:11,00:18:13,- Was he wearing shoes that were the same size as James Joyce's shoes?
00:18:13,00:18:16,Or did James Joyce also wear shoes that were too small for him?
00:18:16,00:18:18,- Same thing. - Same thing.
00:18:18,00:18:20,- That's my question. - That's why he is.
00:18:20,00:18:23,He wanted to wear the same shoes as James Joyce.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"James Joyce had very narrow feet,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"and so he wore these shoes that were really, really narrow,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,even though they didn't fit him.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"He also, like, would only drink white wine"
00:18:31,00:18:33,because James Joyce drunk white wine
00:18:33,00:18:34,and just wanted to be like James Joyce.
00:18:34,00:18:36,Because that's so needy.
00:18:36,00:18:39,Imagine how oppressed you'd feel if your mate was like that.
00:18:39,00:18:40,"You know, you dump them."
00:18:40,00:18:43,"I think they had it falling out, and it's probably because of that."
00:18:43,00:18:45,They claimed it was because James Joyce's daughter fancied him
00:18:45,00:18:47,and he didn't return her affections.
00:18:47,00:18:50,But I think it was the weird wine-drinking shoe-wearing shit.
00:18:50,00:18:53,- I think you might be right. - Can I tell you quickly?
00:18:53,00:18:57,"Just back to O'Calcutta, the play that Beckett submitted,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,"this breathe it was called, the play to,"
00:19:00,00:19:02,Kenneth Tinnon wrote to a lot of famous people
00:19:02,00:19:04,to try and get them to submit a thing.
00:19:04,00:19:06,And one of the people he wrote to was John Lennon.
00:19:06,00:19:08,"And again, it was meant to be all anonymous,"
00:19:08,00:19:12,but apparently this is known that John Lennon did submit a sketch.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"So he wrote a sketch about masturbation,"
00:19:14,00:19:19,and it was based on his time when he used to masturbate
00:19:19,00:19:21,amongst his friends at a party.
00:19:21,00:19:23,- This is the sketch right now. - Okay.
00:19:23,00:19:26,Paul McCartney verifies this story
00:19:26,00:19:28,"because in a biography on Paul McCartney,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"called ""Many Years From Now"", this is what he says."
00:19:31,00:19:33,Apologies for whatever that to say.
00:19:33,00:19:37,We used to have wanking sessions
00:19:37,00:19:41,when we were young at Nigel Wally's house in Walton.
00:19:41,00:19:43,We'd stay over night and we'd sit in armchairs
00:19:43,00:19:46,"and we'd put out all the lights and being teenage pubescent boys,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,we'd all wank.
00:19:48,00:19:52,"What we used to do, someone would say, ""Bridge at Bardot."
00:19:52,00:19:55,"Ooh, that would keep everyone on par."""
00:19:55,00:19:58,"Then somebody probably, John, would say, ""Winston Churchill."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"Oh, no!"""
00:20:00,00:20:04,And it would completely ruin everyone's concentration.
00:20:04,00:20:08,"So, John, yeah, submitted a wanking play to old Calcutta."
00:20:08,00:20:10,- That actually does sound like a really fun game. - Yeah.
00:20:10,00:20:13,"- So, the wanking bit. - Yeah."
00:20:13,00:20:16,I only wish I knew any Beatles songs
00:20:16,00:20:18,because there must be some puns in that summer.
00:20:18,00:20:20,"Yeah, come together."
00:20:20,00:20:28,"Okay, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:20:28,00:20:31,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:20:31,00:20:36,"Okay, my fact this week is that the European road, called E-404,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,doesn't exist.
00:20:38,00:20:42,Have you searched for it?
00:20:42,00:20:47,"Yes, I have. It definitely doesn't exist."
00:20:47,00:20:50,"It was in 1995, the European Parliament decided"
00:20:50,00:20:53,they were going to build the E-404.
00:20:53,00:20:55,"It was near Zebrugge in Belgium,"
00:20:55,00:20:59,"and they decided they were going to build it, and they just never did."
00:20:59,00:21:03,"And so now, if you try to go onto the E-404, plug it into your sat-nav,"
00:21:03,00:21:04,it will just give you an error message.
00:21:04,00:21:06,- That's brilliant. - So good.
00:21:06,00:21:10,Do you know if it predates the E-404 message?
00:21:10,00:21:14,"- 1995, it would not just about it. - But it's closed."
00:21:14,00:21:15,"- It's there and thereabouts, yeah. - Yeah, it's closed."
00:21:15,00:21:18,"So, the E-404 message, which is where you go on the computer"
00:21:18,00:21:21,"and you search for a website and it's not there,"
00:21:21,00:21:25,"that was invented by Tim Berners-Lee around the start of the internet,"
00:21:25,00:21:29,"so that will be around the late 80s and the 90s, something like that."
00:21:29,00:21:31,"- So, it probably doesn't, yeah. - Yeah."
00:21:31,00:21:34,There's a rumor that it was because there was a room at CERN
00:21:34,00:21:37,"where they were working on the worldwide web called Room E-404,"
00:21:37,00:21:38,but it's not true.
00:21:38,00:21:42,"- No. - And one of the founders, Robert Caillio,"
00:21:42,00:21:46,"Tim Berners-Lee's colleague, was asked about it, that thing, the room,"
00:21:46,00:21:50,"and he said, ""I don't even have a hunch about the E-404 fascination,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,"""and frankly, I don't give a damn."
00:21:51,00:21:56,"""The sort of creativity that goes into E-404, the response pages, is fairly useless."
00:21:56,00:21:59,"""The mythology is probably due to the irrationality"
00:21:59,00:22:02,"""deny of evidence and preference for the fairytale over reality"
00:22:02,00:22:04,"""that is quite common in the human species."""
00:22:04,00:22:08,"- Oh, my God! - Wow!"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"- But actually, like, barrel of lard. - Actually, like, barrel of lard."
00:22:10,00:22:12,"- Robert Caillio, isn't he? - Oh, what fun."
00:22:12,00:22:15,Four or four pages are really important at the start of the internet
00:22:15,00:22:17,because it meant that you could search for something
00:22:17,00:22:21,"and if you've got the wrong thing, it would just give you something basic."
00:22:21,00:22:24,"You knew what you were going to get, otherwise it could go in some kind of weird loop"
00:22:24,00:22:26,"and you never, you know, it was a really, really important part"
00:22:26,00:22:29,when they were kind of putting the networks together.
00:22:29,00:22:31,"- Right. - It's not puppy-interesting, James, that's his point."
00:22:31,00:22:36,And the fact that you're bothering to discuss it is a waste of his time and yours.
00:22:36,00:22:39,"Look, the number four was always used at the start of errors"
00:22:39,00:22:43,"when they were user-created errors and they would have four or one, four or two."
00:22:43,00:22:45,Are you trying to make this? Isn't it interesting?
00:22:45,00:22:49,"I find that very interesting and there's a better theory about where four or four comes from,"
00:22:49,00:22:52,which is that in 1989 they were working on this.
00:22:52,00:22:56,"There was a flight, Flight 404, that went missing and it was never found."
00:22:56,00:22:59,And so they may have heard on the radio the four or fours might be found.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"And yes, in 1990 there was another Flight 404 which crashed."
00:23:02,00:23:04,So there were two Flight 404s which went wrong.
00:23:04,00:23:07,- And so... - Coincidence?
00:23:07,00:23:08,"- Yes. - Possibly, yes."
00:23:08,00:23:09,- Yes. - Yes.
00:23:09,00:23:17,"See, I grew up in Hong Kong and four is a very unlucky number in Asia."
00:23:17,00:23:20,"- It means death or something? - Yeah, four ""s"" sounds like it."
00:23:20,00:23:22,"Which means death and yes, it's the same sound."
00:23:22,00:23:26,So room 404 in any hotel does not exist.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"- Let's say for a hotel room 404s. - Oh, yeah."
00:23:29,00:23:31,And it's really interesting because 404 doesn't exist.
00:23:31,00:23:33,So obviously the whole of four doesn't exist.
00:23:33,00:23:35,So you lose floor four.
00:23:35,00:23:37,You would lose floor 13 as well.
00:23:37,00:23:41,"But you also, because 13, for any foreign people who are coming in,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,they keep to the superstition for foreign builders.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"- You got one, two, three, five through to 12. - Yeah."
00:23:46,00:23:50,But then you would also lose any floors that would have four in the number itself.
00:23:50,00:23:53,"So 24, 34."
00:23:53,00:23:57,"- In a 100-floor building, it's actually only about 80 floors"
00:23:57,00:24:01,once you minus all the floors. - Does it go from 12 to 15?
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- Because 14 has a floor in it? - Yes, it does."
00:24:03,00:24:05,"Are they cheating? You know how they claim to have,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,"in that part of the world, a lot of the tallest buildings in the world,"
00:24:08,00:24:09,do you think that they're actually quite squat?
00:24:09,00:24:11,- Yes. - They're just skipped out loads of floors.
00:24:11,00:24:14,- The Sturge Alcalifa is actually only three floors high.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"- It's a bungalow, isn't it? - Yeah."
00:24:17,00:24:19,"Also 87 is bad luck in Australia, I think."
00:24:19,00:24:21,- Is it right? - It's 100 minus 13.
00:24:21,00:24:23,- Yeah. - So you lose that.
00:24:23,00:24:27,"- So I don't know about that, but in... - Who's annoyed about 87?"
00:24:27,00:24:31,"- Because it's 100 minus 13. - Look, Australian cricketers hate 87."
00:24:31,00:24:33,"- Really? - And if they ever got that high against England,"
00:24:33,00:24:35,they would be really upset about it.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"- Yeah, there's some sledding. - Um, the year 404?"
00:24:39,00:24:40,"- Oh, yeah. - Oh."
00:24:40,00:24:42,"- What a year. - AD, what is it?"
00:24:42,00:24:44,- 404 AD. - Did it not exist?
00:24:44,00:24:46,"- It did exist. - Ah, OK."
00:24:46,00:24:48,- Last gladiator fight in Rome. - Really?
00:24:48,00:24:52,- Apparently. - And it was alleged that St. Telemachus
00:24:52,00:24:54,"tried to stop the fight, the gladiator fight from happening,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,and was stoned to death by the crowd.
00:24:57,00:24:58,- Oh. - And that...
00:24:58,00:25:01,But supposedly that was the last fight that ever happened there.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"I don't understand why it would be the last fight that happened there,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,because they've just stoned someone to death.
00:25:04,00:25:07,- They're clearly very passionate about having the fight still. - Yeah? Yes.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"Maybe too passionate, you know?"
00:25:09,00:25:10,"You don't like football hooligans,"
00:25:10,00:25:12,maybe they didn't like gladiator hooligans back then.
00:25:12,00:25:14,"- Yeah. - It's like, ""All right, we're gonna stop letting you watch this."""
00:25:14,00:25:18,- That's how you react. - There's a car called the Bristol 404.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"- Oh, yeah? - Yep. - Does it exist?"
00:25:20,00:25:23,- Yes. But there are only nine. - Oh!
00:25:23,00:25:27,- Okay. How come? - It's very old.
00:25:27,00:25:29,But there are still nine registered on British roads.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"So if you try and search for that, you may find it."
00:25:31,00:25:34,"But they're really expensive and they're mostly in private hands,"
00:25:34,00:25:35,so I don't think you will find it.
00:25:35,00:25:38,I appreciate it. I've gone through the ball and the threshold here.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"- Any more follow-ups? - Andy, before we went on stage night,"
00:25:41,00:25:44,"said, ""I have a fact so boring"
00:25:44,00:25:48,"""that I need to build up the bravery to say, 'Have we got to it yet?'"""
00:25:48,00:25:50,"- No, we haven't got to it yet. - Oh, yeah?"
00:25:50,00:25:57,"- I'm sorry. - Talk a lot, people."
00:25:57,00:25:59,- There is a... - Just...
00:25:59,00:26:03,"James, you were talking about number E404, the road."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, E numbers in food."
00:26:05,00:26:08,"- Oh, yeah, like additives. - Additives. There is an E404."
00:26:08,00:26:09,"- Oh, yeah? - Does it exist?"
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- Yes, it exists. - Right."
00:26:11,00:26:14,- I'm about to tell you in punishing detail what it is.
00:26:14,00:26:16,It's calcium alginate.
00:26:16,00:26:20,"And it's a gelatinous, creamy substance derived from seaweed"
00:26:20,00:26:21,and used to dress wounds.
00:26:21,00:26:25,- OK. - And that's not the ball of flesh!
00:26:25,00:26:26,Just wait!
00:26:26,00:26:33,"It sounds like something you might get at a Beatles party, that."
00:26:33,00:26:38,I think you should be dressing wounds with that.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"- God, thank you. - How many? You haven't got 404 of these, have you?"
00:26:40,00:26:43,I haven't. I think I may be out of 404.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Maybe I'll talk about something else for a bit.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"- You look crying, Shane. - OK."
00:26:46,00:26:48,"- Shall we do what? Roads? - Oh, OK, yeah."
00:26:48,00:26:51,"Cool. So, weird roads."
00:26:51,00:26:55,"Hawaii has lots of roads that sort of only half exist,"
00:26:55,00:26:57,because they keep getting covered in lava.
00:26:57,00:26:59,- Oh! - And this is...
00:26:59,00:27:03,I didn't actually realise that Mount Kilauea has been erupting
00:27:03,00:27:06,basically solidly since 1983 in Hawaii.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"So, it's just been spewing out lava."
00:27:09,00:27:11,"It's had, like, a little break in 2018."
00:27:11,00:27:14,"But then, in 2018, it suddenly had this, you know,"
00:27:14,00:27:17,it took a little break and then suddenly had this huge spew
00:27:17,00:27:23,"and ejected enough lava to fill 320,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools."
00:27:23,00:27:25,- It buried an area half the size of Manhattan. - Wow.
00:27:25,00:27:27,And that includes quite a lot of roads.
00:27:27,00:27:30,And the road that suffers the most seems to be this road
00:27:30,00:27:32,"called the Chain of Craters Road,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,which should have known what it was doing when it called itself that.
00:27:35,00:27:38,"But, hang on, surely... I mean, sorry, layperson on roads here,"
00:27:38,00:27:42,but don't you just leave the road for a bit and then paint over it
00:27:42,00:27:43,and then you can drive along the top of the lava?
00:27:43,00:27:48,"I think if you're driving over, like, craters and boulders and stuff..."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"Right, but a dried lava. Dried lava is not what you're making of."
00:27:51,00:27:53,It's quite bumpy. It's a bumpy road.
00:27:53,00:27:56,Have you ever been to a lava field where the lava's dried?
00:27:56,00:27:58,"- Absolutely not. - Oh, well..."
00:27:58,00:28:01,You wouldn't cycle over it and put it that way.
00:28:01,00:28:03,"Also, they don't just paint roads."
00:28:03,00:28:08,"It's like, let's get the paintbrush out and paint us a new road."
00:28:08,00:28:09,It's a lot that goes into it.
00:28:09,00:28:12,It just feels like lava would dry like asphalt.
00:28:12,00:28:14,- It doesn't... - I'm clearly wrong.
00:28:14,00:28:16,It's very lumpy. You'd need extremely good suspension.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"Maybe in a monster truck or something, you can get gallivanting over it."
00:28:20,00:28:24,"Right. Just put up a sign, ""monster truck's only on this road."""
00:28:24,00:28:27,"I was actually driving in Hawaii, I remembered,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,"and there's a sign that says, ""Beware, invisible cows."""
00:28:30,00:28:33,- Cool. - Isn't that cool?
00:28:33,00:28:36,"- But not ghost cows. - Not ghost cows, no."
00:28:36,00:28:40,Cows that are hiding in the... Is it the landscape underlates?
00:28:40,00:28:43,I fear this might be a lot more boring than your guess.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"It's basically a guess very misty there,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,"and there's lots of cows that walk over the road,"
00:28:47,00:28:50,so you can hit them without seeing them.
00:28:50,00:28:53,That's great. They could maybe change the terminology
00:28:53,00:28:56,just to make you understand what you're looking out for.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"- I agree with that. - Buckle up, kids."
00:29:00,00:29:04,There's some spooky ghost cows.
00:29:04,00:29:07,I got such a good email a few months ago from someone called Tom Wrecked.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"So thanks for this, but he said, and I think he's just spotted this,"
00:29:10,00:29:13,the road to Armageddon is...
00:29:13,00:29:18,"To drive to Armageddon, you have to go on roads 6, 6 and 6."
00:29:18,00:29:22,"So Armageddon comes from Ha Megiddo, which means Mount Megiddo,"
00:29:22,00:29:25,"and that's a place in Israel, Mount Megiddo,"
00:29:25,00:29:29,"and if you drive there from Jerusalem or Tel Aviv or most places in Israel,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,"then you take, just by complete coincidence, take Route 6,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,and then you change onto Route 66.
00:29:33,00:29:34,- Amazing. - Isn't that cool?
00:29:34,00:29:37,- That is cool. - Does that mean anything?
00:29:37,00:29:40,"- Does that mean the world is going to end there? - I'll refer you to Robert Kylo,"
00:29:40,00:29:43,who says the sort of creativity that goes into this is useless.
00:29:43,00:29:46,"The mythology is due to the irrationality, denial of evidence,"
00:29:46,00:29:50,and preference of the fairy tale over reality that is common in a human species.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"- I'll say. - Thanks, Bob."
00:29:53,00:29:58,"I found a few random road names, so like error 404, I was thinking, what else?"
00:29:58,00:30:01,So there's a road in Alabama called the St. Tit Road.
00:30:01,00:30:05,"There's a place called Error Place, which is in Cincinnati, as well,"
00:30:05,00:30:10,and then I got distracted because there were places like Wiener Cut-Off Road.
00:30:10,00:30:14,"And then this is my favorite, Far From Poopin Road."
00:30:14,00:30:19,"And this is a real road, and it's in a township called Fanny in America,"
00:30:19,00:30:23,"and Fanny, obviously, meaning a bum in America, so Far From Poopin Road,"
00:30:23,00:30:26,and the reason it's called that is because it's the closest road
00:30:26,00:30:30,that gets you to a place called Constipation Ridge.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"And I went on Google Maps, and it's all there. It's all real."
00:30:34,00:30:36,- These are real places. - Any ideas why it's called that?
00:30:36,00:30:40,The road is always blocked at Constipation Ridge.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"All right, listen, we need to move on to our final fact of the show."
00:30:43,00:30:46,"It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna."
00:30:46,00:30:51,"My fact this week is that in 2001 in Newfoundland,"
00:30:51,00:30:56,a golden retriever chased after a coyote and was never seen again.
00:30:56,00:31:00,"Now, Newfoundland has its own population of white coyotes."
00:31:00,00:31:06,- What are you saying about this? - What am I implying?
00:31:06,00:31:09,"This was some research done by someone called Carl Zimmer,"
00:31:09,00:31:12,who was looking into these amazing white coyotes in Newfoundland.
00:31:12,00:31:15,They don't exist anywhere else. They've sort of just appeared.
00:31:15,00:31:19,And they're not albino. They've still got pigment in their skin and in their eyes.
00:31:19,00:31:23,"They've just got white fur, and they've looked at their genes,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,"and they've found that they've got this specific mutation on a gene,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"and the other place, the other significant place,"
00:31:29,00:31:33,"that this mutation on this specific gene exists, is in golden retrievers."
00:31:33,00:31:35,And it's what makes them yellow.
00:31:35,00:31:38,And in the same way it's what's making these coyotes white.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"And Zimmer realised that in Newfoundland in March 2001,"
00:31:41,00:31:44,there are news reports of a guy whose golden retriever
00:31:44,00:31:47,went galloping off down a hill after a coyote.
00:31:47,00:31:49,- It's beautiful. - It's quite sweet.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"It could be a Disney film, couldn't it?"
00:31:50,00:31:55,"They're called coy dogs, aren't they, when a coyote has sex with a dog?"
00:31:55,00:31:56,- Yeah. - And that's what they create.
00:31:56,00:32:00,"And a coy carp, of course, is when a coyote has sex with a carp."
00:32:00,00:32:05,I only prized.
00:32:05,00:32:14,"And in Mexico, they used to breed coy dogs on purpose in Teotihuacan,"
00:32:14,00:32:19,which is one of the main cities that they had in the Mayan area.
00:32:19,00:32:22,"They would have the coyote and the dogs, they would make them together,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,and it meant that they had them as guardian animals.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"So they were really fierce, but they were also loyal."
00:32:27,00:32:32,"Oh, so it's a way of domestication, but crossing a domestic breed was something."
00:32:32,00:32:34,"Yeah, so you still have something that's really fierce, like a coyote,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,but then you have the kind of domestic side of the dog.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"- That's very clever. - Yeah, it's clever."
00:32:39,00:32:40,Nice.
00:32:40,00:32:43,"You want to make sure you don't breed something that's like really pathetic,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,but also really fickle.
00:32:45,00:32:47,How do you know you're not going to get the opposite of both?
00:32:47,00:32:49,"- Yes. - Yeah, I am."
00:32:49,00:32:52,- That's the rescue take. - Yeah.
00:32:52,00:32:54,There's the coy wolf as well.
00:32:54,00:32:56,"So that's a coyote wolf, obviously."
00:32:56,00:32:58,"And wolf populations are dwindling,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,and it seems like wolves basically got a bit less choosy
00:33:01,00:33:04,"in who they were mating with, and coyotes were spreading."
00:33:04,00:33:08,"And it's also known as the eastern coyote, but it's definitely a cross."
00:33:08,00:33:12,"It's 10% dog, 25% wolf, and the remainder is coyote, and they're big."
00:33:12,00:33:16,"They're twice the size of a coyote, which is a fox size-ish."
00:33:16,00:33:19,"Yeah, they basically coyotes kind of fill the plate."
00:33:19,00:33:22,"In the UK, we get foxes kind of going in cities"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"and kind of going in bins and stuff, and coyotes in America,"
00:33:25,00:33:28,"especially North America, they kind of do that same thing there, don't they?"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"Yeah, they're so good at navigating cities"
00:33:31,00:33:34,and generally adapting to human expansion.
00:33:34,00:33:38,I think they're the only carnivore that's growing.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Like, his populations are really growing exponentially everywhere,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,even though Americans are trying to exterminate them
00:33:42,00:33:44,because they're thought of as pests.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"But, yeah, they do really well in cities, maybe even better than birds,"
00:33:47,00:33:51,and they do this thing where they navigate the traffic brilliantly.
00:33:51,00:33:54,"So they look both ways before crossing the street, very impressive."
00:33:54,00:33:58,They'll run across half a road and then stop in the middle
00:33:58,00:34:00,"because, you know, the traffic's coming the other direction,"
00:34:00,00:34:04,"sprint across the other way, and they even know if they come to a one-way street,"
00:34:04,00:34:06,they only look in the direction that the traffic's coming from.
00:34:06,00:34:10,"Also, just in terms of, like, let's say their populations are going up,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,"they do this crazy thing coyotes,"
00:34:12,00:34:17,which is that they have the ability to change the number of the litter
00:34:17,00:34:22,that they're going to give birth to based on the howls of a coyote.
00:34:22,00:34:26,"So this is a thing where, let's say there are coyotes where they're being culled"
00:34:26,00:34:30,"or they're being reduced by natural predators or because of humans,"
00:34:30,00:34:33,"they can do a call-out, so a male will be like, ""Coyote call!"""
00:34:33,00:34:34,"I can't remember how they speak, but..."
00:34:34,00:34:37,It's like that howl? Howl?
00:34:37,00:34:40,"- Yeah, I think they howl. - Coyote call!"
00:34:40,00:34:42,- Okay. - Like that.
00:34:42,00:34:44,"So, yeah, so they do the howl."
00:34:44,00:34:48,"And once they do that, they can understand, based on responses,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,what the population size is within the community.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"- Oh, how interesting. - And so, if you, let's say,"
00:34:53,00:34:57,you were culling the coyote communities by 70%
00:34:57,00:35:02,"by the next time that they had given birth as in the time frame that they would need,"
00:35:02,00:35:05,they would be back up to the population size
00:35:05,00:35:09,because they can jump from five to six litter that they would usually have
00:35:09,00:35:11,up to 12 to 16.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"This call causes an autogenic response, basically,"
00:35:14,00:35:16,and they can just up the numbers.
00:35:16,00:35:17,- It's unbelievable. - It's not interesting.
00:35:17,00:35:19,"- It's unbelievable how clever they are. - Wow, it's magic."
00:35:19,00:35:20,It's like a hydra.
00:35:20,00:35:23,You just chop off its head and 17 more heads appear.
00:35:23,00:35:24,"- Pretty much is, yeah. - Yeah."
00:35:24,00:35:27,"And they're very crafty, too. They're extremely wily."
00:35:27,00:35:31,"So, wily coyote, obviously, cartoon character, but genuinely, they're wily."
00:35:31,00:35:33,"So, there was a biologist called John Way"
00:35:33,00:35:36,"who was trying to trap some for research purposes,"
00:35:36,00:35:39,and he found they would take the meat off the trap.
00:35:39,00:35:42,And they wouldn't spring it. Incredibly annoying.
00:35:42,00:35:46,"Another scientist called Robert Crabtree was trying to find one in the late '90s,"
00:35:46,00:35:51,and he had his own personal Moby Dick coyote which he could never get.
00:35:51,00:35:56,So annoying. It would dig up the trap and flip it over and then leave it alone.
00:35:56,00:35:58,"That's how, you know..."
00:35:58,00:36:02,Or it would scrape off the dirt that he'd laid carefully on the trap.
00:36:02,00:36:05,It would poo on the trap and then leave it alone.
00:36:05,00:36:09,There's one time where I don't understand this fully.
00:36:09,00:36:13,Crabtree was in a helicopter trying to drop a net on this one specific coyote.
00:36:13,00:36:16,"And it jumped up, tried to bite the helicopter, and then just ran away."
00:36:16,00:36:18,And he never caught it. He never caught it.
00:36:18,00:36:22,"Is it that this coyote is really smart, or that this guy is pretty dumb?"
00:36:22,00:36:28,"- Robert Crabtree. - If Robert Crabtree ever came up against a roadrunner, for instance, he's fucked."
00:36:28,00:36:34,"Wily coyote. A lot of misconceptions in that cartoon, for example,"
00:36:34,00:36:39,coyotes can outrun roadrunners by twice the speed.
00:36:39,00:36:42,Makes no sense. It should be the other way round.
00:36:42,00:36:46,Who would have thought that wasn't a David Attenborough documentary I was watching?
00:36:46,00:36:50,"OK, what do you think the E in Wily Coyote's name stands for?"
00:36:50,00:36:54,"Oh, is it like, is it the European additives?"
00:36:54,00:36:58,"Yeah, E-404, calcium alginate is what?"
00:36:58,00:37:00,"- No, it's actually Ethelred. - Edith."
00:37:00,00:37:02,"Oh, so close. Ethelbert."
00:37:02,00:37:06,"Oh, yeah, just, you know, it's not interesting, but worth it. Yeah, Ethelbert."
00:37:06,00:37:13,So the thing about them being Wily or Crabtree is just a conception of coyotes that's been around forever.
00:37:13,00:37:18,"And so if you go, if you look back at Native American law, almost across America,"
00:37:18,00:37:22,"before Europeans arrived there, they're known as kind of tricksters."
00:37:22,00:37:26,And they're probably the most important animal to a lot of Native American tribes.
00:37:26,00:37:30,"One of the most important. And yeah, they're like this cheeky trickster."
00:37:30,00:37:33,Exactly the same as kind of Loki or Mercury.
00:37:33,00:37:39,"I find it really interesting that in all mythology, we always have this naughty boy who's doing bad stuff."
00:37:39,00:37:43,"He is a very naughty boy, though, the coyote in some Native American stories."
00:37:43,00:37:48,"- Yeah. - There's a book called Tales of Coyote, The Trickster, American Indian Folklore."
00:37:48,00:37:50,And I read the reviews of it.
00:37:50,00:37:53,"Someone said, ""We bought this book for our fourth graders who are learning about folklore."""
00:37:53,00:37:58,"We read reviews saying, ""Great for all ages, but one quick peek into the book"
00:37:58,00:38:01,"and you will quickly agree that is not great for all ages."""
00:38:01,00:38:07,There is literally a whole section about coyotes' amorous adventures.
00:38:07,00:38:10,"The amount of times the word penis, vagina and horny,"
00:38:10,00:38:14,"and other inappropriate euphemisms show up in this book, is alarming."
00:38:14,00:38:16,Four stars.
00:38:16,00:38:23,Killed the time very nicely while waiting for my god-o to arrive.
00:38:23,00:38:27,This doesn't sound like the traditional Native American historic coyote shout.
00:38:27,00:38:32,"He had a detachable penis that he would send around to have sex with people, the coyote."
00:38:32,00:38:34,"- Oh, the coyote, really? - Yeah."
00:38:34,00:38:35,- Candy. - Gosh.
00:38:35,00:38:40,"There's one very cool story in Chinookun, which are people from Oregon, a tale,"
00:38:40,00:38:43,which is about how coyote learned to catch salmon.
00:38:43,00:38:48,"And coyote... So coyote was actually a kind of half-person, half-coyote, sort of god-like figure."
00:38:48,00:38:52,"And coyote defecates while trying to catch salmon,"
00:38:52,00:38:56,and his own feces start mocking him and laughing at him for how shit he is at fishing.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"And he's like, ""You're shit. No, you're shit."""
00:39:00,00:39:02,"""I'm supposed to be."""
00:39:02,00:39:07,"And then this blumber poo takes pity, offers him advice for how to catch,"
00:39:07,00:39:12,"and how to cook salmon, which I don't know if you take culinary tips from a poo."
00:39:12,00:39:16,"But he does, and then he succeeds for a while, then he fails again."
00:39:16,00:39:19,"And so, as before, he thinks, ""What am I going to do? Does another big poo?"""
00:39:19,00:39:23,And his poo tell gives him some more in-depth instructions this time
00:39:23,00:39:25,for exactly how to fish and where to fish.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"And, you know, that's how the coyote learned to fish."
00:39:28,00:39:31,"- Wow, that sounds cool. - That sounds great. That's incredible."
00:39:31,00:39:35,"There was another thing called coyote way, which was like coyote illness."
00:39:35,00:39:39,"And the idea was that if you killed a coyote, or even if you touched a coyote,"
00:39:39,00:39:42,you could get this kind of weird illness.
00:39:42,00:39:44,Is it where cooties come from?
00:39:44,00:39:47,No. I don't think.
00:39:47,00:39:49,"I mean, I'm guessing that it's not, because that would be amazing."
00:39:49,00:39:55,"But it's basically, if you touched this coyote, you would get this real illness."
00:39:55,00:39:58,"The various things that could happen to you,"
00:39:58,00:40:00,"you get a twisted mouth, cross-eyed vision,"
00:40:00,00:40:04,"loss of memory, fainting, mania, and prostitution."
00:40:04,00:40:10,"- A bit of a cop twist at the end there. - Oh, no."
00:40:10,00:40:13,"It's not my fault, Officer."
00:40:13,00:40:16,I touched a coyote earlier today.
00:40:16,00:40:19,I'm sure you can understand.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"Mr. Hugh Grant, you're not..."
00:40:24,00:40:27,Coyotes have a lot of encounters with celebrities.
00:40:27,00:40:29,There are rashes of stories.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"Yeah, rashes of stories about celebrity coyote encounters."
00:40:31,00:40:37,"So, for example, in 2010, Rick Perry, who stood for president in 2016,"
00:40:37,00:40:41,"he shot a coyote while on a jog, because it was threatening his puppy,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,and apparently he carries a pistol sometimes when going for a jog.
00:40:43,00:40:47,Is that like a coyote and Rick Perry having an...
00:40:47,00:40:50,"You know, it's an altercation rather than the meeting each other, isn't it?"
00:40:50,00:40:52,"It's true. Yeah, it's not much of an encounter."
00:40:52,00:40:57,"Well, in 2009, Ozzy Osbourne's pet Pomeranian dog was eaten by a coyote."
00:40:57,00:40:58,"- No. - And he didn't hear it,"
00:40:58,00:41:01,because he was watching a Michael Jackson memorial show on TV.
00:41:01,00:41:04,"Right. Oh, and that was live."
00:41:04,00:41:08,"So, which means, if you're watching it, we all know where we were"
00:41:08,00:41:11,when Ozzy Osbourne's dog was eaten by a coyote.
00:41:11,00:41:13,- Exactly. - Where were you?
00:41:13,00:41:16,I think very... Does anyone in this audience know where they were
00:41:16,00:41:19,the day that Michael Jackson documentary has brought us life?
00:41:19,00:41:21,"No, exactly."
00:41:21,00:41:24,"Okay, one more, one more."
00:41:24,00:41:30,"In 2015, Steven Spielberg's sister Nancy was briefly spooked by a coyote."
00:41:30,00:41:32,And that is the boring fact.
00:41:32,00:41:45,"All right, on that absolute solid piece of gold we are going to wrap up."
00:41:45,00:41:47,That is it. That is all of our facts.
