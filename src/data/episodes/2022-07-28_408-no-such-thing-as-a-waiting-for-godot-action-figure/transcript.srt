2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Chesterfield.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,680
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,360
 >> My name is Dan Shriver.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,240
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,800
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,280
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,360
 >> My fact is that one Japanese slang term for

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,120
 a retired husband is soraigomi, which literally translates as bulky waist.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,400
 >> [LAUGH]

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,000
 >> That is two on the nose.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,240
 >> It's a lot, it's a lot.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,760
 >> Do you know this man affectionately or less affectionately?

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,080
 >> I think tone of voice counts for a lot in these scenarios.

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,840
 I don't think it's a completely affectionate term.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,400
 It's a phrase that I think maybe older people will know more than younger people

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,440
 in Japan today.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,880
 I think it first came to prominence in the 90s and it was basically there at

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,080
 certainly at the time in Japan the very, very strong culture of working very hard.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,640
 A lot of quite traditional gender roles at the time.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,600
 So you'd have, a husband might be working sort of 16 hours a day for 40 years.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,000
 And then suddenly, he's retired and he's here all the time.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,560
 And this was the phrase that arose as a result of that.

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,880
 >> Another one that they use is nureochiba, which means wet fallen leaves.

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,080
 And the idea is that if you have wet fallen leaves,

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,120
 they just stick to your shoes all the time and the husband is just sticking to

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,840
 his wife annoyingly and she can't get rid of him.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
 >> That's so funny.

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,520
 This is horrible.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,760
 >> So Japan has a very high population that is sitting above the sort of 90s even.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,680
 Like they have the second largest number of centenarians in their country.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,240
 That came out so weird out of my mouth.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,760
 Because I was saying centenarians and then I thought centaurs.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,400
 And I thought, which one is it?

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,960
 And I got stuck halfway through.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
 >> It's both actually in Japan.

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,520
 >> Yeah, a lot of old centaurs in Japan.

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
 Yeah, which is amazing.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,960
 >> What's the highest?

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,560
 >> America has the most.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
 So America has, from the article that I read, it was 97,000.

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,840
 This is a few years old, this article.

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
 Japan with 79,000.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,920
 So Japan, it's six people for every 10,000 people in Japan.

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
 We'll make it to 100 and above.

48
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
 >> Okay, is that high, yeah.

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,480
 >> So proportionally, I think it's Japan, surely?

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,440
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,400
 >> Fortunately, Japan's got the highest number.

52
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,120
 >> Thing is though, centaurs do live long.

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,320
 So it's not really as impressive as you think.

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,080
 >> But it does lead to, I mean, there's a lot of retirement about it in Japan.

55
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,240
 And basically, there are a lot of free hours to fill after you hit 65 or 70.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
 >> Well, you can always go to the leisure center.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,160
 >> [LAUGH]

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,720
 >> I did not deserve even that sarcastic rather.

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,880
 >> [LAUGH]

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
 >> But they have lots of activities.

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,600
 So for example, Japan loves rugby, there's a hugely popular sport there.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,640
 But they have 120,000 rugby players, give or take.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,360
 10,000 of them are over the edge of 40, which impressive enough as a contact sport.

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,640
 There was one rugby club in Japan which has three over 90-year-old players.

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,520
 >> Come on.

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
 >> Genuinely, genuinely.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,520
 >> No way.

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,080
 >> There was an interview with a few of them.

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,760
 One of them was called Ryuichi Nagayama.

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,480
 And he said he found it an enormous amount of fun.

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,080
 He said, since I joined, I have broken ribs many times and broke my collarbone too.

72
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,520
 I can't stand not playing.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,040
 He said it would kill him if he stopped playing because he loves it so much.

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,120
 Well, it sounds like it would kill him if he keeps playing.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,560
 >> Yeah, I'm just picturing a crumbled heap of bones right now.

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,600
 >> It's very impressive.

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,840
 >> Yeah, there was a story which I imagine,

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,280
 it sounds like one of those stories that must slightly be fake.

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,480
 But from what I can read is true, which is that the sales of adult nappies

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,760
 are overtaking the sales of children's nappies.

81
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,600
 >> They are, that's definitely true.

82
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,160
 >> Which is amazing, that's just, there's your indication about the difference

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,920
 in population in Japan, more adults and nappies than babies.

84
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,880
 >> And it's not just the old ones, sometimes it's just convenient, you know?

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,600
 >> How do you think we lasted an hour up here?

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,280
 >> Yeah.

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,840
 >> They do have a Japan problem with dementia, as lots of countries do,

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,360
 but Japan particularly obviously with its massively aging population.

89
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,080
 And there's been some kind of cool initiatives to deal with that.

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,920
 So one of them is that there is a restaurant in Tokyo called

91
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,080
 The Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,720
 And it's where the waiting staff is comprised entirely of people suffering

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,800
 from dementia, and so- >> What?

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,160
 >> My God.

95
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,120
 >> It's great, the restaurant openly says that you as a customer may or

96
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,640
 may not get what you order.

97
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,560
 >> Wow.

98
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,080
 >> We guarantee it's delicious.

99
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,920
 Yeah, the chefs do not have dementia.

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
 >> Right.

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,640
 >> Yeah, it's great, and it's so good.

102
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,360
 And it just allows people, it's sort of based on this idea that there's a lot

103
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,600
 of misunderstanding of dementia, people think you're incapable of doing anything.

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
 Whereas actually, people are capable of doing lots of stuff.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
 They just can't remember a lot.

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,080
 And so it encourages a lot of open discussion about it and

107
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,920
 gives them something to occupy them.

108
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,880
 >> Yeah, it's a great idea, but probably not for

109
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,760
 whoever runs a business, right?

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,680
 It doesn't feel like- >> Well, people love it.

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
 >> Yeah. >> I bloody love it.

112
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,360
 I hate having to choose what I want in a restaurant.

113
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,560
 If I could know that, I could just say a random thing on the menu and

114
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,440
 it didn't make a blind bit of difference, I'd go there.

115
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,840
 >> I read about these three women in Japan that called the monkey busters.

116
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
 Did you come across those guys?

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,200
 So there are a lot of areas of Japan, especially in the rural areas where you

118
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,440
 get the monkeys and they will come down and try and steal stuff from people and

119
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,760
 all that kind of thing.

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,000
 And so this group of three women, 174, 168 and 167, have formed the monkey buster group.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,360
 And if you see the monkeys coming along, if they're trying to damage your

122
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,040
 fields and stuff or whatever, then you call the monkey busters and they come down.

123
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,640
 >> How quickly do they come down?

124
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,800
 >> Well, nearby then quickly, if they're down the road, it might take a few minutes.

125
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,040
 >> Right, so funny, and when they get there, do they shoot the monkeys?

126
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,920
 Do they trap the monkeys?

127
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,680
 >> They don't shoot the monkeys, they shoot over the monkeys' heads.

128
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,120
 >> Wow. >> Like they do warning shots to the monkeys.

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,320
 Firecrackers is the other thing they use sometimes.

130
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,120
 >> Oh, nice, that's great.

131
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,800
 >> That's a great thing to do once you retire, just go around scaring monkeys.

132
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
 >> I'd like it as a career, monkey busting.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,240
 I'm sure someone would pay me for that.

134
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,160
 >> You guys heard of Yui Chiromura.

135
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,040
 >> No, he's not. >> So he is a sportsman, he's Japanese,

136
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,040
 and he is interesting partly because of what he's done since your classic retirement age.

137
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,800
 He was the oldest person in the world to climb Mount Everest, he climbed to age 70.

138
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,040
 Then five years after that, he did it again at the age of 75.

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,280
 He's done it again at the age of 80.

140
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,040
 So he's become the oldest person to climb Everest three times in a row.

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,760
 >> Wow. >> The high point of his career,

142
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:19,320
 I reckon, in his 40s, he skied down Mount Everest with a parachute on his back

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,280
 so he could slow himself down. >> Okay, wow.

144
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,760
 >> It's unbelievable, there was a film made about it in 1975.

145
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,400
 I don't think we've mentioned this before, but I've never heard of it before.

146
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,600
 >> No, did he go from the top?

147
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,280
 >> He went from very, very high up. >> Okay.

148
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,080
 >> I don't know if you went from the exact, I don't know if you went, I think he did.

149
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,440
 >> I thought it was. >> It can't be the top, no, it's too.

150
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,240
 >> It's too much. >> There's too much going on there.

151
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,280
 >> There are lots of crevasses, he nearly died many times on the way down.

152
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,840
 He went 160 kilometers an hour on the way down.

153
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,480
 >> Wow. >> The parachute didn't work at first.

154
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,800
 >> [LAUGH]

155
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,320
 >> He was sliding towards this huge crevass, and eventually the parachute kind of kicked in.

156
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,760
 >> My God. >> He's a hero.

157
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,080
 >> But I love, because you go past all the crevasses going, fucking, come on, parachute.

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,400
 When it finally does deploy, parachutes, of course, rip you back.

159
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200
 >> [LAUGH]

160
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,280
 >> Coming to do all the crevasses all the way down.

161
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,160
 >> I don't think it sails you back up to the top.

162
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,920
 >> He's still there, he's still there, just on a loop, yeah.

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,360
 >> Because they have such an aging population, they have a problem with elderly drivers.

164
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,840
 And they're trying to do a thing where they're trying to get older people to hand back the driving licence.

165
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,120
 There's a few ways they've tried to do this.

166
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,240
 There was a 97-year-old Buddhist priest who handed over his driving licence.

167
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,040
 The idea was, if he did it, maybe he would encourage other people to do it.

168
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,960
 There's some areas where they'll give you cheap ramen, 15% off your ramen,

169
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,880
 if you hand in your driving licence.

170
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,680
 >> It's good, ironically, it'll stop you ramen anyone else with your car.

171
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
 >> Aah.

172
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,120
 >> Very uncertain about that, just to fit.

173
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,560
 >> And there's also a funeral home in Tokyo that's offering a 15% discount

174
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,560
 on the cost of a funeral if you hand in your driving licence.

175
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,000
 >> Aah, that's very good.

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,320
 >> Yeah, we're gonna have to move on in a sec, sorry, next sec.

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,280
 >> I'll give you a couple of sayings or phrases in Japanese

178
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
 if you can guess what they mean.

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,040
 >> OK.

180
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
 >> Bakudo hage, which means barcode baldy.

181
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,440
 Do you know what that means?

182
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,920
 >> Is that someone with a comb-over who's...

183
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,080
 >> He's got it, yeah.

184
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,440
 Really obvious comb-over, you're a barcode baldy.

185
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,360
 By the window tribe, do you know what they are?

186
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,560
 >> By the window tribe.

187
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,440
 >> That is Madogiwa Zoku.

188
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,120
 >> By the window tribe.

189
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,840
 >> People who are underemployed, nosy parkers,

190
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,520
 sit by their windows spying on their neighbours.

191
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,160
 >> Underemployed was close.

192
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,600
 So it's people who've been promoted to quite a senior level,

193
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,360
 but they don't really do anything decent.

194
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,840
 So they just sit there by the window looking out of the window.

195
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,120
 And here's one more.

196
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,920
 Kairo no sura ni shomben, which means piss on a frog's face.

197
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,040
 >> That's just good advice.

198
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,960
 >> Is it like a frog's face is bad enough?

199
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
 The piss on it is even worse.

200
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,600
 If you're piss on a frog's face, do the lowest of the low.

201
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,520
 >> That's a good guess.

202
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,880
 It's someone who is a little bit slow and isn't affected by anything.

203
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
 So whatever you say to them, they'll just sit there going,

204
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,280
 "Yeah, fine, whatever."

205
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,840
 And this is due to a theory, which I don't think is true,

206
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,800
 that if you piss on a frog, it just sits there.

207
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,640
 [LAUGHTER]

208
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
 >> My neighbour has tadpoles in their garden

209
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,920
 that are just turning into frogs.

210
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,960
 And I am going to try that.

211
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,640
 I'm going to be squashing over the fence next week.

212
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,800
 [LAUGHTER]

213
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,880
 >> OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

214
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,280
 My fact this week is that in 1969, Samuel Beckett wrote a play

215
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,440
 that lasts 35 seconds long and features no actors or any dialogue.

216
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,920
 The play is still performed today

217
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,080
 and has even been adapted into a movie.

218
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
 This is an amazing thing.

219
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
 Samuel Beckett, waiting for Godot,

220
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
 one of the great playwrights and novelists,

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,360
 he was called upon by Kenneth Tynan,

222
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,920
 who was an amazing journalist and writer, critic in London,

223
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,840
 famously first person to say, "Fuck!" on television.

224
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
 >> Dan. >> Sorry.

225
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,360
 >> That's all right.

226
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,240
 >> First person to say anything, fucking Chesterfield.

227
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,760
 >> Dan.

228
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,680
 >> So in 1969, he was putting on a play called "O Calcutta,"

229
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,080
 and the idea was he wanted to invite a lot of very famous people

230
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,120
 to contribute to this play, but he was going to keep them anonymous.

231
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,080
 So he wrote to Samuel Beckett. Samuel Beckett agreed to do it.

232
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,960
 And the story goes is that he wrote this entire play,

233
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,320
 which lasts 35 seconds long, onto a postcard and mailed it to him.

234
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,280
 So he received the entire play on this postcard.

235
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,440
 And then it was put on, but Beckett was very upset

236
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,840
 because when the play was eventually put on by Tynan,

237
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,680
 he added extra stuff into the 35-second-long play.

238
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
 And he was like, "Don't touch my play, you dick!"

239
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,360
 And yeah.

240
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,000
 >> So what happened was "O Calcutta" was an erotic review.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,160
 So there were going to be loads of these little mini plays

242
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,960
 that were kind of erotic plays.

243
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,920
 And when Beckett sent this stuff to Tynan on the postcard,

244
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,720
 it was basically just a load of clutter on the stage.

245
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,640
 The lights go on, off, on, off,

246
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,000
 and there's breathing that goes with the on and off.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
 And then at the end, there's a little bit of baby crying.

248
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,720
 That's it. And the whole point of it is it's a joke

249
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,360
 because everyone's expecting something really sexy

250
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,560
 and you get something really lame. That's the whole point.

251
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,920
 But what they decided to do was to add some naked people into it.

252
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,240
 >> Well, it's an erotic review.

253
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,720
 Let's just have all of that stuff,

254
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
 but with some naked people on stage.

255
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,640
 And yeah, he was absolutely furious, wasn't he?

256
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,800
 >> Yeah, that's so annoying, to face the objects.

257
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,120
 >> Exactly. Beckett's very difficult, I have to say.

258
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,680
 >> Yeah, I agree.

259
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,520
 >> Really, really difficult to understand.

260
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,360
 >> You need an interval. Was there an interval in this one?

261
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,480
 [laughter]

262
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,240
 >> It was part of the sketch within a bigger thing.

263
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,760
 So there was lots of different places going on.

264
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
 When it's now performed on stage, it's a two-hander.

265
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,000
 So it's like when we tour live, we do a first half to our show.

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,120
 We do close to 50 minutes.

267
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,720
 Beckett's is 35 seconds.

268
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 And then there's an intermission for beers

269
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
 and then you get a full play on the second half.

270
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,000
 >> Oh, you get a Beckett in the second half?

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,520
 >> Yeah. Beckett was maybe the most Beckett.

272
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,640
 The most famous Beckett.

273
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,920
 >> Andy! Sorry.

274
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,960
 >> Andy was the first person to say Beckett on TV, wasn't he?

275
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,280
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,920
 It was my father's terrible audition tape.

277
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,960
 Didn't get it.

278
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,480
 >> Maybe the most famous play of his, "Waiting for Godot"

279
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,160
 famously described as a play in which nothing happens twice,

280
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,280
 which is kind of true.

281
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,280
 And it was written in French, which I didn't know.

282
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,000
 He was a very international writer.

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,320
 He traveled around a lot, lived in France for decades.

284
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,480
 But it was first produced in Blackpool in 1956.

285
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
 And it's a pretty aggressively modernist play now.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,480
 And Blackpool in 1956 was not ready for it.

287
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,800
 [laughter]

288
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,040
 Incredible. This was still an era where all British plays

289
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,480
 had to go through the Lord Chamberlain's office,

290
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,720
 the official censor of all theatre.

291
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,320
 And an agent called C.W. Herriot

292
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,200
 saw it on behalf of the Lord Chamberlain

293
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,840
 to say which bits shouldn't, shouldn't be allowed.

294
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,560
 And said he had been through two hours of angry boredom.

295
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,720
 The man next to him had fled the theatre saying,

296
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,240
 "Let me out of this."

297
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,280
 Several women were apologising to their escorts

298
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,480
 for having suggested a visit to such a piece.

299
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,000
 And he also requested that they cut the bit

300
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,720
 where Estragon's trousers fall down.

301
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,040
 [laughter]

302
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,560
 He actually, it's quite interesting reading his notes.

303
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
 'Cause I kind of warmed to him, to Herriot.

304
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,720
 'Cause he basically is saying it's really boring and pointless.

305
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,040
 Not that it's too crude.

306
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,360
 And actually with Estragon's trousers to be fair to him,

307
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,000
 he says, "On the business of letting down Estragon's trousers,

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,800
 "I suppose that may be a right. Better keep."

309
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,280
 You know, he thinks that's a bit fucking weird, but whatever.

310
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,840
 I thought this was quite learned of him.

311
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:56,160
 He censored the words 'Gono Kokus' and 'Spiru Cayete', which, yeah.

312
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,560
 - What's 'Gono Kokus'? - It's some kind of magic trick, doesn't it?

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,760
 'Gono Kokus' does not sound like a magic trick, does it?

314
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,600
 It sounds like a spell from Harry Potter, doesn't it?

315
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,840
 'Gono Kokus'!

316
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,240
 I think you're demanding a Derren Brown refund

317
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,320
 if he's done 'Gono Kokus' on you.

318
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,680
 It's presumably a bacterium of some kind.

319
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,640
 They're both microbes.

320
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,360
 So it's the micro, the bacterium of gonorrhea is one of them

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,440
 and the bacterium of syphilis is the other.

322
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,680
 But he went to the trouble of looking in a dictionary

323
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,200
 to check up on those words.

324
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,120
 - Right. - It's a good on-in.

325
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
 Do you know you can get a Godot action figure?

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,520
 - Oh, cool. - Yeah, except it's on Etsy

327
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,360
 and it's just an empty package.

328
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,080
 - Cos you've got to... - You've already written, it never arrives.

329
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,000
 That's it! It's all got five-star reviews on Etsy,

330
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
 apart from one person who says, "I paid for expedited shipping

331
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,040
 "and I still have not received the item."

332
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
 Brilliant. I love that.

333
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,160
 Those, he was once asked by the director, Alan Schneider.

334
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,400
 Beckett was once asked, "Who is Godot?"

335
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,440
 And Beckett answered, "If I knew, I would have said so in the play."

336
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,160
 - Wow. - That's great.

337
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,200
 - How does that mystery, wasn't he? - Yeah.

338
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,440
 Just genuinely, a very mysterious man.

339
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
 He won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

340
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,240
 You'd think he'd be happy about that.

341
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,640
 He said it was a catastrophe. His wife said it was a catastrophe.

342
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,160
 He refused to go to the prize-giving because he was on holiday.

343
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,120
 And his publisher wrote, "Dear Sam and Suzanne."

344
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 That was his wife. "In spite of everything,

345
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,760
 "they have given you the Nobel Prize. I advise you to go into hiding."

346
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,800
 And it's the most eminent prize in the world.

347
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,240
 Anyway, he seemed absolutely furious about it,

348
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,080
 although someone did write to him a message from a Mr. George Godot,

349
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,680
 got in touch with him and said, "Sorry to keep you waiting."

350
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,360
 - Hey! - Which he must have hated.

351
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,360
 I bet he cracked a secret smile at that.

352
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,760
 And then just hated himself for it.

353
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,880
 He's famously the only Nobel Prize winner to have played first-class cricket.

354
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,400
 That's a quiz question that comes up quite a lot.

355
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,000
 He played for Dublin University against Northamptonshire,

356
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
 and he played two games.

357
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,680
 And for some reason, there was just this arbitrary thing where they said,

358
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,880
 "Okay, this is a proper professional game now,

359
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,400
 "and all these other games aren't proper professional games."

360
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,040
 And that's why it counts that he played first-class cricket.

361
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,880
 But actually, when you read the articles about the matches,

362
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,000
 it turns out that his team were absolutely shit.

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,560
 And there's no reason at all they should have been a first-class team.

364
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,360
 Like, the first game they played,

365
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,040
 the article begins with, "The university men are by no means a first-class side.

366
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,800
 "They are keen and enthusiastic, but their batting was poor,

367
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 "their bowling presented no terrors,

368
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 "and their fielding would have been improved by alertness."

369
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,520
 - Right. - Right.

370
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,200
 In the second game they played, a year later, it said in the newspaper,

371
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,680
 "They are weak in all departments of the game,

372
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,280
 "and the university were outclassed from start to finish."

373
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,240
 Maybe he liked that. He hated the good reviews.

374
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,960
 Maybe he loved the absolute subject.

375
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,760
 We're going to have to move on in a sec to our next item.

376
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,160
 We haven't mentioned that he was friends with James Joyce

377
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,280
 and used to wear shoes that were too small for him

378
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,440
 because he wanted to be like James Joyce.

379
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,960
 We haven't mentioned that he was in the resistance

380
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,880
 during the Second World War and almost got killed by the Nazis.

381
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,280
 We haven't mentioned the fact that he was stabbed by a pimp in Paris.

382
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,160
 All this stuff. We've got to move on.

383
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,920
 - Was he wearing shoes that were the same size as James Joyce's shoes?

384
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,720
 Or did James Joyce also wear shoes that were too small for him?

385
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
 - Same thing. - Same thing.

386
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,520
 - That's my question. - That's why he is.

387
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,000
 He wanted to wear the same shoes as James Joyce.

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
 James Joyce had very narrow feet,

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,560
 and so he wore these shoes that were really, really narrow,

390
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,200
 even though they didn't fit him.

391
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
 He also, like, would only drink white wine

392
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
 because James Joyce drunk white wine

393
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,840
 and just wanted to be like James Joyce.

394
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,240
 Because that's so needy.

395
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,120
 Imagine how oppressed you'd feel if your mate was like that.

396
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
 You know, you dump them.

397
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,240
 I think they had it falling out, and it's probably because of that.

398
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,400
 They claimed it was because James Joyce's daughter fancied him

399
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,560
 and he didn't return her affections.

400
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,680
 But I think it was the weird wine-drinking shoe-wearing shit.

401
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,480
 - I think you might be right. - Can I tell you quickly?

402
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,200
 Just back to O'Calcutta, the play that Beckett submitted,

403
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,560
 this breathe it was called, the play to,

404
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,680
 Kenneth Tinnon wrote to a lot of famous people

405
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,080
 to try and get them to submit a thing.

406
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
 And one of the people he wrote to was John Lennon.

407
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,280
 And again, it was meant to be all anonymous,

408
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,040
 but apparently this is known that John Lennon did submit a sketch.

409
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,840
 So he wrote a sketch about masturbation,

410
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,200
 and it was based on his time when he used to masturbate

411
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
 amongst his friends at a party.

412
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
 - This is the sketch right now. - Okay.

413
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,440
 Paul McCartney verifies this story

414
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,680
 because in a biography on Paul McCartney,

415
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,520
 called "Many Years From Now", this is what he says.

416
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,880
 Apologies for whatever that to say.

417
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,640
 We used to have wanking sessions

418
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,120
 when we were young at Nigel Wally's house in Walton.

419
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,440
 We'd stay over night and we'd sit in armchairs

420
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,600
 and we'd put out all the lights and being teenage pubescent boys,

421
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 we'd all wank.

422
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,040
 What we used to do, someone would say, "Bridge at Bardot.

423
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,640
 Ooh, that would keep everyone on par."

424
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,920
 Then somebody probably, John, would say, "Winston Churchill.

425
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,080
 Oh, no!"

426
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,440
 And it would completely ruin everyone's concentration.

427
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,600
 So, John, yeah, submitted a wanking play to old Calcutta.

428
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
 - That actually does sound like a really fun game. - Yeah.

429
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,600
 - So, the wanking bit. - Yeah.

430
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
 I only wish I knew any Beatles songs

431
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
 because there must be some puns in that summer.

432
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
 Yeah, come together.

433
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,480
 Okay, we need to move on to our next fact.

434
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,840
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

435
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,680
 Okay, my fact this week is that the European road, called E-404,

436
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
 doesn't exist.

437
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,680
 Have you searched for it?

438
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,520
 Yes, I have. It definitely doesn't exist.

439
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,880
 It was in 1995, the European Parliament decided

440
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
 they were going to build the E-404.

441
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,680
 It was near Zebrugge in Belgium,

442
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,240
 and they decided they were going to build it, and they just never did.

443
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,120
 And so now, if you try to go onto the E-404, plug it into your sat-nav,

444
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,800
 it will just give you an error message.

445
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 - That's brilliant. - So good.

446
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,400
 Do you know if it predates the E-404 message?

447
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,200
 - 1995, it would not just about it. - But it's closed.

448
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,800
 - It's there and thereabouts, yeah. - Yeah, it's closed.

449
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,720
 So, the E-404 message, which is where you go on the computer

450
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,000
 and you search for a website and it's not there,

451
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,280
 that was invented by Tim Berners-Lee around the start of the internet,

452
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,200
 so that will be around the late 80s and the 90s, something like that.

453
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,520
 - So, it probably doesn't, yeah. - Yeah.

454
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,160
 There's a rumor that it was because there was a room at CERN

455
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,360
 where they were working on the worldwide web called Room E-404,

456
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
 but it's not true.

457
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,400
 - No. - And one of the founders, Robert Caillio,

458
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 Tim Berners-Lee's colleague, was asked about it, that thing, the room,

459
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
 and he said, "I don't even have a hunch about the E-404 fascination,

460
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,840
 "and frankly, I don't give a damn.

461
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,560
 "The sort of creativity that goes into E-404, the response pages, is fairly useless.

462
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,160
 "The mythology is probably due to the irrationality

463
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,400
 "deny of evidence and preference for the fairytale over reality

464
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,880
 "that is quite common in the human species."

465
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,000
 - Oh, my God! - Wow!

466
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 - But actually, like, barrel of lard. - Actually, like, barrel of lard.

467
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,480
 - Robert Caillio, isn't he? - Oh, what fun.

468
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,240
 Four or four pages are really important at the start of the internet

469
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,920
 because it meant that you could search for something

470
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,160
 and if you've got the wrong thing, it would just give you something basic.

471
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,560
 You knew what you were going to get, otherwise it could go in some kind of weird loop

472
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,680
 and you never, you know, it was a really, really important part

473
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,040
 when they were kind of putting the networks together.

474
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,920
 - Right. - It's not puppy-interesting, James, that's his point.

475
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,120
 And the fact that you're bothering to discuss it is a waste of his time and yours.

476
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,320
 Look, the number four was always used at the start of errors

477
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,600
 when they were user-created errors and they would have four or one, four or two.

478
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,160
 Are you trying to make this? Isn't it interesting?

479
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,480
 I find that very interesting and there's a better theory about where four or four comes from,

480
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,120
 which is that in 1989 they were working on this.

481
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,680
 There was a flight, Flight 404, that went missing and it was never found.

482
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,360
 And so they may have heard on the radio the four or fours might be found.

483
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,000
 And yes, in 1990 there was another Flight 404 which crashed.

484
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,880
 So there were two Flight 404s which went wrong.

485
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,080
 - And so... - Coincidence?

486
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,040
 - Yes. - Possibly, yes.

487
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,200
 - Yes. - Yes.

488
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,240
 See, I grew up in Hong Kong and four is a very unlucky number in Asia.

489
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,280
 - It means death or something? - Yeah, four "s" sounds like it.

490
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,520
 Which means death and yes, it's the same sound.

491
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,360
 So room 404 in any hotel does not exist.

492
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,000
 - Let's say for a hotel room 404s. - Oh, yeah.

493
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,840
 And it's really interesting because 404 doesn't exist.

494
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
 So obviously the whole of four doesn't exist.

495
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,320
 So you lose floor four.

496
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,640
 You would lose floor 13 as well.

497
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,280
 But you also, because 13, for any foreign people who are coming in,

498
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,480
 they keep to the superstition for foreign builders.

499
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,640
 - You got one, two, three, five through to 12. - Yeah.

500
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,840
 But then you would also lose any floors that would have four in the number itself.

501
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,720
 So 24, 34.

502
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,840
 - In a 100-floor building, it's actually only about 80 floors

503
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,560
 once you minus all the floors. - Does it go from 12 to 15?

504
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,320
 - Because 14 has a floor in it? - Yes, it does.

505
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,520
 Are they cheating? You know how they claim to have,

506
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,000
 in that part of the world, a lot of the tallest buildings in the world,

507
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,960
 do you think that they're actually quite squat?

508
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,840
 - Yes. - They're just skipped out loads of floors.

509
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,560
 - The Sturge Alcalifa is actually only three floors high.

510
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,200
 - It's a bungalow, isn't it? - Yeah.

511
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,920
 Also 87 is bad luck in Australia, I think.

512
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,760
 - Is it right? - It's 100 minus 13.

513
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,080
 - Yeah. - So you lose that.

514
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,800
 - So I don't know about that, but in... - Who's annoyed about 87?

515
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,840
 - Because it's 100 minus 13. - Look, Australian cricketers hate 87.

516
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,800
 - Really? - And if they ever got that high against England,

517
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 they would be really upset about it.

518
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,480
 - Yeah, there's some sledding. - Um, the year 404?

519
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,600
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh.

520
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
 - What a year. - AD, what is it?

521
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,280
 - 404 AD. - Did it not exist?

522
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,320
 - It did exist. - Ah, OK.

523
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,520
 - Last gladiator fight in Rome. - Really?

524
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,320
 - Apparently. - And it was alleged that St. Telemachus

525
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,880
 tried to stop the fight, the gladiator fight from happening,

526
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,280
 and was stoned to death by the crowd.

527
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,480
 - Oh. - And that...

528
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,080
 But supposedly that was the last fight that ever happened there.

529
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,480
 I don't understand why it would be the last fight that happened there,

530
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,920
 because they've just stoned someone to death.

531
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,760
 - They're clearly very passionate about having the fight still. - Yeah? Yes.

532
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,040
 Maybe too passionate, you know?

533
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,360
 You don't like football hooligans,

534
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,240
 maybe they didn't like gladiator hooligans back then.

535
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,720
 - Yeah. - It's like, "All right, we're gonna stop letting you watch this."

536
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,120
 - That's how you react. - There's a car called the Bristol 404.

537
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,040
 - Oh, yeah? - Yep. - Does it exist?

538
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,560
 - Yes. But there are only nine. - Oh!

539
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,120
 - Okay. How come? - It's very old.

540
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,200
 But there are still nine registered on British roads.

541
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,840
 So if you try and search for that, you may find it.

542
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,160
 But they're really expensive and they're mostly in private hands,

543
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,960
 so I don't think you will find it.

544
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,360
 I appreciate it. I've gone through the ball and the threshold here.

545
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,400
 - Any more follow-ups? - Andy, before we went on stage night,

546
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,640
 said, "I have a fact so boring

547
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
 "that I need to build up the bravery to say, 'Have we got to it yet?'"

548
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,720
 - No, we haven't got to it yet. - Oh, yeah?

549
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,240
 - I'm sorry. - Talk a lot, people.

550
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,840
 - There is a... - Just...

551
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,320
 James, you were talking about number E404, the road.

552
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, E numbers in food.

553
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,360
 - Oh, yeah, like additives. - Additives. There is an E404.

554
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,800
 - Oh, yeah? - Does it exist?

555
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,240
 - Yes, it exists. - Right.

556
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,520
 - I'm about to tell you in punishing detail what it is.

557
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,320
 It's calcium alginate.

558
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,120
 And it's a gelatinous, creamy substance derived from seaweed

559
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,880
 and used to dress wounds.

560
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,280
 - OK. - And that's not the ball of flesh!

561
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,800
 Just wait!

562
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,480
 It sounds like something you might get at a Beatles party, that.

563
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,040
 I think you should be dressing wounds with that.

564
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,920
 - God, thank you. - How many? You haven't got 404 of these, have you?

565
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,040
 I haven't. I think I may be out of 404.

566
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,800
 Maybe I'll talk about something else for a bit.

567
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,600
 - You look crying, Shane. - OK.

568
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,880
 - Shall we do what? Roads? - Oh, OK, yeah.

569
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
 Cool. So, weird roads.

570
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,200
 Hawaii has lots of roads that sort of only half exist,

571
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,360
 because they keep getting covered in lava.

572
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,480
 - Oh! - And this is...

573
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,360
 I didn't actually realise that Mount Kilauea has been erupting

574
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,680
 basically solidly since 1983 in Hawaii.

575
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,600
 So, it's just been spewing out lava.

576
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,960
 It's had, like, a little break in 2018.

577
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,640
 But then, in 2018, it suddenly had this, you know,

578
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,320
 it took a little break and then suddenly had this huge spew

579
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,320
 and ejected enough lava to fill 320,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

580
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,680
 - It buried an area half the size of Manhattan. - Wow.

581
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,800
 And that includes quite a lot of roads.

582
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,600
 And the road that suffers the most seems to be this road

583
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,880
 called the Chain of Craters Road,

584
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
 which should have known what it was doing when it called itself that.

585
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,880
 But, hang on, surely... I mean, sorry, layperson on roads here,

586
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,160
 but don't you just leave the road for a bit and then paint over it

587
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,680
 and then you can drive along the top of the lava?

588
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,120
 I think if you're driving over, like, craters and boulders and stuff...

589
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,040
 Right, but a dried lava. Dried lava is not what you're making of.

590
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,000
 It's quite bumpy. It's a bumpy road.

591
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,160
 Have you ever been to a lava field where the lava's dried?

592
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,400
 - Absolutely not. - Oh, well...

593
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,040
 You wouldn't cycle over it and put it that way.

594
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,320
 Also, they don't just paint roads.

595
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,160
 It's like, let's get the paintbrush out and paint us a new road.

596
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
 It's a lot that goes into it.

597
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
 It just feels like lava would dry like asphalt.

598
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,000
 - It doesn't... - I'm clearly wrong.

599
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,720
 It's very lumpy. You'd need extremely good suspension.

600
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,040
 Maybe in a monster truck or something, you can get gallivanting over it.

601
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,240
 Right. Just put up a sign, "monster truck's only on this road."

602
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,160
 I was actually driving in Hawaii, I remembered,

603
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,400
 and there's a sign that says, "Beware, invisible cows."

604
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,040
 - Cool. - Isn't that cool?

605
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,360
 - But not ghost cows. - Not ghost cows, no.

606
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,280
 Cows that are hiding in the... Is it the landscape underlates?

607
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,960
 I fear this might be a lot more boring than your guess.

608
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,760
 It's basically a guess very misty there,

609
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,440
 and there's lots of cows that walk over the road,

610
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,240
 so you can hit them without seeing them.

611
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,600
 That's great. They could maybe change the terminology

612
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,720
 just to make you understand what you're looking out for.

613
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,040
 - I agree with that. - Buckle up, kids.

614
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,120
 There's some spooky ghost cows.

615
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,800
 I got such a good email a few months ago from someone called Tom Wrecked.

616
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,640
 So thanks for this, but he said, and I think he's just spotted this,

617
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,560
 the road to Armageddon is...

618
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,480
 To drive to Armageddon, you have to go on roads 6, 6 and 6.

619
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,680
 So Armageddon comes from Ha Megiddo, which means Mount Megiddo,

620
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,360
 and that's a place in Israel, Mount Megiddo,

621
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,000
 and if you drive there from Jerusalem or Tel Aviv or most places in Israel,

622
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,720
 then you take, just by complete coincidence, take Route 6,

623
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,320
 and then you change onto Route 66.

624
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,960
 - Amazing. - Isn't that cool?

625
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,080
 - That is cool. - Does that mean anything?

626
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,720
 - Does that mean the world is going to end there? - I'll refer you to Robert Kylo,

627
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,480
 who says the sort of creativity that goes into this is useless.

628
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,200
 The mythology is due to the irrationality, denial of evidence,

629
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,280
 and preference of the fairy tale over reality that is common in a human species.

630
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,840
 - I'll say. - Thanks, Bob.

631
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,720
 I found a few random road names, so like error 404, I was thinking, what else?

632
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,960
 So there's a road in Alabama called the St. Tit Road.

633
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,760
 There's a place called Error Place, which is in Cincinnati, as well,

634
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,480
 and then I got distracted because there were places like Wiener Cut-Off Road.

635
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,240
 And then this is my favorite, Far From Poopin Road.

636
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,800
 And this is a real road, and it's in a township called Fanny in America,

637
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,840
 and Fanny, obviously, meaning a bum in America, so Far From Poopin Road,

638
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,360
 and the reason it's called that is because it's the closest road

639
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,840
 that gets you to a place called Constipation Ridge.

640
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,160
 And I went on Google Maps, and it's all there. It's all real.

641
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,600
 - These are real places. - Any ideas why it's called that?

642
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 The road is always blocked at Constipation Ridge.

643
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,440
 All right, listen, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

644
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,800
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna.

645
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,120
 My fact this week is that in 2001 in Newfoundland,

646
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,000
 a golden retriever chased after a coyote and was never seen again.

647
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,920
 Now, Newfoundland has its own population of white coyotes.

648
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,400
 - What are you saying about this? - What am I implying?

649
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,160
 This was some research done by someone called Carl Zimmer,

650
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,680
 who was looking into these amazing white coyotes in Newfoundland.

651
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,440
 They don't exist anywhere else. They've sort of just appeared.

652
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,520
 And they're not albino. They've still got pigment in their skin and in their eyes.

653
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,760
 They've just got white fur, and they've looked at their genes,

654
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,920
 and they've found that they've got this specific mutation on a gene,

655
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,880
 and the other place, the other significant place,

656
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,360
 that this mutation on this specific gene exists, is in golden retrievers.

657
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,520
 And it's what makes them yellow.

658
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,120
 And in the same way it's what's making these coyotes white.

659
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,560
 And Zimmer realised that in Newfoundland in March 2001,

660
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,120
 there are news reports of a guy whose golden retriever

661
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,480
 went galloping off down a hill after a coyote.

662
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,000
 - It's beautiful. - It's quite sweet.

663
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,560
 It could be a Disney film, couldn't it?

664
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,240
 They're called coy dogs, aren't they, when a coyote has sex with a dog?

665
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,880
 - Yeah. - And that's what they create.

666
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,040
 And a coy carp, of course, is when a coyote has sex with a carp.

667
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,480
 I only prized.

668
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:14,360
 And in Mexico, they used to breed coy dogs on purpose in Teotihuacan,

669
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,000
 which is one of the main cities that they had in the Mayan area.

670
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,920
 They would have the coyote and the dogs, they would make them together,

671
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,160
 and it meant that they had them as guardian animals.

672
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,960
 So they were really fierce, but they were also loyal.

673
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,280
 Oh, so it's a way of domestication, but crossing a domestic breed was something.

674
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,920
 Yeah, so you still have something that's really fierce, like a coyote,

675
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,600
 but then you have the kind of domestic side of the dog.

676
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,040
 - That's very clever. - Yeah, it's clever.

677
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,120
 Nice.

678
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,280
 You want to make sure you don't breed something that's like really pathetic,

679
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,120
 but also really fickle.

680
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,280
 How do you know you're not going to get the opposite of both?

681
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,560
 - Yes. - Yeah, I am.

682
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,480
 - That's the rescue take. - Yeah.

683
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
 There's the coy wolf as well.

684
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,760
 So that's a coyote wolf, obviously.

685
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,960
 And wolf populations are dwindling,

686
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,440
 and it seems like wolves basically got a bit less choosy

687
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,760
 in who they were mating with, and coyotes were spreading.

688
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,480
 And it's also known as the eastern coyote, but it's definitely a cross.

689
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,400
 It's 10% dog, 25% wolf, and the remainder is coyote, and they're big.

690
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,320
 They're twice the size of a coyote, which is a fox size-ish.

691
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,680
 Yeah, they basically coyotes kind of fill the plate.

692
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,360
 In the UK, we get foxes kind of going in cities

693
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,240
 and kind of going in bins and stuff, and coyotes in America,

694
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,520
 especially North America, they kind of do that same thing there, don't they?

695
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,880
 Yeah, they're so good at navigating cities

696
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,520
 and generally adapting to human expansion.

697
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,040
 I think they're the only carnivore that's growing.

698
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,560
 Like, his populations are really growing exponentially everywhere,

699
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,680
 even though Americans are trying to exterminate them

700
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,360
 because they're thought of as pests.

701
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,640
 But, yeah, they do really well in cities, maybe even better than birds,

702
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,360
 and they do this thing where they navigate the traffic brilliantly.

703
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,920
 So they look both ways before crossing the street, very impressive.

704
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,240
 They'll run across half a road and then stop in the middle

705
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,400
 because, you know, the traffic's coming the other direction,

706
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,120
 sprint across the other way, and they even know if they come to a one-way street,

707
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,920
 they only look in the direction that the traffic's coming from.

708
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,040
 Also, just in terms of, like, let's say their populations are going up,

709
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,000
 they do this crazy thing coyotes,

710
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,640
 which is that they have the ability to change the number of the litter

711
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,080
 that they're going to give birth to based on the howls of a coyote.

712
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,280
 So this is a thing where, let's say there are coyotes where they're being culled

713
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,080
 or they're being reduced by natural predators or because of humans,

714
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,080
 they can do a call-out, so a male will be like, "Coyote call!"

715
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,800
 I can't remember how they speak, but...

716
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,800
 It's like that howl? Howl?

717
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,480
 - Yeah, I think they howl. - Coyote call!

718
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,360
 - Okay. - Like that.

719
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,320
 So, yeah, so they do the howl.

720
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,320
 And once they do that, they can understand, based on responses,

721
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,320
 what the population size is within the community.

722
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,680
 - Oh, how interesting. - And so, if you, let's say,

723
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,360
 you were culling the coyote communities by 70%

724
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,920
 by the next time that they had given birth as in the time frame that they would need,

725
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,000
 they would be back up to the population size

726
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,360
 because they can jump from five to six litter that they would usually have

727
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,480
 up to 12 to 16.

728
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,680
 This call causes an autogenic response, basically,

729
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,040
 and they can just up the numbers.

730
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
 - It's unbelievable. - It's not interesting.

731
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,360
 - It's unbelievable how clever they are. - Wow, it's magic.

732
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,480
 It's like a hydra.

733
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,360
 You just chop off its head and 17 more heads appear.

734
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,520
 - Pretty much is, yeah. - Yeah.

735
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,480
 And they're very crafty, too. They're extremely wily.

736
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,240
 So, wily coyote, obviously, cartoon character, but genuinely, they're wily.

737
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,880
 So, there was a biologist called John Way

738
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,360
 who was trying to trap some for research purposes,

739
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,280
 and he found they would take the meat off the trap.

740
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,280
 And they wouldn't spring it. Incredibly annoying.

741
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,760
 Another scientist called Robert Crabtree was trying to find one in the late '90s,

742
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,280
 and he had his own personal Moby Dick coyote which he could never get.

743
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,200
 So annoying. It would dig up the trap and flip it over and then leave it alone.

744
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,160
 That's how, you know...

745
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,120
 Or it would scrape off the dirt that he'd laid carefully on the trap.

746
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,800
 It would poo on the trap and then leave it alone.

747
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,080
 There's one time where I don't understand this fully.

748
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,440
 Crabtree was in a helicopter trying to drop a net on this one specific coyote.

749
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,760
 And it jumped up, tried to bite the helicopter, and then just ran away.

750
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,520
 And he never caught it. He never caught it.

751
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,960
 Is it that this coyote is really smart, or that this guy is pretty dumb?

752
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,840
 - Robert Crabtree. - If Robert Crabtree ever came up against a roadrunner, for instance, he's fucked.

753
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,920
 Wily coyote. A lot of misconceptions in that cartoon, for example,

754
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,240
 coyotes can outrun roadrunners by twice the speed.

755
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,200
 Makes no sense. It should be the other way round.

756
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,280
 Who would have thought that wasn't a David Attenborough documentary I was watching?

757
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,840
 OK, what do you think the E in Wily Coyote's name stands for?

758
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,560
 Oh, is it like, is it the European additives?

759
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,680
 Yeah, E-404, calcium alginate is what?

760
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,440
 - No, it's actually Ethelred. - Edith.

761
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,400
 Oh, so close. Ethelbert.

762
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,520
 Oh, yeah, just, you know, it's not interesting, but worth it. Yeah, Ethelbert.

763
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:13,120
 So the thing about them being Wily or Crabtree is just a conception of coyotes that's been around forever.

764
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,320
 And so if you go, if you look back at Native American law, almost across America,

765
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,880
 before Europeans arrived there, they're known as kind of tricksters.

766
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,760
 And they're probably the most important animal to a lot of Native American tribes.

767
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,960
 One of the most important. And yeah, they're like this cheeky trickster.

768
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,440
 Exactly the same as kind of Loki or Mercury.

769
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,280
 I find it really interesting that in all mythology, we always have this naughty boy who's doing bad stuff.

770
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,240
 He is a very naughty boy, though, the coyote in some Native American stories.

771
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,320
 - Yeah. - There's a book called Tales of Coyote, The Trickster, American Indian Folklore.

772
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,000
 And I read the reviews of it.

773
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,960
 Someone said, "We bought this book for our fourth graders who are learning about folklore."

774
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,200
 We read reviews saying, "Great for all ages, but one quick peek into the book

775
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,760
 and you will quickly agree that is not great for all ages."

776
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,160
 There is literally a whole section about coyotes' amorous adventures.

777
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,680
 The amount of times the word penis, vagina and horny,

778
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,600
 and other inappropriate euphemisms show up in this book, is alarming.

779
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,240
 Four stars.

780
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,200
 Killed the time very nicely while waiting for my god-o to arrive.

781
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,400
 This doesn't sound like the traditional Native American historic coyote shout.

782
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,720
 He had a detachable penis that he would send around to have sex with people, the coyote.

783
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,040
 - Oh, the coyote, really? - Yeah.

784
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,160
 - Candy. - Gosh.

785
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:40,560
 There's one very cool story in Chinookun, which are people from Oregon, a tale,

786
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,320
 which is about how coyote learned to catch salmon.

787
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,680
 And coyote... So coyote was actually a kind of half-person, half-coyote, sort of god-like figure.

788
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,320
 And coyote defecates while trying to catch salmon,

789
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,400
 and his own feces start mocking him and laughing at him for how shit he is at fishing.

790
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,560
 And he's like, "You're shit. No, you're shit."

791
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
 "I'm supposed to be."

792
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,240
 And then this blumber poo takes pity, offers him advice for how to catch,

793
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,240
 and how to cook salmon, which I don't know if you take culinary tips from a poo.

794
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,400
 But he does, and then he succeeds for a while, then he fails again.

795
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,800
 And so, as before, he thinks, "What am I going to do? Does another big poo?"

796
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,360
 And his poo tell gives him some more in-depth instructions this time

797
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,880
 for exactly how to fish and where to fish.

798
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,800
 And, you know, that's how the coyote learned to fish.

799
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,520
 - Wow, that sounds cool. - That sounds great. That's incredible.

800
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,800
 There was another thing called coyote way, which was like coyote illness.

801
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,480
 And the idea was that if you killed a coyote, or even if you touched a coyote,

802
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,240
 you could get this kind of weird illness.

803
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,520
 Is it where cooties come from?

804
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,480
 No. I don't think.

805
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,960
 I mean, I'm guessing that it's not, because that would be amazing.

806
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,800
 But it's basically, if you touched this coyote, you would get this real illness.

807
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,120
 The various things that could happen to you,

808
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,760
 you get a twisted mouth, cross-eyed vision,

809
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,280
 loss of memory, fainting, mania, and prostitution.

810
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,720
 - A bit of a cop twist at the end there. - Oh, no.

811
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,480
 It's not my fault, Officer.

812
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,840
 I touched a coyote earlier today.

813
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,160
 I'm sure you can understand.

814
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,440
 Mr. Hugh Grant, you're not...

815
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,600
 Coyotes have a lot of encounters with celebrities.

816
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,520
 There are rashes of stories.

817
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,960
 Yeah, rashes of stories about celebrity coyote encounters.

818
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,200
 So, for example, in 2010, Rick Perry, who stood for president in 2016,

819
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,040
 he shot a coyote while on a jog, because it was threatening his puppy,

820
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,960
 and apparently he carries a pistol sometimes when going for a jog.

821
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,680
 Is that like a coyote and Rick Perry having an...

822
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,760
 You know, it's an altercation rather than the meeting each other, isn't it?

823
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,680
 It's true. Yeah, it's not much of an encounter.

824
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,040
 Well, in 2009, Ozzy Osbourne's pet Pomeranian dog was eaten by a coyote.

825
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,680
 - No. - And he didn't hear it,

826
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,920
 because he was watching a Michael Jackson memorial show on TV.

827
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,360
 Right. Oh, and that was live.

828
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,640
 So, which means, if you're watching it, we all know where we were

829
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,520
 when Ozzy Osbourne's dog was eaten by a coyote.

830
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,360
 - Exactly. - Where were you?

831
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,720
 I think very... Does anyone in this audience know where they were

832
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,000
 the day that Michael Jackson documentary has brought us life?

833
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,360
 No, exactly.

834
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,200
 Okay, one more, one more.

835
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,320
 In 2015, Steven Spielberg's sister Nancy was briefly spooked by a coyote.

836
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,920
 And that is the boring fact.

837
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:45,320
 All right, on that absolute solid piece of gold we are going to wrap up.

838
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,160
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

839
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,640

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,440

 It's the Nerd Immunity Tour.

854

855
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,680

856
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,440
 Thank you for being here.

857
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,800

858
