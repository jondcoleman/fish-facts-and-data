00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we begin, we just want to let you

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,040
 know that we have a very exciting guest joining us today. It is the editor-in-chief of the Guinness

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,640
 World Records, Craig Glenday. He's an amazing guy. He came to the office. We sat at a nice

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,600
 distance and chat facts with him and he has a new book out. You may have heard of it. It's called

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,640
 Guinness World Records 2022. It is a collection of all the greatest records that have been set.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,720
 You know what Guinness World Records is like explaining the Bible. You don't need that. Anyway,

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,640
 it is out now. It's another fact-packed book and Craig himself is an incredible person of such a

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,120
 pleasure having him on. So do get the book and we hope you enjoy him. That's right. And in fact,

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,880
 we have one other announcement to make which is that our tour of the UK and Ireland is starting

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,840
 very, very soon. It's starting next week. In fact, the tour is going to be so much fun. We're going

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,360
 to be doing live podcasts all over the country and there are shows coming up this next week as

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,640
 you're listening to this. So there are two shows in London. They're kind of work in progress shows.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
 You'll be able to come and see our first half as we shape and mold it into the perfect form.

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,400
 And then after that, the first week of tour proper is the first week of October. We're going to

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,480
 Tumbridge Wells. We're going to Nottingham. We're going to Richmond and we're going to Reading.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,200
 So do come and get a ticket by going to knowsuchthingasoffish.com. All of our dates are up there.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,120
 Also, 27th of September, our work in progress at the Soho Theatre. If you're in London,

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,520
 come and see that. And then on 30th, go to the Canal Cafe. We'll be doing a second run of it

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,560
 there. It's going to be really exciting, but most importantly of all, get Guinness World Records 2022

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
 and enjoy Craig Glenday on No Such Thing as a Fish. Here we go. Yay!

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:02:00,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,160
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,120
 Murray, Anna Tyshinski, and our special guest, it is the editor-in-chief of the Guinness World

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,440
 Records, Craig Glenday. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,520
 favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,240
 number one, and that is Craig. Right. Well, my fact this week is that the world's most tattooed

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,040
 person finally proved that they had the Guinness World Records title by gouging out strips of their

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,680
 scalp and posting it to the Guinness World Records headquarters in a matchbox. Nice.

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,120
 In a matchbox? It's so, Craig, it's so grim. It's a slightly odd thing to do. Did you ask them to

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,600
 do it? No, he was driven to do it. This is the very nice, I have to stress, it's the very, very

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,160
 nice Lucky Diamond Rich. And he has a full body suit of tattoos, as you'd expect. And he was

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,960
 convinced that he had the record, despite the current record holder, Tom Leppard, you know,

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,600
 Tom Leppard, who he was a British military vet, lived on the Isle of Skye. Okay. He was very

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,280
 recognizable because he was covered head to toe in this bright saffron yellow and black spotted

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,600
 full body tattoo and wore gold thong. That's all he wore. I thought like a Leppard does in

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,840
 the wild. Like the wild ones, too. I thought by getting you on, we've been very similar worlds,

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,600
 but I think you live a very different life to us. No one else is going to go, you know Tom Leppard,

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,000
 right? Well, yeah, I suppose. Yeah. I mean, this is our bread and butter, I guess.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 So Tom had the record at 99.9% because it was almost, you couldn't really determine. I mean,

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,040
 there would have been tiny bits between the fingers or up the nostrils in the ears or whatever.

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
 So when Lucky Rich came around, everyone just said, well, he's the same. He's going to be 99.9%.

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,360
 And Lucky Rich is like, no, I am more than 100%. And what he'd done is he had a full body suit

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,200
 of exotic, interesting tattoos he'd collected from around the world. And then at some point decided

44
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,040
 to black them all in entirely using just a black ink gun and then didn't stop there. So then started

45
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,320
 tattooing white pieces over the black and then colored pieces over the white. So it's multi layer.

46
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,560
 I think that makes sense. I think that is more than 100%. So I mean, one of the key rules for

47
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
 Guinness World Records is that if it's not breakable, then it can't be a record. Right.

48
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,520
 So it's kind of like the thing with the, we've mentioned before on the show, a pepper army

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,040
 is actually 108% pork because to get 100 grams of pepper army use 108 grams of pork and you kind

50
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,360
 of desiccate it down, right? You dehydrate it. So is Diamond Lucky Rich like that? I mean,

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,160
 I never tasted the bits that you sent in, but I don't know. Yes, I guess. I mean, you can just

52
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,200
 indefinitely carry on tattooing and layering and tattooing. Right. Rightly, probably angry

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,720
 about this. And angry about Mr. Leppard. About Mr. Leppard and not beating him,

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,200
 that he turned up at the office one day and we didn't know he was coming. So I got this weird

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,800
 phone call. And that's why I got it because I was taking calls maybe foolishly from reception.

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,960
 And in a panic scene, there's a blue man. There's a blue man in reception with white hair and

57
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,040
 metal teeth. It's like, what are you on about the blue man group? I was thinking about something.

58
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,680
 I said, can you just take a note or something? And he left a package, which ended up being like a

59
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,320
 wedding album, but not of wedding photos, but of very detailed anatomical shots of his own body

60
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,400
 and all the body parts and like really detailed, like proper, you know, cheeks apart type.

61
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,720
 Too much. Would you say too much? The other stuff I'm going to definitely have to cut.

62
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,520
 In my head, the package he sent you was the size of the matchbox. So I'm just picturing very

63
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,760
 tiny writing as the address on it. And just a very confused postman picking up this little

64
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,560
 mouse package that he delivers to you guys. So was it so that you could test the tattooed skin,

65
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,400
 that it had multiple layers on it? I think that was possibly his intention. We had,

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,680
 I think, did a new story because we'd taken a core sample of the world's largest paintball.

67
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,640
 So you know, the guy who paints a softball every day, how many his wife give a coat of

68
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,560
 paint to this thing. And now it's, you know, a meter and a half wide. They actually did us

69
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,000
 a core sample. So you can count the number of layers in an engine, you know, extrapolate from

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,800
 that. And I think maybe inspired by that, he sent us a piece of his head. And in the end,

71
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,760
 I think he just almost overruled the body editor. And I said, we have to accept this as a record,

72
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,400
 because he's going to this great length. He's so passionate. And he is clearly more than 100%

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,080
 covered in ink. So eventually he got the record. Wow. People and their heads and you are something

74
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,920
 I feel are like really connected. I read a story that you were walking down the street one day,

75
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,840
 and a man recognized you, stopped you and just started kicking himself in the head

76
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,160
 in order to show you that he was able to do a bunch of it in the space of a minute.

77
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 And he made it into the book in the end, right? Because that was also, and that started off as

78
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,280
 a joke. How many times could you get a thousand applications a week to deal with and a thousand

79
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,720
 from all around the world? It's a lot to process. And you end up rejecting 95% of what you get. And

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,480
 in one included would be most times to kick yourself in the head. Well, I think that he said

81
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,480
 most kicks to the head. So we did clarify, did you mean like your head or someone else's? No,

82
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,440
 it's his own head. Did you improvise on the spot? It's definitely your own.

83
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,400
 But this is one of Jane Torrken's favorite facts that he did in the past, a podcast,

84
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,280
 a world record for most kicks to one's own head is 127 in a minute. And it's bloody hard. I mean,

85
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,000
 the physical effort involved. So it happens all the time when people, I mean, that's why we tend

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,040
 not to let people into the office, hence why Lucky Rich was turned away. He looks like a smurf,

87
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,480
 but he looks like the angriest smurf in the village. He, because yeah, he's completely blue.

88
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,560
 I wasn't expecting that. Yeah, I think if everything fades to blue eventually,

89
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,720
 isn't that right? It sounds like a philosophical statement, everything fades to blue.

90
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,640
 He's got his ear canals done, apparently. And I want to know how deep we're talking here.

91
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,000
 His gums, which is very weird. Has he shown you his gums, presumably? Gums, yeah, gums eyelid.

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I mean, we've seen tongues tattooed. We don't do tattooed eyeballs. So we'd

93
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,200
 refuse to accept that because it's just too far. And it's very, very bad for you. So medically,

94
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,160
 we can't. Does he have them? Does Lucky have them? No. Okay. The thing I was going to say,

95
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,160
 the one that you may want to not use when it's so weird, but the strangest application we've had

96
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,640
 is for someone who could who tattoos their own rectum. And what is bizarre is that they actually

97
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,720
 prolapse the rectum in order to tattoo it and then stick it back in. So I suspect, I don't know.

98
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,080
 Do they tattoo their own because no one else will do it for them? Yes, for a very steady hand.

99
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,440
 A very cool head. And of course we did reject that. We don't want to be encouraging such activity.

100
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,960
 Oh, I don't know. Cover shot for next year's book. Hey kids, have a go. Oh my God.

101
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,760
 The Guinness line's pretty far out, but you do have a line. I found out a favorite tattoo artist

102
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,760
 who I think is still practicing with mine. So this is a guy called Blaine Dickinson.

103
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,200
 And he got in the news in 2007. I can't believe he got in the news for this, but he tattooed

104
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
 a full English breakfast on top of a man's head. And that was that was it. The man requested it.

105
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,200
 Or was it unwanted? I don't think he hadn't requested it. But Blaine Dickinson had said,

106
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,600
 "I want to do this and I need to volunteer." Right? So then he found a volunteer, some 19-year-old,

107
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,960
 who said, "Yeah, I'll do that. It's funny." Anyway, the next thing Blaine Dickinson did,

108
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,080
 he got Anne Robinson's face tattooed onto his bottom next to the words, "You are the weakest

109
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,840
 link goodbye." Because he had been on the weakest link, but he got kicked out in the first round.

110
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,280
 He was on the show for about 45 seconds in total. He got Anne Robinson's face tattooed on him.

111
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,600
 We have an ultra fan who has the owner of Guinness World Records picture tattooed on himself.

112
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,280
 And I think also restraining order, so you can't come near the office as well.

113
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,120
 What tattooed on him? Well, it probably should be.

114
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
 You know more women than men have tattoos. I find that really surprising.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,080
 Interesting. I find that surprising, yeah.

116
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,240
 In almost every country. So it's in the UK, it's 40% to 36%. 40% of women have tattoos.

117
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,520
 It's quite high, isn't it? Yeah. And I'm sorry, that's the average, it's 40% to 36%.

118
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,920
 In the UK, it's 47% to 33%. And they're also more popular among people with higher levels of education.

119
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,560
 Are they? Interesting. Is that because they can afford it as well, I wonder.

120
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,800
 They're quite expensive, aren't they? Oh, you can get some cheap backstreet ones.

121
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,040
 I definitely have a couple of friends of mine for 17. Get some 20-quid jobs.

122
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
 I found one tattoo, which is worth millions. You'd obviously have to remove it from the person

123
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,760
 in order to sell it at auction. Oh, is it a line of code that is the code for Google

124
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,040
 or their algorithm? Why would that be worth that much?

125
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,400
 Because it runs Google. Oh, you mean it's like actually used. Someone's plugged in via their back.

126
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,280
 Well, Google's keeping one person prisoner in a cellar and all of it's code.

127
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,640
 I'm not saying that necessarily, but I'm just saying that that might be, yeah.

128
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
 That would be a way of keeping the secret, wouldn't it?

129
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,320
 Yeah. Well, he's got it in one. Yeah, you know, is that it? That's it.

130
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:44,560
 No, it is. In fact, Kate Moss has two birds, two sort of flock of birds on her lower back.

131
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,400
 Wait, two or a flock? Well, I thought it was two because I've seen the picture.

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,040
 But then she said we decided to do a flock of birds in the quote that I'm looking at right now.

133
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,120
 It's in the picture that I saw. It's two little birds on the back.

134
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,280
 And it was tattooed by Lucian Freud, the famous artist.

135
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,680
 And these are original drawings and he used to tattoo when he was in the Navy.

136
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,080
 So he would tattoo sailors and she heard about that when they were chatting one day

137
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,400
 and she said, I'd love to have a tattoo by you.

138
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,640
 So she thinks that probably everyone in the Navy from his period is probably passed away by now.

139
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,960
 So she's probably the only living person with a Lucian Freud original tattoo.

140
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,920
 So she said if you cut that off her body, I'm not saying anyone should if you're listening.

141
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,960
 She's already sent it to Craig in a matchbox.

142
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,040
 But you know, that skin is is worth a lot. It's original art by Lucian Freud.

143
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,360
 There's another very expensive tattoo or a very tattoo that's worth a huge amount.

144
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
 And that belongs to a guy called Tim Steiner. Do you know about this guy?

145
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,560
 So he has a tattoo on his back that was designed by this Belgian artist called Wim Del Voi.

146
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
 And it's very cool if you look it up, it covers his whole back and there's like

147
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,400
 fish being ridden by children and stuff like that.

148
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,880
 And it was sold to a German art collector called Rick Reinking.

149
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,680
 And the idea is that when he dies, when Tim Steiner dies,

150
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,600
 he's agreed that his back can be removed and it'll be given to Rick Reinking

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,160
 and framed on his wall. And it was a good few tens of thousands of pounds he paid for that.

152
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
 So he's already sold it and he's got the money.

153
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
 He's got the money.

154
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,520
 Again, I like we discussed with selling your hair in advance.

155
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,560
 That was the thing that people did. They'd sell the hair and they get a small down payment

156
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
 for making the deal and then they'd go back for the rest of it.

157
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,640
 When they dropped the hair off, I would just run away.

158
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 I would just run away, take the money and run.

159
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,120
 Yeah. Yeah. If you're a tattoo back guy.

160
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,600
 Yeah.

161
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
 Tattoo back guy didn't get the money though.

162
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,640
 The artist who tattooed it on got the money.

163
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,480
 What the hell does tattoo back guy get?

164
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
 I don't know. A little bit of a fame on the No Such Things as a Fish podcast.

165
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,360
 But does he get anything? He must get a percentage.

166
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,760
 I think he got some payment, yeah, because he had to sign a contract.

167
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
 There is a roll dial short story about a guy who has a beautiful work of art

168
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,080
 by a famous artist tattooed on his back.

169
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,240
 And then it ends up in a gallery.

170
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
 And does he get money before he dies?

171
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,280
 I can't remember the details. I think he might do.

172
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 Oh wow, plagiarized by this artist.

173
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,480
 Right. Okay, here's an ethical dilemma for all of you.

174
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,800
 Okay.

175
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
 You're a doctor working in an A&E department, right?

176
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,640
 Yeah.

177
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,680
 Someone comes in, patient, unconscious.

178
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,720
 They have the words do not resuscitate tattooed on their chest.

179
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,120
 Yep.

180
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,920
 The word not is underlined.

181
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,400
 It's quite emphatic. Do not resuscitate.

182
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,800
 And it's signed as well also in a tattoo.

183
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,360
 Yeah.

184
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
 Do you resuscitate the guy?

185
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:22,800
 No.

186
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
 Okay.

187
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
 No, that's a thing, right?

188
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
 It's a thing where you can request.

189
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,720
 I believe...

190
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
 You can request it, but it's paperwork.

191
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:28,640
 Yeah.

192
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
 It's like this is not an official...

193
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,360
 Oh no, but yeah, I guess it's just a reminder.

194
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
 Because I read about another lady who had that on her front,

195
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,840
 but on her back just in case she was on the wrong side.

196
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,720
 It said PTO.

197
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,960
 So, yeah.

198
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,000
 Wow. Old Dan has really reduced this,

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I would think, quite complicated ethical dilemma,

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
 which actually happened when the hospital called in specialists for.

201
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
 You just said no, don't resuscitate.

202
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,520
 Yeah, that is really tough because I think,

203
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
 and I have not researched this,

204
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
 so please don't quote me on this, any actual surgeons.

205
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,680
 But I think it's like if the patient has made their wishes clear,

206
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
 you're supposed to follow them.

207
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
 I think there are ways in which you can make wishes clear.

208
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,280
 So it is sometimes a bit of a gray area,

209
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,440
 and that does seem quite clear once you've underlined it.

210
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
 Unless you meant to do a strike through, of course,

211
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,960
 and you slightly misaligned it.

212
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,520
 Yeah.

213
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,600
 But there was someone else who in 2012 had a DNR tattoo on his chest,

214
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,520
 but he was conscious when he was in hospital,

215
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,160
 and the doctor said, "Look, what's this DNR tattoo on your chest?"

216
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,960
 And he said, "Oh, I got it because I lost a bet playing poker."

217
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,040
 I actually would loved, if ever I'm in the position,

218
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,320
 I'd love to be resuscitated.

219
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
 And the doctor said, "You should really get that tattoo removed."

220
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
 And he said, "I don't think anyone will take it seriously."

221
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,200
 Wow.

222
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,480
 So it can, you know.

223
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,200
 Well, DNR could now resuscitate.

225
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,960
 Imagine getting it through now, resuscitate.

226
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:57,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

227
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,400
 My fact this week is that the judge who presided over the Da Vinci Code plagiarism case

228
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,000
 hid his own code in the actual text of the judgment.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Unprofessional.

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,920
 Very unprofessional.

231
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
 Yeah, so there was this big plagiarism case.

232
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,400
 I don't know if you remember, between Dan Brown, the author of the Da Vinci Code,

233
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,000
 and the authors of a book called The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.

234
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,800
 And The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail was a nonfiction book where a hypothesis was put out

235
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,240
 that the Grail was in fact a bloodline lineage of Christ.

236
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,640
 And there's a lot of similarities in the book to the point where Dan Brown actually

237
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,960
 amalgamates the author's names,

238
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,680
 pageant and Lee, into a character within the book.

239
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,920
 So there's definitely a sort of acknowledgement of the book.

240
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
 Anyway, huge case, multi-million dollar case,

241
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,840
 and the judge finds in favor of Dan Brown saying it is not plagiarism.

242
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,000
 And when he handed over the judgment, it went round to all sorts of, you know,

243
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,400
 different media outlets, including The Guardian,

244
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,640
 where a journalist who was also a lawyer called Dan Tench was reading it,

245
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,040
 and he noticed that certain words had just a random letter italicized in it for no reason at all.

246
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,120
 And he thought, "That's a bit odd. What's going on there?"

247
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,080
 And then this is where the story gets a bit hazy for me,

248
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,880
 because it sounds like the judge, Justice Peter Smith,

249
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,200
 wrote to Dan Tench to say, "Have you noticed anything weird about the old judgment there?"

250
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 Yeah, he really, really wanted it to be found.

251
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,920
 Yeah, like a kid with a secret.

252
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,600
 Yeah, exactly, you know, look at the opening paragraph, see what you see.

253
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,800
 And then he was like, "Yeah, I noticed the italics, you know, it's a bit odd."

254
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,160
 So he tried to crack it, wasn't quite sure how to do it,

255
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,960
 and then old judge got back in contact going, "Ooh, why don't you look at my who's who?

256
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
 I've had some clues in there."

257
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,400
 The middle of a manslaughter case, he's just there typing away.

258
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
 Also, he's British, I don't know why I've given him some like old Wild West gold dick.

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,120
 Well now, if you look at it, so more and more clues were given,

260
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,280
 and they kept trying to crack it, and eventually it was cracked.

261
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,000
 And the answer was so dull.

262
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,240
 It's so weird.

263
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
 Yeah.

264
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
 I think it's a very interesting answer.

265
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
 Yeah, I think it's not dull, I think it's absolutely bizarre.

266
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
 Yeah, sorry, go on Andy.

267
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,600
 The answer is Jackie Fisher, who are you? Dreadnought, okay?

268
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 And Jackie Fisher was an admiral in the early 20th century,

269
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,440
 who's really interesting, he changed the whole Royal Navy, he's incredible.

270
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,520
 And Justice Peter Smith had a particular interest in Jackie Fisher,

271
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,720
 so hid this code completely for his own amusement.

272
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,920
 But Jackie Fisher's amazing.

273
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 He's so cool.

274
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,440
 First person ever to use the abbreviation OMG, to mean oh my god,

275
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,960
 when he was in his 70s.

276
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
 So very cool and down with the kids, wasn't he?

277
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 Wow, when was Jackie Fisher around, sorry?

278
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,600
 He was running to Winston Churchill, I think, just after the First World War, was it?

279
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,960
 It was in 1917 that he used that, but he is incredible.

280
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,280
 Jackie Fisher, he joined the Navy at the age of 13, which is mind-blowing.

281
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,040
 He served in the Crimean War.

282
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,440
 And he revolutionised the Navy, he created the first ever all big gun fast battleship,

283
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
 which is a technical term, apparently, just all the guns are big.

284
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
 It's all I take from that.

285
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,720
 And he was made First Sea Lord, then he lost the job,

286
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,040
 and then he was given it back again, because the guy who replaced him was Prince Louis of Battenburg,

287
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,040
 who was sort of born in Germany, had a German name,

288
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,680
 beginning of the First World War, lots of suspicion.

289
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,480
 So he was replaced, despite the fact that he'd been in the British Navy for 40 years,

290
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,760
 like unimpeachably, totally British, but he was called Prince Louis of Battenburg.

291
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,240
 So he lost the job and Jackie Fisher got it again.

292
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,600
 But it's interesting that he was replaced by Battenburg, which is a cake,

293
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,080
 because Fisher was responsible for introducing bread onto submarines.

294
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
 I didn't know that.

295
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,760
 Maybe Battenburg went on to bring cakes on one step further.

296
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
 Fisher introduced bread onto submarines.

297
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
 Yeah.

298
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,080
 No one thought of taking bread onto a submarine before.

299
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,800
 No one made the leap from biscuits to bread.

300
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,240
 I think it was because you couldn't take fresh bread, because it goes pretty moldy,

301
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,680
 slash stale.

302
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,040
 So he introduced the idea of baking their own bread, taking the ingredients for bread,

303
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,320
 and then you become bakers, artisan bakers under the seas.

304
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,440
 Okay, Jackie Fisher's interesting.

305
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,560
 But I'm just saying, if the code revealed something like he's actually guilty, it's something...

306
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,360
 What does that actually mean?

307
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,760
 What is the end result of doing all this other than, yeah, you're a smart ass, know what?

308
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,400
 Exactly.

309
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,440
 You're right, that's it.

310
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,720
 But you didn't even get it right, did you?

311
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
 I mean, just do it properly, at least.

312
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,120
 Smitty.

313
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,280
 Yeah.

314
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,680
 That's true.

315
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,880
 Yeah, he made a few mistakes.

316
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,440
 Well, I think I'm on the defendant's side in this.

317
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 I'm on the side of Michael, Bajund and Richard Lee.

318
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
 I think the judge might have called it wrong.

319
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,880
 That's my final statement.

320
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,200
 Okay.

321
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,840
 Oh, MG.

322
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,160
 Yeah.

323
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,800
 Yeah, again, Fisher.

324
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,200
 No, solely because he doesn't sound like a trustworthy character.

325
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,520
 Who?

326
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,240
 He's busy cutting.

327
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
 Wait, Dun Brown?

328
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,240
 Or Peter Smitty?

329
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,960
 The Peter Smitty.

330
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
 Peter Smitty, sorry.

331
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,600
 Busy concocting his code.

332
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,840
 And yeah, the character Lee Teeping.

333
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,880
 Is that how we're pronouncing it?

334
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,280
 And the Dun Brown novels is those two men's names, which I find weird because Dun Brown

335
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,760
 went into the trouble of making an anagram out of Bajund's name, Teeping.

336
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
 And then couldn't be bothered to find an anagram for Lee.

337
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,040
 What's the anagram?

338
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,280
 Eel.

339
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,280
 Eel.

340
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,920
 Eel.

341
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 Yeah.

342
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,280
 It's LEIGH, to be fair.

343
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,480
 So you've got some things to play with there.

344
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,040
 Oh, okay.

345
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,520
 Heigl.

346
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,040
 Heigl Teeping is even for Dun Brown.

347
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,160
 I think that's a bit far.

348
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,520
 Dun Brown, as well as writing the Da Vinci Code, which has sold, I mean, something incredible.

349
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,000
 Tens of millions.

350
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
 Tens of millions of copies, yeah.

351
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
 Almost as much as the Guinness World Records Book.

352
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,800
 Not quite.

353
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,600
 Nice try, Brown.

354
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,320
 To me, the more implausible stuff is Dun Brown.

355
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:51,680
 He is rumoured to be the author of a 1995 dating guide called 187 Men to Avoid,

356
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,240
 a survival guide for the romantically frustrated woman.

357
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,720
 Okay.

358
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,000
 This is a humor book.

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,240
 And there was a story about it, I think, in the New York Times.

360
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,480
 Really recently, there's a woman called Chloe Gordon, who is trying to track it down, right?

361
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,160
 Because she believes this must exist.

362
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,600
 It's by Danielle Brown.

363
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,040
 That's who it's listed as being by.

364
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,960
 Again, the master of codes conceals his identity.

365
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
 Whenever she tries to buy it, she gets delivered the wrong book.

366
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
 This has happened to her repeatedly.

367
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,320
 And lots of different wrong books are labelled as being this book.

368
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,960
 And there's been some error with the barcode.

369
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,640
 There's been some mistake that means that this missing mystery book by,

370
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,720
 we think by Dan Brown, because his agents will not confirm that he's written this book.

371
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,920
 And he's never said anything.

372
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,440
 He completely stonewalls about it.

373
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,200
 But we think it's believed that he wrote it with his, quite confusing,

374
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
 his future ex-wife, Blythe Brown.

375
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,160
 So she wasn't his wife yet when they wrote it.

376
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,880
 Then they got married.

377
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
 Then they got divorced.

378
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,600
 What if the barcode is a code?

379
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
 That needs to be cracked.

380
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,800
 This is all sounding amazing.

381
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
 He puts codes everywhere, this guy.

382
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
 This is what Dan Brown does.

383
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,240
 I know, but this is such a tedious sequel

384
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,800
 that you two are attempting to write between you in imitation.

385
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,120
 I'm saying that Indiana Jones, you know,

386
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,920
 that huge vault of things, just all of this book.

387
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,400
 Thousands and thousands of copies,

388
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,680
 because it's just got the wrong barcode.

389
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,240
 That fits slightly into his early career, as such,

390
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
 the idea that he would have written this book.

391
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,120
 Because he was a musician.

392
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
 He tried to be a musician.

393
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
 He had a CD that was released.

394
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,960
 There was a song in it called "976 Love".

395
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,800
 And then he followed it up with another CD

396
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,080
 called "Angels and Demons",

397
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,200
 which eventually became the first of the Robert Langdon novels for...

398
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
 Wait, was it a song?

399
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,360
 No, no, it was an album.

400
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,960
 He has an album called "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown.

401
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,680
 And it's nothing to do with his future career as an author.

402
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,040
 Okay, so you said the CD became his first Robert Langdon book.

403
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,120
 The book based on the album.

404
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
 What I meant, sorry, is the title.

405
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,560
 If you know the Da Vinci Code series,

406
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,720
 is the prequel to the Da Vinci Code.

407
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,320
 And then the sequel in the actual movie series.

408
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,640
 Very much like the wife situation,

409
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,360
 sort of predating and then becoming the future ex.

410
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,920
 That "Angels and Demons" is the prequel in the books,

411
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
 but the sequel in the movies.

412
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,480
 Greg, has he got any records that you know of, Dan Brown?

413
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,840
 Because he's sold so many books that I would think he must.

414
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,240
 I think at some point he did have that record.

415
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,280
 But the problem is, we find it very hard,

416
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,720
 because we claim to have one of these records as the best selling.

417
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
 And we're not even sure ourselves.

418
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,720
 So we used to always sell ourselves as the best selling copyright book.

419
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,960
 Because in 1974, I think it was,

420
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
 we overtook Dr. Spock's book of child care, which was at the point.

421
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,320
 And then we, because we had effectively the same book, we were...

422
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,280
 Different Dr. Spock, everyone.

423
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
 Different Dr. Spock, you and the other Dr. Spock.

424
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,480
 Yeah, all right.

425
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
 Show them no emotion whatsoever.

426
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
 It lived long and prosper, isn't it?

427
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,360
 He's trying to put it.

428
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,160
 No, not that Dr. Spock.

430
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,200
 Anyway, so yeah.

431
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,080
 That's a really famous one.

432
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,560
 Is it Benjamin Spock who wrote, and it's sort of,

433
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,920
 it was the manual...

434
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,320
 Millions, like 77 million copies or something.

435
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,280
 And at some point in 1974, I think it was, we overtook it.

436
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,040
 Anything else on Dan Brown?

437
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,240
 He never reads other books, which is a bit distressing.

438
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,280
 I could explain something else.

439
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,480
 You definitely read one, didn't you?

440
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,680
 No, I think that's really clear, yes.

441
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,720
 I read one book, took all of its ideas, read another.

442
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,160
 I go tibing, yeah.

443
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,080
 He said in a piece, the New York Times on him, he said,

444
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,120
 "I don't read other fiction because reading other people's work doesn't help me.

445
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,680
 It just turns me into a consumer rather than an author."

446
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,240
 Wow.

447
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,280
 Isn't that extraordinary?

448
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,800
 That is, like, probably explains a lot of it.

449
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,520
 But he reads, well, I thought he reads non-fiction.

450
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,440
 I think, I thought he just didn't read novels.

451
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,920
 Well, I think he does, but I think that counts as reading.

452
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,040
 That's like being a chef and not eating food, it's weird.

453
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,640
 I think it's, it's incredibly odd.

454
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,840
 It's incredibly weird to believe that you can write genuinely good literature,

455
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,320
 but be so arrogant about your abilities that you think you don't need to read

456
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,720
 other examples of it to draw from them alone.

457
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
 Not going to be a consumer.

458
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,520
 A few things on other codes hidden in places.

459
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,160
 So recently, a very exciting code was cracked for the third time.

460
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,840
 Diminishing levels of excitement, surely?

461
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
 Well, it's been a while since someone cracked it.

462
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,880
 This is a book that was called Cain's Jewel Bone,

463
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,920
 and it was a 100-page long murder mystery puzzle.

464
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,400
 So it was created in 1935.

465
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,760
 And the idea was, a prize was given out of 15 pounds,

466
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,160
 which is about a thousand pounds in today's money.

467
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,040
 And it was a novel that was printed out of order.

468
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,320
 And the idea is that you had to reorder it

469
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,520
 in order to work out who the murderer was.

470
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,520
 So page by page, the book had to be reordered by the person reading it

471
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,960
 to work out how the story played out and who the murderer was.

472
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,080
 And it's a short novel.

473
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,200
 It's only 100 pages,

474
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,480
 but the possible combinations of 100 pages are 32 million.

475
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,200
 So it's an extraordinarily hard thing to get right.

476
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,880
 Surely it's more than that.

477
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,360
 Well, yeah, maybe 32 million plus.

478
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
 And they're not numbered, of course.

479
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,480
 We'll say the number of the pages, just...

480
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

481
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,160
 Yes, they're not numbered.

482
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,880
 That's a challenge.

483
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,440
 And it doesn't...

484
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,080
 Do they have some pages where there are chapter openings?

485
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,600
 I haven't actually seen the book.

486
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,400
 So yeah, I'm not sure if it's just one long story,

487
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,360
 but it was set by an Observer's Crossword compiler

488
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
 called Edward Palsmather.

489
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,760
 And yeah, so it was bound out of order.

490
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,840
 And only two people back in the day

491
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,920
 managed to do it, who I think did it in collaboration.

492
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,320
 And then it was republished recently,

493
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,160
 because it's been out of print for a long time,

494
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,880
 by Buddies of Ours, John Mitchinson of QI,

495
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,240
 who has been on the podcast with his company Unbound.

496
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,200
 And it was cracked by a British comedian,

497
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
 who some of us in this room know as well.

498
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,800
 John Finnemore.

499
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,520
 Really?

500
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,280
 John Finnemore, yeah, who...

501
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,680
 John Finnemore's souvenir program on Radio 4.

502
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,880
 He's currently co-writing Good Omens 2 with Neil Gaiman.

503
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
 Yeah, he managed to crack it.

504
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,720
 Did they...

505
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,680
 I imagine it's a terrible book.

506
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,800
 Sounds tedious, doesn't it?

507
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,920
 I mean, how could they do it?

508
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,280
 No wonder only two people did it,

509
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,200
 because it's like, "Oh, can't be bothered with it."

510
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
 That was like a print, no surprise.

511
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,280
 So it was his lockdown hobby,

512
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,120
 and it took him six months to do it.

513
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,400
 And he used to go into a room,

514
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,560
 and he had to research everything to work out.

515
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,920
 You know, he'd be looking into where

516
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,160
 certain train stations were and stuff like that.

517
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,320
 Just constant research to make the connections

518
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,720
 in the book work, and eventually got there.

519
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,600
 Are we 100% sure it wasn't a publishing cock-up

520
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
 that was post-hoc rationalised?

521
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,560
 I'm so sorry we've put your book in the wrong order.

522
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,760
 Why don't we make this fun?

523
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,520
 It's a good wind-up for someone, isn't it?

524
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
 Yeah.

525
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,440
 One of the most explosive of codes

526
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
 that probably rocked the world.

527
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,920
 And the kind of sort of same way that the Da Vinci Code

528
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,520
 really got people obsessed with it

529
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,440
 was the Bible Code, wasn't it?

530
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,880
 Michael Drosnin.

531
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,600
 Do you remember that?

532
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,560
 Yes.

533
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,280
 Have you met him?

534
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,400
 I feel like he said that.

535
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,720
 So before my life at Guinness World Records,

536
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
 I was the editor of The X Factor,

537
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,720
 and not the Simon Cowell show.

538
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,120
 But like a paranormal magazine.

539
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,280
 And we covered all sorts of paranormal

540
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,320
 and conspiracy theories, ghosts, aliens,

541
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,960
 all that sort of stuff.

542
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
 And we spent, we gave a lot of inches to Michael

543
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,920
 to talk about the Bible Code.

544
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
 And is it Ripsy, Liyahu Ripsy, I think,

545
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,280
 who originally came up with the idea,

546
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,920
 discovered this idea and published the paper,

547
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,280
 which then Michael Drosnin went into.

548
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,120
 The idea is that you have a skip code,

549
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,240
 so that every, I think it was like every fifth letter.

550
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,680
 What, so specifically in the Bible,

551
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,880
 every X letter was?

552
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,640
 Yes, I think it was,

553
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,240
 maybe it was in the Hebrew version of it,

554
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
 but you would take every fifth letter

555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,760
 and it spells Torah, for example,

556
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
 or you take every hundredth letter

557
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,680
 and it will spell Diana.

558
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,320
 Or you just go through and you come up with these,

559
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,360
 and it's probably now, I think, nonsense,

560
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,120
 in that you could take any big subject,

561
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,920
 any big book, and apply a skip code to it

562
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,160
 and you will find secret messages.

563
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,480
 In the Bible, if you take every two millionth letter,

564
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
 it spells out Jackie Fisher, who are you?

565
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,000
 Dreadnought.

566
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,800
 (all laughing)

567
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,360
 Exciting.

568
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,360
 Yes, so I think someone did a bit of research

569
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,400
 to disprove it by taking, I think, Moby Dick

570
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,760
 and found the death of Diana coded into Moby Dick.

571
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,200
 And if you apply the code,

572
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,000
 I mean, the words, it's Diana, Dodie,

573
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,040
 Skid, Hearse, Royal, Lady Diana,

574
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,600
 mortal in the jaws of death,

575
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,360
 and unrepaul even is all within the same code.

576
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,920
 If you rip apart Moby Dick and find the code.

577
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,040
 So I think you'll find anything in anything.

578
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,440
 Yeah, it's quite a convoluted way

579
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
 to have written that message, isn't it?

580
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,760
 Why don't you just try to make a normal section

581
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,960
 if you're gonna hide that code?

582
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,760
 Exactly, yeah.

583
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,160
 So you went on to produce this idea

584
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,520
 that somehow it was aliens that were giving us this code.

585
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,080
 Did he?

586
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,520
 Yeah, that was the second book.

587
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,840
 So we sort of parted ways at that point.

588
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,760
 I thought he was an atheist who just didn't believe it,

589
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,400
 but just found it.

590
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,200
 Wow, that's so interesting.

591
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,800
 He thought he was a good believer in aliens.

592
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,120
 No, no, yeah, good point, yeah.

593
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,720
 But yeah, aliens gave us DNA as a code of another kind.

594
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,920
 He thinks it's all connected.

595
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,640
 And yeah, so we stopped publishing him a book.

596
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,720
 Yeah, I think that's right.

597
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
 You don't encourage that too much.

598
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,200
 The X Factor.

599
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,960
 A conspiracy magazine.

600
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,000
 Stop publishing it.

601
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,200
 Well, yeah.

602
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,320
 Just to think about the tattoos,

603
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,000
 the other one that came to mind was,

604
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,560
 it's supposedly the very first use of this steganography,

605
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,960
 I think, is the word for it when you hide codes.

606
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,360
 I think it was as the tattooing people's heads

607
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,960
 and then sending them off as a messenger,

608
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,520
 and then they arrive and then they shave their head and...

609
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,960
 That's just a full English breakfast.

610
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,960
 Sent the wrong guy.

611
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,080
 Cool.

612
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

613
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,440
 and that is Anna.

614
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,680
 My fact this week is that in ancient Persia,

615
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,880
 instead of sitting in front of a fireplace to warm you up,

616
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,240
 you'd sit in front of a wind place to cool you down.

617
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,400
 It's really cool.

618
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,360
 These really cool things called bard gears

619
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,040
 and that spell like Badgers.

620
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,760
 But with an eye.

621
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
 Yeah, I mean, you've really pronounced them

622
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,920
 unhumorously correctly that I think, Anna.

623
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,040
 I'm really disappointed.

624
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,120
 I was waiting to say Badgers, and there we go.

625
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,920
 I'm so sorry.

626
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,560
 James would be so upset if he ever hears this,

627
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,720
 not doing a wanton mispronunciation,

628
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,680
 but they are on old Persian houses

629
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,200
 and old Middle Eastern houses, really,

630
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,880
 and they look like a mini Greek temple, really, don't they?

631
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,040
 But like a really tall Greek temple

632
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,640
 that's acting as a sort of a chimney,

633
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
 and they've got these columns on them,

634
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,760
 almost like Doric columns on them.

635
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,400
 They've been around for sort of 2,500 years, at least we think.

636
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,280
 We think perhaps they got the idea from ancient Egyptians,

637
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,920
 but the idea is that as wind blows past them,

638
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,960
 they funnel cool wind down into the house,

639
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,400
 and as the hot air in the house rises, as hot air does,

640
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,120
 the cool air is pulled downwards,

641
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
 and it would cool the house up,

642
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,960
 and it would often be channeled into the sitting room

643
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,560
 or the general living area,

644
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,120
 and a family could sit around the wind place

645
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,160
 and have their hair blown out of a quark.

646
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,680
 So would it properly bring it in terms of gales of wind,

647
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,000
 or would it be just like a sort of--

648
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,800
 If it's windy, really windy, it's like a Beyoncé.

649
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,880
 So many great music videos filmed in 500 BC, actually.

650
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,360
 If it was a completely still day,

651
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,280
 it would be very surprising to have a gale force wind

652
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,160
 coming down your chimney,

653
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,600
 but yeah, it would channel as much as it could.

654
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,240
 It's amazing.

655
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
 I've got a question, Anna.

656
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,080
 Could these things double as fireplaces?

657
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,920
 Is it just-- could you light a fire in there and--

658
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,520
 It'd get blown out instantly, wouldn't it?

659
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,480
 Yeah, I've just understood.

660
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,840
 I'm born into the room in ages.

661
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,160
 I've understood the problem, yeah.

662
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
 I think there's a bit of engineering side

663
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,840
 which might screw that up for you.

664
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,920
 There's sort of various flaps and stuff.

665
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,120
 They're really cleverly designed,

666
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
 so they'd face a very specific way.

667
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,920
 They'd face in the direction that the wind

668
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,080
 would most commonly come in that area,

669
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,960
 and they'd have little flaps that you could open and close

670
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,080
 and various ducts on them

671
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,160
 that, depending on where the wind was coming from,

672
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,200
 you'd open and close to maximize efficiency.

673
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,680
 So cool.

674
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,880
 Wasn't there also a thing we're like,

675
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,720
 because obviously, once the air is inside,

676
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,240
 the air would warm up and rise.

677
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,320
 They also had sort of like cap flaps

678
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,520
 to let the warm air out,

679
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,800
 sort of the building slightly pressurized the warm air out,

680
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,680
 so you were just bringing in kind of like an air conditioner,

681
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:01,920
 right?

682
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,800
 Modern surgery, they have the same thing, don't they?

683
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,880
 Because the pressure is different inside,

684
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
 so it blows everything out of the room, not in.

685
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,280
 Yeah.

686
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,320
 In modern water, eh?

687
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,160
 In operating theaters.

688
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,640
 Oh, really?

689
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,000
 So that when you open the door,

690
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,680
 you just, yeah, you don't get germs.

691
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,600
 Things get out of the room and not into the room.

692
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:17,600
 It's amazing.

693
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,160
 It's a maze.

694
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,880
 It's a hospital, yeah.

695
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,920
 That's interesting.

696
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,880
 Oh, it's brilliant.

697
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,400
 I was saying to Andy earlier,

698
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,520
 just we're so clever as humans, the history of humans.

699
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,240
 We are.

700
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,560
 Just to like, to invent something like that.

701
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,400
 They've got this far to this point right now.

702
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,040
 Yeah.

703
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,160
 Like, it's just so clever.

704
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,040
 I was saying, it's like we've been deserted on an island,

705
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,200
 and all we had were the elements of the Earth

706
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,120
 and the universe to play with,

707
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,320
 and this is where we've got to.

708
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,120
 And when you hear stuff like this, I'm just saying magic.

709
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,960
 The ancient Egyptians probably came up with this,

710
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,640
 and it's, what a system.

711
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,360
 How clever.

712
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,680
 Everyone listening, give yourselves a pat on the back.

713
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,360
 Yeah, well done.

714
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,400
 Yeah, we are screwing it up now,

715
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,680
 because having invented air conditioning,

716
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,200
 we've now sort of forgotten the techniques

717
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,160
 of using natural ways of cooling houses.

718
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,280
 And now air conditioning is destroying the environment.

719
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,200
 I seriously contribute to climate change.

720
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,560
 Okay, take that pat back.

721
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,360
 And it's all these fuckers' faults, isn't it?

722
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,200
 These Persians introducing the idea.

723
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,760
 No, no, they're the ones who have the solution.

724
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,520
 They invented the electricity-free version,

725
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,480
 which is incredible.

726
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,880
 They invented the concept cover.

727
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,000
 The concept of being cool.

728
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
 No, it is great.

729
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,360
 There are a billion air conditioning units on the planet,

730
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,640
 one for every seven people,

731
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,480
 and that is too many.

732
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
 It's too many by and long.

733
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,320
 And obviously, if you live somewhere really, really hot,

734
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,200
 the natural impulse is to get any kind of device

735
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,560
 that lets you cope with the summers.

736
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,160
 But it's really wasteful,

737
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,400
 because a lot of the energy it uses gets tended to heat.

738
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,800
 So you're cooling yourself and heating the room

739
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,760
 and therefore the planet.

740
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,640
 Yeah.

741
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,240
 Although, obviously, we can talk,

742
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,320
 having just endured a three-month-long summer.

743
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,440
 Yeah, and when it's hot,

744
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,720
 sometimes that's all you want, isn't it?

745
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,160
 Just stick it on.

746
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,040
 I'll be dead soon.

747
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,680
 Just stick it on.

748
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,360
 I love freezing cold rooms,

749
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,840
 I've got to say.

750
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,000
 I'm obsessed with air conditioning.

751
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,560
 Oh, wow.

752
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,840
 There may be a thing you can do

753
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,280
 to trick yourself in this regard.

754
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,320
 This is really interesting.

755
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,880
 There was a study done by a guy called Frederick Rawls,

756
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,320
 who is a psychologist,

757
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
 and he's a member of the American Society

758
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,760
 of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.

759
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,800
 Anyway, his study has shown

760
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
 that if you are shown a false thermometer

761
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,040
 displaying a high temperature,

762
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,200
 you will feel warm,

763
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,320
 even if the room is not especially hot.

764
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,360
 So maybe if we all just draw a thermometer on the wall

765
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,840
 saying it's only 10 degrees in here,

766
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,960
 what a chilly day it is,

767
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,680
 then you won't need AC.

768
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,160
 Whatever.

769
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,640
 Wow.

770
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,200
 That's the--

771
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,520
 I don't know--

772
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,880
 We'll be sacked for defacing the office.

773
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,840
 Have you guys heard of John Gorry?

774
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,080
 No.

775
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,000
 He could have invented air conditioning.

776
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,320
 And he--

777
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
 Somewhere got there first, or--

778
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,800
 No, he got there first.

779
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,120
 Oh.

780
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,160
 In 1851, he patented an ice machine.

781
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,360
 He was a doctor in Florida.

782
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,200
 He wanted something to keep rooms cool for patients.

783
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,280
 And his was a bit different

784
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,080
 because it created ice,

785
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,120
 which would then cool the room

786
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,520
 rather than him cooling the room

787
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,920
 with a manual or evaporation principles.

788
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,720
 But he was run out of business by,

789
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,040
 can you guess, big ice.

790
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,440
 Big, giant ice cubes.

791
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,320
 Pretty much.

792
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,080
 There were these icemakers

793
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,920
 from the north of the USA

794
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
 who made their money hacking up ice

795
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,520
 and transporting them across the country.

796
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,160
 Oh, really?

797
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,640
 And they lobbied against him.

798
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
 Don't call them icemakers.

799
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
 That's like saying Dan Brown invented the idea

800
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,360
 for the Da Vinci Code

801
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,280
 rather than taking it from somewhere else.

802
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,120
 That moves you into his own property.

803
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,560
 This is the most legally contentious podcast

804
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,760
 we've done for a while.

805
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
 No, you're absolutely right.

806
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,960
 The ice sellers then.

807
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
 The ice king, Frederick Tudor,

808
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,280
 was his name.

809
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
 Not a medieval monarch.

810
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,760
 That's quite the name of it.

811
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,880
 Yeah, he campaigned against him

812
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,120
 and John Gorey died penniless a few years later.

813
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,240
 His invention didn't take off,

814
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
 but it worked and it would have worked.

815
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,800
 Yeah.

816
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,680
 Oh, wow.

817
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,040
 Guth and God.

818
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
 That idea of bringing ice in,

819
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,800
 there's an older example of that,

820
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,760
 which was a mountain of snow was created

821
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
 in the garden next to a villa,

822
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,000
 which was imported via donkeys.

823
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,600
 Sort of just carrying it in.

824
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,160
 Bye.

825
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,720
 Where are we?

826
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,120
 Where are we?

827
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,840
 We're in old days.

828
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,040
 It's a friend of the podcast.

829
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,800
 Basie Anus, aka Elagabalus.

830
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,080
 Roman Emperor.

831
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,480
 Roman Emperor, who featured on the show

832
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,000
 because he invented the whoopee cushion

833
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,080
 and his original name is Basie Anus.

834
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,760
 He had, it's pronounced differently.

835
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,760
 Yeah, it's definitely spelled Basie Anus.

836
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,320
 But yeah, so he imported,

837
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,200
 this is the story,

838
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,560
 he imported a lot of snow into his villa.

839
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,520
 So he had this giant snow mountain for the summer,

840
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,760
 just to keep himself warm.

841
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,160
 Cool.

842
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,200
 Did I shove a little?

843
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
 Well, he built an igloo out of it.

844
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,480
 And actually, igle is very warm if you get inside them.

845
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
 Keep them cold.

846
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,120
 Yeah.

847
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,000
 I had this idea.

848
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
 I've got many ideas for films as well,

849
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,280
 which never get made and never get written.

850
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,120
 No one's ever done an Inca movie,

851
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,760
 like the proper Inca movie to end all Inca movies.

852
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,120
 So I had this great idea.

853
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,000
 Went to research around Peru.

854
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,440
 There's an excuse to go on holiday, really.

855
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,320
 But they have similar things,

856
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,720
 don't they?

857
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,960
 The Colcas and where they would keep food

858
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,080
 to have these grain stores on mountain sides,

859
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,560
 which are designed in such a way to channel the air.

860
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,760
 Probably very similar sounding.

861
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,720
 You know the Incas were amazing in terms of architecture.

862
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,000
 But they have these grain stores,

863
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,360
 which are placed about one day's march apart,

864
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,560
 as well across the whole country,

865
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,160
 like a network of them on the Inca highway.

866
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,600
 And they're designed and have channels to drain the water

867
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,400
 so that if it gets wet, it doesn't spoil the food.

868
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,880
 So that's how they were able to grow so big

869
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,920
 and cover the whole country because of these Colcas.

870
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,760
 They're amazing things.

871
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,560
 Yeah, very smart.

872
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
 Yeah, I've heard of those.

873
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,200
 Well, that's like, actually,

874
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,520
 the Persians also had these things called yakchal,

875
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
 which sound quite similar.

876
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,520
 They look like big igloos.

877
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,320
 Is this what these look like?

878
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,080
 They're sort of like big huts.

879
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,440
 Well, the Incas changed the shape,

880
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,800
 depending on what was stored in it.

881
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,120
 So the grain would be round and fruit would be square.

882
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
 That's so you can see from the distance

883
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,680
 what you're having for dinner.

884
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
 That's really amazing.

886
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,960
 And they'd also store non-food things,

887
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,240
 but it was mostly food.

888
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,600
 Different shapes for different foods.

889
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,720
 That is incredible.

890
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,840
 What, is it like a pig shape?

891
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,640
 I think there was that many shapes,

892
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,160
 but yeah, there were some different.

893
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,200
 Called on the cob shape.

894
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
 Flashing hamburger.

895
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,960
 Yeah, the Persians had these huge kind of insulated igloos,

896
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
 which were really similar.

897
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,640
 And yeah, I think a few hundred of them still exist

898
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,040
 and still function many hundreds of years old.

899
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,720
 And you can shove frozen stuff in them.

900
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,320
 They can keep things below freezing,

901
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,680
 even when it's well above freezing.

902
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,560
 Just pop there, put your ice cream.

903
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,160
 When air conditioning was new,

904
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,920
 or not when it was first invented,

905
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,320
 but when it was newly being adopted across America,

906
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,120
 especially in America,

907
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,880
 that's where a lot of AC units are,

908
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,800
 because they've got cities like Washington DC and New York,

909
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,880
 which are so hot in the summer.

910
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,080
 But I love this fact.

911
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,360
 This is from Prospect Magazine.

912
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,880
 They wrote about air conditioning.

913
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
 It was easier to get into buildings,

914
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,200
 because air conditioning units were quite large at the time, right?

915
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,440
 And air conditioning in cars

916
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,840
 was very rare and special in the 1950s,

917
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,640
 because obviously to miniaturize the technology surface

918
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,400
 into a car was really expensive.

919
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,280
 I'll take the window down.

920
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,600
 Yeah, exactly.

921
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,040
 If you're in a car, just...

922
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,800
 But in Texas in the '50s,

923
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,480
 it was so fashionable

924
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,120
 that some people would drive around with their windows

925
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,600
 shut tight in 100-degree heat,

926
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,960
 just to fool their neighbors

927
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
 into thinking that they had AC in the car.

928
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
 Imagine.

929
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
 God!

930
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,600
 Is the driver of that car sweating perfectly?

931
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,680
 But he's got a little thermometer drawn on the side,

932
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,840
 says it's only five degrees.

933
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,520
 I think at the beginning of mobile phones in cars,

934
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
 that the Koreans, I think,

935
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,120
 everyone who was getting pulled over,

936
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,600
 about 70% had just black wooden bricks

937
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,880
 who were driving around

938
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,120
 to make it look like they had mobile phones.

939
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,880
 It's probably as dangerous, but, you know...

940
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,480
 Do you think you can get arrested for that?

941
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
 Can the police find you

942
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
 when they stop you and it turns out

943
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,840
 you were just holding a brick?

944
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,400
 Not on the phone.

945
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,120
 What on earth?

946
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,320
 Brilliant. Get around.

947
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,640
 Always carry a brick in the car,

948
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,840
 just in case you get stopped.

949
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,480
 Yeah, yeah.

950
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,520
 How was that a guess around?

951
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,400
 What, and then just swap?

952
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,920
 Because you can't actually talk on the phone

953
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,400
 if it's a brick.

954
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,840
 No, I know, but you can be on the phone

955
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,960
 and then quickly, you know...

956
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,560
 On a brick cover for your phone,

957
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,840
 just flip it round.

958
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,560
 Oh, yes.

959
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,160
 I mean, just don't be on the phone

960
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,200
 when you're driving, obviously.

961
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,960
 Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's the best I could say.

962
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,600
 Most important thing.

963
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,520
 But if you have to be, get that brick.

964
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,280
 All right.

965
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,520
 Why do you think Aircon was initially taken up?

966
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,720
 Widely.

967
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,280
 Cool people down.

968
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,720
 Incorrect.

969
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,000
 Oh, yes.

970
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,560
 What?

971
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,200
 Walking with that.

972
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,440
 Oh, this is a publishing fact, isn't it?

973
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,720
 It is not a publishing fact,

974
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,160
 although I think I maybe know

975
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,120
 what you're talking about.

976
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,440
 I mean, so it was used in publishing,

977
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,720
 but then it was widely taken up

978
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,640
 to actually warm places up.

979
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,000
 And it was taken up by factories.

980
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 This is in the early 20th century.

981
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,440
 And so the idea with Aircon

982
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,800
 is really the technology behind it

983
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
 just allows you to manipulate the temperature

984
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
 and the humidity whichever way you like.

985
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
 And the take-up was by factories

986
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,920
 and the particularly textile factories

987
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,120
 where it wasn't humid enough

988
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,400
 and cotton threads were breaking.

989
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,280
 And so they mass bought these new Aircon units

990
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,120
 to make it warmer and more humid.

991
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,600
 So nice.

992
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,720
 Oh, yeah, the humidity thing.

993
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,280
 Yeah.

994
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,720
 I walked right into it.

995
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,440
 I did.

996
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,800
 But that's why it's important in printing

997
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,880
 because I obviously like to bring it back

998
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,680
 to the book again.

999
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,400
 But I do spend a lot of time in printing factories

1000
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
 printing the Guinness World Records Book.

1001
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,200
 This is just out.

1002
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,040
 Controlling humidity is a huge thing.

1003
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,400
 Yeah, and that's, I was reading

1004
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,640
 fairly early on that it was introduced

1005
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,800
 because the pepper gets kinky.

1006
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,280
 Because the humidity changes

1007
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,480
 and the pepper warps

1008
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,520
 and then you can't print,

1009
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,920
 particularly for color work on it

1010
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,440
 because you can't get registration.

1011
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,600
 So then does it change the how the ink sits

1012
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,960
 because the paper scrunches up and stuff?

1013
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,800
 So, yeah, you want it to register perfectly

1014
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,520
 on top of each other.

1015
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,240
 But if the pepper is slightly kinks

1016
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,040
 then it doesn't line up.

1017
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,240
 So you get these weird hallows, colored hallows around.

1018
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,760
 I was hoping when you said it gets kinky

1019
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,320
 that all the material suddenly just turns a bit sexy.

1020
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,880
 Fishnet.

1021
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,360
 Yeah.

1022
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,400
 It's like one of those mugs

1023
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
 if it gets too hot every bit so they could ruin.

1024
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:57,520
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1025
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,040
 and that is Andy.

1026
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
 My fact is that the world's oldest balloon

1027
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,280
 has been blown up for nearly 30 years.

1028
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,800
 Has someone's been continuously blowing it up?

1029
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,720
 It's really big by now.

1030
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,400
 And he's exhausted.

1031
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,760
 I'm wary of saying this in front of the records master

1032
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,840
 but there are a few different claims

1033
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,040
 about the world's oldest balloon.

1034
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,720
 I don't know if any have actually come across your desk

1035
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,400
 and been verified.

1036
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,520
 This was a recent story a young man called Ryan Harrison.

1037
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,360
 He was interviewed by the Sun newspaper

1038
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,280
 and he was given a foil balloon when he was born in 1992

1039
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,000
 and his parents taped it up in a box

1040
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,480
 and he insists that it's still completely blown up.

1041
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,920
 So that's one good claimant.

1042
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,240
 There's one guy called Jordan Lyman who lives in Birmingham

1043
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,360
 and in 2018 he'd have one for 26 years

1044
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,280
 so that might be 29 years old by now

1045
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,480
 so about the same age.

1046
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,680
 It's only the size of a tennis ball

1047
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,360
 but he claims it was only the size of a tennis ball

1048
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,160
 when he got it.

1049
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
 What a sad birthday that was.

1050
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,800
 Sad balloon.

1051
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,160
 Well, he was small at the time as well.

1052
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,440
 He was born and he was small

1053
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,120
 so it probably looked like a normal balloon.

1054
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,360
 Yeah.

1055
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,320
 We put it next to him.

1056
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,600
 I don't know why Dan's accepting that.

1057
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,680
 You know, get balloons in proportion to your own size.

1058
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,320
 The younger the birthday, the bigger the balloon.

1059
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,600
 I really went with that, Anna

1060
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
 and I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you.

1061
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,200
 Always has to be the same size as your head.

1062
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,360
 Yeah, there you go.

1063
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,560
 You don't need any bigger.

1064
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,040
 These are the tin foil balloons.

1065
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
 So if you're picturing the balloon right now

1066
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,560
 it's not your classic rubber balloon.

1067
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,720
 This one was a tin foil one.

1068
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,760
 Mylar, I think, almost.

1069
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,400
 Is it mylar?

1070
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,880
 Yeah, so not actually tin foil obviously

1071
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,680
 because that would make a balloon.

1072
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,480
 But yeah, mylar.

1073
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,200
 Well, it's mylar.

1074
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,280
 It's like a plastic thing

1075
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,160
 that's been covered in metal.

1076
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,640
 Yeah.

1077
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:32,960
 Tin foil.

1078
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,000
 Faperised.

1079
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,680
 Well, like tin foil but not, yeah.

1080
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,480
 Yeah.

1081
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,320
 But I just can't believe this.

1082
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,040
 I think they're lying.

1083
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,160
 I'm going to come out and say it

1084
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,000
 and I know I'm being sued by Dan Brown already

1085
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,680
 but you know, we've all had those balloons

1086
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,760
 and they deflate by the end of the day practically.

1087
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,080
 They're kind of floppy and flaccid and sad.

1088
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,840
 It's absolutely incredible.

1089
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,480
 Yeah.

1090
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,840
 I do get, I say I, I mean the company gets

1091
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,600
 probably once every couple of months

1092
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:01,120
 a claim in from mylar/foil balloons.

1093
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,560
 Until you mentioned this was going to come up.

1094
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,640
 I thought, you know, we reject it as a claim,

1095
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,400
 interestingly, or we have done at least.

1096
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
 But they all seem to be roughly the same age.

1097
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,880
 And I'm just wondering if there is a manufacturing period

1098
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,000
 when these mylar balloons were made to a certain spec

1099
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,040
 that was maybe too high.

1100
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,760
 And all the, so it's the balloon on a stick,

1101
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,480
 isn't it the same one?

1102
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,600
 It's a boy, it's a girl.

1103
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,400
 The golden age of making these when they accidentally

1104
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,920
 made them indestructible.

1105
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,720
 So I went through and rather than go to bed last night,

1106
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,560
 I went through, well I stopped at 101 claims

1107
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,480
 to plot who at least claiming,

1108
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,400
 but we haven't seen the balloons

1109
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,160
 but I've plotted them all.

1110
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,280
 When I had a few from the UK, I called Craig Wood.

1111
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,520
 He's got an It's a Boy, that's 28 years and 10 months.

1112
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,880
 Annemarie Ormshaw, she's got an It's a Girl,

1113
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,480
 and that's 33 years old.

1114
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,640
 Then I emailed them and two came back actually.

1115
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,200
 No way!

1116
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,480
 So I've got pictures of these balloons

1117
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,240
 and it's the same type of balloon.

1118
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,720
 Ten foil classic.

1119
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,000
 And it is the mylar.

1120
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,080
 I don't want to say mylar

1121
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,120
 because the Guinness World Records books traditionally

1122
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,920
 were those shiny ones.

1123
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,640
 If you remember, there was a book.

1124
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,040
 Yeah.

1125
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,960
 See, it was made in the same material.

1126
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,120
 So again, weirdly, I had to become an expert in tin foil

1127
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,080
 and mylar.

1128
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,040
 You don't have to say tin foil,

1129
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,560
 just as a sock to tell you.

1130
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,680
 I don't know how we get it.

1131
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,840
 But we have a pet foil cover

1132
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,920
 and we don't know because we want the book to be recyclable.

1133
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,200
 So we've got rid of that

1134
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,000
 because the sheets themselves can't be recycled

1135
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,880
 because it's plastic.

1136
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,600
 This is huge.

1137
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,240
 This is amazing.

1138
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,200
 So I think we need to reactivate this as a record

1139
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,200
 because it's obviously a thing

1140
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,480
 in our job at Guinness World Records

1141
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,520
 is to reflect what's happening.

1142
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,160
 So if people are storing these balloons

1143
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,680
 which they do seem to be...

1144
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,560
 Why do you keep balloons down if you keep everything?

1145
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,000
 Like toenail clippings and...

1146
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,400
 I do.

1147
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,920
 Yeah, yeah, I keep a lot of random things.

1148
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,120
 Oh, you've been to Den's house, I see.

1149
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,120
 But not balloons.

1151
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,080
 But yeah, I do have a cabinet of super old things

1152
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,720
 that I keep.

1153
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,640
 I'll go through and see.

1154
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,480
 Super old things.

1155
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,040
 Well...

1156
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,400
 Like toenail clippings.

1157
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,280
 No, it's mainly like the toys that I had as a child

1158
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,080
 and stuff like that.

1159
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,280
 But I'm doing it for my kids.

1160
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,160
 I'm keeping stuff.

1161
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,480
 Like, I've got the pillow that my wife was sleeping on.

1162
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,680
 Oldest excuse.

1163
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,080
 Oh, yeah.

1164
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,360
 When we keep her...

1165
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,440
 It'll be the oldest pillow in the world.

1166
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,560
 No, it's...

1167
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,400
 No, nothing special like that.

1168
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,680
 Like a balloon.

1169
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,200
 You think your kids are going to appreciate

1170
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,600
 receiving the pillow that your wife was on

1171
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,240
 when she gave birth?

1172
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,280
 North conceived on some of them.

1173
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,600
 I've got my, you know, the blue scrubs.

1174
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,480
 I've kept that that my second son, I was wearing

1175
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,120
 when he was born to give it to him for a Halloween

1176
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,800
 in when he turns 18.

1177
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,960
 Just get them a proper 18th birthday present.

1178
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,160
 If you save this stuff up, it's worth way more, isn't it?

1179
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,880
 Oh, my God.

1180
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,760
 How can you live in London?

1181
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,040
 You must have a very big property.

1182
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,680
 I don't understand.

1183
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,320
 How can you farm this?

1184
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,600
 Okay, so you're going to...

1185
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,520
 I mean, it sounds like unless these are legit

1186
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,400
 that unfortunately for 29-year-old Ryan,

1187
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,520
 he's not got the record.

1188
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,160
 It's very exciting.

1189
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,840
 I think this might be a record for the first time

1190
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,120
 we've ever had a fact

1191
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,960
 pretty much comprehensively debunked

1192
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,320
 while we're recording it.

1193
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,160
 We normally wait until the recording session's over

1194
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,840
 before discovering it's wrong.

1195
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,520
 Also, these people must be so excited

1196
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,960
 because did you say you were looking this up

1197
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,800
 at two o'clock in the morning

1198
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,560
 and they've replied already, presumably?

1199
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,280
 Yeah, that's the...

1200
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,000
 They've been waiting.

1201
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,840
 Well, because I think if you have gainers of records

1202
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,400
 on your email address, people tend to get quite excited.

1203
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,760
 And also, the people who've written in

1204
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,040
 and then we've rejected

1205
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,480
 and then I've written back saying,

1206
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,680
 "Actually, this might be a record."

1207
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,080
 So they're very, very excited about it.

1208
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,040
 Wow.

1209
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,560
 I'm sending pictures of these bloons

1210
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,640
 and the story and...

1211
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,600
 That's amazing that even though it was rejected,

1212
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,680
 she's held on to it going one day.

1213
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,720
 One day, they'll understand.

1214
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,440
 Damn you, Guinness.

1215
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,960
 Well, I'm going to keep it anyway.

1216
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,440
 Yeah.

1217
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,520
 Did the reply go, "Well, well, well."

1218
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,080
 Yes.

1219
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,040
 Look who's back.

1220
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,520
 He comes floating back to my balloon.

1221
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,320
 Oh, my God.

1222
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,040
 So how do people beat it if we tried to set a record?

1223
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,080
 So if we hold a record...

1224
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,200
 To stop to do better than you.

1225
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,960
 But do they record a video?

1226
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,080
 Or do you have to be present?

1227
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,240
 Yes.

1228
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,240
 So we get about a thousand applications through

1229
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,520
 so we can't go to everything.

1230
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:13,840
 Yeah.

1231
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,000
 So we do have some guidelines for filming it,

1232
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,280
 getting an independent witness.

1233
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,080
 You have to get photographs

1234
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,800
 and all the stuff of the space you're doing it in.

1235
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,400
 Send all that to us with the video.

1236
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,960
 And one take video as well.

1237
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,280
 Yeah.

1238
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,520
 Because we don't want any cuts.

1239
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,240
 Or even two videos if you can't fit one into the frame, you know.

1240
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,400
 And then, yeah, send it in.

1241
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,680
 So go to GuinnessWallRecords.com

1242
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,920
 and register your application.

1243
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,800
 We send you the rules

1244
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,880
 because every record has a set of rules that you must follow.

1245
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,680
 If you do that, then you can attempt.

1246
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,240
 Oh, my words.

1247
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,920
 If you set the record,

1248
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,720
 then the next person who applies gets given your figure to beat.

1249
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,600
 Yes.

1250
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,040
 So they'll know that they have to do better than you.

1251
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,280
 And what qualifies as an independent observer?

1252
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,520
 Does that just mean you can't be holding a gun to their head at the time?

1253
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,880
 Like, not your mum.

1254
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,160
 Not your mum.

1255
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,280
 We've had that before.

1256
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,680
 We actually got reported to the Queen

1257
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,080
 because someone, I can't say who it is,

1258
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,600
 but someone who was very famous,

1259
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,960
 there was a famous organist.

1260
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,160
 I'll leave it at that.

1261
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,600
 And that narrows the few.

1262
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,520
 Yeah, there are not that many.

1263
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,920
 Anyway, he did have, I think,

1264
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,760
 his mum as a witness to the longest organ marathon

1265
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,120
 in like 25 hours of playing the organ.

1266
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,240
 But we then rejected it saying,

1267
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,800
 "Well, you can't have your mum say you did it because that's nothing."

1268
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,560
 So he wrote to the Queen and said,

1269
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,560
 "This is disgusting because he wasn't British.

1270
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,360
 Now sit down again."

1271
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,840
 Wrote to the Queen to say,

1272
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,800
 "This is outrageous.

1273
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,000
 One of your subjects has refused me my recognition."

1274
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,160
 So the Queen has to react to things.

1275
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,320
 If you send her a letter, she has to do something about it.

1276
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,520
 She never reacts to any of mine.

1277
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,800
 So then she sent it to the Department of Training Industry,

1278
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,000
 who then got in touch to say,

1279
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,920
 "What happened with the organ?"

1280
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,960
 It's like, "Why, what?"

1281
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,120
 Oh, my God.

1282
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,760
 And they understood in the end that there were guidelines

1283
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,280
 and they didn't follow the guidelines.

1284
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,520
 So that is amazing.

1285
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,400
 That's probably extraordinary.

1286
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,600
 Okay, a foreign organist.

1287
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,800
 I can't believe they crossed the Queen on me.

1288
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,640
 Who's apparently mega famous in the organ world.

1289
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,840
 In the organ world.

1290
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,920
 Longest organ played means very different thing,

1291
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,680
 obviously, in other record-breaking records.

1292
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,120
 You wouldn't get your mum to witness that.

1293
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,800
 Not again.

1294
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:24,000
 Weirdly, the Queen has several records.

1295
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,920
 I've been looking her up on Guinness World Records.

1296
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,720
 Does she?

1297
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,680
 She's got a lot of free time.

1298
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,880
 She's got loads.

1299
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,760
 She has, yeah.

1300
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,480
 But they're all...

1301
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,520
 Boris King's to the head.

1302
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,440
 Yeah, I'm in there every time now.

1303
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,520
 They're all really, like, oldest current monarch,

1304
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
 longest reigning Queen.

1305
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,400
 Charles, it has to be your own head.

1306
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,640
 Yeah, she came to the office once, actually.

1307
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,360
 Wow.

1308
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,120
 She was, I imagine, during Organ Gate.

1309
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,840
 Sought it out herself.

1310
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,440
 Yeah, no, she came because we won some awards.

1311
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,640
 Did you let her in because you were staying off

1312
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,720
 and you don't have to do any of that stuff in the office?

1313
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,240
 No, we did the full "paint the office."

1314
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,200
 I'd love it if the Queen's sitting in reception

1315
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,640
 next to Lucky Diamond Rich.

1316
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,120
 He had Peter Douderswell turned up to the office one day.

1317
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,520
 Peter Douderswell is quite famous in that world.

1318
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,640
 They've glutton.

1319
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,560
 He has, like, fastest three-course meal.

1320
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,040
 And he has this thing where he swallows hot dogs whole.

1321
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,160
 And that is one of the rules.

1322
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,960
 He can't bite them.

1323
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,840
 So he is from Essex, I think.

1324
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,760
 And he, weirdly, opened a can, a can of hot dogs at his home,

1325
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,840
 and then took it on the train into London.

1326
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,560
 Opened still, and full of brine.

1327
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,080
 And turned up at the office and said, "I'm Peter Douderswell."

1328
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,800
 And I knew who he was because it was just one of the names

1329
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,640
 that I just had dealt with over the years.

1330
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,760
 I said, "Oh, yeah, Peter, hello."

1331
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,080
 I said, "I want to eat these sausages."

1332
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,000
 It's like, "Well, okay."

1333
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,360
 I can't stop you.

1334
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,160
 Have you met the Queen?

1335
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,000
 Well, that's why we stop people coming to the office now,

1336
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,320
 because he ate eight of these sausages, back-to-back.

1337
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,800
 So you put it in your mouth and you push one down with the other.

1338
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,640
 So you have this chain.

1339
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,240
 What a nightmare. How do you stop?

1340
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,840
 Right, yes.

1341
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,680
 No, you can't get any more in, literally,

1342
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,840
 because it's like, you know, it's gone as far as it can go.

1343
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,800
 Oh, wow.

1344
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,360
 So do you need a ninth sausage to push in the eighth one,

1345
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,720
 and then you withdraw?

1346
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,360
 You retract your knife.

1347
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,040
 Oh, you can get your fingers in there.

1348
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,840
 Okay, sorry, of course.

1349
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,800
 Yeah.

1350
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,240
 Anyway, he did it. He got the record great.

1351
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,960
 And then he said, "I can also drink milk hanging upside down."

1352
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,280
 And it's like, I don't know how...

1353
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,800
 We haven't got a frame or anything,

1354
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
 but we had two very tall boys in the office.

1355
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,360
 So we got the two boys to hold him by his ankles,

1356
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,360
 upside down in the reception area,

1357
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,040
 and he drank two pints of milk.

1358
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,720
 But what you have to do with this record,

1359
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,480
 you have to get up very quickly.

1360
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,200
 Otherwise, the milk and gravity, you know?

1361
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,800
 And he was trying to communicate this after the fact,

1362
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,040
 when he had a gullet full of milk and nine sausages.

1363
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,840
 And he couldn't get it out.

1364
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,720
 So he ended up vomiting all the sausages and all the milk,

1365
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,080
 all over our office reception area.

1366
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,480
 Do you then have to take the record away from him?

1367
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,600
 He didn't get the milk one then.

1368
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,680
 He got the sausages, that's okay.

1369
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,760
 They stayed in long enough, but yeah.

1370
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,840
 So the office manager's like, "That is it."

1371
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,240
 We're not having any more people come to the office.

1372
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,760
 Your whole office manager.

1373
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,120
 Oh, my God.

1374
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,040
 The scene's outside your office, Matthew and mate.

1375
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,120
 People pogoing up on their noses.

1376
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,440
 How many cleaners have quit after one day?

1377
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,120
 That's the main image I'm going to be left with

1378
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,560
 after this week's podcast, though,

1379
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,160
 is the guy on the train with the open tin of sausages.

1380
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,120
 Why did he open the tin?

1381
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,560
 He probably had one tin left.

1382
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,560
 He opened it and he thought, "Oh, no."

1383
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,440
 Or his wife was saying,

1384
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,120
 "I need the tin opener here for dinner."

1385
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,560
 So you're not taking that with you.

1386
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,360
 Okay, that's it.

1387
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,400
 That is all of our facts.

1388
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,680

 at Guinness World Records.

1414
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,080
 It's an amazing book.

1415
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,200
 Every year, it's amazing.

1416
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,320
 So do get this one.

 We'll see you all then.

1420
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,720
 Goodbye.

1421
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,620
 (upbeat music)

1422
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,200
