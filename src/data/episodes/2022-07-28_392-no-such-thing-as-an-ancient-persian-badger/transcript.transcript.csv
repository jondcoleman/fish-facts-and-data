00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we begin, we just want to let you"
00:00:04,00:00:11,know that we have a very exciting guest joining us today. It is the editor-in-chief of the Guinness
00:00:11,00:00:16,"World Records, Craig Glenday. He's an amazing guy. He came to the office. We sat at a nice"
00:00:16,00:00:21,distance and chat facts with him and he has a new book out. You may have heard of it. It's called
00:00:21,00:00:26,Guinness World Records 2022. It is a collection of all the greatest records that have been set.
00:00:26,00:00:30,"You know what Guinness World Records is like explaining the Bible. You don't need that. Anyway,"
00:00:30,00:00:36,it is out now. It's another fact-packed book and Craig himself is an incredible person of such a
00:00:36,00:00:41,"pleasure having him on. So do get the book and we hope you enjoy him. That's right. And in fact,"
00:00:41,00:00:46,we have one other announcement to make which is that our tour of the UK and Ireland is starting
00:00:46,00:00:51,"very, very soon. It's starting next week. In fact, the tour is going to be so much fun. We're going"
00:00:51,00:00:57,to be doing live podcasts all over the country and there are shows coming up this next week as
00:00:57,00:01:02,you're listening to this. So there are two shows in London. They're kind of work in progress shows.
00:01:02,00:01:07,You'll be able to come and see our first half as we shape and mold it into the perfect form.
00:01:07,00:01:12,"And then after that, the first week of tour proper is the first week of October. We're going to"
00:01:12,00:01:16,Tumbridge Wells. We're going to Nottingham. We're going to Richmond and we're going to Reading.
00:01:16,00:01:21,So do come and get a ticket by going to knowsuchthingasoffish.com. All of our dates are up there.
00:01:21,00:01:25,"Also, 27th of September, our work in progress at the Soho Theatre. If you're in London,"
00:01:25,00:01:29,"come and see that. And then on 30th, go to the Canal Cafe. We'll be doing a second run of it"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"there. It's going to be really exciting, but most importantly of all, get Guinness World Records 2022"
00:01:34,00:01:38,and enjoy Craig Glenday on No Such Thing as a Fish. Here we go. Yay!
00:01:39,00:02:00,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:02:00,00:02:06,from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter
00:02:06,00:02:11,"Murray, Anna Tyshinski, and our special guest, it is the editor-in-chief of the Guinness World"
00:02:11,00:02:15,"Records, Craig Glenday. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four"
00:02:15,00:02:21,"favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact"
00:02:21,00:02:28,"number one, and that is Craig. Right. Well, my fact this week is that the world's most tattooed"
00:02:28,00:02:35,person finally proved that they had the Guinness World Records title by gouging out strips of their
00:02:35,00:02:41,scalp and posting it to the Guinness World Records headquarters in a matchbox. Nice.
00:02:41,00:02:49,"In a matchbox? It's so, Craig, it's so grim. It's a slightly odd thing to do. Did you ask them to"
00:02:49,00:02:53,"do it? No, he was driven to do it. This is the very nice, I have to stress, it's the very, very"
00:02:53,00:03:00,"nice Lucky Diamond Rich. And he has a full body suit of tattoos, as you'd expect. And he was"
00:03:00,00:03:04,"convinced that he had the record, despite the current record holder, Tom Leppard, you know,"
00:03:04,00:03:11,"Tom Leppard, who he was a British military vet, lived on the Isle of Skye. Okay. He was very"
00:03:11,00:03:17,recognizable because he was covered head to toe in this bright saffron yellow and black spotted
00:03:17,00:03:23,full body tattoo and wore gold thong. That's all he wore. I thought like a Leppard does in
00:03:23,00:03:27,"the wild. Like the wild ones, too. I thought by getting you on, we've been very similar worlds,"
00:03:27,00:03:31,"but I think you live a very different life to us. No one else is going to go, you know Tom Leppard,"
00:03:31,00:03:38,"right? Well, yeah, I suppose. Yeah. I mean, this is our bread and butter, I guess."
00:03:38,00:03:44,"So Tom had the record at 99.9% because it was almost, you couldn't really determine. I mean,"
00:03:44,00:03:49,there would have been tiny bits between the fingers or up the nostrils in the ears or whatever.
00:03:49,00:03:53,"So when Lucky Rich came around, everyone just said, well, he's the same. He's going to be 99.9%."
00:03:54,00:04:01,"And Lucky Rich is like, no, I am more than 100%. And what he'd done is he had a full body suit"
00:04:01,00:04:07,"of exotic, interesting tattoos he'd collected from around the world. And then at some point decided"
00:04:07,00:04:13,to black them all in entirely using just a black ink gun and then didn't stop there. So then started
00:04:13,00:04:20,tattooing white pieces over the black and then colored pieces over the white. So it's multi layer.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"I think that makes sense. I think that is more than 100%. So I mean, one of the key rules for"
00:04:24,00:04:29,"Guinness World Records is that if it's not breakable, then it can't be a record. Right."
00:04:29,00:04:33,"So it's kind of like the thing with the, we've mentioned before on the show, a pepper army"
00:04:33,00:04:39,is actually 108% pork because to get 100 grams of pepper army use 108 grams of pork and you kind
00:04:39,00:04:45,"of desiccate it down, right? You dehydrate it. So is Diamond Lucky Rich like that? I mean,"
00:04:45,00:04:52,"I never tasted the bits that you sent in, but I don't know. Yes, I guess. I mean, you can just"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"indefinitely carry on tattooing and layering and tattooing. Right. Rightly, probably angry"
00:04:57,00:05:02,"about this. And angry about Mr. Leppard. About Mr. Leppard and not beating him,"
00:05:02,00:05:07,that he turned up at the office one day and we didn't know he was coming. So I got this weird
00:05:07,00:05:12,phone call. And that's why I got it because I was taking calls maybe foolishly from reception.
00:05:12,00:05:18,"And in a panic scene, there's a blue man. There's a blue man in reception with white hair and"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"metal teeth. It's like, what are you on about the blue man group? I was thinking about something."
00:05:23,00:05:27,"I said, can you just take a note or something? And he left a package, which ended up being like a"
00:05:27,00:05:34,"wedding album, but not of wedding photos, but of very detailed anatomical shots of his own body"
00:05:34,00:05:40,"and all the body parts and like really detailed, like proper, you know, cheeks apart type."
00:05:40,00:05:44,Too much. Would you say too much? The other stuff I'm going to definitely have to cut.
00:05:44,00:05:51,"In my head, the package he sent you was the size of the matchbox. So I'm just picturing very"
00:05:51,00:05:57,tiny writing as the address on it. And just a very confused postman picking up this little
00:05:57,00:06:04,"mouse package that he delivers to you guys. So was it so that you could test the tattooed skin,"
00:06:04,00:06:08,"that it had multiple layers on it? I think that was possibly his intention. We had,"
00:06:08,00:06:13,"I think, did a new story because we'd taken a core sample of the world's largest paintball."
00:06:13,00:06:18,"So you know, the guy who paints a softball every day, how many his wife give a coat of"
00:06:18,00:06:22,"paint to this thing. And now it's, you know, a meter and a half wide. They actually did us"
00:06:22,00:06:28,"a core sample. So you can count the number of layers in an engine, you know, extrapolate from"
00:06:28,00:06:34,"that. And I think maybe inspired by that, he sent us a piece of his head. And in the end,"
00:06:34,00:06:39,"I think he just almost overruled the body editor. And I said, we have to accept this as a record,"
00:06:39,00:06:44,because he's going to this great length. He's so passionate. And he is clearly more than 100%
00:06:44,00:06:52,covered in ink. So eventually he got the record. Wow. People and their heads and you are something
00:06:52,00:06:55,"I feel are like really connected. I read a story that you were walking down the street one day,"
00:06:55,00:06:59,"and a man recognized you, stopped you and just started kicking himself in the head"
00:07:00,00:07:06,in order to show you that he was able to do a bunch of it in the space of a minute.
00:07:06,00:07:10,"And he made it into the book in the end, right? Because that was also, and that started off as"
00:07:10,00:07:15,a joke. How many times could you get a thousand applications a week to deal with and a thousand
00:07:15,00:07:20,from all around the world? It's a lot to process. And you end up rejecting 95% of what you get. And
00:07:20,00:07:24,"in one included would be most times to kick yourself in the head. Well, I think that he said"
00:07:24,00:07:30,"most kicks to the head. So we did clarify, did you mean like your head or someone else's? No,"
00:07:30,00:07:33,it's his own head. Did you improvise on the spot? It's definitely your own.
00:07:33,00:07:38,"But this is one of Jane Torrken's favorite facts that he did in the past, a podcast,"
00:07:38,00:07:43,"a world record for most kicks to one's own head is 127 in a minute. And it's bloody hard. I mean,"
00:07:43,00:07:48,"the physical effort involved. So it happens all the time when people, I mean, that's why we tend"
00:07:48,00:07:53,"not to let people into the office, hence why Lucky Rich was turned away. He looks like a smurf,"
00:07:53,00:07:58,"but he looks like the angriest smurf in the village. He, because yeah, he's completely blue."
00:07:58,00:08:02,"I wasn't expecting that. Yeah, I think if everything fades to blue eventually,"
00:08:02,00:08:08,"isn't that right? It sounds like a philosophical statement, everything fades to blue."
00:08:08,00:08:16,"He's got his ear canals done, apparently. And I want to know how deep we're talking here."
00:08:16,00:08:22,"His gums, which is very weird. Has he shown you his gums, presumably? Gums, yeah, gums eyelid."
00:08:22,00:08:26,"I mean, we've seen tongues tattooed. We don't do tattooed eyeballs. So we'd"
00:08:26,00:08:31,"refuse to accept that because it's just too far. And it's very, very bad for you. So medically,"
00:08:31,00:08:36,"we can't. Does he have them? Does Lucky have them? No. Okay. The thing I was going to say,"
00:08:36,00:08:42,"the one that you may want to not use when it's so weird, but the strangest application we've had"
00:08:42,00:08:48,is for someone who could who tattoos their own rectum. And what is bizarre is that they actually
00:08:48,00:08:54,"prolapse the rectum in order to tattoo it and then stick it back in. So I suspect, I don't know."
00:08:54,00:09:00,"Do they tattoo their own because no one else will do it for them? Yes, for a very steady hand."
00:09:00,00:09:05,A very cool head. And of course we did reject that. We don't want to be encouraging such activity.
00:09:05,00:09:12,"Oh, I don't know. Cover shot for next year's book. Hey kids, have a go. Oh my God."
00:09:14,00:09:21,"The Guinness line's pretty far out, but you do have a line. I found out a favorite tattoo artist"
00:09:21,00:09:25,who I think is still practicing with mine. So this is a guy called Blaine Dickinson.
00:09:25,00:09:31,"And he got in the news in 2007. I can't believe he got in the news for this, but he tattooed"
00:09:31,00:09:36,a full English breakfast on top of a man's head. And that was that was it. The man requested it.
00:09:36,00:09:41,"Or was it unwanted? I don't think he hadn't requested it. But Blaine Dickinson had said,"
00:09:41,00:09:45,"""I want to do this and I need to volunteer."" Right? So then he found a volunteer, some 19-year-old,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"who said, ""Yeah, I'll do that. It's funny."" Anyway, the next thing Blaine Dickinson did,"
00:09:48,00:09:54,"he got Anne Robinson's face tattooed onto his bottom next to the words, ""You are the weakest"
00:09:54,00:09:59,"link goodbye."" Because he had been on the weakest link, but he got kicked out in the first round."
00:09:59,00:10:05,He was on the show for about 45 seconds in total. He got Anne Robinson's face tattooed on him.
00:10:05,00:10:11,We have an ultra fan who has the owner of Guinness World Records picture tattooed on himself.
00:10:11,00:10:15,"And I think also restraining order, so you can't come near the office as well."
00:10:15,00:10:19,"What tattooed on him? Well, it probably should be."
00:10:19,00:10:24,You know more women than men have tattoos. I find that really surprising.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"Interesting. I find that surprising, yeah."
00:10:26,00:10:32,"In almost every country. So it's in the UK, it's 40% to 36%. 40% of women have tattoos."
00:10:32,00:10:37,"It's quite high, isn't it? Yeah. And I'm sorry, that's the average, it's 40% to 36%."
00:10:37,00:10:43,"In the UK, it's 47% to 33%. And they're also more popular among people with higher levels of education."
00:10:43,00:10:48,"Are they? Interesting. Is that because they can afford it as well, I wonder."
00:10:48,00:10:52,"They're quite expensive, aren't they? Oh, you can get some cheap backstreet ones."
00:10:52,00:10:57,I definitely have a couple of friends of mine for 17. Get some 20-quid jobs.
00:10:57,00:11:01,"I found one tattoo, which is worth millions. You'd obviously have to remove it from the person"
00:11:01,00:11:09,"in order to sell it at auction. Oh, is it a line of code that is the code for Google"
00:11:09,00:11:15,or their algorithm? Why would that be worth that much?
00:11:15,00:11:20,"Because it runs Google. Oh, you mean it's like actually used. Someone's plugged in via their back."
00:11:20,00:11:25,"Well, Google's keeping one person prisoner in a cellar and all of it's code."
00:11:25,00:11:28,"I'm not saying that necessarily, but I'm just saying that that might be, yeah."
00:11:28,00:11:30,"That would be a way of keeping the secret, wouldn't it?"
00:11:30,00:11:34,"Yeah. Well, he's got it in one. Yeah, you know, is that it? That's it."
00:11:34,00:11:44,"No, it is. In fact, Kate Moss has two birds, two sort of flock of birds on her lower back."
00:11:44,00:11:48,"Wait, two or a flock? Well, I thought it was two because I've seen the picture."
00:11:48,00:11:53,But then she said we decided to do a flock of birds in the quote that I'm looking at right now.
00:11:53,00:11:57,It's in the picture that I saw. It's two little birds on the back.
00:11:57,00:12:03,"And it was tattooed by Lucian Freud, the famous artist."
00:12:03,00:12:07,And these are original drawings and he used to tattoo when he was in the Navy.
00:12:07,00:12:12,So he would tattoo sailors and she heard about that when they were chatting one day
00:12:12,00:12:14,"and she said, I'd love to have a tattoo by you."
00:12:14,00:12:18,So she thinks that probably everyone in the Navy from his period is probably passed away by now.
00:12:18,00:12:22,So she's probably the only living person with a Lucian Freud original tattoo.
00:12:22,00:12:27,"So she said if you cut that off her body, I'm not saying anyone should if you're listening."
00:12:27,00:12:30,She's already sent it to Craig in a matchbox.
00:12:30,00:12:37,"But you know, that skin is is worth a lot. It's original art by Lucian Freud."
00:12:37,00:12:41,There's another very expensive tattoo or a very tattoo that's worth a huge amount.
00:12:41,00:12:45,And that belongs to a guy called Tim Steiner. Do you know about this guy?
00:12:45,00:12:50,So he has a tattoo on his back that was designed by this Belgian artist called Wim Del Voi.
00:12:50,00:12:54,"And it's very cool if you look it up, it covers his whole back and there's like"
00:12:54,00:12:56,fish being ridden by children and stuff like that.
00:12:56,00:13:00,And it was sold to a German art collector called Rick Reinking.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"And the idea is that when he dies, when Tim Steiner dies,"
00:13:03,00:13:07,he's agreed that his back can be removed and it'll be given to Rick Reinking
00:13:07,00:13:12,and framed on his wall. And it was a good few tens of thousands of pounds he paid for that.
00:13:12,00:13:15,So he's already sold it and he's got the money.
00:13:15,00:13:16,He's got the money.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"Again, I like we discussed with selling your hair in advance."
00:13:19,00:13:22,That was the thing that people did. They'd sell the hair and they get a small down payment
00:13:22,00:13:24,for making the deal and then they'd go back for the rest of it.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"When they dropped the hair off, I would just run away."
00:13:26,00:13:28,"I would just run away, take the money and run."
00:13:28,00:13:31,Yeah. Yeah. If you're a tattoo back guy.
00:13:31,00:13:31,Yeah.
00:13:31,00:13:33,Tattoo back guy didn't get the money though.
00:13:33,00:13:34,The artist who tattooed it on got the money.
00:13:34,00:13:36,What the hell does tattoo back guy get?
00:13:36,00:13:39,I don't know. A little bit of a fame on the No Such Things as a Fish podcast.
00:13:39,00:13:41,But does he get anything? He must get a percentage.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"I think he got some payment, yeah, because he had to sign a contract."
00:13:43,00:13:46,There is a roll dial short story about a guy who has a beautiful work of art
00:13:46,00:13:48,by a famous artist tattooed on his back.
00:13:48,00:13:50,And then it ends up in a gallery.
00:13:50,00:13:51,And does he get money before he dies?
00:13:51,00:13:55,I can't remember the details. I think he might do.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"Oh wow, plagiarized by this artist."
00:13:57,00:14:00,"Right. Okay, here's an ethical dilemma for all of you."
00:14:00,00:14:00,Okay.
00:14:00,00:14:04,"You're a doctor working in an A&E department, right?"
00:14:04,00:14:04,Yeah.
00:14:04,00:14:07,"Someone comes in, patient, unconscious."
00:14:07,00:14:12,They have the words do not resuscitate tattooed on their chest.
00:14:12,00:14:13,Yep.
00:14:13,00:14:15,The word not is underlined.
00:14:15,00:14:18,It's quite emphatic. Do not resuscitate.
00:14:18,00:14:20,And it's signed as well also in a tattoo.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Do you resuscitate the guy?
00:14:22,00:14:22,No.
00:14:22,00:14:23,Okay.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"No, that's a thing, right?"
00:14:24,00:14:26,It's a thing where you can request.
00:14:26,00:14:26,I believe...
00:14:26,00:14:28,"You can request it, but it's paperwork."
00:14:28,00:14:28,Yeah.
00:14:28,00:14:30,It's like this is not an official...
00:14:30,00:14:33,"Oh no, but yeah, I guess it's just a reminder."
00:14:33,00:14:35,"Because I read about another lady who had that on her front,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,but on her back just in case she was on the wrong side.
00:14:37,00:14:38,It said PTO.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"So, yeah."
00:14:40,00:14:44,"Wow. Old Dan has really reduced this,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,"I would think, quite complicated ethical dilemma,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,which actually happened when the hospital called in specialists for.
00:14:48,00:14:51,"You just said no, don't resuscitate."
00:14:51,00:14:53,"Yeah, that is really tough because I think,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"and I have not researched this,"
00:14:55,00:14:57,"so please don't quote me on this, any actual surgeons."
00:14:57,00:15:01,"But I think it's like if the patient has made their wishes clear,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,you're supposed to follow them.
00:15:03,00:15:05,I think there are ways in which you can make wishes clear.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"So it is sometimes a bit of a gray area,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,and that does seem quite clear once you've underlined it.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"Unless you meant to do a strike through, of course,"
00:15:11,00:15:12,and you slightly misaligned it.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Yeah.
00:15:13,00:15:17,"But there was someone else who in 2012 had a DNR tattoo on his chest,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,"but he was conscious when he was in hospital,"
00:15:19,00:15:22,"and the doctor said, ""Look, what's this DNR tattoo on your chest?"""
00:15:22,00:15:24,"And he said, ""Oh, I got it because I lost a bet playing poker."""
00:15:24,00:15:29,"I actually would loved, if ever I'm in the position,"
00:15:29,00:15:30,I'd love to be resuscitated.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"And the doctor said, ""You should really get that tattoo removed."""
00:15:33,00:15:35,"And he said, ""I don't think anyone will take it seriously."""
00:15:35,00:15:37,Wow.
00:15:37,00:15:38,"So it can, you know."
00:15:38,00:15:39,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:39,00:15:43,"Well, DNR could now resuscitate."
00:15:43,00:15:46,"Imagine getting it through now, resuscitate."
00:15:46,00:15:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:15:57,00:16:02,My fact this week is that the judge who presided over the Da Vinci Code plagiarism case
00:16:02,00:16:06,hid his own code in the actual text of the judgment.
00:16:06,00:16:08,Unprofessional.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Very unprofessional.
00:16:09,00:16:12,"Yeah, so there was this big plagiarism case."
00:16:12,00:16:16,"I don't know if you remember, between Dan Brown, the author of the Da Vinci Code,"
00:16:16,00:16:20,and the authors of a book called The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.
00:16:20,00:16:24,And The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail was a nonfiction book where a hypothesis was put out
00:16:24,00:16:28,that the Grail was in fact a bloodline lineage of Christ.
00:16:28,00:16:32,And there's a lot of similarities in the book to the point where Dan Brown actually
00:16:32,00:16:34,"amalgamates the author's names,"
00:16:34,00:16:37,"pageant and Lee, into a character within the book."
00:16:37,00:16:41,So there's definitely a sort of acknowledgement of the book.
00:16:41,00:16:45,"Anyway, huge case, multi-million dollar case,"
00:16:45,00:16:49,and the judge finds in favor of Dan Brown saying it is not plagiarism.
00:16:49,00:16:54,"And when he handed over the judgment, it went round to all sorts of, you know,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,"different media outlets, including The Guardian,"
00:16:56,00:17:00,"where a journalist who was also a lawyer called Dan Tench was reading it,"
00:17:00,00:17:07,and he noticed that certain words had just a random letter italicized in it for no reason at all.
00:17:07,00:17:09,"And he thought, ""That's a bit odd. What's going on there?"""
00:17:09,00:17:12,"And then this is where the story gets a bit hazy for me,"
00:17:12,00:17:14,"because it sounds like the judge, Justice Peter Smith,"
00:17:14,00:17:21,"wrote to Dan Tench to say, ""Have you noticed anything weird about the old judgment there?"""
00:17:21,00:17:23,"Yeah, he really, really wanted it to be found."
00:17:23,00:17:25,"Yeah, like a kid with a secret."
00:17:25,00:17:31,"Yeah, exactly, you know, look at the opening paragraph, see what you see."
00:17:31,00:17:36,"And then he was like, ""Yeah, I noticed the italics, you know, it's a bit odd."""
00:17:36,00:17:40,"So he tried to crack it, wasn't quite sure how to do it,"
00:17:40,00:17:44,"and then old judge got back in contact going, ""Ooh, why don't you look at my who's who?"
00:17:44,00:17:46,"I've had some clues in there."""
00:17:46,00:17:50,"The middle of a manslaughter case, he's just there typing away."
00:17:50,00:17:54,"Also, he's British, I don't know why I've given him some like old Wild West gold dick."
00:17:54,00:17:59,"Well now, if you look at it, so more and more clues were given,"
00:17:59,00:18:03,"and they kept trying to crack it, and eventually it was cracked."
00:18:03,00:18:06,And the answer was so dull.
00:18:06,00:18:08,It's so weird.
00:18:08,00:18:10,Yeah.
00:18:10,00:18:12,I think it's a very interesting answer.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"Yeah, I think it's not dull, I think it's absolutely bizarre."
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Yeah, sorry, go on Andy."
00:18:16,00:18:21,"The answer is Jackie Fisher, who are you? Dreadnought, okay?"
00:18:21,00:18:25,"And Jackie Fisher was an admiral in the early 20th century,"
00:18:25,00:18:29,"who's really interesting, he changed the whole Royal Navy, he's incredible."
00:18:29,00:18:33,"And Justice Peter Smith had a particular interest in Jackie Fisher,"
00:18:33,00:18:36,so hid this code completely for his own amusement.
00:18:36,00:18:37,But Jackie Fisher's amazing.
00:18:37,00:18:39,He's so cool.
00:18:39,00:18:43,"First person ever to use the abbreviation OMG, to mean oh my god,"
00:18:43,00:18:44,when he was in his 70s.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"So very cool and down with the kids, wasn't he?"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"Wow, when was Jackie Fisher around, sorry?"
00:18:48,00:18:51,"He was running to Winston Churchill, I think, just after the First World War, was it?"
00:18:51,00:18:54,"It was in 1917 that he used that, but he is incredible."
00:18:54,00:18:59,"Jackie Fisher, he joined the Navy at the age of 13, which is mind-blowing."
00:18:59,00:19:01,He served in the Crimean War.
00:19:01,00:19:05,"And he revolutionised the Navy, he created the first ever all big gun fast battleship,"
00:19:05,00:19:08,"which is a technical term, apparently, just all the guns are big."
00:19:08,00:19:10,It's all I take from that.
00:19:10,00:19:12,"And he was made First Sea Lord, then he lost the job,"
00:19:12,00:19:17,"and then he was given it back again, because the guy who replaced him was Prince Louis of Battenburg,"
00:19:17,00:19:21,"who was sort of born in Germany, had a German name,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,"beginning of the First World War, lots of suspicion."
00:19:23,00:19:28,"So he was replaced, despite the fact that he'd been in the British Navy for 40 years,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"like unimpeachably, totally British, but he was called Prince Louis of Battenburg."
00:19:31,00:19:34,So he lost the job and Jackie Fisher got it again.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"But it's interesting that he was replaced by Battenburg, which is a cake,"
00:19:37,00:19:42,because Fisher was responsible for introducing bread onto submarines.
00:19:42,00:19:43,I didn't know that.
00:19:43,00:19:47,Maybe Battenburg went on to bring cakes on one step further.
00:19:47,00:19:50,Fisher introduced bread onto submarines.
00:19:50,00:19:50,Yeah.
00:19:50,00:19:54,No one thought of taking bread onto a submarine before.
00:19:54,00:19:56,No one made the leap from biscuits to bread.
00:19:56,00:20:00,"I think it was because you couldn't take fresh bread, because it goes pretty moldy,"
00:20:00,00:20:01,slash stale.
00:20:01,00:20:05,"So he introduced the idea of baking their own bread, taking the ingredients for bread,"
00:20:05,00:20:08,"and then you become bakers, artisan bakers under the seas."
00:20:08,00:20:11,"Okay, Jackie Fisher's interesting."
00:20:11,00:20:18,"But I'm just saying, if the code revealed something like he's actually guilty, it's something..."
00:20:18,00:20:19,What does that actually mean?
00:20:19,00:20:23,"What is the end result of doing all this other than, yeah, you're a smart ass, know what?"
00:20:23,00:20:24,Exactly.
00:20:24,00:20:25,"You're right, that's it."
00:20:25,00:20:26,"But you didn't even get it right, did you?"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"I mean, just do it properly, at least."
00:20:28,00:20:29,Smitty.
00:20:29,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:29,That's true.
00:20:29,00:20:30,"Yeah, he made a few mistakes."
00:20:30,00:20:35,"Well, I think I'm on the defendant's side in this."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"I'm on the side of Michael, Bajund and Richard Lee."
00:20:37,00:20:39,I think the judge might have called it wrong.
00:20:39,00:20:40,That's my final statement.
00:20:40,00:20:41,Okay.
00:20:41,00:20:41,"Oh, MG."
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:46,"Yeah, again, Fisher."
00:20:46,00:20:51,"No, solely because he doesn't sound like a trustworthy character."
00:20:51,00:20:51,Who?
00:20:51,00:20:52,He's busy cutting.
00:20:52,00:20:53,"Wait, Dun Brown?"
00:20:53,00:20:54,Or Peter Smitty?
00:20:54,00:20:54,The Peter Smitty.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"Peter Smitty, sorry."
00:20:56,00:20:57,Busy concocting his code.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"And yeah, the character Lee Teeping."
00:20:59,00:21:00,Is that how we're pronouncing it?
00:21:00,00:21:05,"And the Dun Brown novels is those two men's names, which I find weird because Dun Brown"
00:21:05,00:21:09,"went into the trouble of making an anagram out of Bajund's name, Teeping."
00:21:09,00:21:12,And then couldn't be bothered to find an anagram for Lee.
00:21:12,00:21:13,What's the anagram?
00:21:13,00:21:13,Eel.
00:21:13,00:21:13,Eel.
00:21:13,00:21:13,Eel.
00:21:13,00:21:13,Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:17,"It's LEIGH, to be fair."
00:21:17,00:21:18,So you've got some things to play with there.
00:21:18,00:21:19,"Oh, okay."
00:21:19,00:21:19,Heigl.
00:21:19,00:21:23,Heigl Teeping is even for Dun Brown.
00:21:23,00:21:24,I think that's a bit far.
00:21:24,00:21:31,"Dun Brown, as well as writing the Da Vinci Code, which has sold, I mean, something incredible."
00:21:31,00:21:32,Tens of millions.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"Tens of millions of copies, yeah."
00:21:33,00:21:36,Almost as much as the Guinness World Records Book.
00:21:36,00:21:38,Not quite.
00:21:38,00:21:39,"Nice try, Brown."
00:21:39,00:21:42,"To me, the more implausible stuff is Dun Brown."
00:21:42,00:21:51,"He is rumoured to be the author of a 1995 dating guide called 187 Men to Avoid,"
00:21:51,00:21:54,a survival guide for the romantically frustrated woman.
00:21:54,00:21:54,Okay.
00:21:54,00:21:56,This is a humor book.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"And there was a story about it, I think, in the New York Times."
00:21:58,00:22:02,"Really recently, there's a woman called Chloe Gordon, who is trying to track it down, right?"
00:22:02,00:22:04,Because she believes this must exist.
00:22:04,00:22:05,It's by Danielle Brown.
00:22:05,00:22:07,That's who it's listed as being by.
00:22:07,00:22:10,"Again, the master of codes conceals his identity."
00:22:10,00:22:13,"Whenever she tries to buy it, she gets delivered the wrong book."
00:22:13,00:22:15,This has happened to her repeatedly.
00:22:15,00:22:18,And lots of different wrong books are labelled as being this book.
00:22:18,00:22:20,And there's been some error with the barcode.
00:22:20,00:22:26,"There's been some mistake that means that this missing mystery book by,"
00:22:26,00:22:30,"we think by Dan Brown, because his agents will not confirm that he's written this book."
00:22:30,00:22:31,And he's never said anything.
00:22:31,00:22:33,He completely stonewalls about it.
00:22:33,00:22:39,"But we think it's believed that he wrote it with his, quite confusing,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,"his future ex-wife, Blythe Brown."
00:22:41,00:22:44,So she wasn't his wife yet when they wrote it.
00:22:44,00:22:44,Then they got married.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Then they got divorced.
00:22:45,00:22:47,What if the barcode is a code?
00:22:47,00:22:48,That needs to be cracked.
00:22:48,00:22:50,This is all sounding amazing.
00:22:50,00:22:52,"He puts codes everywhere, this guy."
00:22:52,00:22:53,This is what Dan Brown does.
00:22:53,00:22:56,"I know, but this is such a tedious sequel"
00:22:56,00:22:58,that you two are attempting to write between you in imitation.
00:22:58,00:23:01,"I'm saying that Indiana Jones, you know,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"that huge vault of things, just all of this book."
00:23:03,00:23:06,"Thousands and thousands of copies,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,because it's just got the wrong barcode.
00:23:07,00:23:14,"That fits slightly into his early career, as such,"
00:23:14,00:23:15,the idea that he would have written this book.
00:23:15,00:23:17,Because he was a musician.
00:23:17,00:23:18,He tried to be a musician.
00:23:18,00:23:20,He had a CD that was released.
00:23:20,00:23:22,"There was a song in it called ""976 Love""."
00:23:22,00:23:24,And then he followed it up with another CD
00:23:24,00:23:26,"called ""Angels and Demons"","
00:23:26,00:23:31,which eventually became the first of the Robert Langdon novels for...
00:23:31,00:23:32,"Wait, was it a song?"
00:23:32,00:23:33,"No, no, it was an album."
00:23:33,00:23:36,"He has an album called ""Angels and Demons"" by Dan Brown."
00:23:36,00:23:39,And it's nothing to do with his future career as an author.
00:23:39,00:23:43,"Okay, so you said the CD became his first Robert Langdon book."
00:23:43,00:23:45,The book based on the album.
00:23:45,00:23:46,"What I meant, sorry, is the title."
00:23:48,00:23:50,"If you know the Da Vinci Code series,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,is the prequel to the Da Vinci Code.
00:23:52,00:23:56,And then the sequel in the actual movie series.
00:23:56,00:23:58,"Very much like the wife situation,"
00:23:58,00:24:01,sort of predating and then becoming the future ex.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"That ""Angels and Demons"" is the prequel in the books,"
00:24:03,00:24:05,but the sequel in the movies.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"Greg, has he got any records that you know of, Dan Brown?"
00:24:08,00:24:11,Because he's sold so many books that I would think he must.
00:24:11,00:24:14,I think at some point he did have that record.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"But the problem is, we find it very hard,"
00:24:17,00:24:20,because we claim to have one of these records as the best selling.
00:24:20,00:24:22,And we're not even sure ourselves.
00:24:22,00:24:26,So we used to always sell ourselves as the best selling copyright book.
00:24:26,00:24:30,"Because in 1974, I think it was,"
00:24:30,00:24:35,"we overtook Dr. Spock's book of child care, which was at the point."
00:24:35,00:24:40,"And then we, because we had effectively the same book, we were..."
00:24:40,00:24:41,"Different Dr. Spock, everyone."
00:24:41,00:24:43,"Different Dr. Spock, you and the other Dr. Spock."
00:24:43,00:24:44,"Yeah, all right."
00:24:44,00:24:46,Show them no emotion whatsoever.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"It lived long and prosper, isn't it?"
00:24:48,00:24:49,He's trying to put it.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:50,00:24:52,"No, not that Dr. Spock."
00:24:52,00:24:53,"Anyway, so yeah."
00:24:53,00:24:54,That's a really famous one.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"Is it Benjamin Spock who wrote, and it's sort of,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,it was the manual...
00:24:57,00:25:00,"Millions, like 77 million copies or something."
00:25:00,00:25:05,"And at some point in 1974, I think it was, we overtook it."
00:25:05,00:25:07,Anything else on Dan Brown?
00:25:07,00:25:10,"He never reads other books, which is a bit distressing."
00:25:10,00:25:11,I could explain something else.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"You definitely read one, didn't you?"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"No, I think that's really clear, yes."
00:25:16,00:25:18,"I read one book, took all of its ideas, read another."
00:25:18,00:25:20,"I go tibing, yeah."
00:25:20,00:25:24,"He said in a piece, the New York Times on him, he said,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,"""I don't read other fiction because reading other people's work doesn't help me."
00:25:27,00:25:29,"It just turns me into a consumer rather than an author."""
00:25:29,00:25:30,Wow.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Isn't that extraordinary?
00:25:31,00:25:32,"That is, like, probably explains a lot of it."
00:25:32,00:25:35,"But he reads, well, I thought he reads non-fiction."
00:25:35,00:25:37,"I think, I thought he just didn't read novels."
00:25:37,00:25:39,"Well, I think he does, but I think that counts as reading."
00:25:39,00:25:43,"That's like being a chef and not eating food, it's weird."
00:25:43,00:25:44,"I think it's, it's incredibly odd."
00:25:44,00:25:49,"It's incredibly weird to believe that you can write genuinely good literature,"
00:25:49,00:25:54,but be so arrogant about your abilities that you think you don't need to read
00:25:54,00:25:56,other examples of it to draw from them alone.
00:25:56,00:25:58,Not going to be a consumer.
00:25:58,00:26:01,A few things on other codes hidden in places.
00:26:01,00:26:06,"So recently, a very exciting code was cracked for the third time."
00:26:06,00:26:09,"Diminishing levels of excitement, surely?"
00:26:09,00:26:12,"Well, it's been a while since someone cracked it."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"This is a book that was called Cain's Jewel Bone,"
00:26:14,00:26:17,and it was a 100-page long murder mystery puzzle.
00:26:17,00:26:20,So it was created in 1935.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"And the idea was, a prize was given out of 15 pounds,"
00:26:23,00:26:26,which is about a thousand pounds in today's money.
00:26:26,00:26:29,And it was a novel that was printed out of order.
00:26:29,00:26:32,And the idea is that you had to reorder it
00:26:32,00:26:35,in order to work out who the murderer was.
00:26:35,00:26:39,"So page by page, the book had to be reordered by the person reading it"
00:26:39,00:26:42,to work out how the story played out and who the murderer was.
00:26:42,00:26:44,And it's a short novel.
00:26:44,00:26:45,"It's only 100 pages,"
00:26:45,00:26:50,but the possible combinations of 100 pages are 32 million.
00:26:50,00:26:53,So it's an extraordinarily hard thing to get right.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Surely it's more than that.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"Well, yeah, maybe 32 million plus."
00:26:57,00:26:58,"And they're not numbered, of course."
00:26:58,00:27:00,"We'll say the number of the pages, just..."
00:27:00,00:27:01,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:01,00:27:02,"Yes, they're not numbered."
00:27:02,00:27:02,That's a challenge.
00:27:02,00:27:03,And it doesn't...
00:27:03,00:27:06,Do they have some pages where there are chapter openings?
00:27:06,00:27:07,I haven't actually seen the book.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"So yeah, I'm not sure if it's just one long story,"
00:27:10,00:27:13,but it was set by an Observer's Crossword compiler
00:27:13,00:27:14,called Edward Palsmather.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"And yeah, so it was bound out of order."
00:27:17,00:27:19,And only two people back in the day
00:27:19,00:27:21,"managed to do it, who I think did it in collaboration."
00:27:21,00:27:24,"And then it was republished recently,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,"because it's been out of print for a long time,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,"by Buddies of Ours, John Mitchinson of QI,"
00:27:28,00:27:32,who has been on the podcast with his company Unbound.
00:27:32,00:27:35,"And it was cracked by a British comedian,"
00:27:35,00:27:36,who some of us in this room know as well.
00:27:37,00:27:38,John Finnemore.
00:27:38,00:27:39,Really?
00:27:39,00:27:41,"John Finnemore, yeah, who..."
00:27:41,00:27:43,John Finnemore's souvenir program on Radio 4.
00:27:43,00:27:46,He's currently co-writing Good Omens 2 with Neil Gaiman.
00:27:46,00:27:50,"Yeah, he managed to crack it."
00:27:50,00:27:50,Did they...
00:27:50,00:27:51,I imagine it's a terrible book.
00:27:51,00:27:52,"Sounds tedious, doesn't it?"
00:27:52,00:27:53,"I mean, how could they do it?"
00:27:53,00:27:55,"No wonder only two people did it,"
00:27:55,00:27:57,"because it's like, ""Oh, can't be bothered with it."""
00:27:57,00:27:58,"That was like a print, no surprise."
00:27:58,00:28:01,"So it was his lockdown hobby,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,and it took him six months to do it.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"And he used to go into a room,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,and he had to research everything to work out.
00:28:06,00:28:07,"You know, he'd be looking into where"
00:28:07,00:28:10,certain train stations were and stuff like that.
00:28:10,00:28:12,Just constant research to make the connections
00:28:12,00:28:14,"in the book work, and eventually got there."
00:28:14,00:28:17,Are we 100% sure it wasn't a publishing cock-up
00:28:17,00:28:19,that was post-hoc rationalised?
00:28:19,00:28:22,I'm so sorry we've put your book in the wrong order.
00:28:22,00:28:23,Why don't we make this fun?
00:28:23,00:28:25,"It's a good wind-up for someone, isn't it?"
00:28:25,00:28:27,Yeah.
00:28:27,00:28:29,One of the most explosive of codes
00:28:29,00:28:31,that probably rocked the world.
00:28:31,00:28:33,And the kind of sort of same way that the Da Vinci Code
00:28:33,00:28:35,really got people obsessed with it
00:28:35,00:28:37,"was the Bible Code, wasn't it?"
00:28:37,00:28:38,Michael Drosnin.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Do you remember that?
00:28:39,00:28:40,Yes.
00:28:40,00:28:41,Have you met him?
00:28:41,00:28:42,I feel like he said that.
00:28:42,00:28:44,"So before my life at Guinness World Records,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,"I was the editor of The X Factor,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,and not the Simon Cowell show.
00:28:48,00:28:53,But like a paranormal magazine.
00:28:53,00:28:55,And we covered all sorts of paranormal
00:28:55,00:28:58,"and conspiracy theories, ghosts, aliens,"
00:28:58,00:28:58,all that sort of stuff.
00:28:58,00:29:02,"And we spent, we gave a lot of inches to Michael"
00:29:02,00:29:03,to talk about the Bible Code.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"And is it Ripsy, Liyahu Ripsy, I think,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,"who originally came up with the idea,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,"discovered this idea and published the paper,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,which then Michael Drosnin went into.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"The idea is that you have a skip code,"
00:29:13,00:29:16,"so that every, I think it was like every fifth letter."
00:29:16,00:29:17,"What, so specifically in the Bible,"
00:29:17,00:29:18,every X letter was?
00:29:18,00:29:20,"Yes, I think it was,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,"maybe it was in the Hebrew version of it,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,but you would take every fifth letter
00:29:24,00:29:25,"and it spells Torah, for example,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,or you take every hundredth letter
00:29:27,00:29:29,and it will spell Diana.
00:29:29,00:29:32,"Or you just go through and you come up with these,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"and it's probably now, I think, nonsense,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,"in that you could take any big subject,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"any big book, and apply a skip code to it"
00:29:39,00:29:42,and you will find secret messages.
00:29:42,00:29:44,"In the Bible, if you take every two millionth letter,"
00:29:44,00:29:47,"it spells out Jackie Fisher, who are you?"
00:29:47,00:29:48,Dreadnought.
00:29:48,00:29:48,(all laughing)
00:29:48,00:29:49,Exciting.
00:29:49,00:29:53,"Yes, so I think someone did a bit of research"
00:29:53,00:29:56,"to disprove it by taking, I think, Moby Dick"
00:29:56,00:29:59,and found the death of Diana coded into Moby Dick.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"And if you apply the code,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"I mean, the words, it's Diana, Dodie,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,"Skid, Hearse, Royal, Lady Diana,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,"mortal in the jaws of death,"
00:30:09,00:30:13,and unrepaul even is all within the same code.
00:30:13,00:30:15,If you rip apart Moby Dick and find the code.
00:30:15,00:30:19,So I think you'll find anything in anything.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"Yeah, it's quite a convoluted way"
00:30:21,00:30:22,"to have written that message, isn't it?"
00:30:22,00:30:25,Why don't you just try to make a normal section
00:30:25,00:30:26,if you're gonna hide that code?
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Exactly, yeah."
00:30:27,00:30:30,So you went on to produce this idea
00:30:30,00:30:33,that somehow it was aliens that were giving us this code.
00:30:33,00:30:34,Did he?
00:30:34,00:30:35,"Yeah, that was the second book."
00:30:35,00:30:37,So we sort of parted ways at that point.
00:30:37,00:30:39,"I thought he was an atheist who just didn't believe it,"
00:30:39,00:30:40,but just found it.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"Wow, that's so interesting."
00:30:41,00:30:42,He thought he was a good believer in aliens.
00:30:42,00:30:45,"No, no, yeah, good point, yeah."
00:30:45,00:30:50,"But yeah, aliens gave us DNA as a code of another kind."
00:30:50,00:30:51,He thinks it's all connected.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"And yeah, so we stopped publishing him a book."
00:30:54,00:30:56,"Yeah, I think that's right."
00:30:56,00:30:58,You don't encourage that too much.
00:30:58,00:30:59,The X Factor.
00:30:59,00:31:00,A conspiracy magazine.
00:31:00,00:31:02,Stop publishing it.
00:31:02,00:31:03,"Well, yeah."
00:31:03,00:31:04,"Just to think about the tattoos,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"the other one that came to mind was,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,"it's supposedly the very first use of this steganography,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"I think, is the word for it when you hide codes."
00:31:10,00:31:13,I think it was as the tattooing people's heads
00:31:13,00:31:14,"and then sending them off as a messenger,"
00:31:14,00:31:17,and then they arrive and then they shave their head and...
00:31:17,00:31:18,That's just a full English breakfast.
00:31:18,00:31:22,Sent the wrong guy.
00:31:23,00:31:24,Cool.
00:31:24,00:31:31,"Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,and that is Anna.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"My fact this week is that in ancient Persia,"
00:31:35,00:31:38,"instead of sitting in front of a fireplace to warm you up,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,you'd sit in front of a wind place to cool you down.
00:31:42,00:31:46,It's really cool.
00:31:46,00:31:49,These really cool things called bard gears
00:31:49,00:31:51,and that spell like Badgers.
00:31:51,00:31:51,But with an eye.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"Yeah, I mean, you've really pronounced them"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"unhumorously correctly that I think, Anna."
00:31:55,00:31:57,I'm really disappointed.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"I was waiting to say Badgers, and there we go."
00:31:59,00:31:59,I'm so sorry.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"James would be so upset if he ever hears this,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,"not doing a wanton mispronunciation,"
00:32:04,00:32:07,but they are on old Persian houses
00:32:07,00:32:09,"and old Middle Eastern houses, really,"
00:32:09,00:32:12,"and they look like a mini Greek temple, really, don't they?"
00:32:12,00:32:15,But like a really tall Greek temple
00:32:15,00:32:16,"that's acting as a sort of a chimney,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,"and they've got these columns on them,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,almost like Doric columns on them.
00:32:19,00:32:22,"They've been around for sort of 2,500 years, at least we think."
00:32:22,00:32:25,"We think perhaps they got the idea from ancient Egyptians,"
00:32:25,00:32:27,"but the idea is that as wind blows past them,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,"they funnel cool wind down into the house,"
00:32:30,00:32:34,"and as the hot air in the house rises, as hot air does,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,"the cool air is pulled downwards,"
00:32:37,00:32:38,"and it would cool the house up,"
00:32:38,00:32:40,and it would often be channeled into the sitting room
00:32:40,00:32:42,"or the general living area,"
00:32:42,00:32:45,and a family could sit around the wind place
00:32:45,00:32:48,and have their hair blown out of a quark.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"So would it properly bring it in terms of gales of wind,"
00:32:51,00:32:54,or would it be just like a sort of--
00:32:54,00:32:56,"If it's windy, really windy, it's like a Beyoncé."
00:32:56,00:33:02,"So many great music videos filmed in 500 BC, actually."
00:33:02,00:33:05,"If it was a completely still day,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,it would be very surprising to have a gale force wind
00:33:07,00:33:08,"coming down your chimney,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,"but yeah, it would channel as much as it could."
00:33:11,00:33:12,It's amazing.
00:33:12,00:33:13,"I've got a question, Anna."
00:33:13,00:33:16,Could these things double as fireplaces?
00:33:16,00:33:19,Is it just-- could you light a fire in there and--
00:33:19,00:33:21,"It'd get blown out instantly, wouldn't it?"
00:33:21,00:33:22,"Yeah, I've just understood."
00:33:22,00:33:23,I'm born into the room in ages.
00:33:23,00:33:26,"I've understood the problem, yeah."
00:33:26,00:33:28,I think there's a bit of engineering side
00:33:28,00:33:29,which might screw that up for you.
00:33:29,00:33:31,There's sort of various flaps and stuff.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"They're really cleverly designed,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,so they'd face a very specific way.
00:33:34,00:33:35,They'd face in the direction that the wind
00:33:35,00:33:38,"would most commonly come in that area,"
00:33:38,00:33:40,and they'd have little flaps that you could open and close
00:33:40,00:33:42,and various ducts on them
00:33:42,00:33:44,"that, depending on where the wind was coming from,"
00:33:44,00:33:47,you'd open and close to maximize efficiency.
00:33:47,00:33:47,So cool.
00:33:47,00:33:48,"Wasn't there also a thing we're like,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,"because obviously, once the air is inside,"
00:33:50,00:33:52,the air would warm up and rise.
00:33:52,00:33:54,They also had sort of like cap flaps
00:33:54,00:33:55,"to let the warm air out,"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"sort of the building slightly pressurized the warm air out,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"so you were just bringing in kind of like an air conditioner,"
00:34:01,00:34:01,right?
00:34:01,00:34:04,"Modern surgery, they have the same thing, don't they?"
00:34:04,00:34:06,"Because the pressure is different inside,"
00:34:06,00:34:08,"so it blows everything out of the room, not in."
00:34:08,00:34:09,Yeah.
00:34:09,00:34:10,"In modern water, eh?"
00:34:10,00:34:12,In operating theaters.
00:34:12,00:34:12,"Oh, really?"
00:34:12,00:34:14,"So that when you open the door,"
00:34:14,00:34:15,"you just, yeah, you don't get germs."
00:34:15,00:34:17,Things get out of the room and not into the room.
00:34:17,00:34:17,It's amazing.
00:34:17,00:34:18,It's a maze.
00:34:18,00:34:18,"It's a hospital, yeah."
00:34:18,00:34:19,That's interesting.
00:34:19,00:34:20,"Oh, it's brilliant."
00:34:20,00:34:22,"I was saying to Andy earlier,"
00:34:22,00:34:25,"just we're so clever as humans, the history of humans."
00:34:25,00:34:26,We are.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"Just to like, to invent something like that."
00:34:28,00:34:30,They've got this far to this point right now.
00:34:30,00:34:31,Yeah.
00:34:31,00:34:32,"Like, it's just so clever."
00:34:32,00:34:35,"I was saying, it's like we've been deserted on an island,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,and all we had were the elements of the Earth
00:34:37,00:34:39,"and the universe to play with,"
00:34:39,00:34:40,and this is where we've got to.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"And when you hear stuff like this, I'm just saying magic."
00:34:43,00:34:44,"The ancient Egyptians probably came up with this,"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"and it's, what a system."
00:34:46,00:34:47,How clever.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"Everyone listening, give yourselves a pat on the back."
00:34:49,00:34:51,"Yeah, well done."
00:34:51,00:34:52,"Yeah, we are screwing it up now,"
00:34:52,00:34:53,"because having invented air conditioning,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,we've now sort of forgotten the techniques
00:34:55,00:34:58,of using natural ways of cooling houses.
00:34:58,00:35:01,And now air conditioning is destroying the environment.
00:35:01,00:35:03,I seriously contribute to climate change.
00:35:03,00:35:04,"Okay, take that pat back."
00:35:04,00:35:07,"And it's all these fuckers' faults, isn't it?"
00:35:07,00:35:09,These Persians introducing the idea.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"No, no, they're the ones who have the solution."
00:35:11,00:35:13,"They invented the electricity-free version,"
00:35:13,00:35:14,which is incredible.
00:35:14,00:35:16,They invented the concept cover.
00:35:16,00:35:18,The concept of being cool.
00:35:18,00:35:18,"No, it is great."
00:35:18,00:35:21,"There are a billion air conditioning units on the planet,"
00:35:21,00:35:22,"one for every seven people,"
00:35:22,00:35:24,and that is too many.
00:35:24,00:35:26,It's too many by and long.
00:35:26,00:35:28,"And obviously, if you live somewhere really, really hot,"
00:35:28,00:35:31,the natural impulse is to get any kind of device
00:35:31,00:35:32,that lets you cope with the summers.
00:35:32,00:35:34,"But it's really wasteful,"
00:35:34,00:35:36,because a lot of the energy it uses gets tended to heat.
00:35:36,00:35:38,So you're cooling yourself and heating the room
00:35:38,00:35:39,and therefore the planet.
00:35:39,00:35:40,Yeah.
00:35:40,00:35:42,"Although, obviously, we can talk,"
00:35:42,00:35:44,having just endured a three-month-long summer.
00:35:44,00:35:45,"Yeah, and when it's hot,"
00:35:45,00:35:46,"sometimes that's all you want, isn't it?"
00:35:46,00:35:48,Just stick it on.
00:35:48,00:35:49,I'll be dead soon.
00:35:49,00:35:49,Just stick it on.
00:35:49,00:35:53,"I love freezing cold rooms,"
00:35:53,00:35:53,I've got to say.
00:35:53,00:35:56,I'm obsessed with air conditioning.
00:35:56,00:35:56,"Oh, wow."
00:35:56,00:35:57,There may be a thing you can do
00:35:57,00:35:59,to trick yourself in this regard.
00:35:59,00:36:00,This is really interesting.
00:36:00,00:36:02,"There was a study done by a guy called Frederick Rawls,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,"who is a psychologist,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,and he's a member of the American Society
00:36:06,00:36:09,"of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers."
00:36:09,00:36:12,"Anyway, his study has shown"
00:36:12,00:36:15,that if you are shown a false thermometer
00:36:15,00:36:17,"displaying a high temperature,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,"you will feel warm,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,even if the room is not especially hot.
00:36:22,00:36:27,So maybe if we all just draw a thermometer on the wall
00:36:27,00:36:29,"saying it's only 10 degrees in here,"
00:36:29,00:36:30,"what a chilly day it is,"
00:36:30,00:36:33,then you won't need AC.
00:36:33,00:36:34,Whatever.
00:36:34,00:36:34,Wow.
00:36:34,00:36:35,That's the--
00:36:35,00:36:35,I don't know--
00:36:35,00:36:36,We'll be sacked for defacing the office.
00:36:38,00:36:39,Have you guys heard of John Gorry?
00:36:39,00:36:40,No.
00:36:40,00:36:42,He could have invented air conditioning.
00:36:42,00:36:42,And he--
00:36:42,00:36:43,"Somewhere got there first, or--"
00:36:43,00:36:44,"No, he got there first."
00:36:44,00:36:45,Oh.
00:36:45,00:36:48,"In 1851, he patented an ice machine."
00:36:48,00:36:49,He was a doctor in Florida.
00:36:49,00:36:51,He wanted something to keep rooms cool for patients.
00:36:51,00:36:53,And his was a bit different
00:36:53,00:36:56,"because it created ice,"
00:36:56,00:36:57,which would then cool the room
00:36:57,00:36:59,rather than him cooling the room
00:36:59,00:37:01,with a manual or evaporation principles.
00:37:01,00:37:04,"But he was run out of business by,"
00:37:04,00:37:07,"can you guess, big ice."
00:37:07,00:37:09,"Big, giant ice cubes."
00:37:09,00:37:10,Pretty much.
00:37:10,00:37:12,There were these icemakers
00:37:12,00:37:13,from the north of the USA
00:37:13,00:37:15,who made their money hacking up ice
00:37:15,00:37:17,and transporting them across the country.
00:37:17,00:37:18,"Oh, really?"
00:37:18,00:37:18,And they lobbied against him.
00:37:18,00:37:20,Don't call them icemakers.
00:37:20,00:37:22,That's like saying Dan Brown invented the idea
00:37:22,00:37:23,for the Da Vinci Code
00:37:23,00:37:25,rather than taking it from somewhere else.
00:37:25,00:37:27,That moves you into his own property.
00:37:27,00:37:28,This is the most legally contentious podcast
00:37:28,00:37:29,we've done for a while.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"No, you're absolutely right."
00:37:31,00:37:32,The ice sellers then.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"The ice king, Frederick Tudor,"
00:37:34,00:37:35,was his name.
00:37:35,00:37:36,Not a medieval monarch.
00:37:36,00:37:37,That's quite the name of it.
00:37:37,00:37:40,"Yeah, he campaigned against him"
00:37:40,00:37:43,and John Gorey died penniless a few years later.
00:37:43,00:37:44,"His invention didn't take off,"
00:37:44,00:37:46,but it worked and it would have worked.
00:37:46,00:37:46,Yeah.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"Oh, wow."
00:37:47,00:37:49,Guth and God.
00:37:49,00:37:50,"That idea of bringing ice in,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"there's an older example of that,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,which was a mountain of snow was created
00:37:55,00:37:57,"in the garden next to a villa,"
00:37:57,00:38:00,which was imported via donkeys.
00:38:00,00:38:01,Sort of just carrying it in.
00:38:01,00:38:02,Bye.
00:38:02,00:38:02,Where are we?
00:38:02,00:38:03,Where are we?
00:38:03,00:38:03,We're in old days.
00:38:03,00:38:05,It's a friend of the podcast.
00:38:05,00:38:08,"Basie Anus, aka Elagabalus."
00:38:08,00:38:10,Roman Emperor.
00:38:10,00:38:12,"Roman Emperor, who featured on the show"
00:38:12,00:38:14,because he invented the whoopee cushion
00:38:14,00:38:16,and his original name is Basie Anus.
00:38:16,00:38:19,"He had, it's pronounced differently."
00:38:19,00:38:23,"Yeah, it's definitely spelled Basie Anus."
00:38:23,00:38:26,"But yeah, so he imported,"
00:38:26,00:38:27,"this is the story,"
00:38:27,00:38:30,he imported a lot of snow into his villa.
00:38:30,00:38:33,"So he had this giant snow mountain for the summer,"
00:38:33,00:38:35,just to keep himself warm.
00:38:35,00:38:36,Cool.
00:38:36,00:38:37,Did I shove a little?
00:38:37,00:38:39,"Well, he built an igloo out of it."
00:38:39,00:38:42,"And actually, igle is very warm if you get inside them."
00:38:42,00:38:44,Keep them cold.
00:38:44,00:38:45,Yeah.
00:38:45,00:38:46,I had this idea.
00:38:46,00:38:47,"I've got many ideas for films as well,"
00:38:47,00:38:49,which never get made and never get written.
00:38:49,00:38:51,"No one's ever done an Inca movie,"
00:38:51,00:38:53,like the proper Inca movie to end all Inca movies.
00:38:53,00:38:55,So I had this great idea.
00:38:55,00:38:58,Went to research around Peru.
00:38:58,00:38:59,"There's an excuse to go on holiday, really."
00:38:59,00:39:00,"But they have similar things,"
00:39:00,00:39:00,don't they?
00:39:00,00:39:02,The Colcas and where they would keep food
00:39:02,00:39:06,"to have these grain stores on mountain sides,"
00:39:06,00:39:08,which are designed in such a way to channel the air.
00:39:08,00:39:09,Probably very similar sounding.
00:39:09,00:39:12,You know the Incas were amazing in terms of architecture.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"But they have these grain stores,"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"which are placed about one day's march apart,"
00:39:17,00:39:18,"as well across the whole country,"
00:39:18,00:39:20,like a network of them on the Inca highway.
00:39:20,00:39:23,And they're designed and have channels to drain the water
00:39:23,00:39:26,"so that if it gets wet, it doesn't spoil the food."
00:39:26,00:39:28,So that's how they were able to grow so big
00:39:28,00:39:31,and cover the whole country because of these Colcas.
00:39:32,00:39:33,They're amazing things.
00:39:33,00:39:34,"Yeah, very smart."
00:39:34,00:39:35,"Yeah, I've heard of those."
00:39:35,00:39:37,"Well, that's like, actually,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"the Persians also had these things called yakchal,"
00:39:39,00:39:40,which sound quite similar.
00:39:40,00:39:41,They look like big igloos.
00:39:41,00:39:42,Is this what these look like?
00:39:42,00:39:44,They're sort of like big huts.
00:39:44,00:39:45,"Well, the Incas changed the shape,"
00:39:45,00:39:46,depending on what was stored in it.
00:39:46,00:39:49,So the grain would be round and fruit would be square.
00:39:49,00:39:50,That's so you can see from the distance
00:39:50,00:39:51,what you're having for dinner.
00:39:51,00:39:52,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:52,00:39:53,That's really amazing.
00:39:53,00:39:54,"And they'd also store non-food things,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,but it was mostly food.
00:39:56,00:39:57,Different shapes for different foods.
00:39:57,00:39:58,That is incredible.
00:39:58,00:39:59,"What, is it like a pig shape?"
00:40:01,00:40:02,"I think there was that many shapes,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,"but yeah, there were some different."
00:40:04,00:40:05,Called on the cob shape.
00:40:05,00:40:07,Flashing hamburger.
00:40:07,00:40:12,"Yeah, the Persians had these huge kind of insulated igloos,"
00:40:12,00:40:14,which were really similar.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"And yeah, I think a few hundred of them still exist"
00:40:16,00:40:19,and still function many hundreds of years old.
00:40:19,00:40:20,And you can shove frozen stuff in them.
00:40:20,00:40:22,"They can keep things below freezing,"
00:40:22,00:40:23,even when it's well above freezing.
00:40:23,00:40:26,"Just pop there, put your ice cream."
00:40:26,00:40:28,"When air conditioning was new,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,"or not when it was first invented,"
00:40:29,00:40:32,"but when it was newly being adopted across America,"
00:40:32,00:40:33,"especially in America,"
00:40:33,00:40:34,"that's where a lot of AC units are,"
00:40:34,00:40:36,"because they've got cities like Washington DC and New York,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,which are so hot in the summer.
00:40:38,00:40:40,But I love this fact.
00:40:40,00:40:41,This is from Prospect Magazine.
00:40:41,00:40:42,They wrote about air conditioning.
00:40:42,00:40:44,"It was easier to get into buildings,"
00:40:44,00:40:47,"because air conditioning units were quite large at the time, right?"
00:40:47,00:40:49,And air conditioning in cars
00:40:49,00:40:51,"was very rare and special in the 1950s,"
00:40:51,00:40:54,because obviously to miniaturize the technology surface
00:40:54,00:40:56,into a car was really expensive.
00:40:56,00:40:57,I'll take the window down.
00:40:58,00:40:59,"Yeah, exactly."
00:40:59,00:41:01,"If you're in a car, just..."
00:41:01,00:41:02,"But in Texas in the '50s,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,it was so fashionable
00:41:04,00:41:07,that some people would drive around with their windows
00:41:07,00:41:09,"shut tight in 100-degree heat,"
00:41:09,00:41:10,just to fool their neighbors
00:41:10,00:41:12,into thinking that they had AC in the car.
00:41:12,00:41:14,Imagine.
00:41:14,00:41:16,God!
00:41:16,00:41:19,Is the driver of that car sweating perfectly?
00:41:19,00:41:23,"But he's got a little thermometer drawn on the side,"
00:41:23,00:41:25,says it's only five degrees.
00:41:27,00:41:29,"I think at the beginning of mobile phones in cars,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,"that the Koreans, I think,"
00:41:31,00:41:33,"everyone who was getting pulled over,"
00:41:33,00:41:37,about 70% had just black wooden bricks
00:41:37,00:41:38,who were driving around
00:41:38,00:41:41,to make it look like they had mobile phones.
00:41:41,00:41:42,"It's probably as dangerous, but, you know..."
00:41:42,00:41:44,Do you think you can get arrested for that?
00:41:44,00:41:45,Can the police find you
00:41:45,00:41:46,when they stop you and it turns out
00:41:46,00:41:47,you were just holding a brick?
00:41:47,00:41:48,Not on the phone.
00:41:48,00:41:49,What on earth?
00:41:49,00:41:50,Brilliant. Get around.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"Always carry a brick in the car,"
00:41:52,00:41:53,just in case you get stopped.
00:41:53,00:41:54,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:54,00:41:55,How was that a guess around?
00:41:55,00:41:56,"What, and then just swap?"
00:41:56,00:41:57,Because you can't actually talk on the phone
00:41:57,00:41:58,if it's a brick.
00:41:58,00:41:59,"No, I know, but you can be on the phone"
00:41:59,00:42:00,"and then quickly, you know..."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"On a brick cover for your phone,"
00:42:02,00:42:03,just flip it round.
00:42:03,00:42:04,"Oh, yes."
00:42:04,00:42:06,"I mean, just don't be on the phone"
00:42:06,00:42:07,"when you're driving, obviously."
00:42:07,00:42:08,"Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's the best I could say."
00:42:08,00:42:09,Most important thing.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"But if you have to be, get that brick."
00:42:11,00:42:13,All right.
00:42:13,00:42:17,Why do you think Aircon was initially taken up?
00:42:17,00:42:18,Widely.
00:42:18,00:42:19,Cool people down.
00:42:19,00:42:20,Incorrect.
00:42:20,00:42:22,"Oh, yes."
00:42:22,00:42:22,What?
00:42:22,00:42:23,Walking with that.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"Oh, this is a publishing fact, isn't it?"
00:42:25,00:42:26,"It is not a publishing fact,"
00:42:26,00:42:28,although I think I maybe know
00:42:28,00:42:29,what you're talking about.
00:42:29,00:42:31,"I mean, so it was used in publishing,"
00:42:31,00:42:32,but then it was widely taken up
00:42:32,00:42:34,to actually warm places up.
00:42:34,00:42:36,And it was taken up by factories.
00:42:36,00:42:38,This is in the early 20th century.
00:42:38,00:42:39,And so the idea with Aircon
00:42:39,00:42:40,is really the technology behind it
00:42:40,00:42:42,just allows you to manipulate the temperature
00:42:42,00:42:45,and the humidity whichever way you like.
00:42:45,00:42:46,And the take-up was by factories
00:42:46,00:42:47,and the particularly textile factories
00:42:47,00:42:49,where it wasn't humid enough
00:42:49,00:42:50,and cotton threads were breaking.
00:42:50,00:42:53,And so they mass bought these new Aircon units
00:42:53,00:42:55,to make it warmer and more humid.
00:42:55,00:42:55,So nice.
00:42:55,00:42:56,"Oh, yeah, the humidity thing."
00:42:56,00:42:57,Yeah.
00:42:57,00:42:58,I walked right into it.
00:42:58,00:42:59,I did.
00:42:59,00:43:00,But that's why it's important in printing
00:43:00,00:43:02,because I obviously like to bring it back
00:43:02,00:43:03,to the book again.
00:43:03,00:43:06,But I do spend a lot of time in printing factories
00:43:06,00:43:08,printing the Guinness World Records Book.
00:43:08,00:43:09,This is just out.
00:43:09,00:43:13,Controlling humidity is a huge thing.
00:43:13,00:43:14,"Yeah, and that's, I was reading"
00:43:14,00:43:16,fairly early on that it was introduced
00:43:16,00:43:18,because the pepper gets kinky.
00:43:18,00:43:21,Because the humidity changes
00:43:21,00:43:22,and the pepper warps
00:43:22,00:43:23,"and then you can't print,"
00:43:24,00:43:25,particularly for color work on it
00:43:25,00:43:27,because you can't get registration.
00:43:27,00:43:29,So then does it change the how the ink sits
00:43:29,00:43:30,because the paper scrunches up and stuff?
00:43:30,00:43:32,"So, yeah, you want it to register perfectly"
00:43:32,00:43:33,on top of each other.
00:43:33,00:43:36,But if the pepper is slightly kinks
00:43:36,00:43:37,then it doesn't line up.
00:43:37,00:43:40,"So you get these weird hallows, colored hallows around."
00:43:40,00:43:41,I was hoping when you said it gets kinky
00:43:41,00:43:44,that all the material suddenly just turns a bit sexy.
00:43:44,00:43:44,Fishnet.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Yeah.
00:43:45,00:43:46,It's like one of those mugs
00:43:46,00:43:48,if it gets too hot every bit so they could ruin.
00:43:48,00:43:57,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:43:57,00:43:59,and that is Andy.
00:43:59,00:44:01,My fact is that the world's oldest balloon
00:44:01,00:44:03,has been blown up for nearly 30 years.
00:44:03,00:44:06,Has someone's been continuously blowing it up?
00:44:06,00:44:08,It's really big by now.
00:44:08,00:44:10,And he's exhausted.
00:44:10,00:44:15,I'm wary of saying this in front of the records master
00:44:16,00:44:17,but there are a few different claims
00:44:17,00:44:19,about the world's oldest balloon.
00:44:19,00:44:20,I don't know if any have actually come across your desk
00:44:20,00:44:22,and been verified.
00:44:22,00:44:25,This was a recent story a young man called Ryan Harrison.
00:44:25,00:44:27,He was interviewed by the Sun newspaper
00:44:27,00:44:31,and he was given a foil balloon when he was born in 1992
00:44:31,00:44:34,and his parents taped it up in a box
00:44:34,00:44:36,and he insists that it's still completely blown up.
00:44:36,00:44:37,So that's one good claimant.
00:44:37,00:44:40,There's one guy called Jordan Lyman who lives in Birmingham
00:44:40,00:44:43,and in 2018 he'd have one for 26 years
00:44:43,00:44:45,so that might be 29 years old by now
00:44:45,00:44:46,so about the same age.
00:44:46,00:44:47,It's only the size of a tennis ball
00:44:47,00:44:49,but he claims it was only the size of a tennis ball
00:44:49,00:44:50,when he got it.
00:44:50,00:44:52,What a sad birthday that was.
00:44:52,00:44:52,Sad balloon.
00:44:52,00:44:54,"Well, he was small at the time as well."
00:44:54,00:44:55,He was born and he was small
00:44:55,00:44:57,so it probably looked like a normal balloon.
00:44:57,00:44:57,Yeah.
00:44:57,00:44:58,We put it next to him.
00:44:58,00:44:59,I don't know why Dan's accepting that.
00:44:59,00:45:01,"You know, get balloons in proportion to your own size."
00:45:01,00:45:04,"The younger the birthday, the bigger the balloon."
00:45:04,00:45:05,"I really went with that, Anna"
00:45:05,00:45:07,and I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you.
00:45:07,00:45:09,Always has to be the same size as your head.
00:45:09,00:45:11,"Yeah, there you go."
00:45:11,00:45:12,You don't need any bigger.
00:45:12,00:45:15,These are the tin foil balloons.
00:45:15,00:45:17,So if you're picturing the balloon right now
00:45:17,00:45:18,it's not your classic rubber balloon.
00:45:18,00:45:20,This one was a tin foil one.
00:45:20,00:45:21,"Mylar, I think, almost."
00:45:21,00:45:22,Is it mylar?
00:45:22,00:45:24,"Yeah, so not actually tin foil obviously"
00:45:24,00:45:25,because that would make a balloon.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"But yeah, mylar."
00:45:26,00:45:27,"Well, it's mylar."
00:45:27,00:45:29,It's like a plastic thing
00:45:29,00:45:32,that's been covered in metal.
00:45:32,00:45:32,Yeah.
00:45:32,00:45:32,Tin foil.
00:45:32,00:45:34,Faperised.
00:45:34,00:45:35,"Well, like tin foil but not, yeah."
00:45:35,00:45:36,Yeah.
00:45:36,00:45:38,But I just can't believe this.
00:45:38,00:45:39,I think they're lying.
00:45:39,00:45:40,I'm going to come out and say it
00:45:40,00:45:42,and I know I'm being sued by Dan Brown already
00:45:42,00:45:43,"but you know, we've all had those balloons"
00:45:43,00:45:45,and they deflate by the end of the day practically.
00:45:45,00:45:48,They're kind of floppy and flaccid and sad.
00:45:48,00:45:49,It's absolutely incredible.
00:45:49,00:45:50,Yeah.
00:45:50,00:45:53,"I do get, I say I, I mean the company gets"
00:45:53,00:45:55,probably once every couple of months
00:45:55,00:46:01,a claim in from mylar/foil balloons.
00:46:01,00:46:04,Until you mentioned this was going to come up.
00:46:04,00:46:06,"I thought, you know, we reject it as a claim,"
00:46:06,00:46:08,"interestingly, or we have done at least."
00:46:08,00:46:10,But they all seem to be roughly the same age.
00:46:11,00:46:14,And I'm just wondering if there is a manufacturing period
00:46:14,00:46:18,when these mylar balloons were made to a certain spec
00:46:18,00:46:19,that was maybe too high.
00:46:19,00:46:21,"And all the, so it's the balloon on a stick,"
00:46:21,00:46:22,isn't it the same one?
00:46:22,00:46:23,"It's a boy, it's a girl."
00:46:23,00:46:26,The golden age of making these when they accidentally
00:46:26,00:46:27,made them indestructible.
00:46:27,00:46:30,"So I went through and rather than go to bed last night,"
00:46:30,00:46:34,"I went through, well I stopped at 101 claims"
00:46:34,00:46:38,"to plot who at least claiming,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,but we haven't seen the balloons
00:46:40,00:46:42,but I've plotted them all.
00:46:42,00:46:45,"When I had a few from the UK, I called Craig Wood."
00:46:45,00:46:49,"He's got an It's a Boy, that's 28 years and 10 months."
00:46:49,00:46:52,"Annemarie Ormshaw, she's got an It's a Girl,"
00:46:52,00:46:54,and that's 33 years old.
00:46:54,00:46:58,Then I emailed them and two came back actually.
00:46:58,00:46:59,No way!
00:46:59,00:47:00,So I've got pictures of these balloons
00:47:00,00:47:02,and it's the same type of balloon.
00:47:02,00:47:04,Ten foil classic.
00:47:04,00:47:06,And it is the mylar.
00:47:06,00:47:08,I don't want to say mylar
00:47:08,00:47:11,because the Guinness World Records books traditionally
00:47:11,00:47:11,were those shiny ones.
00:47:11,00:47:12,"If you remember, there was a book."
00:47:12,00:47:13,Yeah.
00:47:13,00:47:14,"See, it was made in the same material."
00:47:14,00:47:21,"So again, weirdly, I had to become an expert in tin foil"
00:47:21,00:47:22,and mylar.
00:47:22,00:47:23,"You don't have to say tin foil,"
00:47:23,00:47:24,just as a sock to tell you.
00:47:24,00:47:25,I don't know how we get it.
00:47:25,00:47:27,But we have a pet foil cover
00:47:27,00:47:29,and we don't know because we want the book to be recyclable.
00:47:29,00:47:31,So we've got rid of that
00:47:31,00:47:34,because the sheets themselves can't be recycled
00:47:34,00:47:34,because it's plastic.
00:47:34,00:47:35,This is huge.
00:47:35,00:47:36,This is amazing.
00:47:36,00:47:39,So I think we need to reactivate this as a record
00:47:39,00:47:41,because it's obviously a thing
00:47:41,00:47:42,in our job at Guinness World Records
00:47:42,00:47:43,is to reflect what's happening.
00:47:43,00:47:46,So if people are storing these balloons
00:47:46,00:47:47,which they do seem to be...
00:47:47,00:47:52,Why do you keep balloons down if you keep everything?
00:47:52,00:47:54,Like toenail clippings and...
00:47:54,00:47:54,I do.
00:47:54,00:47:55,"Yeah, yeah, I keep a lot of random things."
00:47:55,00:47:57,"Oh, you've been to Den's house, I see."
00:47:57,00:47:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:57,00:47:59,But not balloons.
00:47:59,00:48:02,"But yeah, I do have a cabinet of super old things"
00:48:02,00:48:02,that I keep.
00:48:02,00:48:04,I'll go through and see.
00:48:05,00:48:06,Super old things.
00:48:06,00:48:07,Well...
00:48:07,00:48:08,Like toenail clippings.
00:48:08,00:48:11,"No, it's mainly like the toys that I had as a child"
00:48:11,00:48:12,and stuff like that.
00:48:12,00:48:13,But I'm doing it for my kids.
00:48:13,00:48:14,I'm keeping stuff.
00:48:14,00:48:16,"Like, I've got the pillow that my wife was sleeping on."
00:48:16,00:48:17,Oldest excuse.
00:48:17,00:48:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:18,00:48:19,When we keep her...
00:48:19,00:48:21,It'll be the oldest pillow in the world.
00:48:21,00:48:22,"No, it's..."
00:48:22,00:48:24,"No, nothing special like that."
00:48:24,00:48:25,Like a balloon.
00:48:25,00:48:29,You think your kids are going to appreciate
00:48:29,00:48:31,receiving the pillow that your wife was on
00:48:31,00:48:32,when she gave birth?
00:48:32,00:48:33,North conceived on some of them.
00:48:33,00:48:35,"I've got my, you know, the blue scrubs."
00:48:35,00:48:38,"I've kept that that my second son, I was wearing"
00:48:38,00:48:41,when he was born to give it to him for a Halloween
00:48:41,00:48:42,in when he turns 18.
00:48:42,00:48:44,Just get them a proper 18th birthday present.
00:48:44,00:48:48,"If you save this stuff up, it's worth way more, isn't it?"
00:48:48,00:48:48,"Oh, my God."
00:48:48,00:48:49,How can you live in London?
00:48:49,00:48:51,You must have a very big property.
00:48:51,00:48:51,I don't understand.
00:48:51,00:48:54,How can you farm this?
00:48:54,00:48:57,"Okay, so you're going to..."
00:48:57,00:49:01,"I mean, it sounds like unless these are legit"
00:49:01,00:49:04,"that unfortunately for 29-year-old Ryan,"
00:49:04,00:49:05,he's not got the record.
00:49:05,00:49:06,It's very exciting.
00:49:06,00:49:07,I think this might be a record for the first time
00:49:07,00:49:09,we've ever had a fact
00:49:09,00:49:10,pretty much comprehensively debunked
00:49:10,00:49:12,while we're recording it.
00:49:12,00:49:14,We normally wait until the recording session's over
00:49:14,00:49:15,before discovering it's wrong.
00:49:15,00:49:17,"Also, these people must be so excited"
00:49:17,00:49:18,because did you say you were looking this up
00:49:18,00:49:20,at two o'clock in the morning
00:49:20,00:49:22,"and they've replied already, presumably?"
00:49:22,00:49:23,"Yeah, that's the..."
00:49:23,00:49:24,They've been waiting.
00:49:24,00:49:25,"Well, because I think if you have gainers of records"
00:49:25,00:49:28,"on your email address, people tend to get quite excited."
00:49:28,00:49:29,"And also, the people who've written in"
00:49:29,00:49:31,and then we've rejected
00:49:31,00:49:32,"and then I've written back saying,"
00:49:32,00:49:33,"""Actually, this might be a record."""
00:49:33,00:49:36,"So they're very, very excited about it."
00:49:36,00:49:37,Wow.
00:49:37,00:49:38,I'm sending pictures of these bloons
00:49:38,00:49:40,and the story and...
00:49:40,00:49:43,"That's amazing that even though it was rejected,"
00:49:43,00:49:45,she's held on to it going one day.
00:49:45,00:49:46,"One day, they'll understand."
00:49:46,00:49:47,"Damn you, Guinness."
00:49:47,00:49:48,"Well, I'm going to keep it anyway."
00:49:48,00:49:49,Yeah.
00:49:49,00:49:51,"Did the reply go, ""Well, well, well."""
00:49:51,00:49:52,Yes.
00:49:52,00:49:55,Look who's back.
00:49:55,00:49:57,He comes floating back to my balloon.
00:49:57,00:50:00,"Oh, my God."
00:50:00,00:50:03,So how do people beat it if we tried to set a record?
00:50:03,00:50:04,So if we hold a record...
00:50:04,00:50:05,To stop to do better than you.
00:50:05,00:50:06,But do they record a video?
00:50:06,00:50:08,Or do you have to be present?
00:50:08,00:50:08,Yes.
00:50:08,00:50:12,So we get about a thousand applications through
00:50:12,00:50:13,so we can't go to everything.
00:50:13,00:50:13,Yeah.
00:50:13,00:50:16,"So we do have some guidelines for filming it,"
00:50:16,00:50:17,getting an independent witness.
00:50:17,00:50:20,You have to get photographs
00:50:20,00:50:22,and all the stuff of the space you're doing it in.
00:50:22,00:50:24,Send all that to us with the video.
00:50:24,00:50:26,And one take video as well.
00:50:26,00:50:27,Yeah.
00:50:27,00:50:29,Because we don't want any cuts.
00:50:30,00:50:34,"Or even two videos if you can't fit one into the frame, you know."
00:50:34,00:50:36,"And then, yeah, send it in."
00:50:36,00:50:37,So go to GuinnessWallRecords.com
00:50:37,00:50:39,and register your application.
00:50:39,00:50:40,We send you the rules
00:50:40,00:50:42,because every record has a set of rules that you must follow.
00:50:42,00:50:45,"If you do that, then you can attempt."
00:50:45,00:50:46,"Oh, my words."
00:50:46,00:50:47,"If you set the record,"
00:50:47,00:50:50,then the next person who applies gets given your figure to beat.
00:50:50,00:50:51,Yes.
00:50:51,00:50:53,So they'll know that they have to do better than you.
00:50:53,00:50:55,And what qualifies as an independent observer?
00:50:55,00:50:57,Does that just mean you can't be holding a gun to their head at the time?
00:50:57,00:50:58,"Like, not your mum."
00:50:58,00:51:00,Not your mum.
00:51:00,00:51:01,We've had that before.
00:51:01,00:51:03,We actually got reported to the Queen
00:51:03,00:51:06,"because someone, I can't say who it is,"
00:51:06,00:51:07,"but someone who was very famous,"
00:51:07,00:51:08,there was a famous organist.
00:51:08,00:51:10,I'll leave it at that.
00:51:10,00:51:11,And that narrows the few.
00:51:11,00:51:13,"Yeah, there are not that many."
00:51:13,00:51:15,"Anyway, he did have, I think,"
00:51:15,00:51:19,his mum as a witness to the longest organ marathon
00:51:19,00:51:23,in like 25 hours of playing the organ.
00:51:23,00:51:24,"But we then rejected it saying,"
00:51:24,00:51:26,"""Well, you can't have your mum say you did it because that's nothing."""
00:51:26,00:51:28,"So he wrote to the Queen and said,"
00:51:28,00:51:30,"""This is disgusting because he wasn't British."
00:51:30,00:51:31,"Now sit down again."""
00:51:31,00:51:33,"Wrote to the Queen to say,"
00:51:33,00:51:34,"""This is outrageous."
00:51:34,00:51:38,"One of your subjects has refused me my recognition."""
00:51:38,00:51:40,So the Queen has to react to things.
00:51:40,00:51:42,"If you send her a letter, she has to do something about it."
00:51:42,00:51:43,She never reacts to any of mine.
00:51:43,00:51:46,"So then she sent it to the Department of Training Industry,"
00:51:46,00:51:48,"who then got in touch to say,"
00:51:48,00:51:49,"""What happened with the organ?"""
00:51:49,00:51:50,"It's like, ""Why, what?"""
00:51:50,00:51:53,"Oh, my God."
00:51:53,00:51:55,And they understood in the end that there were guidelines
00:51:55,00:51:57,and they didn't follow the guidelines.
00:51:57,00:51:59,So that is amazing.
00:51:59,00:52:00,That's probably extraordinary.
00:52:00,00:52:03,"Okay, a foreign organist."
00:52:03,00:52:04,I can't believe they crossed the Queen on me.
00:52:04,00:52:08,Who's apparently mega famous in the organ world.
00:52:08,00:52:09,In the organ world.
00:52:09,00:52:11,"Longest organ played means very different thing,"
00:52:11,00:52:13,"obviously, in other record-breaking records."
00:52:13,00:52:15,You wouldn't get your mum to witness that.
00:52:15,00:52:16,Not again.
00:52:16,00:52:24,"Weirdly, the Queen has several records."
00:52:24,00:52:25,I've been looking her up on Guinness World Records.
00:52:25,00:52:26,Does she?
00:52:26,00:52:27,She's got a lot of free time.
00:52:27,00:52:28,She's got loads.
00:52:28,00:52:29,"She has, yeah."
00:52:29,00:52:30,But they're all...
00:52:30,00:52:31,Boris King's to the head.
00:52:31,00:52:33,"Yeah, I'm in there every time now."
00:52:33,00:52:35,"They're all really, like, oldest current monarch,"
00:52:35,00:52:36,longest reigning Queen.
00:52:36,00:52:38,"Charles, it has to be your own head."
00:52:38,00:52:44,"Yeah, she came to the office once, actually."
00:52:44,00:52:45,Wow.
00:52:45,00:52:47,"She was, I imagine, during Organ Gate."
00:52:47,00:52:49,Sought it out herself.
00:52:49,00:52:53,"Yeah, no, she came because we won some awards."
00:52:53,00:52:54,Did you let her in because you were staying off
00:52:54,00:52:56,and you don't have to do any of that stuff in the office?
00:52:56,00:52:58,"No, we did the full ""paint the office."""
00:52:58,00:53:01,I'd love it if the Queen's sitting in reception
00:53:01,00:53:02,next to Lucky Diamond Rich.
00:53:02,00:53:07,He had Peter Douderswell turned up to the office one day.
00:53:07,00:53:09,Peter Douderswell is quite famous in that world.
00:53:09,00:53:10,They've glutton.
00:53:10,00:53:12,"He has, like, fastest three-course meal."
00:53:12,00:53:17,And he has this thing where he swallows hot dogs whole.
00:53:17,00:53:20,And that is one of the rules.
00:53:20,00:53:20,He can't bite them.
00:53:20,00:53:23,"So he is from Essex, I think."
00:53:23,00:53:29,"And he, weirdly, opened a can, a can of hot dogs at his home,"
00:53:29,00:53:31,and then took it on the train into London.
00:53:31,00:53:34,"Opened still, and full of brine."
00:53:34,00:53:38,"And turned up at the office and said, ""I'm Peter Douderswell."""
00:53:38,00:53:40,And I knew who he was because it was just one of the names
00:53:40,00:53:42,that I just had dealt with over the years.
00:53:42,00:53:43,"I said, ""Oh, yeah, Peter, hello."""
00:53:43,00:53:46,"I said, ""I want to eat these sausages."""
00:53:46,00:53:48,"It's like, ""Well, okay."""
00:53:48,00:53:49,I can't stop you.
00:53:50,00:53:52,Have you met the Queen?
00:53:52,00:53:56,"Well, that's why we stop people coming to the office now,"
00:53:56,00:54:00,"because he ate eight of these sausages, back-to-back."
00:54:00,00:54:02,So you put it in your mouth and you push one down with the other.
00:54:02,00:54:04,So you have this chain.
00:54:04,00:54:06,What a nightmare. How do you stop?
00:54:06,00:54:07,"Right, yes."
00:54:07,00:54:09,"No, you can't get any more in, literally,"
00:54:09,00:54:11,"because it's like, you know, it's gone as far as it can go."
00:54:11,00:54:12,"Oh, wow."
00:54:12,00:54:15,"So do you need a ninth sausage to push in the eighth one,"
00:54:15,00:54:16,and then you withdraw?
00:54:16,00:54:17,You retract your knife.
00:54:17,00:54:19,"Oh, you can get your fingers in there."
00:54:19,00:54:19,"Okay, sorry, of course."
00:54:19,00:54:20,Yeah.
00:54:20,00:54:22,"Anyway, he did it. He got the record great."
00:54:22,00:54:24,"And then he said, ""I can also drink milk hanging upside down."""
00:54:24,00:54:27,"And it's like, I don't know how..."
00:54:27,00:54:28,"We haven't got a frame or anything,"
00:54:28,00:54:30,but we had two very tall boys in the office.
00:54:30,00:54:33,"So we got the two boys to hold him by his ankles,"
00:54:33,00:54:35,"upside down in the reception area,"
00:54:35,00:54:37,and he drank two pints of milk.
00:54:37,00:54:38,"But what you have to do with this record,"
00:54:38,00:54:40,you have to get up very quickly.
00:54:40,00:54:43,"Otherwise, the milk and gravity, you know?"
00:54:43,00:54:46,"And he was trying to communicate this after the fact,"
00:54:46,00:54:51,when he had a gullet full of milk and nine sausages.
00:54:51,00:54:53,And he couldn't get it out.
00:54:53,00:54:56,"So he ended up vomiting all the sausages and all the milk,"
00:54:56,00:55:00,all over our office reception area.
00:55:00,00:55:02,Do you then have to take the record away from him?
00:55:02,00:55:03,He didn't get the milk one then.
00:55:03,00:55:05,"He got the sausages, that's okay."
00:55:05,00:55:07,"They stayed in long enough, but yeah."
00:55:07,00:55:09,"So the office manager's like, ""That is it."""
00:55:09,00:55:12,We're not having any more people come to the office.
00:55:12,00:55:13,Your whole office manager.
00:55:13,00:55:15,"Oh, my God."
00:55:15,00:55:17,"The scene's outside your office, Matthew and mate."
00:55:17,00:55:19,People pogoing up on their noses.
00:55:19,00:55:23,How many cleaners have quit after one day?
00:55:23,00:55:25,That's the main image I'm going to be left with
00:55:25,00:55:26,"after this week's podcast, though,"
00:55:26,00:55:30,is the guy on the train with the open tin of sausages.
00:55:30,00:55:31,Why did he open the tin?
00:55:31,00:55:32,He probably had one tin left.
00:55:32,00:55:34,"He opened it and he thought, ""Oh, no."""
00:55:34,00:55:35,"Or his wife was saying,"
00:55:35,00:55:37,"""I need the tin opener here for dinner."""
00:55:37,00:55:38,So you're not taking that with you.
00:55:44,00:55:45,"Okay, that's it."
00:55:45,00:55:46,That is all of our facts.
