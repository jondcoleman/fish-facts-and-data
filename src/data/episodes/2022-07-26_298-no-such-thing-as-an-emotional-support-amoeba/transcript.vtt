 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from New York City!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Aniches Incki, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that when race horses travel by airplane, they're allowed to bring an emotional support goat for no extra cost.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 So this is absolutely true, it was an article I read in USA Today about a company called HE Text Sutton.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 They are the only company in America that has a specific aircraft that it uses to fly horses. That plane is known as Air Horse One.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Nice.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Amazing. So I read the pet goats keep them calm when they're flying because they are friends.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 They're mates.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 But they're free, they're basically hand luggage, but also there are human grooms who are accompanying the horses, and you don't have to pay for them either.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So they're also hand luggage.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 The humans are basically the carry-on luggage of the horses.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 And who goes up in the overhead compartment and who goes under the seat of those two? Go in the overhead?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Go in the overhead.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 It's not always going socially, is it?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 It's anything that makes the horses feel chilled.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 So chickens quite often come with them. Basically they try to recreate the atmosphere of their stable exactly because these race horses are very precious.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 And if they make them feel comfortable, they do that, and they have constant grooms, don't they? Is that like the proper race horses, the big guns?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 We'll have sort of 12, 15 grooms constantly struggling with ensuring them.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 You're not a very good flyer, are you?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 No, yeah.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Would you like it to have like 15 men just stroking you to have their journey?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Well, they can only help, right?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 They do get separated by according to how much they pay.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 So if you don't pay very much, there are three of you in a stall, and that's basically the economy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And then if you're in first class, you've got a whole stall to yourself, and they're separated by sex.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Are they?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Yes, the fillies, the lady horses are loaded at the back, so the cults, which further up, don't smell them and get excited.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Wow.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Because the wind is going this way.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Why is the wind going that way?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Well, you're flying, I imagine.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 I'm pretty sure you have fun the men play.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 You've misunderstood how aeroplane is.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 The air is rushing past this way.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 They don't wind the windows down.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 I think Andy flies in convertible planes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 So there's no mile high club in the horse world.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Nothing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 No, imagine it would be mayhem.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 There must have been at some point.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 No, no, there's no.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Come on.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 They don't have free time.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 It's not like the seatbelt sign goes off, and the horses can wander around the plane.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 All right.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 I bet sometimes one of the backs, like, oh, this toilet's taken.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Do you mind if I just pop up front and use the girls?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Maybe not.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 This air horse one is not just horses that go in it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 One time, someone took the miniature cow in the aeroplane.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And apparently, once, they took five dolphins.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 No.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 But I have no idea how that works.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 How does that work?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 They just have an emotional support crab with them, and then they're fine.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Did you say you did know?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Yes, because they did this in other times.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 So in 1965, they flew with dolphins for the first time.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And this was from the US to the Netherlands.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 I'm not entirely sure why, maybe they were going on holiday.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 But they had hammocks for them.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 So you can see pictures of these dolphins in these hammocks with little holes for their fins.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And they had each dolphin had a groom next to them covering them with water at all times.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So they had to be constantly flanneling them down.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Wow.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 I read about this dolphins, the dolphins going on air horse one.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And the operations manager was interviewed about the trip.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And he said, everyone involved with those dolphins was very harsh.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 They had a police escort, and no one would say anything or answer questions.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Which made you think they were probably military dolphins.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 OK.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 You know, they get the pilots treat these animals better than they treat us.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 When they're flying, they fly more carefully for the animals.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So the horses, the horses are really expensive, much more expensive than human.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And so they really don't want them.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 These race horses to be damaged by falling over or whatever.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So the pilots do extremely wide turns in the air and very, very gentle ascent and descents.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 To the extent that the aircraft can actually detour for more than 500 miles in order to just not disturb the horses.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 No.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Because they do a massive loop instead of going just going and then turning straight left.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 You've hidden a plane that's turned straight left.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 You really fly economy.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 What do you mean fly economy?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Is that like the economy people go one direction, the business class go another direction?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 We've already established that Andy thinks there's a gust of wind blow.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 So emotional support?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Yeah, animals or planes.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 This is obviously a big huge thing.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And I mean, the stories keep cropping up and they keep on being funny,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 because animals or planes just doesn't work.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 So I don't know if you guys saw this.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 There was a British flight from Walters, from Gatwick to Austin.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 This was last month.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 And it was delayed by an hour and a half because two emotional support bulldogs,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 which were wearing tutus and were there to help their owners get through the flight,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 they themselves became too distressed to be on the plane.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Oh, really?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Yeah, the dogs needed emotional support.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And did they get it?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 No, of course they did.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Well, it does make sense because animals with anxious humans become more anxious,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 don't they?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 That's been proven, I think.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 So really, if you do have an emotional support animal, they should have one.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And they should go smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Yeah, that's right.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Emotional support?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Amoeba?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 I don't know.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 One of the first ones that kind of became big online and was a bit of a meme

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 was someone called Call of Fitzgerald.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And she had a duck and she was getting on the plane and someone took a photo

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 and put it online.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I do remember that, but what I didn't remember is that the duck's name was Daniel Turduckon,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Stinkerbot.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Not the first ever emotional support animal.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Turduckon.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Turduckon.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 That's the thing where you put a...

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Is the duck chick side a turkey?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And then a chicken inside the duck?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Sure.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 I think so.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 I think it's it.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 All I'm saying is that if I was a duck and my middle name was Turduckon,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 I would be concerned about what the future held for me.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And that's why, but maybe that's the incentive to be emotionally supportive to your owner,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 otherwise it's a sort of a warning about where you might end up.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 This is my pet duck, Donald Hoysin Murray.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 It's crazy this.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So that was 2013.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 I think that story happened.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 2011.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 So there's a national service for animal registry.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 And they're the ones who will sort of issue a vest that the animal will have to wear

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 and they give the certificate as well.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 2011.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 So there's 2,400 animals that were issued with that.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Now we've got over 200,000.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 So it's exploded into...

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 But I've never seen a duck on a plane.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 No, me neither.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 All the assholes you read imply that they're creating havoc on all of our flights.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Has anyone ever seen an emotional sport animal or a flight?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Wow.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 They're all here.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 That's what we've lived.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Okay.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 That's not then.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 They are controversial, though, because they have exponentially increased, as you say.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And there is almost no evidence to back up the idea that if you have a genuine mental illness

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 that having an emotional sport animal on the flight can make you feel better.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 As in, there hasn't been a study's done.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 But obviously for individuals, it does seem to work.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 But there is this industry cropping up to make money.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 So you can get these certificates really easily off Amazon.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 You just click a button and you get a certificate saying this is an emotionally-support-certified frog or whatever.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 And it's actually really weird researching this, because I was reading all these articles about how it's being so fraudulent and used and how known we should do it.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 But because, you know, the Google algorithms are sort of idiots sometimes.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 In the middle of these articles, I kept getting advertised.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Do you want an emotional support certificate for your dolphin and three easy steps?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Can I just say we went to Google the other day and I think some of our friends from Google might be in here.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 So I just like say they're not idiots, are they?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 They're very smart, guys.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 They're very vocal.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 You know one of the first, in my opinion, emotional support animals.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Oh, wow, this is going on.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 From the early 20th century.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 So in the first decade of flight, a lot of people would fly with an animal called a spotted cockpit terrier.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And this was a special breed of dog that didn't really get upset if you put him in an aircraft.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 And also it gave off a lot of heat, and so it would keep you warm in your cockpit.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 So for instance, your kind of planes were the wind is coming.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 And you're getting cold, you have this little dog and it keeps you warm.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Sorry, is this real?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 This is real.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Wow.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 There's loads of photos of them.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 If you go on Smithsonian, you'll see loads of pictures of these early pioneers of flight with a little dog next to them.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 That's not emotional support, any more than really wearing a jacket is emotional support, is it?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 I was looking into the history of flying horses.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 So it's just like from Pegasus.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Let me rephrase that.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 I was looking into the history of horses that have been made to fly.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 And surprisingly, it goes back to the 17th century, actually more the 18th century.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 I found this, and I can't believe this is true, but I've seen numerous drawings of it.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 They used to do hot air ballooning with horses back in France.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And there's an image.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 And so initially, it's not like the horses even in the basket.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 They attached the strings around the horse.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 And it was a person called Emma Putivan, who used to ride the horse up into the air as it was attached to the balloon.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Yes, so the horse was the basket.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 And he just used to go up and just wave and then land and trot off into the distance.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Which is crazy. And then there was this other guy, Pierre Tetsu Brissy, who had a basket, but he had a horse in it.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And he did over 50 flights with his horse.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 He is amazing that guy, but he did a lot of experiments in the early days of ballooning.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 And one of the things that he did is people didn't really know what happened with electrical storms and thunder and lightning and stuff like that.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 And so he went up into clouds where there was thunder and lightning with a metal rod to see if he could get the lightning to strike him.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Wow, presumably it didn't.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 If it did, it only happened once.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 So this is not an animal, but I was looking into what are things that aren't allowed on planes.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 If we're allowed all these animals on, what can you get on?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 And there's a lady called Jan Bevan a few years ago.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 So she's in Switzerland and she was going to Baltimore to do a concerto and she plays the cello.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 The cello was too big for, she was worried about it being checked and blown.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 So she bought the cello a seat on the plane, which is actually done quite a lot.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 So she signed it in as Chuck cello, she gave it a name.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 And she got to the airport and they didn't let her fly to America because the cello did not have a visa to get in.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It's got a seat, so it has to be a thing and it hasn't got a visa.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 So she got kicked off the flight. She never made it to her concert.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I think it's really dangerous to call your cello Chuck cello when airport staff are handling it.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 That sounds too much like an instruction.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 It is type of fact number two and that is Chazinski.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 My fact this week is that the French can't decide how to say the word "pencil" in their own language.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 So I couldn't believe this. A lot of us learn French when we're growing up and I guess we're just taught to say "clean".

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 But there's an article about how basically France is split up into regions, depending on their word for "pencil".

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And I counted seven different words for it. It is insane.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And if you talk to people from the individual regions, they think the guy next door is an idiot who says it a different way.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 So and I actually, I call my French friend and said okay, what do you think of this article? What do you say?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 And so he said he would call it crayon à papier, as in a crayon for paper, or "a crayon à mine".

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 And it seems to me crayon of the mine, which is very weird.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 But then he said, but also apparently you can call it crayon de papier.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Now my friend, who's from Provence, said if someone asked me for "a crayon de papier", I would very politely give him a pencil.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And I would ask him to go and draw some stick figures, you functional illiterate, because that means a pencil made of paper.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And apparently not to these guys, he speculated that it was on the east side of France, he speculated maybe it was something that came over with the Nazis.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 That feels like a stretch, doesn't it?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 They did a lot of bad stuff.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 That feels like a longer term destabilisation project, doesn't it?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 So what did cause the second French Revolution? Well, wow.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 It is weird, so I mean they are, that crayon glee is another one, grey crayon, which my friend said and maybe I heard that, if I read a book from the 50s, I might have read it like that.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Crayon de bois, a pencil made of wood, maybe to distinguish from those little plastic ones that have the lead come up through the middle.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And yes, seven different words for pencil, don't know how to say it, don't know how they've got anywhere in life.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Jessica, they probably just use pens. Good point.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 They're always having furious rails about their language though, the French.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 And they have this body, the Academy of Francees, which is very ancient, it was founded nearly 400 years ago, and its job is just a rule on French language disputes.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Especially if an English word makes us wear into the language, they have to come up with a French equivalent for it.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 So they're generally very elderly, once you're drawing your info life, in 2010 they made a big decision.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 They voted that new entrance must be under 75 years old, because too many were over that.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And they didn't make it retroactive because they would have had to kick out almost everybody in the Academy.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 And they're called immortals, aren't they? Which I don't know if that can't be true.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 They're not, they frequently die.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 They have a special uniform, they have an official uniform, which is known as Labivare, which I think translates as green clothing, because there is green.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 But then there also means worm, it also means towards, and it also means glass.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So if in French you want to say the green worm goes towards the green glass, it's translated as laverver, laver, laver, laver.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 No, cool.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 That's amazing.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 So do they, do they at home have the abivare, which is the green clothing?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 And the next one have a worm costume.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Oh no, I've turned up in the abivare when I went to turn up in my abivare.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 I'm sure that has happened on numerous occasions.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 It's too far-fetched. I regretted conjuring up the image as I said it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 They are also almost exclusively men. There have only ever been nine female immortals.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Although there have already been 730 in the last 400 years in total.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 But that is still a low percentage.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Can we just establish that as definitely a low percentage?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Also, there's a thing I've been trying to actually find out if this is true. So I wonder if you guys have heard.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 So when someone passes away, that's when they have to refill a seat, right?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 But each seat has a different number assigned to it.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 And so you feel a pre-discessive seat. And as part of filling it, you need to make a speech about how great they are.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And there's currently a bunch of empty seats because no one is willing to say nice things about the person who was their predecessor.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 Wow. And I looked into the list. There's about 6 empty seats.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And there's no reason for it because it's an elite. They say this is the greatest elite, a secret club that you could be a part of in France.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 You're commanding the language. Some of the greatest riders in the history of France have been a part of it.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 And there's 6 empty seats because the last six were dicks.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 A lot of the great writers didn't get to be part of it, right?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 So Bolesack tried to get in, Zola tried to get in, and none of them could.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Wow.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 They do sound like a kind of a bunch of ourselves, don't they?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 I don't know. If you go on their website, their slogan is 'deer, nopadier', as in say, and don't say.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And it was basically created to stop the English invasion of the French language.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 And they've done quite well. It was 1635 by Louis XIII Chief Minister.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 And yeah, because they didn't like the idea that English might start encroaching on their territory.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 But it does mean they have these weird words, so they have a word for 'apodcast' in fact.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Let's do that.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Which so most countries would sort of go with 'podcast' for the French.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Well, yes, French. 'podcast' would be German.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Yes.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 'podcast' Russian.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Italian.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 'podcast' though.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Yeah.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Let's try Nigerian.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Oh, I don't think we should.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 We've reached my limit.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Thank you.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Let's move on quickly.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 So their word for 'podcast' is 'diffuzant pour baladir', which is a broadcast for Walkman.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Wow!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 And this is where the academy members age, I think, really starts to shoot.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 But the French language has just the size of the whole lexicon.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 It's smaller than the English language.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 So this causes problems for translations, for example.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 So the Harry Potter books are long.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 They're even longer in French.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So Voldemort, he who must not be named, is saluit don't on 'dua papanosse le nom'.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And they have a really fun time translating those books.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 So 'huffle puff' is 'puff suflin'.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Nice.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 So good.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 And some of them, they're really literal.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 So 'neville long bottom' is 'neville long du pat' or 'neville long in the bottom'.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 But the Hogwarts, the school, is 'poudlard', which means 'pig lice'.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So 'hog warts' has become 'pig lice'.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Ah, nice.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Yeah.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 So they've taken two words for 'pig' and put them together.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 And then two words for an 'STD' and put them together.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Very cool.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Yeah, no, you're right.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 So there is a letter in French, which is a letter 'u' and then it's got like a grab accent.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 So it's going down, down from the top left to the bottom right.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 And that letter is only in one word in the entire language.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Wow.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 And that is the word 'u', which means 'where'.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And the only reason it's there is because there's another word 'u', which means 'or'.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 But they've pronounced exactly the same.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 But they put this extra letter in, so you know which one you're talking about.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 So it's only in a single word and yet, on a French keyboard, it still has its own key.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 That's a awesome name.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 That's amazing.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 And you know that key.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 It feels so cocky because it is not nearly as rubbed off as any of the others.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Did you know the French didn't have a word for French kissing until 2013?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Did they?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 No, they didn't.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Did they not?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 No.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 But what did they say when they were like, 'Oh, let's do the, let's do the, put my belly of face thing'.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Well, they don't, like fish don't need a word for water, you know?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 Like...

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 I believe that what I've found is that they had phrases like kissing at length in the mouth.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Right.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Which is so sexy.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 But they've changed it to galache, which is a word that also means an ice skating boot.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 So the idea is that you're kind of sliding around.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Don't shoot the messenger.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 The word to kiss is actually another disaster for the French.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 They have seven different ways of saying to kiss as in just a peck on the cheek, depending on where you're from.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 So like fair libies, base, bige, and then there's one which is basic, which I think in Belgium means kiss.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 And comes from the origin kiss and in like the 30s you would use it to mean kiss.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 But now, it means very explicitly to have sex with.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 But if, like, that word starts with an F.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 And...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 But if you come from Belgium and you just say that, like give me a kiss, then come on.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Books and motel room for now.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Do you know you're allowed to say the word fuck in Canada on the radio in Canada?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 We've got some Canadian fuckers in tonight.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 In Canada, you're allowed to say the word fuck on the radio as long as you're on a French language station.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And the reason is because they think the French speakers don't have the same connotation of the word as English speakers.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Ah, that interesting.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Just coincidentally, with that word, I was looking into in China.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 They have a lot of censorship, obviously, from the government about what words they can use, particularly online.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 And one of the things that you can't say are swear words.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And so, they've managed to get by that by using fuck, the English word, but using Chinese words to sort of use that to appropriate it.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So, what they'll say on Chinese, on the Chinese website, is "fuck you".

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 So, wait.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So, "fuck you".

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Yeah, yeah, we got that. Thanks, mate.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 Yeah, "fuck you too".

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 That's not Chinese word, too.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Great, thank you.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Yeah.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 What does that mean?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Oh, it literally translates as French Croatian squid, which is a mythical creature in China, a squid that was simultaneously found in both France and Croatia.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 And they thought we'll call it "fuck you", because hence that, so yeah, that's how they get by.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 That's what it really is.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 What are you talking about, this mythical creature?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 It's the French Croatian squid.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Do you want to hear some French phrases and just see if you can get what they mean?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Okay.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 So, I've got, I'm pet the Traver.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 You're farting sideways.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 You're farting sideways.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 It means that you're not doing anything right.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 You're doing something really simple that normal people will be able to do, not doing it sideways.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 That's much better. It just means you're grumpy.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Oh.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Okay.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 All right, all right, all right.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 "Peace it, dolls on violon. This is like pissing in a violin."

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 This is like pissing in a violin.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Is it something to do with bringing musical instruments onto a plane?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Yes.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 You need a lot to fill up a cello.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 It's like, this is fun, but I feel like the strings are attached.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 I've got my penis out and I feel like I need a fiddle.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Yeah.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 These are all much better than the real ones.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 End this.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 End this.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 It just means something's useless, just useless.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 There's no point to this.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 This is like pissing in a violin.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Well, if you need the toilet.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 I think it's because it's got holes in it, no?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 No, no, no.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 No.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Anna's right, if you, in extremists, and you've got a lot of violins, spare.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 You only need one.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 I'm supposed to be fully bladderist, but two maps I would have thought.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 This is why they had a revolution.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Louis XIV kept wasting priceless trance of areas.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 The French do really protect their language.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 This academy really shows that.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 There's a rule that I think they're going a bit lax on now in France and sort of talking about it.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 But on radio, 40% of all music needs to be French.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Yes.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 That's the thing.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 But this other thing that I discovered is that at the Olympics, there is someone who is hired specifically from the French side to go around all the events of the Olympics to make sure there's enough French going on in them.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Okay.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 What do you think?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 What do you think that are?

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 They go to the javelin and then they make sure what persons are going to begat.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 It's all to do with language.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 The language needs to be the commentary needs to do if there's a sign to the toilet and needs to say...

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Well, it's a doll's veal of.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 And the person whose job it is for every Olympics to do that is called the Great Witness.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 And the Great Witness goes around going, "Not enough French, not enough French because it's the official language."

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 English and French are the official Olympic languages.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 I've never heard Olympic commentary and heard them shout out French words.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 I've put down, you know, you don't hear it.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 It's all in English.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 I mean, being a prostitute is not an event in the Olympics.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 So, French didn't get the way on that one.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Should we move on to our next slide?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 We should.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Okay, it is time.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 It is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 My effect is that there is a gravity measuring device in Maryland so sensitive that it can tell whether or not the scientists working on it have had lunch.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 I can already tell if I've had lunch.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Don't even need this thing.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 No, you're right.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Well, that's several million dollars.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 They have really chucked away.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 This is an amazing thing.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 So, this is NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 And they have built a machine that...

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Goddard, I can't tell if the place is the punch line or my pronunciation of it is the punch line.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Say it again and let's see when they laugh.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Guys, fuck her, you.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 I don't ask you to pronounce Lefster and Chumley and all these weird English words.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Right.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 So, in Maryland, there is a machine that says...

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 It's just written there.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 It's just Maryland.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Mary... right.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Great.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Can we just... can we plow on?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Can we... you know...

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Can we have one, no?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 I can't read anything out anymore.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 I'm too nervous.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Look.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 It doesn't matter where it is.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 The location is not important of the machine.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 It's in America.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 So, it uses quantum mechanics. There are 100 billion cesium atoms in a column and it times how quickly these individual atoms fall from the top of the bottom.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Wow.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 And it... basically, it weighs nearby material.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And the scientists noticed that we're getting different readings when they came back after lunch to this machine.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Then when they did it before... then when they were working on it before.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 So, it's sort of the most expensive fat-shaving device in history.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Yeah. So, it's an incredible thing.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 So, the reason it is useful is not just because it can tell you if you've had lunch.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 But, they want to put it in space.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 There are already a couple of amazing gravity sensing satellites in space.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 But this one is 10 times better than the existing ones.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 And what it means is that you can point it at individual places and you can measure the size of a glacier.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 And you can say that glacier is shrunk by that much because the gravity has altered around it.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Or you can observe changes in aquifer levels, even underground.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Like, it's insane stuff.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Yeah, incredible.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Because glaciers are changing the way of the world, aren't they?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Constantly melting glaciers.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 So, England and Scotland or England and Wales versus Scotland are on a seasaw right now with each other

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 because of glacial melting.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 So, basically, this weird thing happens where as glaciers melt, which is happening a bit more due to supposed climate change.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 You've got to place your audience.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Yeah, plate to the coast.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 I don't mean that.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 But basically, Scotland, which is much colder, used to have a huge weight of glacial ice,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 which has been melting over tens of thousands of years.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 And so, as it melts, the water dissipates and Scotland's losing weight,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 whereas comparatively England, getting a bit fatter comparatively.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 And so, England is sort of sinking. So, it's like a very gradual seasaw, a very boring seasaw,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 where, if you're at the Scotland end, you're on your way up.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 At the England end, you're on your way down.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Oh, well.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 And at some point, I think we should just jump off the seasaw and give Scotland a broken coxix.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 So, I'm saying.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Oh, look difficult child, you must have been.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 On these kind of measuring devices that are really, really sensitive,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 there are seismograph stations at Yellowstone that can measure the flushing of toilets at the old faithful inn.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 That's amazing.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 They're trying to get the geasers, and they see something on the scale,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 and it's actually someone flushing the toilet.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 That's insane, yeah.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 I would feel like my privacy had been violated if I used the toilets at the old...

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 At the old faithful inn.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Old faithful inn.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Yeah.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 And I knew that a scientist was watching that and judging.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 You're not watching.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 I've never misunderstood.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 I've barely read you through to this scientist mate outside the old faithful

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 to point at the guy leaving the loo and be like, "We know what you've done."

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 I was just looking at weighing things.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 And so, do you guys know the first person to weigh the world?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Ooh.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Oh, no.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Oh, sorry, yeah, take a guess.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Is it someone ancient Greek or...?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 No, no, it wasn't actually.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Newton told us how we could weigh the world.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 He didn't bother doing it.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 And a hundred years later, Henry Cavendish, scientist Henry Cavendish,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 decided to try and weigh the world.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And the way you can do it, basically, he did it by...

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 So he knew that objects with larger mass will attract objects with smaller mass.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 And even if you're on Earth, if you've got a big lead ball,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 and you suspend a little lead ball next to it,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 it will very, very slightly be attracted to it.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 And basically, because of the gravity equation that Newton worked out,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 if you can measure exactly how much that little lead ball moves towards the big one,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 you can work out the mass of the Earth.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So he weighed...

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 The Earth, it was pretty amazing.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 He came within just by balancing two lead balls together.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 He came within one percent of what we know the Earth weighs today.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Wow.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 But he was a real widow.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 So he...

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 He was terrified of women, Henry Cavendish.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 He'd never addressed strangers directly, because he was cripplingly shy.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 So he had a house in servants, but he had a private staircase built in the back of himself.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 It was a hat or not of himself.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 No wonder he didn't like strangers if they climbing up the back of him all the time.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 He had a private staircase built in the back of his house for himself,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 because he was so terrified of meeting servants on the stairs.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 And he actually, he was a really smart guy, and he went to Cambridge.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 And his final oral exams he had to take to pass his degree as natural philosophy degree,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 he just dropped out altogether, because he was so terrified of talking in public in this oral exam,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 didn't get his degree.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 He was insanely...

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 When he got introduced to people, sort of a gathering, his famous scientist,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 he'd be introduced.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 And sometimes he used to just be introduced, turn away, turn his back on the buzzer,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 and sprint out the room as fast as he could, and held the nearest carriage

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 and just gallop off into the sunset.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Wow.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Do you guys know, it's just on gravity.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Do you know that people have a phobia of gravity?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 There's a word for that.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 But...

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Okay, is that people who are scared of that they might fall over?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 It's, yeah, there's different versions of their fear.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 So it's called barifobia.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 So one thing is that their fear is that gravity will get really strong

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 and just crush them all of a sudden.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Well, I wasn't scared about that until now.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Yeah.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 So just the sudden change in the universe and we'll all just go squat.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Oh, no.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 And then the second one...

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 I think it would be quite funny for a few minutes.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Yeah, everyone will rock it around when you work.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Yeah, the other version is that you're on a high place

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 and gravity suddenly pulls you off.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 So that's a sort of fear of falling, basically.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 And then the third one is that gravity kind of just goes away

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 and we all just float away like a horse on a hot air balloon.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 And that's these are genuine fears that people have.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Wow.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Hey, I was reading...

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 So obviously the best example that we have of understanding

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 how gravity works for humans who are non-planets,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 are astronauts and how it plays with the body and so on.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 And so I was reading that the bladder of humans

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 is a really interesting thing when you go to space

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 because we don't know, because everything's floating around,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 astronauts don't know that they need to go to the toilet.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 They have no idea.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 So they've been told that it must have come obvious at some stage.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Yes.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 So John Glenn, when he was up there, it became obvious

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 when his bladder had a full 27 ounces in there.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 That's seven ounces more than a bladder is meant to take.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 So he was expanding, basically, with urine.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 And the problem is, is that when it gets two full,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 the urethra gets covered.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 So it's a problem with actually being...

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 So astronauts just have to go every two hours regardless

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 just to get rid of the urine.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Sorry, there was a bit in there that I didn't quite understand.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Yeah.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 Your urethra gets covered by urine.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 I didn't read the whole article.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 But yet that's the bit that I'm going to wake up in the middle of the night, remembering.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 You can't need to go too much to go.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Yeah.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 That's not because the urine is blocking off the entrance to your...

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 The urine hasn't solidified at the entrance

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 and then stop the rest of the urine getting through.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 I assume not until Dan said that.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 But this is...

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 So if we ever get to Mars and live on Mars,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 that will be a problem for the people who grow up on Mars

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 because gravity is much lighter there.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 So they will probably be taller.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 But when they come back to Earth, if they ever do,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 they will not be able to get out of bed.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Because the gravity is three times stronger.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 Oh, right.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 So it's like, is it Superman who comes to Earth

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 and then the gravity's different on his planet to our planet?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Yes.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 That means he can fly around, is that right?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Is that why he can fly?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 Yeah.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 According to one person in the audience,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 I am going to believe the original mythology

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 was that he could leap us a building in a single bound.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 That was the thing.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 Because they couldn't quite work out with the movies

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 and the animation how to make him fly.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 And then they worked that out and then he turned into...

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Is that because the gravity is so strong on his planet

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 that he's developed incredibly strong legs to counteract it?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 So he can leap really easily...

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 I think that is true.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 And if the thing is about humans...

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Is everyone on his planet just walking around normally?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Well, I think his planet got destroyed.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 I really know anything about it.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 Yeah.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Andy, Krypton's no longer I'm afraid.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Oh, man.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Yeah.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Really?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Anyway.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Back to the real world.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 The amount that humans can manage on other planets

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 about depending on how big their gravity is.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 People have looked into that.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 That was such a strange sentence I'm going to start again.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Scientists have looked on other planets that have more gravity

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 and try to work out how much we would be able to manage.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 And they've looked at that by seeing how much people can squat

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 and what they can lift when they're squatting.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 And they reckon the absolute maximum that anyone

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 will be able to do is 4.6 times of our gravity.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 If you couldn't do that, you wouldn't have enough strength

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 to even lift your legs to walk around the planet.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 And the way that they found that out is by looking at a guy called

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 Half-Thought Julius Bjornsson, who was also...

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 So Gregor, the mountain plug-in from Game of Thrones.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Oh, cool.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 And he has the world record for squat lifts.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 He was the world's strongest man, and he did that this year.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 And they worked out how much the gravity would be able to work

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 so that the mountain would be able to walk.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 And it's 4.6 times.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 So if it was Dan's world where gravity suddenly got really,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 really strong, the wheel got squashed.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 If it was 4.6 times, he would be the only person able to walk

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 on the whole planet.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Wow.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 That's the TV series I would watch.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 Yeah.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 It's just Gregor Clegane walking around the load of pancake people.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 And that is my fact.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 My fact this week is that the pirate, who mentored Blackbeard,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 once attacked a ship, purely to steal all of the hats

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 of everyone on board.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Because his crew had drunkenly thrown all of their own hats

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 over board the night before.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 So this is a guy called Benjamin Hornegold,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 and he was a pirate.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Can I just say hornygold is a great name for a pirate, isn't he?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 Hornegold.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 It's the two things he's after in life.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 That's true.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Is it horny first name, surname Gold middle name four?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Horny?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Yeah, I'm hornyforgold.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 Yeah.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 No, it's not.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 Okay.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 So Benjamin, let's just call him Benjamin.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 No, so this was in the 1700s, 1717,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 and basically they had this massive night out on their ship.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 They threw their hats on, you know, into the ocean.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Just like that, yeah.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 And so, and we know about this, because we have reports

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 from the ship that was robbed and basically terrifying

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 a bunch of pirates come on.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 They said, please don't hurt us.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 And they went, okay, cool.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Can we have your hat?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Took the hat and left.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 There was money on there.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 There was everything on there.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 They didn't need it.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 And yeah, so this was Blackbeard's mentor.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Blackbeard was his second in command for many, many years.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Yeah.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 It's weird to think of pirates having mentors.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 You sort of assigned an older pirate student

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 to look after you for your early years.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 Yeah.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 So, did he teach Blackbeard all of his trademark ship?

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Like, Blackbeard was very famous for having sort of fireworks sewn into his hair.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Wasn't he?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 How this huge head of black hair, a full of fireworks, a scare people.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 And so, he did, sorry, because you're mowing over that as a fat.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 That was a crazy thing that he did.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 This was a pirate who put fireworks in his head as he was robbing people.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 And he didn't have, he had a beard.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Like, fire hazards are everywhere in that situation.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Yeah.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 And that's how he scared people.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 It is, although, no record of him ever killing anyone, I don't think.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 But he just, yeah, he sort of ruled by fear.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 In fact, I think the reason that we romanticize pirates is because of this thing

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 that was written in 1724, a general history of the robberies and murders of the most notorious pirates.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 And this described Blackbeard, and it said his beard was black, extravagant length.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 As to Brett, it came up to his eyes.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 Which I didn't even know bears could do that.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 Oh.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 And he was, I don't know how you grow it that way.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 He was accustomed to twist it with ribbons in small tails and turn them about his ears.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Which suddenly sounds actually much less threatening.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Yeah.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 It sounds like his mentor is just there doing pigt health.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Yeah.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 He, just to go back to Hornigold for a second.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Hornigold, do you know how he was got rid of from his ship?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 He got voted out by his crew.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Right.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Like X Factor.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Yes.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 It was quite a placid.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 So he didn't want to attack British ships.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 And his crew said, look, we're missing a lot of opportunities here.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 And they deposed him in a vote.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 And then he was just a passenger on board their ship.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 How's it ever going around attacking other people?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 He was sitting in the break going, well, I wouldn't do it this way if I were you.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 But, you know, we've had a vote.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 And fun.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 People do use pirates as a good example of early democracy.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Because they were weirdly egalitarian.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 And yeah, they had this democratic system.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 And there was quite a lot of equality in common quality.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Or like spoils equality, pillager quality, whatever on board.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 So, you know, the lowest mate didn't really earn very much less than the captain.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And it was basically to prevent yourself being overthrown, literally, thrown, thrown over.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 They had compensation as well.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 If you had an injury at work, you would be compensated.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 There's a list.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 We have numbers.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 If you lost a right arm, you'd get 600 pieces of silver.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 If you lost a left arm, you'd get 500 pieces.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 So much more important to lose that one if you're looking for money.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 If you lost your right leg, you got 500, lost left leg, 400, lost either I, same amount.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Lost a finger, 100, like there was every bit of your body had compensation.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Well, and also, and this is where I think the real scammers would come in in this health insurance system.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 If you lost a leg, and then you, after that, lost your peg leg, then you got the same amount of compensation again.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Oh, there's a loophole.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Love?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Have ye been in an accident at work that was not your fault?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 Although Robert Louis Stevenson made up almost everything.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 He made up chef of my timbers.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 He made up the song '15 Man on the Deadman's Chest'.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 One leg of pirates, pirates, it's all...

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Well, it's all made up.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Pirates?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 I mean, have you ever found some evidence that pirates and pirates did hang out together?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 So the...

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 You had an emotional support, Pirate.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Yeah.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 So the biggest Pirate Stronghold was Port Royal and Jamaica.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 And actually, this was in the 1600s, and it was being fought over between the English and Spanish.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 But it was the second largest European city in the new world.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 So it was second only to Boston, Port Royal, and the pirates controlled it.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 And it was a great laugh.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 So a quarter of the buildings were bars or brothels.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 It was a massive frack boy kind of drinking culture.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 So the pirates used to dump a massive fat of alcohol on the street

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 and force all passes by to drink from it.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Wow.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 A pirate was great fun.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 And apparently, going to a Dutch explorer who visited,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 he said that the pirates drank as much as the pirates there.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 He said that the pirates gathered to drink from the large stops of ale

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 with just as much alacrity as the drunks that frequented.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 That's amazing.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Yeah.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 So funny.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 Another place that's associated with pirates is Pittsburgh.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Of course.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 This is a sporting thing.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Yes, it is.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Yeah, well done.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Yeah.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 So the Pittsburgh pirates, they weren't always called the Pittsburgh pirates.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 They were originally known as the Pittsburgh,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 and I'm going to let you try and read this.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 Oh, God knows.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 It's a mountain range.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Alleghenies?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 Alleghenies.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Oh.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 So they were the Pittsburgh Alleghenies.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 And they got renamed.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 In 1880, they stole away a second basement from another team.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 And they got called in one of the newspapers, a bunch of pirates.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 And they took the name from that.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 And that's how they got called the Pittsburgh pirates.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 Alleghenies.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Allegedly, yeah, yeah.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Alleghenies.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 No, no, no.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 It was Elliot.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Yeah.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 That's strong.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 No, sorry.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Can I read it?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 I only want to say, because the reason I brought this up is because I have a fight about the Pittsburgh pirates,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 which I really want to say, because I want to know if you guys have heard this.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 This is amazing.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 So the Pittsburgh pirates had a scandal in 1985 when it turned out that some of their team had been buying cocaine from a giant parrot.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Wow.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 So I can think of two ways that is.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Either a giant parrot, which has been trained as a, I guess, a mule.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 Yes.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Or a team mascot, who is unbelievably brazen about the way he sells his drugs.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 You're absolutely right.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 What's the one?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Yeah, they have, they had this giant parrot mascot and he was kind of taken the cocaine from the street and given it to players.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Wow.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Cool.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 And it wasn't an actual parrot.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 It was a human.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 It was a human in a parrot suit.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Yes, sorry.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 That's a bit obvious in an alleyway when there's a giant...

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 You'd never suspect a giant parrot suit?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Yeah, but if you're buying drugs and then some guy in a massive parrot suit comes up to you, I think you're...

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 I'd be like, these drugs are fucking working.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Wow.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 Ah, Polly wants some crack.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 Should we wrap up?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 Yeah, okay, that is it.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
