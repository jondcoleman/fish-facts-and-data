00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.280
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.920
 This week, coming to you from the Glee Comedy Club in Cardiff.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.840
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.600
 I am sitting here with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.640
 and James Harkin.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.920
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.160
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.680
 OK, my fact this week is the oldest surviving

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.120
 Soty puppet has just been bought to auction,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.440
 and it was bought by Soty.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.960
 No.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.680
 Yeah?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.960
 It was by the new guy, Richard Cadal,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.200
 who's in charge of Soty at the moment.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.480
 And whenever he bitted for it, he bitted it with Soty

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.240
 on his hands.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.360
 [APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 Wow.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.680
 That is great.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.720
 That's very cool.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.840
 So it's like Soty's emancipated himself.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.880
 Yeah.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.480
 Cool.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.720
 It's actually more like he sold himself back in dislavery.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760
 Yeah.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.240
 OK, get this.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.520
 When they were on television together,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.080
 Soty and Sue were never allowed to touch each other

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.480
 in case things got too steamy.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.680
 Yeah, so this is true.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.000
 Soty and Sue, when Sue was introduced,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 there was a worry at the BBC that this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.960
 would introduce a sexual element and too much sexual tension

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.760
 to the show.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.400
 And so she was only allowed in on sufferance

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.160
 that she never touched him, that he never touched her.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.720
 They didn't speak to her beforehand,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.760
 and go, this is what you're not allowed to do, right?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.360
 Well, no.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.520
 For international listeners, they both love puppet bears.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.280
 So it's easy to enforce.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.400
 And but actually Sue is a panda and pandas aren't bears.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160
 Oh.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.680
 So there's a certain amount of interspecies

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.640
 stuff going on there.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.440
 Yeah, true.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.280
 Wow.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.720
 Oh, no.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.640
 Wasn't she voiced by the wife of the person who did Soty?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.400
 Yeah, Harry Colbert's wife played her.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.160
 But then Harry Colbert's son took over the role,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.760
 but his mum stayed playing the girlfriend.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.720
 Ah.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720
 But it was an unusual setup.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.440
 Yeah.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.040
 I think he actually replaced her, didn't he?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.160
 His daughter replaced her quite quickly and said

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.080
 he didn't want her playing Sue anymore, maybe because of that.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.880
 And also apparently, the person who took over

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.600
 playing Sue said she was getting a little bit older,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.360
 and she was finding it a little bit harder

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.640
 to re-descript, watch a monitor, work a puppet,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.560
 and smoke a cigarette all at the same time.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.320
 Very uncomfortable for parole to Sue.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.880
 But this is the sort of worry about sexuality.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.760
 This was in 1964 to say no.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.600
 And they got so serious that the directed general of the BBC

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.640
 intervened personally.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.160
 This went all the way to his desk.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.640
 And he called the host in and said, I'm allowing it.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.600
 But then two years later, they canceled the show.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.800
 And it went to YGV who didn't care.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.560
 It's been all right.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.160
 Did they touch each other?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.480
 Well, then they went to Channel 4

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.080
 and it got extremely stinking.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.400
 Sue did actually want to have a pregnancy scare.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.920
 No.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.920
 Yeah, it's part of the bitch.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.720
 She had a pregnancy scare.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720
 Although it turned out she just had a cushion up her jumper.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.840
 So, simpler times.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.840
 Imagine if you went to your gynecologist

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.200
 and said, I think I'm pregnant.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.160
 And they go, no, you just got a cushion up there.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.040
 And you're a man.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.280
 What the fuck you do?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800
 And then I took my feet out of the stir-ups

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.680
 and I bid him good day.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.080
 But the team America guys got in trouble for their puppet

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.440
 sex scene properly, didn't they?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.440
 They did.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.560
 So they had to re-edit the sex scene in Team America

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.080
 nine times and re-submit it to the Motion Picture

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.640
 Association of America to say, is this OK yet?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.040
 Because the film association was saying,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.160
 we can only classify Team America as--

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.960
 in America, I think it's NC 17, which is the rating that means,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.240
 like, no under 18-year-olds are allowed to go and see it.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.800
 Just because these two puppets have sex, which--

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.400
 and as I think Tray Parker pointed out,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.280
 it doesn't make any sense.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.880
 Our characters are made of wood and have no genitals.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.440
 And yet--

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.400
 It is a very rude scene.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.920
 Yes, yeah.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.680
 Did you have to go with your mom?

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.320
 This is like watching the Suttisha all over again.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.000
 Mighty Morphine Power Rangers got banned in Malaysia

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.880
 because the Morphine bits sounded too much like Morphine.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.440
 They were famously sluggish, weren't they?

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.840
 Yeah, but you guys in the UK, you had Ninja Turtles, which

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.720
 is what I call them.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.440
 Sorry, who?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.440
 I'd never heard of it.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.640
 Yeah, you called them hero turtles, didn't you?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.480
 Yeah, because they thought that you weren't able to deal

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.520
 with nunchucks, basically.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.400
 But they still have the nunchucks, didn't they?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 No, no, they're not just saying--

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.240
 I looked at a picture today, because I had no idea

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.000
 that this was the case.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.840
 So Michelangelo, instead of having nunchucks--

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840
 This is a feather.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.120
 Oh, he just has a nice cup of tea.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.640
 Yeah.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.360
 He's like, that guy looks like he needs a hug from the hug turtle.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.760
 Yeah, it was--

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.120
 He had-- no, he had still.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.520
 I mean, really, they did that.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.480
 Yeah, really, they changed it.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.920
 So he just had a grappling hook.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.520
 So my memory is him having nunchucks.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.480
 No, in the opening scenes, there's

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.960
 a couple of seconds of nunchucks.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.680
 And then if you look at the pictures, maybe it was only

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.520
 for a few episodes.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.360
 Maybe they brought it back.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.120
 But he has a grappling hook.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.280
 Well, you can do a lot more damage with a grappling hook.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.560
 I know.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.760
 It's got spikes on the eggs.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.280
 Yeah.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.160
 Yeah.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.760
 So Pepper Pick, this year, I think,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.600
 got quite recently, was banned in Australia.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.200
 Just one episode it was.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.720
 And it was the episode where Pepper

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.880
 is taught that spiders are very small and can't hurt you.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.600
 It gets loads of complaints, Pepper Pick, though,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.800
 for being a bad influence on children.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.200
 And some of the things that parents

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.000
 have said about it, of Ritten and said,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.200
 a father wrote in to the people who make it

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.640
 and complained that his son has started splashing

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.280
 in muddy puddles on the way to school.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.760
 I know, but no, apparently that's bad.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.440
 And another mother wrote in and said,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.960
 she'd asked her daughter what she wanted for breakfast.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.520
 And she said, chocolate cake.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.320
 And another said, his son has stopped

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.240
 eating cucumber and tomato sandwiches.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.400
 And these just all sound like terrible parents.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.240
 Yeah.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.920
 Hey, we need to move on to our second fact.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.560
 It is time for fact number two.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.360
 And that is Andy.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.120
 My fact is that mountains are partly shaped by salmon.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.880
 Wow.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.400
 What?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.720
 Wow.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.600
 This is true.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 This is absolutely true.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.320
 Salmon play a significant role in the shape of mountains.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.200
 That happens over a long period of time, obviously.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.400
 But so salmon swim upstream to spawn.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.760
 And then as they do so, the female kind of stirs up the mud

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.520
 and the sediment at the bottom when she's

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.480
 making a kind of nest in the water.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.560
 And that means that the river channels erode faster.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.600
 And it means they erode downstream faster.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.360
 And over hundreds of thousands of years,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.800
 a landscape where salmon spawn could be up to 30% lower

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.480
 than a landscape with no salmon.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.240
 Wow.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.360
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.800
 There's a thing that one of our friends at QI

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.600
 mentioned the other day, actually, which is that the paint

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.880
 of painting mountains white.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.080
 So this is--

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.360
 Yeah, have you seen this in the Peruvian Mountains?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.960
 This is a guy who's going around painting them white

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.840
 to combat global warming.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.760
 Not just one guy with one paintbrush, though.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760
 He's.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.320
 It's pretty much, slightly, in to begin with.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.400
 I mean, because to begin with, everyone

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.320
 thought he was nuts.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.040
 And he said, because all the ice and all the snow

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.760
 had gone off it.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.360
 And so it just was bare mountains.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.160
 And he went, oh, I'll save the ice and snow

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 by painting it white again to look like it has ice and snow.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.400
 But that's not why he's doing it.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.240
 That's not why he's doing it.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480
 He's not creating the article there.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.760
 OK, so he's not going, oh, I'll save these mountains

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.040
 from not being covered in the snow by making it look like they've

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.240
 got snow and then maybe that'll convince them.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.440
 It's so that it keeps the surface cooler.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.320
 Because if you've got a white surface,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.840
 then it keeps the color of the heat.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.400
 Yeah, so I think the average cut that's

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.640
 covered in white paint is like 17 degrees cooler

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.240
 than if it's got black paint.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.640
 And then the idea is that the ice will stay on it for longer.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.200
 And then it can give everyone water in nearby villages

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.720
 and keep the vegetation growing.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.880
 Yeah, mountain painting.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.080
 Didn't you win a Nobel Prize for that?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.080
 I don't think so.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.960
 Maybe you did read the article then.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.960
 No, I don't think you should have, though, shouldn't I?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.960
 You've got some kind of a, maybe like a Nickelodeon or kids

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.000
 of water, so I don't know.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Yeah.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.200
 And the tallest mountain in Colorado, OK,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.400
 is called Mount Elbert.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.920
 And it's next to another mountain called Mount Massive.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.240
 And Mount Massive is 12 feet shorter than Mount Elbert.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.480
 OK, I think they have the third and fourth

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.160
 or the second and third biggest mountains

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.600
 in the whole of America.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.080
 But the next to each other, and a lot of--

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.320
 there are a lot of fans of Mount Massive.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.040
 And what they like to do is go to the top of Mount Massive

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.880
 and put a big pile of stones on the top,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.320
 so that it becomes the biggest.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.800
 But then Mount Elbert has quite a few fans as well.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.000
 And they keep going up and taking all the rocks down.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.960
 Wow.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.000
 That's so Colorado.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.160
 It's boring.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.040
 Here's another fact.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.280
 Mountains can suffer from tired mountains in Rome.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.920
 So this has happened around the world in lots of different places.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.360
 But at the moment, it's happening in North Korea.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.200
 And they have a mountain called Mount Mantap.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.800
 And due to all of the nuclear tests there,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.880
 basically, there's a load of geological damage.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.400
 And the rock mass inside the mountain

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.440
 just isn't kind of integral anymore.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.640
 Did you say it's called Mount Mantap?

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.120
 Yes, I've heard that.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.040
 That sounds like how Kim Jong-un refers to his penis, doesn't it?

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.960
 God, this is a mountain.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.960
 This may be think about other syndromes that might be.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.280
 So this is tired mountains in syndrome,

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.920
 just a few that I found online.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.000
 Floppy trunk syndrome, that's a thing that elephants can get.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.400
 These are all very sad, by the way.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.280
 This is not like a happy flop.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.160
 This is not like that.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.400
 Which is another Kim Jong-un drive term.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.640
 Bazaar Kalama syndrome, that's a thing.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.960
 If you human raise a llama, they go crazy,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.040
 and they attack the humans.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.320
 Wobbly hedgehog syndrome.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.720
 Again, it's not a very nice thing if you're the hedgehog,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.440
 but it is if you're reading the words on the internet.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.040
 And there was a guy who was diagnosed with chronic lightness

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.880
 syndrome.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.720
 This is incredible.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.000
 This is a real thing, apparently.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.560
 It's a bit like ADHD, and it means that he can't properly

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.240
 gauge how long things take.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.040
 So he's late for absolutely everything.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040
 OK.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.440
 Come on, I've used this excuse so many times.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.760
 No, it is a real thing.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.440
 It's very funny you mentioned that, James.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.960
 Because I found out about chronic lightness syndrome.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.720
 And it's weird, he'd listen here, and I've invited him

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.920
 to be at the show tonight.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
 And I just want to--

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.480
 Are you--

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.760
 Oh, full of shame.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.080
 In 1945, when people first started testing atomic weapons,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.200
 Kodak found out about it before anyone else.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.720
 And I had no idea about this, but this

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.200
 is because film, camera film, is really

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.000
 sensitive to radiation.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.760
 And they got loads of complaints from people in America,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.640
 saying, our camera film is fogging up.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.400
 And so a scientist who was working at Kodak

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.960
 looked into it and did some 1940s googling.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.320
 And he deduced that they must be testing atomic bombs.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.960
 And he stayed quiet for a little while,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.840
 because he thought, I better not just

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.080
 won't get involved with that, that's fine.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.760
 And they put some atomic proof filters

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.360
 around their factory, and they just didn't mention it.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.760
 And then eventually, they kept on damaging their films.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.640
 It's radiation.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.400
 And so they tried to sue the American government in 1951

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.680
 for doing all these nuclear tests that was the worst thing

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680
 about them, apparently, was that they

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.800
 were screwing up Kodak's film.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.000
 And the American government agreed

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.640
 to give them all the maps and the schedule of all future

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.920
 nuclear tests on the grounds that they didn't talk

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.560
 about this to anyone anymore.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.400
 Yeah.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.120
 That's amazing.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.800
 I know.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.640
 Just quickly, Kodak and mountains, this is an interesting connection.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.320
 When George Mallory and Irving, the original, supposedly

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.640
 almost might have made it to the top of Everest

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.880
 before Hillary did, when Mallory and Irving disappeared,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.440
 and it's been a big mystery ever since,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.160
 did they make it or did they not, there's

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.360
 been hunts that have been going on to find them.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.400
 And the one thing they're looking for

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.200
 is the camera that was had by Mallory and Irving,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.960
 because, because of the cold nature of the mountain,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.520
 the film is preserved.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.440
 And Kodak say, if we find the camera,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.960
 we'll still be able to develop it at this point.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.080
 So they do searches.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.400
 So one thing was when Hillary went to the top of the mountain,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.080
 he did a very basic search for Mallory.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.680
 He was looking for two things, the camera.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.840
 And the other thing was a picture of Mallory's wife.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.760
 Because Mallory said he was going to bury a picture

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.840
 of his wife on the top of the mountain.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.800
 So Hillary got up there, didn't find it.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.120
 Then in 1989, people went out to look for the camera.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.640
 And suddenly, perfectly preserved on the snow,

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.000
 was Mallory, the body of Mallory.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.640
 And they found everything on him.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.400
 They had his goggles, perfect condition, his ice pick.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.680
 They had his wallet.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680
 They had everything.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.320
 The one thing they didn't have was his camera.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.640
 So it must be on Irving.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.480
 But they were so close to finding out.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.240
 And check this out.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.360
 Another thing they didn't find inside the wallet

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.760
 was the picture of his wife.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.640
 Ooh.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.720
 And then again, if I was dying, I would quickly throw away

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.880
 the photo of my wife.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.360
 So you wouldn't be looking at it with your dying breath.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.360
 You'd be like, oh, fuck.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.280
 I'd want her to be remembered as the wife

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.040
 of the man who first climbed Everest.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.240
 And to successfully do that, sometimes,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.760
 you have to cut some strings.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.240
 I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.320
 She would have understood, I think.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.040
 You could have understood.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.240
 Do you know how tall the smallest unclimbed mountain in Japan

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.400
 is?

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.000
 I'll give you a clue.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.400
 It's in Osaka.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.240
 I'm going to go for 12,000 feet.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.800
 OK, that's high.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.600
 That's high.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.840
 I only work in meters.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.080
 So I'm going to go for the tallest, unclimbed--

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.600
 Smallest.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.080
 Smallest.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.440
 Unclimbed.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.480
 The smallest mountain that no one has bothered to climb.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.280
 This is the most ridiculous question I've ever been asked.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.320
 And I'm going to go for 1,600 meters.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:46.840
 OK.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.280
 I'm going to go for 4 meters.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.680
 Yeah.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.360
 Hasn't grasped the metric system yet.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.720
 So what's 4 meters in feet?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.400
 That's, like, 3 feet.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.120
 No, no, no.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.280
 No, like, a meter is longer than a foot.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.760
 OK, that's got big feet.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.760
 You know, when they say that, they're with big feet.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.600
 Big man's up.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:15.480
 It's almost like no one cares how tall they're.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.040
 No, amazingly, Dan is almost absolutely bang on.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.960
 It is 15 feet above sea level.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.560
 Oh, yes.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.480
 It's not a mountain.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.320
 It is a mountain.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.720
 The Japanese geospatial information authority

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.360
 are very relaxed about what qualifies as a mountain.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.280
 I'm not kidding.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.760
 Yeah, it's called Mount Tempo.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.360
 And it's basically a pile of dirt,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.160
 which was dredged out of the harbor in 1832

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.760
 to allow vessels to sail in to the port.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.160
 And that is not even the highest point in the park.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.640
 It is in.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.640
 But the Japan's national tourist organization

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.480
 have said that they do have a mountain rescue unit in case anyone

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.680
 gets lost on the slopes.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.600
 OK, shall we move on to fact number three?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.080
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.760
 And that is Shuzanski.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.440
 Yes, my fact is that when King George VI married the Queen Mother,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.240
 the Archbishop of Canterbury wouldn't

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.680
 let them broadcast the ceremony on the radio

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.040
 in case people listened in the pub without removing their hats.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.040
 This was the BBC really wanted to broadcast it.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.040
 It was 1923, and BBC had just set up this radio station.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.760
 They wanted something to broadcast the Royal Wedding

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.120
 scene like the right thing.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.480
 He wasn't George VI at the time.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.360
 This was before he was King.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.920
 But they asked if they could broadcast it.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.080
 And the Abbey chapter said, absolutely not.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.480
 Vito, because people all listened in the pubs and worse,

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.840
 they may listen with their hats still on.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.760
 And it might be received in an irreverent manner.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.160
 So did people just used to just keep wearing their hats

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.520
 inside the pub, generally?

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.240
 No.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.680
 I think just like if you are really a complete layabout,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.720
 if you're a really a bad person, if you're a drunk,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.040
 then you might forget to take your hats off.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.600
 You might be wearing a baseball cap or something.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.000
 What, in 1923?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.680
 I don't know if it was baseball caps.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.640
 You had a mind on it.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.680
 But what I'm saying is that people do sometimes wear hats

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.240
 in the pubs, so.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.160
 But this was the thing.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.120
 So you were supposed to take off your hat inside.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.800
 If you were doing something like watching

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.760
 a very respectable ceremony.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.720
 Well, you were always supposed to really weren't you?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.400
 Was it not an etiquette of always taking your hat off

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.200
 when you were inside?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.240
 I was reading something etiquette.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.120
 And it was actually really complicated.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.920
 So I think on some inside moments,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.120
 you wouldn't like, for instance,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.960
 you see pictures of bars in the 1920s

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.440
 where men kept their hats on.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.720
 And that was apparently because they

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.400
 couldn't rely on them not being stolen if they took them off.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.480
 I think the idea is, if you're in a place

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.400
 which is akin to a public street--

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.160
 so it could be a corridor, or it could be

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.440
 a lobby of a hotel.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.600
 And I guess you could probably say that pub is a bit like that, maybe.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.960
 So what, then you can leave your hat on?

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.040
 Yeah, OK.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.680
 And where's the song came from?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.160
 Yeah, that's the chorus.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.760
 But then there's a big log list of things that you're allowed to hear.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.720
 If you're in a corridor, if you're in a lobby,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.680
 anywhere like a public street--

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.680
 Cool.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.640
 You don't know that song.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640
 Do you?

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.440
 And then had to take off their hats

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.640
 when the National Anthem was being played in the olden days in Etica.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.000
 And it's really supposed to now as well.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.360
 But women are allowed to, unless it's a unisex hat.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.960
 So if it's a hat that any one--

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.280
 I mean, anyone can wear any hats.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.680
 I'm not judging.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.680
 But let's say it is a baseball cap that is a unisex hat,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.800
 then the women have to take the hat off as well.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.880
 So it's the hat, which is--

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.880
 God, I can really imagine panicking as to what gender my hat was.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.680
 What the right thing to do was at that moment.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.680
 I found a really amazing thing about George VI.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.520
 In 1926, and as far as I can tell,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.560
 he's the only British monarch to have done this.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.640
 So this is prior to him being a king,

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.040
 he competed in the doubles at Wimbledon as a tennis player.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.760
 Really?

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.600
 I don't know that.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.680
 How did he do?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.920
 He lost the first match and he was out for the rest of it.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.000
 But that's extraordinary.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.960
 That suddenly the prince of the UK was suddenly there.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.440
 Yeah, great.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.560
 Imagine Prince Charles at the snooker.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.560
 You'd watch, wouldn't you?

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.480
 Well, we have that one who rides the horses.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.080
 Zara Phillips.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.480
 They all ride the horses.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.960
 Yeah, he was professionally.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.440
 He was very young.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.960
 Yeah, he was amazing.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.120
 So they got married only after him

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.320
 trying really hard to marry the Queen Mother for a long time.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.040
 And he'd proposed twice in the past.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.360
 It's so weird that she was known as the Queen Mother

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.120
 all the way through her life.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.640
 It's like she was destined for the job.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.680
 She should have known.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.080
 He was called Albert at the time, weirdly.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.560
 And she was called Elizabeth at the time.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.960
 And she refused his first proposal

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.720
 because we kind of all remember the Queen Mother.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.480
 She was quite a spunky character.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.840
 And at the time, she refused because she didn't want to feel

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.760
 like she wasn't able to be free to think, speak, and act

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.360
 as she felt she ought to.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.520
 So he said, I'm only going to marry this woman.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.440
 I really love her.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.360
 So his mum, Albert's mum, invited her up to her house

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.200
 and had some really, really sharp words

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.080
 being like, OK, well, you have to marry my son.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.280
 And then he proposed again.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.640
 And she said, no, again.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.400
 So good on her.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.120
 And then he beat her down the third time, like metaphorically.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.240
 She was the first commoner to be

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.520
 married to a member of the royal family for 200 years,

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.080
 I think.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080
 Wow.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.120
 But she was a commoner.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.120
 But she was the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.560
 And she grew up in Glam's castle.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.040
 Yeah.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.400
 So it's stretching commoner a little bit, isn't it?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.840
 And this is a really good fact.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.280
 I liked about George the Sith.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.040
 During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.560
 he technically was at war with himself

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.560
 because he was the monarch of both those places.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.560
 Oh, wow.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.040
 Amazing.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.840
 So no judge.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.560
 Why are you hitting yourself?

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.840
 And here's another fact.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.000
 When he died, there were more than 300,000 people

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.440
 who queued up to see his body.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.120
 And that is just about the same as a population of Cardiff.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.200
 Wow.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.840
 Why did they all go down to do that?

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.440
 You've got like a weird connection to them.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.480
 Didn't have much entertainment on here.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:21.760
 Next week at the Glee Club, the body of King George, let's say.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.120
 Just on royal weddings, there was a thing where Prince William

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.200
 and Kate Middleton got married, another quite posh commoner

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.400
 marrying into the royal family.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.240
 But when they got married, that was in 2011, I think,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.280
 New Zealand released an official stamp

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.560
 to commemorate the occasion, except what they did

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.360
 was they released the official stamp, which had a perforation

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.360
 down the middle between William and Kate.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.200
 So you could tear them apart and get two stamps.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.680
 God, I swear.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.120
 Did they do that on purpose?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.880
 I don't know.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.040
 Are they apologised?

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.520
 Wow.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.280
 I can't look at whether it would have been better or worse

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.160
 for the perforation to go horizontally and cut their heads off.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.560
 They made their own choice.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.160
 This year, it was Pippa Middleton's wedding, wasn't it?

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.960
 And in our book, we have a little bit about that.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.480
 600 people were invited to Pippa Middleton's wedding.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.720
 300 guests and 300 members of the public

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.320
 who were allowed to stand in a pen outside the venue.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.400
 Did they have a trough at the very least

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.000
 or a nose bag each, maybe?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.040
 What was the--

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.360
 Well, they didn't say exactly why it was.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.480
 Well, I guess, officially, it was kind of just

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.960
 so that the local village can kind of be part of it or whatever.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.520
 But a lot of people thought that maybe it

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.840
 was to stop the paparazzi game there or whatever

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.120
 because there's so many people.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.040
 And no one really knows.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.720
 But it was crazy.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.360
 There were more than 20,000 Caterpays.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.960
 20,000.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.240
 It might have been there.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.520
 There would have been 10,000 fewer within five minutes.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.760
 So some world weddings in the past have gone really badly.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.160
 And they're really fun to read about.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.040
 So George IV, for instance, he met his future wife,

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.040
 Caroline at Brunswick, in 1795.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.800
 And it was the age when it was just arranged.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.360
 She was not flown over.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.800
 She was brought over to the UK.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.040
 And at the moment he set eyes on her, his first words were,

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.800
 I am not well.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.400
 Get me a glass of brandy.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.600
 And he proceeded to spend the next 24 hours

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.040
 in a drunken stupor and the wedding night

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.360
 lying on the floor in a drunken stupor.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.280
 He arrived late to that wedding

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.600
 and stumbled up the aisle completely drunk.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.520
 And then he refused to say any of his vows

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.160
 until his father ordered him to behave himself.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.840
 And they separated quite soon after that.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840
 Wow.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.640
 I read that he only got married because parliament said,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.440
 we will pay off your debts, but only if you marry this woman.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.960
 Yeah.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.520
 So that's the sole motivation he had.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.080
 He seems like the kind of person who would have racked up

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.160
 a lot of debts, doesn't he?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.680
 Yeah.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.880
 And I think did he stare at his mistress

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.680
 who was in the front row throughout the ceremony?

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.800
 I don't know.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.560
 Poor woman.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.240
 Yeah.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.520
 So there was another one in 1736.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.440
 There was a German princess Augusta arrived in London.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.720
 She was 17 years old.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.400
 And she had to marry the heir to the throne who was Frederick,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.920
 who didn't end up becoming king.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.080
 But she was told by her mum, look, they all speak German

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.760
 there, it's fine, because she spoke no English.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.000
 She got there, nobody spoke any German.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.440
 She didn't speak any English.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.000
 She was absolutely terrified.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.280
 She was ushered down the aisle.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.080
 She was sobbing.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.320
 She was clinging to her mum's coattails apparently,

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.880
 saying, please don't make me do this.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.680
 The groom of Frederick, apparently,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.800
 just shouted the vows in her ear

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.040
 that she had to repeat verbatim.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.600
 And then immediately after that, she

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.760
 vomited all down her dress and all over the skirt

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.080
 of her new mother-in-law.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.840
 And that was the start of what turned out

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.480
 to be quite a happy marriage, actually.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.960
 Oh, we have to move on shortly.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.600
 If you guys have anything before we do--

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.680
 oh, I've got one thing.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.040
 The movie, "The King's Speech," that was about George's

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:39.480
 thick.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.040
 He had a stutter.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.400
 Did you deliberately?

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.840
 It just came out as I did it.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.040
 Are you auditioning for the sequel?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.840
 So Colin Firth played him in the movie.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.200
 And in order to do it, obviously,

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.320
 he taught himself to do a stutter for the movie.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.240
 Then the movie finished, and Colin Firth found himself

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.440
 not being able to get rid of the stutter.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.760
 So then he himself had to be treated for an artificially

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.960
 manufactured stutter.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.760
 Isn't that great?

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.520
 No way.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.280
 Way.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.160
 I love that on the dance Wikipedia.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.680
 If it ever existed, you'd look for the citation

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.280
 at the bottom, or just a row of numbers.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.480
 Way, way, way.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.840
 I've also got quite nice hat, little thing.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.040
 So the politeness of the British with the hat back in the day,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.560
 Michael Bond passed away this year,

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.400
 who was the author of Paddington Bear.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.960
 And Paddington Bear was largely based on his father.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.520
 And his father apparently was so polite and nice

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.160
 that when he used to go swimming,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.440
 he would wear into the ocean, his trunks,

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.400
 and also his hat, just in case he passed someone

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.480
 as he was swimming, so he could say, oh, good day to you.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.080
 And if his hat to them, is that lovely?

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:56.760
 Yeah.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.160
 Did you know that on a hat etiquette,

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.160
 the reason we have cloakrooms today,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.640
 where you put your hat and your coat in a cloakroom,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.360
 is because of hats in the olden days.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.760
 So when everyone was wearing hats up until the early 1900s,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.200
 they took up half the space in restaurants.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.000
 Because, as we said earlier, men

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.880
 had to take off their top hats when they went inside

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880
 into a restaurant, for instance.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.600
 But then you didn't want to leave it under the table,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.400
 because it couldn't really fit.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.360
 So it would take up a second chair.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.880
 And there was a guy, this guy called AJ Liebling,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.640
 at one point said, you know, a restaurant's

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.080
 of 50% occupied by hats who don't eat anything.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.680
 We should really infer that cloakroom to store these.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.200
 And that's what I like.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.200
 I'd be lovely if there was a smaller hat table

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.640
 with, you know, and a hat's menu.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.400
 Right, well, they all got to hang out together.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.160
 OK, should we move on to our final fact?

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.880
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.400
 And that is my fact.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.280
 My fact this week is that the Brazilian frog, known

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.040
 as the Pumpkin Toadlet, has a mating call

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.680
 that can be heard by every animal out there,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.720
 except for one other Pumpkin Toadlets.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.200
 It turns out they're deaf.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.840
 They do these croaks to get their attention.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.000
 And they keep getting eaten.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.440
 They're probably going, why am I exposing myself so much?

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.040
 And it turns out it must be an evolutionary thing

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.400
 where they did used to be able to hear.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.360
 And somewhere along the line, they went deaf,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.080
 the entire species.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.360
 I think they're subspecies within the Pumpkin Toadlet.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.320
 So there's two species, specifically, that are deaf.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.840
 And what they think is that when they're doing the call,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.160
 the way it moves their neck, another Pumpkin Toadlet,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.160
 female Pumpkin Toadlet sees the moves of the shakes

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.320
 or whatever of the toad.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.000
 And they're like, that looks like he might be saying something.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.960
 I have no idea.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.280
 But it looks hot, so I'll go over.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.680
 But what usually would happen in evolution purposes

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.280
 is that you would lose the call because you would

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.680
 protect yourself from predators.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.520
 But they haven't.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.240
 And it's the first case that we've ever

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.160
 found of an animal that hasn't lost the call

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.400
 when it's redundant and exposes it to predators.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.960
 But it will be getting there presumably.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.880
 We're always surprised when we find animals

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.280
 that haven't evolved into this perfect being.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.440
 But presumably in a few million years it's there.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.080
 We're just in the ship phase.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.480
 Yeah, you're right.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.560
 We're in the learning phase.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.680
 When you're in the ship phase, you do often die out.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.800
 You get extinct, don't you?

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.440
 Yeah, that is a risk for the toadlet.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.480
 Apparently they do little waves as well.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.000
 Yeah.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Like this.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.920
 Well, I can understand why the females come aflocking.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.600
 LAUGHTER

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.200
 I must have it, that is a great podcast material, is it?

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.760
 Well James was doing is.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.040
 He was making a gesture that made it seem like he was trying

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.960
 to, like, work out somebody's height.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.040
 It's like, you have a child and you're going,

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.840
 is that four-foot, five-foot, four-point-five?

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.160
 Yeah, that's what he was like, four metres, three metres,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.080
 or so.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.920
 Five or six metres.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.480
 Five or six metres, OK.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.480
 Yeah, so, unfortunately, for the frog, it happens to be the case

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.720
 that, and it's like a bright orange colour.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.080
 Yeah, they're really tiny, aren't they?

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.880
 They're really tiny.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.440
 I like the size of your thumbnail almost.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.640
 They're really super small.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.160
 Yeah, and their call is quite soft as a result.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.080
 But they still can be heard by the predators.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.360
 But they are incredibly toxic.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.800
 So if they do get eaten, they might end up

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.160
 killing the predator anyway.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.480
 So they're probably just actually just being really cocky.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.440
 And they're just going, hey, I'm here, I'm here, what are you going to do?

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.240
 What are you going to do, nothing?

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.960
 Do you know that there's a type of frog called a cocky frog?

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.200
 No, really?

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.760
 It's in-- I can't remember where they're from.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.840
 They're from an island somewhere, but they're now on Hawaii,

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.240
 which is also an island, but it's different islands where they're from.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.960
 But they're on Hawaii, and they make a hell of a racket.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.520
 They're really, really loud.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.800
 And the load of people in Hawaii are really hastiness

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.160
 because it keeps them awake at night when they're mating.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.000
 Just get loads of horny frogs just making loads and loads of lies.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.280
 That's like there's something called the--

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.040
 I thought I was looking at other sounds that animals could make.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.400
 And I was wondering, do fish make mating calls?

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.480
 And they make really loud ones.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.080
 So there's a fish called the plainfish midshipman fish,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.880
 which is in the Toadfish family.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.720
 So it's got Toad relations.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.480
 And it hums to attract mates.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.400
 So it makes its hum which sounds like a guitar amplifier,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.080
 or it sounds like a flock of bees.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.960
 -Flock of bees. -Sure, a flock of bees.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.480
 Yeah.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.040
 And it turns out that they make so much noise

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.080
 that they live in California and they're constant complaints

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.320
 to the police for the noise that they make,

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.640
 because they're disrupting people's sleep

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.560
 and drowning out people's conversations.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.640
 And they growl and they grunt as well to keep out intruders.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.280
 And they didn't know what it was for a long time.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.680
 So people were calling the police saying,

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.720
 "Someone's keeping me awake all night."

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.480
 And it's them.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.040
 And the person who eventually found out about this weird noise

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.560
 that they make as a researcher called Andrew Bass,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.480
 B-A-Double-S, which is the first case

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.960
 of double nominative determinism I've ever found.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.120
 -As in-- -Double.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.040
 It's a fish.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.920
 And it's the bassy noise that the fish make.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.160
 Oh, I thought there was a fish species called Andrew.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.440
 That makes more sense.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.240
 -The Andrew fish. -Yeah.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.320
 Did you guys know some frogs call so much

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.000
 and so vociferously for a mate that, once they've got a mate,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.760
 they're too tired to follow through and have sex with the female.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.760
 The female arrives and they say, "I'm sorry, I can't.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.240
 "I'm no good to you now."

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.720
 They lose loads of weight, don't they?

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.960
 They can't eat.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.880
 They can't sleep, and they're so weak that they've just

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.000
 a floppy mess.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.760
 And it feels like--

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.720
 Everyone's had a night like that.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.200
 I mean, that is it.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.160
 I've never done it.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.360
 I've found the really cool one.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.360
 There's a frog in Taiwan.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.080
 It's an urban city frog, and it does a mating call,

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.160
 but it's worked out how to make their mating call better.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.400
 It goes to storm drains, and it uses it as a megaphone.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.200
 So it gets to the top of a storm drain.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.080
 And it literally, it's just whatever it's you're,

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.440
 "I'm super horny."

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.920
 "Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey."

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.120
 And they found that the female frog goes to the edge

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.920
 of the storm drain, so it works for them.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.480
 But do the females know that it's not--

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.360
 because it must sound like a massive frog.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.760
 Oh, that sound like a super frog.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.560
 It must, you're right, yeah.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.840
 Do you know the biggest frog that's ever lived

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.080
 is about the size of a beach ball and it at dinosaurs?

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.840
 Wow.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.800
 It's not like T-Rex's, though.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.040
 No, like baby dinosaurs, you know.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.560
 So the comment told the Latin name for that is Bufo, Bufo.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.760
 And this frog, it was known as-- or is known as Bielza Bufo.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.120
 Oh, hi.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.960
 That's his official name, as well.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.240
 That's not--

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.800
 but it was the size of a beach ball.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.720
 And they worked out how strong it's bite was.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.680
 And its bite was about 2,200 newtons,

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.320
 which is about the same as a lion's bite.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.080
 Wow.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.920
 Wow.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.760
 Yeah.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.520
 Do you know how porcupines attract to each other?

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.680
 Or how male porcupines attract females?

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.840
 This really bite was.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.240
 Really awesome spikes.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.840
 It is actually-- well, it's in a way, yeah.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.240
 They stand up on their hind legs,

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.280
 and they move, they shuffle towards the female just

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.480
 with their penis fully erect.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.480
 And that's how they do it.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:43.120
 It's a sun uncompromisingly direct flirting method.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.160
 It's good.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.960
 There's no question over what he's after.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.800
 We like that.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.720
 Or sometimes, and you can see pictures of this, they hop.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.360
 They lift one arm, their front paw off the ground,

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.400
 and they hop on the other one, whilst clutching their crotch

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.280
 with the one that's off the ground.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.680
 They do.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.200
 And this attracts the women.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.160
 And if the woman or the female porcupine likes that enough,

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.360
 the crotch dance, then she'll allow them to have sex with her.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.600
 And usually, if she's not up for sex,

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.120
 then a male porcupine can't get in there,

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.440
 because she's so spiny.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.800
 And then the way you know that she likes you

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.320
 is she puts her tail up, and it covers all of her spines,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.040
 which means that you will not be impaled.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.520
 She's a very good, very good system.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.000
 Do you know that some frogs change color

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.240
 to make their life easier when they're in orgies?

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.040
 Really?

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.080
 If you've been in orgie, your life doesn't get much easier, does it?

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.360
 Yeah, you've made it.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.600
 You're fine.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.560
 Well, it does, if you're a frog, you see,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.160
 because there's a lot of them.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.760
 There's loads and loads of frogs all get together.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.040
 Might be a particularly nice puddle or something.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.160
 But these are in some species.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.320
 They all get together, and they'll just

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.720
 shag anything.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.760
 Male, female, tennis ball, whatever.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.160
 There are some pictures of tennis balls

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.800
 landing into this orgie of frogs,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.000
 and all the frogs just go for it.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 Really?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.760
 What happens to the match?

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:10.720
 The charge is six going down, you know?

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.800
 So that's what happens.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.320
 And, but there are some species.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.840
 A lot of these species who do this kind of group mating,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.320
 they also change colour, and no one was really sure why,

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.800
 and it seems that the reason they do it is to say,

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.560
 "I'm a man, or I'm a woman, you know, keep off me."

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.040
 Oh, wow, it's like when you go to those parties at union,

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.760
 you have to wear a traffic light colour depending

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.800
 on how available you are.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.160
 But the problem is, at the start, they're all green.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.160
 Have you heard of this thing?

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.080
 So when frogs have, it's called explosive breeding, isn't it?

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.360
 They do this thing called explosive breeding,

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.360
 which is instead of mating all year round,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.640
 they have one session, you know, every year.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.520
 And all the mating happens then.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.760
 So some females, because there's a horrible crush of bodies,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.480
 some females are crushed to death in these things.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.680
 Unfortunately, it's already unfortunate, yeah.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.640
 Let me rephrase it, put the column in a different place.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.760
 Some females are crushed to death, unfortunately.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:12.720
 But the male frogs will still mate with them successfully,

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.040
 successfully.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.400
 OK, so it's all about the mating habits

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.480
 outside the body, because the female produces eggs.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.040
 The male produces sperm, and they meet outside the body.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.040
 So the males sort of go up and squeeze the females.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.240
 Oh, God.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.320
 And they squeeze.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.480
 It's just nature, guys.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.280
 It's just nature.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.160
 It can't be gross if it's just nature.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.960
 No, that's not a defense for anything.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.720
 Yeah, and they squeeze the eggs out of the body

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.720
 and then mate with them.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.800
 Amazing.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.640
 Yeah, it is messed up.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.760
 I'm sorry.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.080
 So Seahawks, look at that.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.360
 Don't boo the frogs.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.720
 It's their instincts.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.920
 I don't think the frogs are the ones being booed.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.360
 He's pointing at me.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.560
 I don't, mate.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.800
 So Seahawks has the best mating rituals,

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.080
 the best way of attracting each other,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.680
 which people might have seen, but it's so great.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.720
 So they change colour as well to attract mates.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.440
 And then when they've got something they think they fancy,

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.600
 they swim for hours and hours together,

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.120
 and they get their tails intertwined,

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.160
 and they go snout to snout.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.240
 And they spin around, and they do this incredible dance.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.680
 But another thing they do is when they're in the flirting period,

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.640
 they meet up every morning, and they hang out together

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.600
 for a couple of hours.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.320
 And then they part ways again.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.840
 They date each other.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.440
 I know.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.760
 It's so sweet.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.560
 And so they do this sort of pre-dawn dance

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560
 where they meet up.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.200
 They do that.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.440
 And then once they're ready, on like the fourth or fifth date,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.720
 or whenever you think is appropriate,

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.320
 then they do the full eight hour corp chip dance,

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.960
 the ends in pregnancy.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.560
 And that's--

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.160
 You see, Andy, this is how you tell a story about animal mating.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.160
 Yeah.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.600
 There's no food we can go to now.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.440
 Does the sea horse then die?

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:07.320
 And then they just punches it in their head until the eggs come out?

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:07.960
 It's--

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.720
 Yep.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.800
 That's the romantic climate.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800
 Right.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.680
 Sorry.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.600
 I didn't think it was interesting.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.520
 And I realized it's just horrible.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.800
 I'm sorry.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.840
 David Attenborough doesn't get this shit, does he?

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.160
 Necro is David Attenborough.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.680
 He picks his targets carefully.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.320
 We need to wrap up shortly.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.800
 We need to get in the van and leave this town.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.920
 Thank you for listening to the last episode.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920
 That's such a big surprise.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.800
 You guys have anything before we do?

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.000
 I can give you some names of frogs.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.880
 Great.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.920
 I read a list of all the names of all the frogs.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.920
 Andrew, Billy, Bobby.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.280
 Well, Andrew's a fish as we've established our name.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.520
 So there is the demonic poison frog.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.640
 They all have amazing names.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.320
 The hole in the head frog.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.040
 The brilliant thigh to poison frog.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.680
 And the Pobblebunk.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.760
 Pobblebunk.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.560
 Pobblebunk.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.760
 You have to say it like that.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.080
 That's appropriate, because someone had a frog in their throat

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.280
 as they named that animal.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.120
 All right, let's wrap up, guys.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.920
 OK, that's it.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.960
 That is all of our facts.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.480
 Thank you so much for listening to us.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.320
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.520
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.240
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.880
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.840
 Andy, please just don't contact him this way.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.800
 James.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.000
 That's James Harkin.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.080
 Ed Shazinski.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.040
 You can email podcast@QI.com.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.540
 Yep.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.720
 Or you can go to his jet ski.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.480
 You want to say you're there, don't you?

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.320
 No.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.200
 I'm immediately setting myself to private.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.800
 You can get our group account, which is at no such thing,

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800
 or you can go to our website.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.320
 No such thing is a fish.com.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.560
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.120
 And we also have a link to our book, which is now out,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.800
 which we're about to give a copy away to one of the members

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800
 of our audience who sent us in a fact.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.680
 And that fact, Anna, you have it.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.200
 Yes.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.400
 This fact is from Hannah Winterborn, who I think is in here somewhere.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.480
 Yes.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.480
 And this fact-- this is the fact that--

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.360
 Oh, the six of her.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.040
 This is the fact that British Army soldiers

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.360
 can wear the same underwear for three months straight, apparently.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.280
 And that is because it's antibacterial underwear, I believe.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.680
 And Hannah, who is here tonight, has worn this underwear for three

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.800
 months straight.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.800
 Wow.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.040
 That's really exciting.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.560
 Yeah.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.040
 Cool.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.560
 OK.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.400
 Well, yeah, we'll give you a book after the show.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.320
 Guys, thank you so much for being here tonight.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.160
 We hope you had fun.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.120
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:54.800
 See you then.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.800
 Goodbye.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.720
 [APPLAUSE]

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.020
 (upbeat music)

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:16.020
