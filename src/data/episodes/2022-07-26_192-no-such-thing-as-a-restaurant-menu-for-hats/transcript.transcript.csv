00:00:07,00:00:08,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
00:00:08,00:00:11,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:11,00:00:22,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:22,00:00:24,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:24,00:00:27,"This week, coming to you from the Glee Comedy Club in Cardiff."
00:00:27,00:00:30,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:30,00:00:32,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:32,00:00:35,"I am sitting here with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:35,00:00:36,and James Harkin.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:39,00:00:42,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:44,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:44,00:00:47,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:47,00:00:49,"OK, my fact this week is the oldest surviving"
00:00:49,00:00:52,"Soty puppet has just been bought to auction,"
00:00:52,00:00:55,and it was bought by Soty.
00:00:55,00:00:55,No.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Yeah?
00:00:56,00:00:58,"It was by the new guy, Richard Cadal,"
00:00:58,00:01:01,who's in charge of Soty at the moment.
00:01:01,00:01:04,"And whenever he bitted for it, he bitted it with Soty"
00:01:04,00:01:05,on his hands.
00:01:05,00:01:07,[APPLAUSE]
00:01:07,00:01:09,Wow.
00:01:09,00:01:10,That is great.
00:01:10,00:01:11,That's very cool.
00:01:11,00:01:13,So it's like Soty's emancipated himself.
00:01:13,00:01:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:16,00:01:16,Yeah.
00:01:16,00:01:17,Cool.
00:01:17,00:01:19,It's actually more like he sold himself back in dislavery.
00:01:19,00:01:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:22,00:01:22,Yeah.
00:01:22,00:01:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:24,00:01:26,"OK, get this."
00:01:26,00:01:27,"When they were on television together,"
00:01:27,00:01:30,Soty and Sue were never allowed to touch each other
00:01:30,00:01:32,in case things got too steamy.
00:01:32,00:01:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:36,00:01:38,"Yeah, so this is true."
00:01:38,00:01:41,"Soty and Sue, when Sue was introduced,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,there was a worry at the BBC that this
00:01:43,00:01:46,would introduce a sexual element and too much sexual tension
00:01:46,00:01:47,to the show.
00:01:47,00:01:50,And so she was only allowed in on sufferance
00:01:50,00:01:53,"that she never touched him, that he never touched her."
00:01:53,00:01:54,"They didn't speak to her beforehand,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,"and go, this is what you're not allowed to do, right?"
00:01:56,00:01:57,"Well, no."
00:01:57,00:01:59,"For international listeners, they both love puppet bears."
00:01:59,00:02:02,So it's easy to enforce.
00:02:02,00:02:06,And but actually Sue is a panda and pandas aren't bears.
00:02:06,00:02:08,Oh.
00:02:08,00:02:10,So there's a certain amount of interspecies
00:02:10,00:02:11,stuff going on there.
00:02:11,00:02:12,"Yeah, true."
00:02:12,00:02:13,Wow.
00:02:13,00:02:14,"Oh, no."
00:02:14,00:02:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:15,00:02:21,Wasn't she voiced by the wife of the person who did Soty?
00:02:21,00:02:24,"Yeah, Harry Colbert's wife played her."
00:02:24,00:02:27,"But then Harry Colbert's son took over the role,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,but his mum stayed playing the girlfriend.
00:02:30,00:02:31,Ah.
00:02:31,00:02:33,But it was an unusual setup.
00:02:33,00:02:34,Yeah.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"I think he actually replaced her, didn't he?"
00:02:36,00:02:40,His daughter replaced her quite quickly and said
00:02:40,00:02:43,"he didn't want her playing Sue anymore, maybe because of that."
00:02:43,00:02:44,"And also apparently, the person who took over"
00:02:44,00:02:47,"playing Sue said she was getting a little bit older,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,and she was finding it a little bit harder
00:02:49,00:02:52,"to re-descript, watch a monitor, work a puppet,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,and smoke a cigarette all at the same time.
00:02:54,00:02:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:57,00:03:00,Very uncomfortable for parole to Sue.
00:03:00,00:03:02,But this is the sort of worry about sexuality.
00:03:02,00:03:04,This was in 1964 to say no.
00:03:04,00:03:08,And they got so serious that the directed general of the BBC
00:03:08,00:03:10,intervened personally.
00:03:10,00:03:12,This went all the way to his desk.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"And he called the host in and said, I'm allowing it."
00:03:14,00:03:16,"But then two years later, they canceled the show."
00:03:16,00:03:18,And it went to YGV who didn't care.
00:03:18,00:03:20,It's been all right.
00:03:20,00:03:22,Did they touch each other?
00:03:22,00:03:23,"Well, then they went to Channel 4"
00:03:23,00:03:25,and it got extremely stinking.
00:03:25,00:03:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:28,00:03:32,Sue did actually want to have a pregnancy scare.
00:03:32,00:03:32,No.
00:03:32,00:03:33,"Yeah, it's part of the bitch."
00:03:33,00:03:34,She had a pregnancy scare.
00:03:34,00:03:36,Although it turned out she just had a cushion up her jumper.
00:03:36,00:03:40,"So, simpler times."
00:03:40,00:03:42,Imagine if you went to your gynecologist
00:03:42,00:03:45,"and said, I think I'm pregnant."
00:03:45,00:03:48,"And they go, no, you just got a cushion up there."
00:03:48,00:03:49,And you're a man.
00:03:49,00:03:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:51,00:03:54,What the fuck you do?
00:03:54,00:03:55,And then I took my feet out of the stir-ups
00:03:55,00:03:56,and I bid him good day.
00:03:56,00:03:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:59,00:04:03,But the team America guys got in trouble for their puppet
00:04:03,00:04:04,"sex scene properly, didn't they?"
00:04:04,00:04:05,They did.
00:04:05,00:04:08,So they had to re-edit the sex scene in Team America
00:04:08,00:04:11,nine times and re-submit it to the Motion Picture
00:04:11,00:04:14,"Association of America to say, is this OK yet?"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"Because the film association was saying,"
00:04:17,00:04:20,we can only classify Team America as--
00:04:20,00:04:23,"in America, I think it's NC 17, which is the rating that means,"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"like, no under 18-year-olds are allowed to go and see it."
00:04:26,00:04:29,"Just because these two puppets have sex, which--"
00:04:29,00:04:32,"and as I think Tray Parker pointed out,"
00:04:32,00:04:33,it doesn't make any sense.
00:04:33,00:04:36,Our characters are made of wood and have no genitals.
00:04:36,00:04:37,And yet--
00:04:37,00:04:40,It is a very rude scene.
00:04:40,00:04:41,"Yes, yeah."
00:04:41,00:04:43,Did you have to go with your mom?
00:04:43,00:04:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:47,00:04:50,This is like watching the Suttisha all over again.
00:04:50,00:04:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:53,00:04:57,Mighty Morphine Power Rangers got banned in Malaysia
00:04:57,00:05:01,because the Morphine bits sounded too much like Morphine.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"They were famously sluggish, weren't they?"
00:05:03,00:05:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:07,00:05:11,"Yeah, but you guys in the UK, you had Ninja Turtles, which"
00:05:11,00:05:12,is what I call them.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"Sorry, who?"
00:05:13,00:05:14,I'd never heard of it.
00:05:14,00:05:15,"Yeah, you called them hero turtles, didn't you?"
00:05:15,00:05:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:16,00:05:19,"Yeah, because they thought that you weren't able to deal"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"with nunchucks, basically."
00:05:21,00:05:23,"But they still have the nunchucks, didn't they?"
00:05:23,00:05:24,"No, no, they're not just saying--"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"I looked at a picture today, because I had no idea"
00:05:26,00:05:27,that this was the case.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"So Michelangelo, instead of having nunchucks--"
00:05:28,00:05:29,This is a feather.
00:05:29,00:05:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:31,00:05:33,"Oh, he just has a nice cup of tea."
00:05:33,00:05:33,Yeah.
00:05:33,00:05:38,"He's like, that guy looks like he needs a hug from the hug turtle."
00:05:38,00:05:39,"Yeah, it was--"
00:05:39,00:05:41,"He had-- no, he had still."
00:05:41,00:05:42,"I mean, really, they did that."
00:05:42,00:05:43,"Yeah, really, they changed it."
00:05:43,00:05:44,So he just had a grappling hook.
00:05:44,00:05:48,So my memory is him having nunchucks.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"No, in the opening scenes, there's"
00:05:50,00:05:51,a couple of seconds of nunchucks.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"And then if you look at the pictures, maybe it was only"
00:05:53,00:05:54,for a few episodes.
00:05:54,00:05:55,Maybe they brought it back.
00:05:55,00:05:57,But he has a grappling hook.
00:05:57,00:05:59,"Well, you can do a lot more damage with a grappling hook."
00:05:59,00:05:59,I know.
00:05:59,00:06:00,It's got spikes on the eggs.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Yeah.
00:06:01,00:06:02,Yeah.
00:06:02,00:06:04,"So Pepper Pick, this year, I think,"
00:06:04,00:06:07,"got quite recently, was banned in Australia."
00:06:07,00:06:09,Just one episode it was.
00:06:09,00:06:10,And it was the episode where Pepper
00:06:10,00:06:13,is taught that spiders are very small and can't hurt you.
00:06:13,00:06:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:16,00:06:18,"It gets loads of complaints, Pepper Pick, though,"
00:06:18,00:06:20,for being a bad influence on children.
00:06:20,00:06:22,And some of the things that parents
00:06:22,00:06:24,"have said about it, of Ritten and said,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,a father wrote in to the people who make it
00:06:26,00:06:28,and complained that his son has started splashing
00:06:28,00:06:31,in muddy puddles on the way to school.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"I know, but no, apparently that's bad."
00:06:33,00:06:35,"And another mother wrote in and said,"
00:06:35,00:06:36,she'd asked her daughter what she wanted for breakfast.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"And she said, chocolate cake."
00:06:38,00:06:40,"And another said, his son has stopped"
00:06:40,00:06:43,eating cucumber and tomato sandwiches.
00:06:43,00:06:46,And these just all sound like terrible parents.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:48,"Hey, we need to move on to our second fact."
00:06:48,00:06:50,It is time for fact number two.
00:06:50,00:06:52,And that is Andy.
00:06:52,00:06:57,My fact is that mountains are partly shaped by salmon.
00:06:57,00:06:57,Wow.
00:06:57,00:06:58,What?
00:06:58,00:06:58,Wow.
00:06:58,00:06:59,This is true.
00:06:59,00:07:00,This is absolutely true.
00:07:00,00:07:04,Salmon play a significant role in the shape of mountains.
00:07:04,00:07:07,"That happens over a long period of time, obviously."
00:07:07,00:07:10,But so salmon swim upstream to spawn.
00:07:10,00:07:13,"And then as they do so, the female kind of stirs up the mud"
00:07:13,00:07:15,and the sediment at the bottom when she's
00:07:15,00:07:17,making a kind of nest in the water.
00:07:17,00:07:20,And that means that the river channels erode faster.
00:07:20,00:07:22,And it means they erode downstream faster.
00:07:22,00:07:24,"And over hundreds of thousands of years,"
00:07:24,00:07:28,a landscape where salmon spawn could be up to 30% lower
00:07:28,00:07:30,than a landscape with no salmon.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Wow.
00:07:31,00:07:33,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:07:33,00:07:35,There's a thing that one of our friends at QI
00:07:35,00:07:38,"mentioned the other day, actually, which is that the paint"
00:07:38,00:07:40,of painting mountains white.
00:07:40,00:07:42,So this is--
00:07:42,00:07:44,"Yeah, have you seen this in the Peruvian Mountains?"
00:07:44,00:07:46,This is a guy who's going around painting them white
00:07:46,00:07:48,to combat global warming.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"Not just one guy with one paintbrush, though."
00:07:50,00:07:51,He's.
00:07:51,00:07:54,"It's pretty much, slightly, in to begin with."
00:07:54,00:07:55,"I mean, because to begin with, everyone"
00:07:55,00:07:56,thought he was nuts.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"And he said, because all the ice and all the snow"
00:07:59,00:07:59,had gone off it.
00:07:59,00:08:01,And so it just was bare mountains.
00:08:01,00:08:03,"And he went, oh, I'll save the ice and snow"
00:08:03,00:08:06,by painting it white again to look like it has ice and snow.
00:08:06,00:08:07,But that's not why he's doing it.
00:08:07,00:08:08,That's not why he's doing it.
00:08:08,00:08:09,He's not creating the article there.
00:08:09,00:08:12,"OK, so he's not going, oh, I'll save these mountains"
00:08:12,00:08:15,from not being covered in the snow by making it look like they've
00:08:15,00:08:17,got snow and then maybe that'll convince them.
00:08:17,00:08:21,It's so that it keeps the surface cooler.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"Because if you've got a white surface,"
00:08:23,00:08:24,then it keeps the color of the heat.
00:08:24,00:08:27,"Yeah, so I think the average cut that's"
00:08:27,00:08:30,covered in white paint is like 17 degrees cooler
00:08:30,00:08:32,than if it's got black paint.
00:08:32,00:08:34,And then the idea is that the ice will stay on it for longer.
00:08:34,00:08:37,And then it can give everyone water in nearby villages
00:08:37,00:08:38,and keep the vegetation growing.
00:08:38,00:08:39,"Yeah, mountain painting."
00:08:39,00:08:43,Didn't you win a Nobel Prize for that?
00:08:43,00:08:44,I don't think so.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Maybe you did read the article then.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"No, I don't think you should have, though, shouldn't I?"
00:08:48,00:08:51,"You've got some kind of a, maybe like a Nickelodeon or kids"
00:08:51,00:08:54,"of water, so I don't know."
00:08:54,00:08:55,Yeah.
00:08:55,00:08:58,"And the tallest mountain in Colorado, OK,"
00:08:58,00:09:00,is called Mount Elbert.
00:09:00,00:09:05,And it's next to another mountain called Mount Massive.
00:09:05,00:09:10,And Mount Massive is 12 feet shorter than Mount Elbert.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"OK, I think they have the third and fourth"
00:09:12,00:09:14,or the second and third biggest mountains
00:09:14,00:09:15,in the whole of America.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"But the next to each other, and a lot of--"
00:09:18,00:09:20,there are a lot of fans of Mount Massive.
00:09:20,00:09:23,And what they like to do is go to the top of Mount Massive
00:09:23,00:09:24,"and put a big pile of stones on the top,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,so that it becomes the biggest.
00:09:27,00:09:29,But then Mount Elbert has quite a few fans as well.
00:09:29,00:09:33,And they keep going up and taking all the rocks down.
00:09:33,00:09:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:36,00:09:36,Wow.
00:09:36,00:09:38,That's so Colorado.
00:09:38,00:09:39,It's boring.
00:09:39,00:09:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:42,00:09:43,Here's another fact.
00:09:43,00:09:47,Mountains can suffer from tired mountains in Rome.
00:09:47,00:09:49,So this has happened around the world in lots of different places.
00:09:49,00:09:52,"But at the moment, it's happening in North Korea."
00:09:52,00:09:55,And they have a mountain called Mount Mantap.
00:09:55,00:09:57,"And due to all of the nuclear tests there,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,"basically, there's a load of geological damage."
00:09:59,00:10:02,And the rock mass inside the mountain
00:10:02,00:10:04,just isn't kind of integral anymore.
00:10:04,00:10:06,Did you say it's called Mount Mantap?
00:10:06,00:10:08,"Yes, I've heard that."
00:10:08,00:10:11,"That sounds like how Kim Jong-un refers to his penis, doesn't it?"
00:10:11,00:10:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:13,00:10:16,"God, this is a mountain."
00:10:16,00:10:19,This may be think about other syndromes that might be.
00:10:19,00:10:22,"So this is tired mountains in syndrome,"
00:10:22,00:10:23,just a few that I found online.
00:10:23,00:10:28,"Floppy trunk syndrome, that's a thing that elephants can get."
00:10:28,00:10:30,"These are all very sad, by the way."
00:10:30,00:10:32,This is not like a happy flop.
00:10:32,00:10:34,This is not like that.
00:10:34,00:10:38,Which is another Kim Jong-un drive term.
00:10:38,00:10:41,"Bazaar Kalama syndrome, that's a thing."
00:10:41,00:10:44,"If you human raise a llama, they go crazy,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,and they attack the humans.
00:10:47,00:10:50,Wobbly hedgehog syndrome.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"Again, it's not a very nice thing if you're the hedgehog,"
00:10:52,00:10:56,but it is if you're reading the words on the internet.
00:10:56,00:10:59,And there was a guy who was diagnosed with chronic lightness
00:10:59,00:11:00,syndrome.
00:11:00,00:11:01,This is incredible.
00:11:01,00:11:03,"This is a real thing, apparently."
00:11:03,00:11:05,"It's a bit like ADHD, and it means that he can't properly"
00:11:05,00:11:07,gauge how long things take.
00:11:07,00:11:09,So he's late for absolutely everything.
00:11:09,00:11:10,OK.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"Come on, I've used this excuse so many times."
00:11:13,00:11:14,"No, it is a real thing."
00:11:14,00:11:16,"It's very funny you mentioned that, James."
00:11:16,00:11:17,Because I found out about chronic lightness syndrome.
00:11:17,00:11:19,"And it's weird, he'd listen here, and I've invited him"
00:11:19,00:11:20,to be at the show tonight.
00:11:20,00:11:21,And I just want to--
00:11:21,00:11:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:23,00:11:25,Are you--
00:11:25,00:11:26,"Oh, full of shame."
00:11:26,00:11:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:28,00:11:33,"In 1945, when people first started testing atomic weapons,"
00:11:33,00:11:36,Kodak found out about it before anyone else.
00:11:36,00:11:37,"And I had no idea about this, but this"
00:11:37,00:11:40,"is because film, camera film, is really"
00:11:40,00:11:42,sensitive to radiation.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"And they got loads of complaints from people in America,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,"saying, our camera film is fogging up."
00:11:46,00:11:48,And so a scientist who was working at Kodak
00:11:48,00:11:50,looked into it and did some 1940s googling.
00:11:50,00:11:57,And he deduced that they must be testing atomic bombs.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"And he stayed quiet for a little while,"
00:11:58,00:11:59,"because he thought, I better not just"
00:11:59,00:12:01,"won't get involved with that, that's fine."
00:12:01,00:12:02,And they put some atomic proof filters
00:12:02,00:12:05,"around their factory, and they just didn't mention it."
00:12:05,00:12:07,"And then eventually, they kept on damaging their films."
00:12:07,00:12:08,It's radiation.
00:12:08,00:12:12,And so they tried to sue the American government in 1951
00:12:12,00:12:14,for doing all these nuclear tests that was the worst thing
00:12:14,00:12:15,"about them, apparently, was that they"
00:12:15,00:12:17,were screwing up Kodak's film.
00:12:17,00:12:21,And the American government agreed
00:12:21,00:12:24,to give them all the maps and the schedule of all future
00:12:24,00:12:26,nuclear tests on the grounds that they didn't talk
00:12:26,00:12:29,about this to anyone anymore.
00:12:29,00:12:30,Yeah.
00:12:30,00:12:31,That's amazing.
00:12:31,00:12:31,I know.
00:12:31,00:12:35,"Just quickly, Kodak and mountains, this is an interesting connection."
00:12:35,00:12:40,"When George Mallory and Irving, the original, supposedly"
00:12:40,00:12:42,almost might have made it to the top of Everest
00:12:42,00:12:45,"before Hillary did, when Mallory and Irving disappeared,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"and it's been a big mystery ever since,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,"did they make it or did they not, there's"
00:12:49,00:12:51,been hunts that have been going on to find them.
00:12:51,00:12:52,And the one thing they're looking for
00:12:52,00:12:55,"is the camera that was had by Mallory and Irving,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,"because, because of the cold nature of the mountain,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,the film is preserved.
00:12:59,00:13:02,"And Kodak say, if we find the camera,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,we'll still be able to develop it at this point.
00:13:04,00:13:06,So they do searches.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"So one thing was when Hillary went to the top of the mountain,"
00:13:09,00:13:12,he did a very basic search for Mallory.
00:13:12,00:13:13,"He was looking for two things, the camera."
00:13:13,00:13:15,And the other thing was a picture of Mallory's wife.
00:13:15,00:13:18,Because Mallory said he was going to bury a picture
00:13:18,00:13:20,of his wife on the top of the mountain.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"So Hillary got up there, didn't find it."
00:13:22,00:13:26,"Then in 1989, people went out to look for the camera."
00:13:26,00:13:29,"And suddenly, perfectly preserved on the snow,"
00:13:29,00:13:32,"was Mallory, the body of Mallory."
00:13:32,00:13:33,And they found everything on him.
00:13:33,00:13:37,"They had his goggles, perfect condition, his ice pick."
00:13:37,00:13:38,They had his wallet.
00:13:38,00:13:39,They had everything.
00:13:39,00:13:42,The one thing they didn't have was his camera.
00:13:42,00:13:43,So it must be on Irving.
00:13:43,00:13:45,But they were so close to finding out.
00:13:45,00:13:46,And check this out.
00:13:46,00:13:48,Another thing they didn't find inside the wallet
00:13:48,00:13:49,was the picture of his wife.
00:13:49,00:13:50,Ooh.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"And then again, if I was dying, I would quickly throw away"
00:13:53,00:13:54,the photo of my wife.
00:13:54,00:13:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:57,00:14:00,So you wouldn't be looking at it with your dying breath.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"You'd be like, oh, fuck."
00:14:02,00:14:05,I'd want her to be remembered as the wife
00:14:05,00:14:07,of the man who first climbed Everest.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"And to successfully do that, sometimes,"
00:14:09,00:14:11,you have to cut some strings.
00:14:11,00:14:13,I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"She would have understood, I think."
00:14:15,00:14:17,You could have understood.
00:14:17,00:14:21,Do you know how tall the smallest unclimbed mountain in Japan
00:14:21,00:14:22,is?
00:14:22,00:14:23,I'll give you a clue.
00:14:23,00:14:24,It's in Osaka.
00:14:24,00:14:29,"I'm going to go for 12,000 feet."
00:14:29,00:14:30,"OK, that's high."
00:14:30,00:14:31,That's high.
00:14:31,00:14:32,I only work in meters.
00:14:32,00:14:37,"So I'm going to go for the tallest, unclimbed--"
00:14:37,00:14:37,Smallest.
00:14:37,00:14:39,Smallest.
00:14:39,00:14:40,Unclimbed.
00:14:40,00:14:42,The smallest mountain that no one has bothered to climb.
00:14:42,00:14:44,This is the most ridiculous question I've ever been asked.
00:14:44,00:14:46,"And I'm going to go for 1,600 meters."
00:14:46,00:14:46,OK.
00:14:46,00:14:48,I'm going to go for 4 meters.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:52,Hasn't grasped the metric system yet.
00:14:52,00:14:54,So what's 4 meters in feet?
00:14:54,00:14:56,"That's, like, 3 feet."
00:14:56,00:15:00,"No, no, no."
00:15:00,00:15:03,"No, like, a meter is longer than a foot."
00:15:03,00:15:05,"OK, that's got big feet."
00:15:05,00:15:07,"You know, when they say that, they're with big feet."
00:15:07,00:15:08,Big man's up.
00:15:08,00:15:15,It's almost like no one cares how tall they're.
00:15:15,00:15:19,"No, amazingly, Dan is almost absolutely bang on."
00:15:19,00:15:20,It is 15 feet above sea level.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"Oh, yes."
00:15:22,00:15:23,It's not a mountain.
00:15:23,00:15:24,It is a mountain.
00:15:24,00:15:26,The Japanese geospatial information authority
00:15:26,00:15:29,are very relaxed about what qualifies as a mountain.
00:15:29,00:15:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:31,00:15:33,I'm not kidding.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"Yeah, it's called Mount Tempo."
00:15:34,00:15:36,"And it's basically a pile of dirt,"
00:15:36,00:15:39,which was dredged out of the harbor in 1832
00:15:39,00:15:41,to allow vessels to sail in to the port.
00:15:41,00:15:44,And that is not even the highest point in the park.
00:15:44,00:15:45,It is in.
00:15:45,00:15:48,But the Japan's national tourist organization
00:15:48,00:15:51,have said that they do have a mountain rescue unit in case anyone
00:15:51,00:15:52,gets lost on the slopes.
00:15:52,00:15:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:55,00:15:56,"OK, shall we move on to fact number three?"
00:15:56,00:15:58,"OK, it's time for fact number three."
00:15:58,00:15:59,And that is Shuzanski.
00:15:59,00:16:04,"Yes, my fact is that when King George VI married the Queen Mother,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,the Archbishop of Canterbury wouldn't
00:16:06,00:16:08,let them broadcast the ceremony on the radio
00:16:08,00:16:12,in case people listened in the pub without removing their hats.
00:16:12,00:16:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:15,00:16:17,This was the BBC really wanted to broadcast it.
00:16:17,00:16:21,"It was 1923, and BBC had just set up this radio station."
00:16:21,00:16:22,They wanted something to broadcast the Royal Wedding
00:16:22,00:16:24,scene like the right thing.
00:16:24,00:16:25,He wasn't George VI at the time.
00:16:25,00:16:27,This was before he was King.
00:16:27,00:16:28,But they asked if they could broadcast it.
00:16:28,00:16:31,"And the Abbey chapter said, absolutely not."
00:16:31,00:16:34,"Vito, because people all listened in the pubs and worse,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,they may listen with their hats still on.
00:16:36,00:16:39,And it might be received in an irreverent manner.
00:16:39,00:16:42,So did people just used to just keep wearing their hats
00:16:42,00:16:43,"inside the pub, generally?"
00:16:43,00:16:44,No.
00:16:44,00:16:49,"I think just like if you are really a complete layabout,"
00:16:49,00:16:52,"if you're a really a bad person, if you're a drunk,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,then you might forget to take your hats off.
00:16:54,00:16:56,You might be wearing a baseball cap or something.
00:16:56,00:16:59,"What, in 1923?"
00:16:59,00:17:00,I don't know if it was baseball caps.
00:17:00,00:17:01,You had a mind on it.
00:17:01,00:17:04,But what I'm saying is that people do sometimes wear hats
00:17:04,00:17:06,"in the pubs, so."
00:17:06,00:17:07,But this was the thing.
00:17:07,00:17:09,So you were supposed to take off your hat inside.
00:17:09,00:17:10,If you were doing something like watching
00:17:10,00:17:12,a very respectable ceremony.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"Well, you were always supposed to really weren't you?"
00:17:14,00:17:17,Was it not an etiquette of always taking your hat off
00:17:17,00:17:18,when you were inside?
00:17:18,00:17:19,I was reading something etiquette.
00:17:19,00:17:21,And it was actually really complicated.
00:17:21,00:17:22,"So I think on some inside moments,"
00:17:22,00:17:24,"you wouldn't like, for instance,"
00:17:24,00:17:25,you see pictures of bars in the 1920s
00:17:25,00:17:27,where men kept their hats on.
00:17:27,00:17:28,And that was apparently because they
00:17:28,00:17:32,couldn't rely on them not being stolen if they took them off.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"I think the idea is, if you're in a place"
00:17:34,00:17:37,which is akin to a public street--
00:17:37,00:17:40,"so it could be a corridor, or it could be"
00:17:40,00:17:41,a lobby of a hotel.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"And I guess you could probably say that pub is a bit like that, maybe."
00:17:44,00:17:45,"So what, then you can leave your hat on?"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Yeah, OK."
00:17:47,00:17:48,And where's the song came from?
00:17:48,00:17:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Yeah, that's the chorus."
00:17:52,00:17:55,But then there's a big log list of things that you're allowed to hear.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"If you're in a corridor, if you're in a lobby,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,anywhere like a public street--
00:18:01,00:18:02,Cool.
00:18:02,00:18:03,You don't know that song.
00:18:03,00:18:04,Do you?
00:18:04,00:18:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:08,00:18:10,And then had to take off their hats
00:18:10,00:18:13,when the National Anthem was being played in the olden days in Etica.
00:18:13,00:18:16,And it's really supposed to now as well.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"But women are allowed to, unless it's a unisex hat."
00:18:19,00:18:20,So if it's a hat that any one--
00:18:20,00:18:22,"I mean, anyone can wear any hats."
00:18:22,00:18:23,I'm not judging.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"But let's say it is a baseball cap that is a unisex hat,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,then the women have to take the hat off as well.
00:18:28,00:18:30,"So it's the hat, which is--"
00:18:30,00:18:33,"God, I can really imagine panicking as to what gender my hat was."
00:18:33,00:18:37,What the right thing to do was at that moment.
00:18:37,00:18:41,I found a really amazing thing about George VI.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"In 1926, and as far as I can tell,"
00:18:44,00:18:47,he's the only British monarch to have done this.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"So this is prior to him being a king,"
00:18:50,00:18:56,he competed in the doubles at Wimbledon as a tennis player.
00:18:56,00:18:56,Really?
00:18:56,00:18:57,I don't know that.
00:18:57,00:18:58,How did he do?
00:18:58,00:19:01,He lost the first match and he was out for the rest of it.
00:19:01,00:19:03,But that's extraordinary.
00:19:03,00:19:07,That suddenly the prince of the UK was suddenly there.
00:19:07,00:19:08,"Yeah, great."
00:19:08,00:19:11,Imagine Prince Charles at the snooker.
00:19:11,00:19:12,"You'd watch, wouldn't you?"
00:19:12,00:19:15,"Well, we have that one who rides the horses."
00:19:15,00:19:17,Zara Phillips.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:18,00:19:19,They all ride the horses.
00:19:19,00:19:20,"Yeah, he was professionally."
00:19:20,00:19:22,He was very young.
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Yeah, he was amazing."
00:19:23,00:19:26,So they got married only after him
00:19:26,00:19:29,trying really hard to marry the Queen Mother for a long time.
00:19:29,00:19:32,And he'd proposed twice in the past.
00:19:32,00:19:34,It's so weird that she was known as the Queen Mother
00:19:34,00:19:39,all the way through her life.
00:19:39,00:19:40,It's like she was destined for the job.
00:19:40,00:19:43,She should have known.
00:19:43,00:19:46,"He was called Albert at the time, weirdly."
00:19:46,00:19:48,And she was called Elizabeth at the time.
00:19:48,00:19:49,And she refused his first proposal
00:19:49,00:19:51,because we kind of all remember the Queen Mother.
00:19:51,00:19:53,She was quite a spunky character.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"And at the time, she refused because she didn't want to feel"
00:19:56,00:19:59,"like she wasn't able to be free to think, speak, and act"
00:19:59,00:20:01,as she felt she ought to.
00:20:01,00:20:03,"So he said, I'm only going to marry this woman."
00:20:03,00:20:04,I really love her.
00:20:04,00:20:08,"So his mum, Albert's mum, invited her up to her house"
00:20:08,00:20:10,"and had some really, really sharp words"
00:20:10,00:20:12,"being like, OK, well, you have to marry my son."
00:20:12,00:20:13,And then he proposed again.
00:20:13,00:20:14,"And she said, no, again."
00:20:14,00:20:16,So good on her.
00:20:16,00:20:20,"And then he beat her down the third time, like metaphorically."
00:20:20,00:20:22,She was the first commoner to be
00:20:22,00:20:24,"married to a member of the royal family for 200 years,"
00:20:24,00:20:25,I think.
00:20:25,00:20:26,Wow.
00:20:26,00:20:27,But she was a commoner.
00:20:27,00:20:30,But she was the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore.
00:20:30,00:20:32,And she grew up in Glam's castle.
00:20:32,00:20:33,Yeah.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"So it's stretching commoner a little bit, isn't it?"
00:20:36,00:20:37,And this is a really good fact.
00:20:37,00:20:39,I liked about George the Sith.
00:20:39,00:20:43,"During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947,"
00:20:43,00:20:45,he technically was at war with himself
00:20:45,00:20:47,because he was the monarch of both those places.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"Oh, wow."
00:20:48,00:20:50,Amazing.
00:20:50,00:20:50,So no judge.
00:20:50,00:20:52,Why are you hitting yourself?
00:20:52,00:20:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:54,00:20:55,And here's another fact.
00:20:55,00:20:59,"When he died, there were more than 300,000 people"
00:20:59,00:21:01,who queued up to see his body.
00:21:01,00:21:05,And that is just about the same as a population of Cardiff.
00:21:05,00:21:06,Wow.
00:21:06,00:21:07,Why did they all go down to do that?
00:21:07,00:21:11,You've got like a weird connection to them.
00:21:11,00:21:14,Didn't have much entertainment on here.
00:21:14,00:21:21,"Next week at the Glee Club, the body of King George, let's say."
00:21:21,00:21:25,"Just on royal weddings, there was a thing where Prince William"
00:21:25,00:21:29,"and Kate Middleton got married, another quite posh commoner"
00:21:29,00:21:30,marrying into the royal family.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"But when they got married, that was in 2011, I think,"
00:21:33,00:21:35,New Zealand released an official stamp
00:21:35,00:21:37,"to commemorate the occasion, except what they did"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"was they released the official stamp, which had a perforation"
00:21:40,00:21:43,down the middle between William and Kate.
00:21:43,00:21:48,So you could tear them apart and get two stamps.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"God, I swear."
00:21:49,00:21:51,Did they do that on purpose?
00:21:51,00:21:51,I don't know.
00:21:51,00:21:53,Are they apologised?
00:21:53,00:21:53,Wow.
00:21:53,00:21:55,I can't look at whether it would have been better or worse
00:21:55,00:21:58,for the perforation to go horizontally and cut their heads off.
00:21:58,00:22:02,They made their own choice.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"This year, it was Pippa Middleton's wedding, wasn't it?"
00:22:05,00:22:07,"And in our book, we have a little bit about that."
00:22:07,00:22:11,600 people were invited to Pippa Middleton's wedding.
00:22:11,00:22:14,300 guests and 300 members of the public
00:22:14,00:22:19,who were allowed to stand in a pen outside the venue.
00:22:19,00:22:21,Did they have a trough at the very least
00:22:21,00:22:24,"or a nose bag each, maybe?"
00:22:24,00:22:25,What was the--
00:22:25,00:22:27,"Well, they didn't say exactly why it was."
00:22:27,00:22:29,"Well, I guess, officially, it was kind of just"
00:22:29,00:22:32,so that the local village can kind of be part of it or whatever.
00:22:32,00:22:34,But a lot of people thought that maybe it
00:22:34,00:22:36,was to stop the paparazzi game there or whatever
00:22:36,00:22:38,because there's so many people.
00:22:38,00:22:39,And no one really knows.
00:22:39,00:22:39,But it was crazy.
00:22:39,00:22:42,"There were more than 20,000 Caterpays."
00:22:42,00:22:43,"20,000."
00:22:43,00:22:45,It might have been there.
00:22:45,00:22:49,"There would have been 10,000 fewer within five minutes."
00:22:49,00:22:52,So some world weddings in the past have gone really badly.
00:22:52,00:22:54,And they're really fun to read about.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"So George IV, for instance, he met his future wife,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,"Caroline at Brunswick, in 1795."
00:22:59,00:23:00,And it was the age when it was just arranged.
00:23:00,00:23:02,She was not flown over.
00:23:02,00:23:04,She was brought over to the UK.
00:23:04,00:23:08,"And at the moment he set eyes on her, his first words were,"
00:23:08,00:23:08,I am not well.
00:23:08,00:23:11,Get me a glass of brandy.
00:23:11,00:23:13,And he proceeded to spend the next 24 hours
00:23:13,00:23:16,in a drunken stupor and the wedding night
00:23:16,00:23:18,lying on the floor in a drunken stupor.
00:23:18,00:23:20,He arrived late to that wedding
00:23:20,00:23:22,and stumbled up the aisle completely drunk.
00:23:22,00:23:24,And then he refused to say any of his vows
00:23:24,00:23:27,until his father ordered him to behave himself.
00:23:27,00:23:29,And they separated quite soon after that.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Wow.
00:23:30,00:23:33,"I read that he only got married because parliament said,"
00:23:33,00:23:36,"we will pay off your debts, but only if you marry this woman."
00:23:36,00:23:36,Yeah.
00:23:36,00:23:38,So that's the sole motivation he had.
00:23:38,00:23:40,He seems like the kind of person who would have racked up
00:23:40,00:23:41,"a lot of debts, doesn't he?"
00:23:41,00:23:41,Yeah.
00:23:41,00:23:43,And I think did he stare at his mistress
00:23:43,00:23:45,who was in the front row throughout the ceremony?
00:23:45,00:23:46,I don't know.
00:23:46,00:23:47,Poor woman.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:50,So there was another one in 1736.
00:23:50,00:23:53,There was a German princess Augusta arrived in London.
00:23:53,00:23:54,She was 17 years old.
00:23:54,00:23:57,"And she had to marry the heir to the throne who was Frederick,"
00:23:57,00:23:58,who didn't end up becoming king.
00:23:58,00:24:01,"But she was told by her mum, look, they all speak German"
00:24:01,00:24:02,"there, it's fine, because she spoke no English."
00:24:02,00:24:05,"She got there, nobody spoke any German."
00:24:05,00:24:06,She didn't speak any English.
00:24:06,00:24:08,She was absolutely terrified.
00:24:08,00:24:09,She was ushered down the aisle.
00:24:09,00:24:10,She was sobbing.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"She was clinging to her mum's coattails apparently,"
00:24:12,00:24:13,"saying, please don't make me do this."
00:24:13,00:24:15,"The groom of Frederick, apparently,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,just shouted the vows in her ear
00:24:17,00:24:20,that she had to repeat verbatim.
00:24:20,00:24:21,"And then immediately after that, she"
00:24:21,00:24:23,vomited all down her dress and all over the skirt
00:24:23,00:24:26,of her new mother-in-law.
00:24:26,00:24:27,And that was the start of what turned out
00:24:27,00:24:31,"to be quite a happy marriage, actually."
00:24:31,00:24:33,"Oh, we have to move on shortly."
00:24:33,00:24:35,If you guys have anything before we do--
00:24:35,00:24:36,"oh, I've got one thing."
00:24:36,00:24:39,"The movie, ""The King's Speech,"" that was about George's"
00:24:39,00:24:39,thick.
00:24:39,00:24:42,He had a stutter.
00:24:42,00:24:45,Did you deliberately?
00:24:45,00:24:46,It just came out as I did it.
00:24:46,00:24:49,Are you auditioning for the sequel?
00:24:49,00:24:54,So Colin Firth played him in the movie.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"And in order to do it, obviously,"
00:24:56,00:24:58,he taught himself to do a stutter for the movie.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"Then the movie finished, and Colin Firth found himself"
00:25:01,00:25:03,not being able to get rid of the stutter.
00:25:03,00:25:07,So then he himself had to be treated for an artificially
00:25:07,00:25:09,manufactured stutter.
00:25:09,00:25:10,Isn't that great?
00:25:10,00:25:11,No way.
00:25:11,00:25:14,Way.
00:25:14,00:25:16,I love that on the dance Wikipedia.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"If it ever existed, you'd look for the citation"
00:25:18,00:25:20,"at the bottom, or just a row of numbers."
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Way, way, way."
00:25:21,00:25:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:24,00:25:29,"I've also got quite nice hat, little thing."
00:25:29,00:25:33,"So the politeness of the British with the hat back in the day,"
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Michael Bond passed away this year,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,who was the author of Paddington Bear.
00:25:37,00:25:39,And Paddington Bear was largely based on his father.
00:25:39,00:25:42,And his father apparently was so polite and nice
00:25:42,00:25:44,"that when he used to go swimming,"
00:25:44,00:25:46,"he would wear into the ocean, his trunks,"
00:25:46,00:25:49,"and also his hat, just in case he passed someone"
00:25:49,00:25:53,"as he was swimming, so he could say, oh, good day to you."
00:25:53,00:25:56,"And if his hat to them, is that lovely?"
00:25:56,00:25:56,Yeah.
00:25:56,00:25:59,"Did you know that on a hat etiquette,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,"the reason we have cloakrooms today,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"where you put your hat and your coat in a cloakroom,"
00:26:03,00:26:05,is because of hats in the olden days.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"So when everyone was wearing hats up until the early 1900s,"
00:26:08,00:26:11,they took up half the space in restaurants.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Because, as we said earlier, men"
00:26:13,00:26:14,had to take off their top hats when they went inside
00:26:14,00:26:15,"into a restaurant, for instance."
00:26:15,00:26:18,"But then you didn't want to leave it under the table,"
00:26:18,00:26:19,because it couldn't really fit.
00:26:19,00:26:21,So it would take up a second chair.
00:26:21,00:26:26,"And there was a guy, this guy called AJ Liebling,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"at one point said, you know, a restaurant's"
00:26:28,00:26:33,of 50% occupied by hats who don't eat anything.
00:26:33,00:26:35,We should really infer that cloakroom to store these.
00:26:35,00:26:36,And that's what I like.
00:26:36,00:26:38,I'd be lovely if there was a smaller hat table
00:26:38,00:26:42,"with, you know, and a hat's menu."
00:26:42,00:26:46,"Right, well, they all got to hang out together."
00:26:46,00:26:48,"OK, should we move on to our final fact?"
00:26:48,00:26:50,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:26:50,00:26:52,And that is my fact.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"My fact this week is that the Brazilian frog, known"
00:26:55,00:26:59,"as the Pumpkin Toadlet, has a mating call"
00:26:59,00:27:01,"that can be heard by every animal out there,"
00:27:01,00:27:04,except for one other Pumpkin Toadlets.
00:27:04,00:27:10,It turns out they're deaf.
00:27:10,00:27:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:14,00:27:16,They do these croaks to get their attention.
00:27:16,00:27:18,And they keep getting eaten.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"They're probably going, why am I exposing myself so much?"
00:27:21,00:27:24,And it turns out it must be an evolutionary thing
00:27:24,00:27:25,where they did used to be able to hear.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"And somewhere along the line, they went deaf,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,the entire species.
00:27:29,00:27:31,I think they're subspecies within the Pumpkin Toadlet.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"So there's two species, specifically, that are deaf."
00:27:34,00:27:37,"And what they think is that when they're doing the call,"
00:27:37,00:27:41,"the way it moves their neck, another Pumpkin Toadlet,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,female Pumpkin Toadlet sees the moves of the shakes
00:27:44,00:27:45,or whatever of the toad.
00:27:45,00:27:48,"And they're like, that looks like he might be saying something."
00:27:48,00:27:49,I have no idea.
00:27:49,00:27:53,"But it looks hot, so I'll go over."
00:27:53,00:27:56,But what usually would happen in evolution purposes
00:27:56,00:27:58,is that you would lose the call because you would
00:27:58,00:27:59,protect yourself from predators.
00:27:59,00:28:00,But they haven't.
00:28:00,00:28:02,And it's the first case that we've ever
00:28:02,00:28:06,found of an animal that hasn't lost the call
00:28:06,00:28:09,when it's redundant and exposes it to predators.
00:28:09,00:28:10,But it will be getting there presumably.
00:28:10,00:28:12,We're always surprised when we find animals
00:28:12,00:28:15,that haven't evolved into this perfect being.
00:28:15,00:28:17,But presumably in a few million years it's there.
00:28:17,00:28:20,We're just in the ship phase.
00:28:20,00:28:21,"Yeah, you're right."
00:28:21,00:28:22,We're in the learning phase.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"When you're in the ship phase, you do often die out."
00:28:24,00:28:25,"You get extinct, don't you?"
00:28:25,00:28:28,"Yeah, that is a risk for the toadlet."
00:28:28,00:28:31,Apparently they do little waves as well.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Yeah.
00:28:32,00:28:35,Like this.
00:28:35,00:28:37,"Well, I can understand why the females come aflocking."
00:28:37,00:28:40,LAUGHTER
00:28:40,00:28:43,"I must have it, that is a great podcast material, is it?"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:45,00:28:46,Well James was doing is.
00:28:46,00:28:49,He was making a gesture that made it seem like he was trying
00:28:49,00:28:50,"to, like, work out somebody's height."
00:28:50,00:28:53,"It's like, you have a child and you're going,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,"is that four-foot, five-foot, four-point-five?"
00:28:55,00:28:58,"Yeah, that's what he was like, four metres, three metres,"
00:28:58,00:29:00,or so.
00:29:00,00:29:00,Five or six metres.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"Five or six metres, OK."
00:29:02,00:29:07,"Yeah, so, unfortunately, for the frog, it happens to be the case"
00:29:07,00:29:09,"that, and it's like a bright orange colour."
00:29:09,00:29:11,"Yeah, they're really tiny, aren't they?"
00:29:11,00:29:11,They're really tiny.
00:29:11,00:29:13,I like the size of your thumbnail almost.
00:29:13,00:29:14,They're really super small.
00:29:14,00:29:18,"Yeah, and their call is quite soft as a result."
00:29:18,00:29:20,But they still can be heard by the predators.
00:29:20,00:29:23,But they are incredibly toxic.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"So if they do get eaten, they might end up"
00:29:25,00:29:27,killing the predator anyway.
00:29:27,00:29:30,So they're probably just actually just being really cocky.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"And they're just going, hey, I'm here, I'm here, what are you going to do?"
00:29:33,00:29:36,"What are you going to do, nothing?"
00:29:36,00:29:38,Do you know that there's a type of frog called a cocky frog?
00:29:38,00:29:41,"No, really?"
00:29:41,00:29:44,It's in-- I can't remember where they're from.
00:29:44,00:29:47,"They're from an island somewhere, but they're now on Hawaii,"
00:29:47,00:29:51,"which is also an island, but it's different islands where they're from."
00:29:51,00:29:53,"But they're on Hawaii, and they make a hell of a racket."
00:29:53,00:29:55,"They're really, really loud."
00:29:55,00:29:57,And the load of people in Hawaii are really hastiness
00:29:57,00:30:00,because it keeps them awake at night when they're mating.
00:30:00,00:30:04,Just get loads of horny frogs just making loads and loads of lies.
00:30:04,00:30:06,That's like there's something called the--
00:30:06,00:30:11,I thought I was looking at other sounds that animals could make.
00:30:11,00:30:14,"And I was wondering, do fish make mating calls?"
00:30:14,00:30:16,And they make really loud ones.
00:30:16,00:30:20,"So there's a fish called the plainfish midshipman fish,"
00:30:20,00:30:21,which is in the Toadfish family.
00:30:21,00:30:23,So it's got Toad relations.
00:30:23,00:30:27,And it hums to attract mates.
00:30:27,00:30:30,"So it makes its hum which sounds like a guitar amplifier,"
00:30:30,00:30:34,or it sounds like a flock of bees.
00:30:34,00:30:35,"-Flock of bees. -Sure, a flock of bees."
00:30:35,00:30:37,Yeah.
00:30:37,00:30:41,And it turns out that they make so much noise
00:30:41,00:30:44,that they live in California and they're constant complaints
00:30:44,00:30:46,"to the police for the noise that they make,"
00:30:46,00:30:47,because they're disrupting people's sleep
00:30:47,00:30:49,and drowning out people's conversations.
00:30:49,00:30:52,And they growl and they grunt as well to keep out intruders.
00:30:52,00:30:54,And they didn't know what it was for a long time.
00:30:54,00:30:55,"So people were calling the police saying,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,"""Someone's keeping me awake all night."""
00:30:57,00:30:58,And it's them.
00:30:58,00:31:02,And the person who eventually found out about this weird noise
00:31:02,00:31:06,"that they make as a researcher called Andrew Bass,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,"B-A-Double-S, which is the first case"
00:31:09,00:31:12,of double nominative determinism I've ever found.
00:31:12,00:31:14,-As in-- -Double.
00:31:14,00:31:15,It's a fish.
00:31:15,00:31:17,And it's the bassy noise that the fish make.
00:31:17,00:31:22,"Oh, I thought there was a fish species called Andrew."
00:31:22,00:31:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:25,00:31:27,That makes more sense.
00:31:27,00:31:29,-The Andrew fish. -Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:32,Did you guys know some frogs call so much
00:31:32,00:31:36,"and so vociferously for a mate that, once they've got a mate,"
00:31:36,00:31:40,they're too tired to follow through and have sex with the female.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"The female arrives and they say, ""I'm sorry, I can't."
00:31:42,00:31:44,"""I'm no good to you now."""
00:31:44,00:31:45,"They lose loads of weight, don't they?"
00:31:45,00:31:46,They can't eat.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"They can't sleep, and they're so weak that they've just"
00:31:48,00:31:50,a floppy mess.
00:31:50,00:31:50,And it feels like--
00:31:50,00:31:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:53,00:31:54,Everyone's had a night like that.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"I mean, that is it."
00:31:56,00:31:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:58,00:31:59,I've never done it.
00:31:59,00:32:00,I've found the really cool one.
00:32:00,00:32:02,There's a frog in Taiwan.
00:32:02,00:32:06,"It's an urban city frog, and it does a mating call,"
00:32:06,00:32:09,but it's worked out how to make their mating call better.
00:32:09,00:32:13,"It goes to storm drains, and it uses it as a megaphone."
00:32:13,00:32:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:14,00:32:16,So it gets to the top of a storm drain.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"And it literally, it's just whatever it's you're,"
00:32:18,00:32:20,"""I'm super horny."""
00:32:20,00:32:24,"""Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey."""
00:32:24,00:32:28,And they found that the female frog goes to the edge
00:32:28,00:32:30,"of the storm drain, so it works for them."
00:32:30,00:32:32,But do the females know that it's not--
00:32:32,00:32:34,because it must sound like a massive frog.
00:32:34,00:32:35,"Oh, that sound like a super frog."
00:32:35,00:32:38,"It must, you're right, yeah."
00:32:38,00:32:40,Do you know the biggest frog that's ever lived
00:32:40,00:32:44,is about the size of a beach ball and it at dinosaurs?
00:32:44,00:32:44,Wow.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"It's not like T-Rex's, though."
00:32:46,00:32:50,"No, like baby dinosaurs, you know."
00:32:50,00:32:54,"So the comment told the Latin name for that is Bufo, Bufo."
00:32:54,00:32:58,"And this frog, it was known as-- or is known as Bielza Bufo."
00:32:58,00:33:00,"Oh, hi."
00:33:00,00:33:01,"That's his official name, as well."
00:33:01,00:33:03,That's not--
00:33:03,00:33:04,but it was the size of a beach ball.
00:33:04,00:33:07,And they worked out how strong it's bite was.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"And its bite was about 2,200 newtons,"
00:33:10,00:33:13,which is about the same as a lion's bite.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Wow.
00:33:14,00:33:14,Wow.
00:33:14,00:33:15,Yeah.
00:33:15,00:33:18,Do you know how porcupines attract to each other?
00:33:18,00:33:20,Or how male porcupines attract females?
00:33:20,00:33:21,This really bite was.
00:33:21,00:33:24,Really awesome spikes.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"It is actually-- well, it's in a way, yeah."
00:33:26,00:33:29,"They stand up on their hind legs,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,"and they move, they shuffle towards the female just"
00:33:32,00:33:35,with their penis fully erect.
00:33:35,00:33:37,And that's how they do it.
00:33:37,00:33:43,It's a sun uncompromisingly direct flirting method.
00:33:43,00:33:44,It's good.
00:33:44,00:33:45,There's no question over what he's after.
00:33:45,00:33:47,We like that.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"Or sometimes, and you can see pictures of this, they hop."
00:33:50,00:33:53,"They lift one arm, their front paw off the ground,"
00:33:53,00:33:56,"and they hop on the other one, whilst clutching their crotch"
00:33:56,00:33:58,with the one that's off the ground.
00:33:58,00:33:59,They do.
00:33:59,00:34:01,And this attracts the women.
00:34:01,00:34:04,"And if the woman or the female porcupine likes that enough,"
00:34:04,00:34:07,"the crotch dance, then she'll allow them to have sex with her."
00:34:07,00:34:09,"And usually, if she's not up for sex,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"then a male porcupine can't get in there,"
00:34:11,00:34:12,because she's so spiny.
00:34:12,00:34:13,And then the way you know that she likes you
00:34:13,00:34:17,"is she puts her tail up, and it covers all of her spines,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,which means that you will not be impaled.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"She's a very good, very good system."
00:34:22,00:34:25,Do you know that some frogs change color
00:34:25,00:34:27,to make their life easier when they're in orgies?
00:34:27,00:34:31,Really?
00:34:31,00:34:35,"If you've been in orgie, your life doesn't get much easier, does it?"
00:34:35,00:34:36,"Yeah, you've made it."
00:34:36,00:34:37,You're fine.
00:34:37,00:34:39,"Well, it does, if you're a frog, you see,"
00:34:39,00:34:42,because there's a lot of them.
00:34:42,00:34:44,There's loads and loads of frogs all get together.
00:34:44,00:34:47,Might be a particularly nice puddle or something.
00:34:47,00:34:48,But these are in some species.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"They all get together, and they'll just"
00:34:50,00:34:51,shag anything.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Male, female, tennis ball, whatever."
00:34:54,00:34:57,There are some pictures of tennis balls
00:34:57,00:34:58,"landing into this orgie of frogs,"
00:34:58,00:35:01,and all the frogs just go for it.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Really?
00:35:02,00:35:03,What happens to the match?
00:35:03,00:35:10,"The charge is six going down, you know?"
00:35:10,00:35:11,So that's what happens.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"And, but there are some species."
00:35:13,00:35:16,"A lot of these species who do this kind of group mating,"
00:35:16,00:35:19,"they also change colour, and no one was really sure why,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"and it seems that the reason they do it is to say,"
00:35:21,00:35:24,"""I'm a man, or I'm a woman, you know, keep off me."""
00:35:24,00:35:27,"Oh, wow, it's like when you go to those parties at union,"
00:35:27,00:35:28,you have to wear a traffic light colour depending
00:35:28,00:35:29,on how available you are.
00:35:29,00:35:31,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:31,00:35:33,"But the problem is, at the start, they're all green."
00:35:33,00:35:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:36,00:35:38,Have you heard of this thing?
00:35:38,00:35:41,"So when frogs have, it's called explosive breeding, isn't it?"
00:35:41,00:35:42,"They do this thing called explosive breeding,"
00:35:42,00:35:44,"which is instead of mating all year round,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"they have one session, you know, every year."
00:35:46,00:35:48,And all the mating happens then.
00:35:48,00:35:52,"So some females, because there's a horrible crush of bodies,"
00:35:52,00:35:56,some females are crushed to death in these things.
00:35:56,00:36:00,"Unfortunately, it's already unfortunate, yeah."
00:36:00,00:36:02,"Let me rephrase it, put the column in a different place."
00:36:02,00:36:04,"Some females are crushed to death, unfortunately."
00:36:04,00:36:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:07,00:36:12,"But the male frogs will still mate with them successfully,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,successfully.
00:36:14,00:36:16,"OK, so it's all about the mating habits"
00:36:16,00:36:19,"outside the body, because the female produces eggs."
00:36:19,00:36:22,"The male produces sperm, and they meet outside the body."
00:36:22,00:36:25,So the males sort of go up and squeeze the females.
00:36:25,00:36:26,"Oh, God."
00:36:26,00:36:27,And they squeeze.
00:36:27,00:36:28,"It's just nature, guys."
00:36:28,00:36:30,It's just nature.
00:36:30,00:36:32,It can't be gross if it's just nature.
00:36:32,00:36:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:34,00:36:36,"No, that's not a defense for anything."
00:36:36,00:36:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:40,00:36:41,"Yeah, and they squeeze the eggs out of the body"
00:36:41,00:36:42,and then mate with them.
00:36:42,00:36:43,Amazing.
00:36:43,00:36:44,"Yeah, it is messed up."
00:36:44,00:36:45,I'm sorry.
00:36:45,00:36:48,"So Seahawks, look at that."
00:36:48,00:36:49,Don't boo the frogs.
00:36:49,00:36:50,It's their instincts.
00:36:50,00:36:52,I don't think the frogs are the ones being booed.
00:36:52,00:36:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:56,00:36:57,He's pointing at me.
00:36:57,00:36:58,"I don't, mate."
00:36:58,00:37:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:02,00:37:05,"So Seahawks has the best mating rituals,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,"the best way of attracting each other,"
00:37:07,00:37:09,"which people might have seen, but it's so great."
00:37:09,00:37:12,So they change colour as well to attract mates.
00:37:12,00:37:15,"And then when they've got something they think they fancy,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,"they swim for hours and hours together,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,"and they get their tails intertwined,"
00:37:19,00:37:20,and they go snout to snout.
00:37:20,00:37:23,"And they spin around, and they do this incredible dance."
00:37:23,00:37:25,"But another thing they do is when they're in the flirting period,"
00:37:25,00:37:28,"they meet up every morning, and they hang out together"
00:37:28,00:37:29,for a couple of hours.
00:37:29,00:37:31,And then they part ways again.
00:37:31,00:37:32,They date each other.
00:37:32,00:37:33,I know.
00:37:33,00:37:34,It's so sweet.
00:37:34,00:37:36,And so they do this sort of pre-dawn dance
00:37:36,00:37:37,where they meet up.
00:37:37,00:37:38,They do that.
00:37:38,00:37:41,"And then once they're ready, on like the fourth or fifth date,"
00:37:41,00:37:43,"or whenever you think is appropriate,"
00:37:43,00:37:47,"then they do the full eight hour corp chip dance,"
00:37:47,00:37:48,the ends in pregnancy.
00:37:48,00:37:49,And that's--
00:37:49,00:37:53,"You see, Andy, this is how you tell a story about animal mating."
00:37:53,00:37:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:55,00:37:56,Yeah.
00:37:56,00:37:57,There's no food we can go to now.
00:37:57,00:38:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:00,00:38:02,Does the sea horse then die?
00:38:02,00:38:07,And then they just punches it in their head until the eggs come out?
00:38:07,00:38:07,It's--
00:38:07,00:38:08,Yep.
00:38:08,00:38:10,That's the romantic climate.
00:38:10,00:38:11,Right.
00:38:11,00:38:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:13,00:38:14,Sorry.
00:38:14,00:38:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:16,00:38:19,I didn't think it was interesting.
00:38:19,00:38:21,And I realized it's just horrible.
00:38:21,00:38:22,I'm sorry.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"David Attenborough doesn't get this shit, does he?"
00:38:26,00:38:30,Necro is David Attenborough.
00:38:30,00:38:31,He picks his targets carefully.
00:38:31,00:38:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:34,00:38:38,We need to wrap up shortly.
00:38:38,00:38:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:41,00:38:42,We need to get in the van and leave this town.
00:38:42,00:38:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:44,00:38:46,Thank you for listening to the last episode.
00:38:46,00:38:47,That's such a big surprise.
00:38:47,00:38:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:50,00:38:52,You guys have anything before we do?
00:38:52,00:38:55,I can give you some names of frogs.
00:38:55,00:38:55,Great.
00:38:55,00:38:57,I read a list of all the names of all the frogs.
00:38:57,00:38:59,"Andrew, Billy, Bobby."
00:38:59,00:39:03,"Well, Andrew's a fish as we've established our name."
00:39:03,00:39:06,So there is the demonic poison frog.
00:39:06,00:39:07,They all have amazing names.
00:39:07,00:39:10,The hole in the head frog.
00:39:10,00:39:14,The brilliant thigh to poison frog.
00:39:14,00:39:15,And the Pobblebunk.
00:39:15,00:39:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:18,00:39:19,Pobblebunk.
00:39:19,00:39:20,Pobblebunk.
00:39:20,00:39:21,You have to say it like that.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"That's appropriate, because someone had a frog in their throat"
00:39:24,00:39:25,as they named that animal.
00:39:25,00:39:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:27,00:39:29,"All right, let's wrap up, guys."
00:39:29,00:39:29,"OK, that's it."
00:39:29,00:39:30,That is all of our facts.
00:39:30,00:39:33,Thank you so much for listening to us.
00:39:33,00:39:35,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:39:52,00:39:54,"You want to say you're there, don't you?"
00:39:54,00:39:55,No.
00:39:55,00:39:57,I'm immediately setting myself to private.
00:39:57,00:40:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:00,00:40:02,"You can get our group account, which is at no such thing,"
00:40:02,00:40:03,or you can go to our website.
00:40:03,00:40:05,No such thing is a fish.com.
00:40:05,00:40:07,We have all of our previous episodes up there.
00:40:07,00:40:10,"And we also have a link to our book, which is now out,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,which we're about to give a copy away to one of the members
00:40:12,00:40:14,of our audience who sent us in a fact.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"And that fact, Anna, you have it."
00:40:16,00:40:17,Yes.
00:40:17,00:40:21,"This fact is from Hannah Winterborn, who I think is in here somewhere."
00:40:21,00:40:22,Yes.
00:40:22,00:40:24,And this fact-- this is the fact that--
00:40:24,00:40:25,"Oh, the six of her."
00:40:25,00:40:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:28,00:40:30,This is the fact that British Army soldiers
00:40:30,00:40:34,"can wear the same underwear for three months straight, apparently."
00:40:34,00:40:37,"And that is because it's antibacterial underwear, I believe."
00:40:37,00:40:42,"And Hannah, who is here tonight, has worn this underwear for three"
00:40:42,00:40:43,months straight.
00:40:43,00:40:44,Wow.
00:40:44,00:40:46,That's really exciting.
00:40:46,00:40:46,Yeah.
00:40:46,00:40:47,Cool.
00:40:47,00:40:47,OK.
00:40:47,00:40:49,"Well, yeah, we'll give you a book after the show."
00:40:49,00:40:51,"Guys, thank you so much for being here tonight."
00:40:51,00:40:52,We hope you had fun.
00:40:52,00:40:54,We'll be back again next week with another episode.
00:40:54,00:40:54,See you then.
