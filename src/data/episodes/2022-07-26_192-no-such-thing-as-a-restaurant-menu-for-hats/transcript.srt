00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,320
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,280
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,920
 This week, coming to you from the Glee Comedy Club in Cardiff.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,840
 [APPLAUSE]

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,600
 I am sitting here with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,640
 and James Harkin.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,920
 And in no particular order, here we go.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160
 Starting with you, James.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,680
 OK, my fact this week is the oldest surviving

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,120
 Soty puppet has just been bought to auction,

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,440
 and it was bought by Soty.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,960
 No.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,680
 Yeah?

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,960
 It was by the new guy, Richard Cadal,

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,200
 who's in charge of Soty at the moment.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,480
 And whenever he bitted for it, he bitted it with Soty

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,240
 on his hands.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,360
 [APPLAUSE]

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,840
 Wow.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,680
 That is great.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,720
 That's very cool.

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,840
 So it's like Soty's emancipated himself.

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
 [LAUGHTER]

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,880
 Yeah.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,480
 Cool.

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,720
 It's actually more like he sold himself back in dislavery.

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,000
 [LAUGHTER]

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,760
 Yeah.

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,760
 [LAUGHTER]

38
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,240
 OK, get this.

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,520
 When they were on television together,

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,080
 Soty and Sue were never allowed to touch each other

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,480
 in case things got too steamy.

42
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,480
 [LAUGHTER]

43
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,680
 Yeah, so this is true.

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,000
 Soty and Sue, when Sue was introduced,

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,560
 there was a worry at the BBC that this

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,960
 would introduce a sexual element and too much sexual tension

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,760
 to the show.

48
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,400
 And so she was only allowed in on sufferance

49
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,160
 that she never touched him, that he never touched her.

50
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,720
 They didn't speak to her beforehand,

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,760
 and go, this is what you're not allowed to do, right?

52
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,360
 Well, no.

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
 For international listeners, they both love puppet bears.

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,280
 So it's easy to enforce.

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,400
 And but actually Sue is a panda and pandas aren't bears.

56
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,160
 Oh.

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,680
 So there's a certain amount of interspecies

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,640
 stuff going on there.

59
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,440
 Yeah, true.

60
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
 Wow.

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,720
 Oh, no.

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,760
 [LAUGHTER]

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,640
 Wasn't she voiced by the wife of the person who did Soty?

64
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,400
 Yeah, Harry Colbert's wife played her.

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,160
 But then Harry Colbert's son took over the role,

66
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,760
 but his mum stayed playing the girlfriend.

67
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,720
 Ah.

68
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
 But it was an unusual setup.

69
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,440
 Yeah.

70
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,040
 I think he actually replaced her, didn't he?

71
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,160
 His daughter replaced her quite quickly and said

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,080
 he didn't want her playing Sue anymore, maybe because of that.

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,880
 And also apparently, the person who took over

74
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,600
 playing Sue said she was getting a little bit older,

75
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,360
 and she was finding it a little bit harder

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
 to re-descript, watch a monitor, work a puppet,

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,560
 and smoke a cigarette all at the same time.

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,640
 [LAUGHTER]

79
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,320
 Very uncomfortable for parole to Sue.

80
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,880
 But this is the sort of worry about sexuality.

81
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,760
 This was in 1964 to say no.

82
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,600
 And they got so serious that the directed general of the BBC

83
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,640
 intervened personally.

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,160
 This went all the way to his desk.

85
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,640
 And he called the host in and said, I'm allowing it.

86
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,600
 But then two years later, they canceled the show.

87
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
 And it went to YGV who didn't care.

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
 It's been all right.

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,160
 Did they touch each other?

90
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,480
 Well, then they went to Channel 4

91
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,080
 and it got extremely stinking.

92
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,360
 [LAUGHTER]

93
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,400
 Sue did actually want to have a pregnancy scare.

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,920
 No.

95
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
 Yeah, it's part of the bitch.

96
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,720
 She had a pregnancy scare.

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 Although it turned out she just had a cushion up her jumper.

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,840
 So, simpler times.

99
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
 Imagine if you went to your gynecologist

100
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,200
 and said, I think I'm pregnant.

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,160
 And they go, no, you just got a cushion up there.

102
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,040
 And you're a man.

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,520
 [LAUGHTER]

104
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,280
 What the fuck you do?

105
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,800
 And then I took my feet out of the stir-ups

106
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,680
 and I bid him good day.

107
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,880
 [LAUGHTER]

108
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,080
 But the team America guys got in trouble for their puppet

109
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,440
 sex scene properly, didn't they?

110
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
 They did.

111
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,560
 So they had to re-edit the sex scene in Team America

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,080
 nine times and re-submit it to the Motion Picture

113
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,640
 Association of America to say, is this OK yet?

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
 Because the film association was saying,

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
 we can only classify Team America as--

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,960
 in America, I think it's NC 17, which is the rating that means,

117
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
 like, no under 18-year-olds are allowed to go and see it.

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,800
 Just because these two puppets have sex, which--

119
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
 and as I think Tray Parker pointed out,

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
 it doesn't make any sense.

121
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
 Our characters are made of wood and have no genitals.

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,440
 And yet--

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,400
 It is a very rude scene.

124
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,920
 Yes, yeah.

125
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,680
 Did you have to go with your mom?

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,400
 [LAUGHTER]

127
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,320
 This is like watching the Suttisha all over again.

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,760
 [LAUGHTER]

129
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,000
 Mighty Morphine Power Rangers got banned in Malaysia

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,880
 because the Morphine bits sounded too much like Morphine.

131
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,440
 They were famously sluggish, weren't they?

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,600
 [LAUGHTER]

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
 Yeah, but you guys in the UK, you had Ninja Turtles, which

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,720
 is what I call them.

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,440
 Sorry, who?

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
 I'd never heard of it.

137
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
 Yeah, you called them hero turtles, didn't you?

138
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,120
 Oh, yeah.

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,480
 Yeah, because they thought that you weren't able to deal

140
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,520
 with nunchucks, basically.

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,400
 But they still have the nunchucks, didn't they?

142
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
 No, no, they're not just saying--

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
 I looked at a picture today, because I had no idea

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,000
 that this was the case.

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,840
 So Michelangelo, instead of having nunchucks--

146
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
 This is a feather.

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,560
 [LAUGHTER]

148
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
 Oh, he just has a nice cup of tea.

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,640
 Yeah.

150
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,360
 He's like, that guy looks like he needs a hug from the hug turtle.

151
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
 Yeah, it was--

152
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,120
 He had-- no, he had still.

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
 I mean, really, they did that.

154
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,480
 Yeah, really, they changed it.

155
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
 So he just had a grappling hook.

156
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,520
 So my memory is him having nunchucks.

157
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,480
 No, in the opening scenes, there's

158
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,960
 a couple of seconds of nunchucks.

159
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,680
 And then if you look at the pictures, maybe it was only

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
 for a few episodes.

161
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,360
 Maybe they brought it back.

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
 But he has a grappling hook.

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
 Well, you can do a lot more damage with a grappling hook.

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,560
 I know.

165
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,760
 It's got spikes on the eggs.

166
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,280
 Yeah.

167
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,160
 Yeah.

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,760
 So Pepper Pick, this year, I think,

169
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,600
 got quite recently, was banned in Australia.

170
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
 Just one episode it was.

171
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,720
 And it was the episode where Pepper

172
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,880
 is taught that spiders are very small and can't hurt you.

173
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,920
 [LAUGHTER]

174
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,600
 It gets loads of complaints, Pepper Pick, though,

175
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,800
 for being a bad influence on children.

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
 And some of the things that parents

177
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,000
 have said about it, of Ritten and said,

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,200
 a father wrote in to the people who make it

179
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,640
 and complained that his son has started splashing

180
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,280
 in muddy puddles on the way to school.

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,760
 I know, but no, apparently that's bad.

182
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,440
 And another mother wrote in and said,

183
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,960
 she'd asked her daughter what she wanted for breakfast.

184
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
 And she said, chocolate cake.

185
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,320
 And another said, his son has stopped

186
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,240
 eating cucumber and tomato sandwiches.

187
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,400
 And these just all sound like terrible parents.

188
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
 Yeah.

189
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,920
 Hey, we need to move on to our second fact.

190
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,560
 It is time for fact number two.

191
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
 And that is Andy.

192
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,120
 My fact is that mountains are partly shaped by salmon.

193
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,880
 Wow.

194
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,400
 What?

195
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,720
 Wow.

196
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,600
 This is true.

197
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
 This is absolutely true.

198
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,320
 Salmon play a significant role in the shape of mountains.

199
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,200
 That happens over a long period of time, obviously.

200
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,400
 But so salmon swim upstream to spawn.

201
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,760
 And then as they do so, the female kind of stirs up the mud

202
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,520
 and the sediment at the bottom when she's

203
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,480
 making a kind of nest in the water.

204
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,560
 And that means that the river channels erode faster.

205
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,600
 And it means they erode downstream faster.

206
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,360
 And over hundreds of thousands of years,

207
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,800
 a landscape where salmon spawn could be up to 30% lower

208
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
 than a landscape with no salmon.

209
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,240
 Wow.

210
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,360
 Yeah, that's amazing.

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,800
 There's a thing that one of our friends at QI

212
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,600
 mentioned the other day, actually, which is that the paint

213
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,880
 of painting mountains white.

214
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
 So this is--

215
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,360
 Yeah, have you seen this in the Peruvian Mountains?

216
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,960
 This is a guy who's going around painting them white

217
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,840
 to combat global warming.

218
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,760
 Not just one guy with one paintbrush, though.

219
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 He's.

220
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,320
 It's pretty much, slightly, in to begin with.

221
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,400
 I mean, because to begin with, everyone

222
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,320
 thought he was nuts.

223
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,040
 And he said, because all the ice and all the snow

224
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,760
 had gone off it.

225
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,360
 And so it just was bare mountains.

226
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
 And he went, oh, I'll save the ice and snow

227
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 by painting it white again to look like it has ice and snow.

228
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,400
 But that's not why he's doing it.

229
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,240
 That's not why he's doing it.

230
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,480
 He's not creating the article there.

231
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,760
 OK, so he's not going, oh, I'll save these mountains

232
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,040
 from not being covered in the snow by making it look like they've

233
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
 got snow and then maybe that'll convince them.

234
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,440
 It's so that it keeps the surface cooler.

235
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,320
 Because if you've got a white surface,

236
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,840
 then it keeps the color of the heat.

237
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,400
 Yeah, so I think the average cut that's

238
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,640
 covered in white paint is like 17 degrees cooler

239
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,240
 than if it's got black paint.

240
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,640
 And then the idea is that the ice will stay on it for longer.

241
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,200
 And then it can give everyone water in nearby villages

242
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
 and keep the vegetation growing.

243
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,880
 Yeah, mountain painting.

244
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,080
 Didn't you win a Nobel Prize for that?

245
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
 I don't think so.

246
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
 Maybe you did read the article then.

247
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,960
 No, I don't think you should have, though, shouldn't I?

248
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,960
 You've got some kind of a, maybe like a Nickelodeon or kids

249
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,000
 of water, so I don't know.

250
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Yeah.

251
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,200
 And the tallest mountain in Colorado, OK,

252
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,400
 is called Mount Elbert.

253
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,920
 And it's next to another mountain called Mount Massive.

254
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
 And Mount Massive is 12 feet shorter than Mount Elbert.

255
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
 OK, I think they have the third and fourth

256
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
 or the second and third biggest mountains

257
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
 in the whole of America.

258
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,080
 But the next to each other, and a lot of--

259
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,320
 there are a lot of fans of Mount Massive.

260
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,040
 And what they like to do is go to the top of Mount Massive

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
 and put a big pile of stones on the top,

262
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,320
 so that it becomes the biggest.

263
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,800
 But then Mount Elbert has quite a few fans as well.

264
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,000
 And they keep going up and taking all the rocks down.

265
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,160
 [LAUGHTER]

266
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
 Wow.

267
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
 That's so Colorado.

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,160
 It's boring.

269
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,240
 [LAUGHTER]

270
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,040
 Here's another fact.

271
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,280
 Mountains can suffer from tired mountains in Rome.

272
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,920
 So this has happened around the world in lots of different places.

273
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,360
 But at the moment, it's happening in North Korea.

274
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,200
 And they have a mountain called Mount Mantap.

275
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,800
 And due to all of the nuclear tests there,

276
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,880
 basically, there's a load of geological damage.

277
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,400
 And the rock mass inside the mountain

278
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,440
 just isn't kind of integral anymore.

279
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,640
 Did you say it's called Mount Mantap?

280
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,120
 Yes, I've heard that.

281
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,040
 That sounds like how Kim Jong-un refers to his penis, doesn't it?

282
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,080
 [LAUGHTER]

283
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,960
 God, this is a mountain.

284
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
 This may be think about other syndromes that might be.

285
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,280
 So this is tired mountains in syndrome,

286
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
 just a few that I found online.

287
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,000
 Floppy trunk syndrome, that's a thing that elephants can get.

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
 These are all very sad, by the way.

289
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,280
 This is not like a happy flop.

290
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,160
 This is not like that.

291
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,400
 Which is another Kim Jong-un drive term.

292
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,640
 Bazaar Kalama syndrome, that's a thing.

293
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,960
 If you human raise a llama, they go crazy,

294
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,040
 and they attack the humans.

295
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,320
 Wobbly hedgehog syndrome.

296
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,720
 Again, it's not a very nice thing if you're the hedgehog,

297
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,440
 but it is if you're reading the words on the internet.

298
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,040
 And there was a guy who was diagnosed with chronic lightness

299
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
 syndrome.

300
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,720
 This is incredible.

301
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,000
 This is a real thing, apparently.

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,560
 It's a bit like ADHD, and it means that he can't properly

303
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,240
 gauge how long things take.

304
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,040
 So he's late for absolutely everything.

305
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
 OK.

306
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,440
 Come on, I've used this excuse so many times.

307
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,760
 No, it is a real thing.

308
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
 It's very funny you mentioned that, James.

309
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,960
 Because I found out about chronic lightness syndrome.

310
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,720
 And it's weird, he'd listen here, and I've invited him

311
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,920
 to be at the show tonight.

312
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
 And I just want to--

313
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,960
 [LAUGHTER]

314
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,480
 Are you--

315
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,760
 Oh, full of shame.

316
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 [LAUGHTER]

317
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,080
 In 1945, when people first started testing atomic weapons,

318
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,200
 Kodak found out about it before anyone else.

319
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,720
 And I had no idea about this, but this

320
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,200
 is because film, camera film, is really

321
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
 sensitive to radiation.

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,760
 And they got loads of complaints from people in America,

323
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,640
 saying, our camera film is fogging up.

324
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,400
 And so a scientist who was working at Kodak

325
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,960
 looked into it and did some 1940s googling.

326
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,320
 And he deduced that they must be testing atomic bombs.

327
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,960
 And he stayed quiet for a little while,

328
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,840
 because he thought, I better not just

329
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
 won't get involved with that, that's fine.

330
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,760
 And they put some atomic proof filters

331
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,360
 around their factory, and they just didn't mention it.

332
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
 And then eventually, they kept on damaging their films.

333
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,640
 It's radiation.

334
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,400
 And so they tried to sue the American government in 1951

335
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,680
 for doing all these nuclear tests that was the worst thing

336
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
 about them, apparently, was that they

337
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,800
 were screwing up Kodak's film.

338
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,000
 And the American government agreed

339
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,640
 to give them all the maps and the schedule of all future

340
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,920
 nuclear tests on the grounds that they didn't talk

341
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,560
 about this to anyone anymore.

342
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,400
 Yeah.

343
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,120
 That's amazing.

344
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,800
 I know.

345
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,640
 Just quickly, Kodak and mountains, this is an interesting connection.

346
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,320
 When George Mallory and Irving, the original, supposedly

347
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,640
 almost might have made it to the top of Everest

348
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,880
 before Hillary did, when Mallory and Irving disappeared,

349
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,440
 and it's been a big mystery ever since,

350
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,160
 did they make it or did they not, there's

351
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,360
 been hunts that have been going on to find them.

352
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,400
 And the one thing they're looking for

353
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,200
 is the camera that was had by Mallory and Irving,

354
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,960
 because, because of the cold nature of the mountain,

355
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,520
 the film is preserved.

356
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,440
 And Kodak say, if we find the camera,

357
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,960
 we'll still be able to develop it at this point.

358
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
 So they do searches.

359
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,400
 So one thing was when Hillary went to the top of the mountain,

360
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,080
 he did a very basic search for Mallory.

361
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,680
 He was looking for two things, the camera.

362
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,840
 And the other thing was a picture of Mallory's wife.

363
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,760
 Because Mallory said he was going to bury a picture

364
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,840
 of his wife on the top of the mountain.

365
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,800
 So Hillary got up there, didn't find it.

366
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,120
 Then in 1989, people went out to look for the camera.

367
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,640
 And suddenly, perfectly preserved on the snow,

368
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,000
 was Mallory, the body of Mallory.

369
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,640
 And they found everything on him.

370
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,400
 They had his goggles, perfect condition, his ice pick.

371
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,680
 They had his wallet.

372
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
 They had everything.

373
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
 The one thing they didn't have was his camera.

374
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
 So it must be on Irving.

375
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,480
 But they were so close to finding out.

376
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,240
 And check this out.

377
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,360
 Another thing they didn't find inside the wallet

378
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,760
 was the picture of his wife.

379
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
 Ooh.

380
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,720
 And then again, if I was dying, I would quickly throw away

381
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,880
 the photo of my wife.

382
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
 [LAUGHTER]

383
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,360
 So you wouldn't be looking at it with your dying breath.

384
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
 You'd be like, oh, fuck.

385
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,280
 I'd want her to be remembered as the wife

386
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,040
 of the man who first climbed Everest.

387
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,240
 And to successfully do that, sometimes,

388
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,760
 you have to cut some strings.

389
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,240
 I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.

390
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,320
 She would have understood, I think.

391
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,040
 You could have understood.

392
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,240
 Do you know how tall the smallest unclimbed mountain in Japan

393
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,400
 is?

394
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,000
 I'll give you a clue.

395
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
 It's in Osaka.

396
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,240
 I'm going to go for 12,000 feet.

397
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,800
 OK, that's high.

398
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,600
 That's high.

399
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,840
 I only work in meters.

400
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,080
 So I'm going to go for the tallest, unclimbed--

401
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,600
 Smallest.

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,080
 Smallest.

403
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,440
 Unclimbed.

404
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,480
 The smallest mountain that no one has bothered to climb.

405
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,280
 This is the most ridiculous question I've ever been asked.

406
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,320
 And I'm going to go for 1,600 meters.

407
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,840
 OK.

408
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,280
 I'm going to go for 4 meters.

409
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,680
 Yeah.

410
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,360
 Hasn't grasped the metric system yet.

411
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,720
 So what's 4 meters in feet?

412
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,400
 That's, like, 3 feet.

413
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,120
 No, no, no.

414
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,280
 No, like, a meter is longer than a foot.

415
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,760
 OK, that's got big feet.

416
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
 You know, when they say that, they're with big feet.

417
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,600
 Big man's up.

418
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:15,480
 It's almost like no one cares how tall they're.

419
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,040
 No, amazingly, Dan is almost absolutely bang on.

420
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,960
 It is 15 feet above sea level.

421
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,560
 Oh, yes.

422
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,480
 It's not a mountain.

423
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,320
 It is a mountain.

424
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
 The Japanese geospatial information authority

425
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
 are very relaxed about what qualifies as a mountain.

426
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
 [LAUGHTER]

427
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,280
 I'm not kidding.

428
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,760
 Yeah, it's called Mount Tempo.

429
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,360
 And it's basically a pile of dirt,

430
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,160
 which was dredged out of the harbor in 1832

431
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,760
 to allow vessels to sail in to the port.

432
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,160
 And that is not even the highest point in the park.

433
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,640
 It is in.

434
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,640
 But the Japan's national tourist organization

435
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,480
 have said that they do have a mountain rescue unit in case anyone

436
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,680
 gets lost on the slopes.

437
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,000
 [LAUGHTER]

438
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,600
 OK, shall we move on to fact number three?

439
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,080
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

440
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,760
 And that is Shuzanski.

441
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,440
 Yes, my fact is that when King George VI married the Queen Mother,

442
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,240
 the Archbishop of Canterbury wouldn't

443
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,680
 let them broadcast the ceremony on the radio

444
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,040
 in case people listened in the pub without removing their hats.

445
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,240
 [LAUGHTER]

446
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,040
 This was the BBC really wanted to broadcast it.

447
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
 It was 1923, and BBC had just set up this radio station.

448
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,760
 They wanted something to broadcast the Royal Wedding

449
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,120
 scene like the right thing.

450
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,480
 He wasn't George VI at the time.

451
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,360
 This was before he was King.

452
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,920
 But they asked if they could broadcast it.

453
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,080
 And the Abbey chapter said, absolutely not.

454
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,480
 Vito, because people all listened in the pubs and worse,

455
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,840
 they may listen with their hats still on.

456
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,760
 And it might be received in an irreverent manner.

457
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,160
 So did people just used to just keep wearing their hats

458
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,520
 inside the pub, generally?

459
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,240
 No.

460
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,680
 I think just like if you are really a complete layabout,

461
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,720
 if you're a really a bad person, if you're a drunk,

462
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,040
 then you might forget to take your hats off.

463
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,600
 You might be wearing a baseball cap or something.

464
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
 What, in 1923?

465
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,680
 I don't know if it was baseball caps.

466
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,640
 You had a mind on it.

467
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,680
 But what I'm saying is that people do sometimes wear hats

468
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,240
 in the pubs, so.

469
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,160
 But this was the thing.

470
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,120
 So you were supposed to take off your hat inside.

471
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,800
 If you were doing something like watching

472
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,760
 a very respectable ceremony.

473
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,720
 Well, you were always supposed to really weren't you?

474
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,400
 Was it not an etiquette of always taking your hat off

475
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,200
 when you were inside?

476
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,240
 I was reading something etiquette.

477
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,120
 And it was actually really complicated.

478
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,920
 So I think on some inside moments,

479
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,120
 you wouldn't like, for instance,

480
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,960
 you see pictures of bars in the 1920s

481
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,440
 where men kept their hats on.

482
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,720
 And that was apparently because they

483
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
 couldn't rely on them not being stolen if they took them off.

484
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
 I think the idea is, if you're in a place

485
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,400
 which is akin to a public street--

486
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,160
 so it could be a corridor, or it could be

487
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
 a lobby of a hotel.

488
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,600
 And I guess you could probably say that pub is a bit like that, maybe.

489
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,960
 So what, then you can leave your hat on?

490
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,040
 Yeah, OK.

491
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,680
 And where's the song came from?

492
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,880
 [LAUGHTER]

493
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
 Yeah, that's the chorus.

494
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,760
 But then there's a big log list of things that you're allowed to hear.

495
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,720
 If you're in a corridor, if you're in a lobby,

496
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,680
 anywhere like a public street--

497
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
 Cool.

498
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,640
 You don't know that song.

499
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
 Do you?

500
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,040
 [LAUGHTER]

501
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,440
 And then had to take off their hats

502
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,640
 when the National Anthem was being played in the olden days in Etica.

503
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,000
 And it's really supposed to now as well.

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
 But women are allowed to, unless it's a unisex hat.

505
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
 So if it's a hat that any one--

506
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,280
 I mean, anyone can wear any hats.

507
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,680
 I'm not judging.

508
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,680
 But let's say it is a baseball cap that is a unisex hat,

509
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,800
 then the women have to take the hat off as well.

510
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,880
 So it's the hat, which is--

511
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,880
 God, I can really imagine panicking as to what gender my hat was.

512
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,680
 What the right thing to do was at that moment.

513
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,680
 I found a really amazing thing about George VI.

514
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,520
 In 1926, and as far as I can tell,

515
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,560
 he's the only British monarch to have done this.

516
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,640
 So this is prior to him being a king,

517
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,040
 he competed in the doubles at Wimbledon as a tennis player.

518
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,760
 Really?

519
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,600
 I don't know that.

520
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,680
 How did he do?

521
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,920
 He lost the first match and he was out for the rest of it.

522
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,000
 But that's extraordinary.

523
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,960
 That suddenly the prince of the UK was suddenly there.

524
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,440
 Yeah, great.

525
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,560
 Imagine Prince Charles at the snooker.

526
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
 You'd watch, wouldn't you?

527
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,480
 Well, we have that one who rides the horses.

528
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,080
 Zara Phillips.

529
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
 Yeah, exactly.

530
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,480
 They all ride the horses.

531
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,960
 Yeah, he was professionally.

532
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,440
 He was very young.

533
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,960
 Yeah, he was amazing.

534
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,120
 So they got married only after him

535
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,320
 trying really hard to marry the Queen Mother for a long time.

536
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,040
 And he'd proposed twice in the past.

537
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,360
 It's so weird that she was known as the Queen Mother

538
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,120
 all the way through her life.

539
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,640
 It's like she was destined for the job.

540
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,680
 She should have known.

541
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,080
 He was called Albert at the time, weirdly.

542
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,560
 And she was called Elizabeth at the time.

543
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,960
 And she refused his first proposal

544
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,720
 because we kind of all remember the Queen Mother.

545
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,480
 She was quite a spunky character.

546
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,840
 And at the time, she refused because she didn't want to feel

547
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,760
 like she wasn't able to be free to think, speak, and act

548
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
 as she felt she ought to.

549
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,520
 So he said, I'm only going to marry this woman.

550
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,440
 I really love her.

551
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,360
 So his mum, Albert's mum, invited her up to her house

552
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,200
 and had some really, really sharp words

553
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,080
 being like, OK, well, you have to marry my son.

554
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
 And then he proposed again.

555
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,640
 And she said, no, again.

556
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
 So good on her.

557
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,120
 And then he beat her down the third time, like metaphorically.

558
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,240
 She was the first commoner to be

559
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,520
 married to a member of the royal family for 200 years,

560
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,080
 I think.

561
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 Wow.

562
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,120
 But she was a commoner.

563
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,120
 But she was the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore.

564
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,560
 And she grew up in Glam's castle.

565
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,040
 Yeah.

566
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,400
 So it's stretching commoner a little bit, isn't it?

567
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,840
 And this is a really good fact.

568
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
 I liked about George the Sith.

569
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,040
 During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947,

570
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,560
 he technically was at war with himself

571
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
 because he was the monarch of both those places.

572
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
 Oh, wow.

573
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,040
 Amazing.

574
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,840
 So no judge.

575
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,560
 Why are you hitting yourself?

576
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
 [LAUGHTER]

577
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,840
 And here's another fact.

578
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,000
 When he died, there were more than 300,000 people

579
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,440
 who queued up to see his body.

580
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,120
 And that is just about the same as a population of Cardiff.

581
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,200
 Wow.

582
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,840
 Why did they all go down to do that?

583
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,440
 You've got like a weird connection to them.

584
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,480
 Didn't have much entertainment on here.

585
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,760
 Next week at the Glee Club, the body of King George, let's say.

586
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,120
 Just on royal weddings, there was a thing where Prince William

587
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,200
 and Kate Middleton got married, another quite posh commoner

588
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
 marrying into the royal family.

589
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,240
 But when they got married, that was in 2011, I think,

590
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,280
 New Zealand released an official stamp

591
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,560
 to commemorate the occasion, except what they did

592
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,360
 was they released the official stamp, which had a perforation

593
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,360
 down the middle between William and Kate.

594
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,200
 So you could tear them apart and get two stamps.

595
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
 God, I swear.

596
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,120
 Did they do that on purpose?

597
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,880
 I don't know.

598
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,040
 Are they apologised?

599
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,520
 Wow.

600
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,280
 I can't look at whether it would have been better or worse

601
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,160
 for the perforation to go horizontally and cut their heads off.

602
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,560
 They made their own choice.

603
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,160
 This year, it was Pippa Middleton's wedding, wasn't it?

604
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,960
 And in our book, we have a little bit about that.

605
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,480
 600 people were invited to Pippa Middleton's wedding.

606
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,720
 300 guests and 300 members of the public

607
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,320
 who were allowed to stand in a pen outside the venue.

608
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,400
 Did they have a trough at the very least

609
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,000
 or a nose bag each, maybe?

610
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
 What was the--

611
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,360
 Well, they didn't say exactly why it was.

612
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,480
 Well, I guess, officially, it was kind of just

613
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,960
 so that the local village can kind of be part of it or whatever.

614
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,520
 But a lot of people thought that maybe it

615
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,840
 was to stop the paparazzi game there or whatever

616
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,120
 because there's so many people.

617
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,040
 And no one really knows.

618
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,720
 But it was crazy.

619
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,360
 There were more than 20,000 Caterpays.

620
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,960
 20,000.

621
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,240
 It might have been there.

622
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,520
 There would have been 10,000 fewer within five minutes.

623
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,760
 So some world weddings in the past have gone really badly.

624
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,160
 And they're really fun to read about.

625
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,040
 So George IV, for instance, he met his future wife,

626
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
 Caroline at Brunswick, in 1795.

627
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,800
 And it was the age when it was just arranged.

628
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,360
 She was not flown over.

629
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,800
 She was brought over to the UK.

630
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,040
 And at the moment he set eyes on her, his first words were,

631
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,800
 I am not well.

632
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,400
 Get me a glass of brandy.

633
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,600
 And he proceeded to spend the next 24 hours

634
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,040
 in a drunken stupor and the wedding night

635
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,360
 lying on the floor in a drunken stupor.

636
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,280
 He arrived late to that wedding

637
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,600
 and stumbled up the aisle completely drunk.

638
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,520
 And then he refused to say any of his vows

639
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,160
 until his father ordered him to behave himself.

640
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,840
 And they separated quite soon after that.

641
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
 Wow.

642
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,640
 I read that he only got married because parliament said,

643
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,440
 we will pay off your debts, but only if you marry this woman.

644
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,960
 Yeah.

645
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,520
 So that's the sole motivation he had.

646
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,080
 He seems like the kind of person who would have racked up

647
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,160
 a lot of debts, doesn't he?

648
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,680
 Yeah.

649
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,880
 And I think did he stare at his mistress

650
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,680
 who was in the front row throughout the ceremony?

651
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,800
 I don't know.

652
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,560
 Poor woman.

653
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,240
 Yeah.

654
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,520
 So there was another one in 1736.

655
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,440
 There was a German princess Augusta arrived in London.

656
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,720
 She was 17 years old.

657
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,400
 And she had to marry the heir to the throne who was Frederick,

658
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
 who didn't end up becoming king.

659
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,080
 But she was told by her mum, look, they all speak German

660
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,760
 there, it's fine, because she spoke no English.

661
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,000
 She got there, nobody spoke any German.

662
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,440
 She didn't speak any English.

663
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,000
 She was absolutely terrified.

664
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,280
 She was ushered down the aisle.

665
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,080
 She was sobbing.

666
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,320
 She was clinging to her mum's coattails apparently,

667
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,880
 saying, please don't make me do this.

668
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,680
 The groom of Frederick, apparently,

669
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,800
 just shouted the vows in her ear

670
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,040
 that she had to repeat verbatim.

671
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,600
 And then immediately after that, she

672
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,760
 vomited all down her dress and all over the skirt

673
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,080
 of her new mother-in-law.

674
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,840
 And that was the start of what turned out

675
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,480
 to be quite a happy marriage, actually.

676
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,960
 Oh, we have to move on shortly.

677
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,600
 If you guys have anything before we do--

678
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,680
 oh, I've got one thing.

679
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,040
 The movie, "The King's Speech," that was about George's

680
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,480
 thick.

681
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,040
 He had a stutter.

682
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,400
 Did you deliberately?

683
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,840
 It just came out as I did it.

684
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,040
 Are you auditioning for the sequel?

685
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,840
 So Colin Firth played him in the movie.

686
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,200
 And in order to do it, obviously,

687
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,320
 he taught himself to do a stutter for the movie.

688
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,240
 Then the movie finished, and Colin Firth found himself

689
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,440
 not being able to get rid of the stutter.

690
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,760
 So then he himself had to be treated for an artificially

691
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,960
 manufactured stutter.

692
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,760
 Isn't that great?

693
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,520
 No way.

694
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,280
 Way.

695
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,160
 I love that on the dance Wikipedia.

696
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,680
 If it ever existed, you'd look for the citation

697
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,280
 at the bottom, or just a row of numbers.

698
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,480
 Way, way, way.

699
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,280
 [LAUGHTER]

700
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,840
 I've also got quite nice hat, little thing.

701
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,040
 So the politeness of the British with the hat back in the day,

702
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,560
 Michael Bond passed away this year,

703
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,400
 who was the author of Paddington Bear.

704
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,960
 And Paddington Bear was largely based on his father.

705
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,520
 And his father apparently was so polite and nice

706
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,160
 that when he used to go swimming,

707
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,440
 he would wear into the ocean, his trunks,

708
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,400
 and also his hat, just in case he passed someone

709
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,480
 as he was swimming, so he could say, oh, good day to you.

710
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,080
 And if his hat to them, is that lovely?

711
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,760
 Yeah.

712
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,160
 Did you know that on a hat etiquette,

713
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
 the reason we have cloakrooms today,

714
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,640
 where you put your hat and your coat in a cloakroom,

715
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,360
 is because of hats in the olden days.

716
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,760
 So when everyone was wearing hats up until the early 1900s,

717
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,200
 they took up half the space in restaurants.

718
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
 Because, as we said earlier, men

719
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,880
 had to take off their top hats when they went inside

720
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 into a restaurant, for instance.

721
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,600
 But then you didn't want to leave it under the table,

722
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,400
 because it couldn't really fit.

723
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,360
 So it would take up a second chair.

724
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,880
 And there was a guy, this guy called AJ Liebling,

725
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,640
 at one point said, you know, a restaurant's

726
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,080
 of 50% occupied by hats who don't eat anything.

727
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,680
 We should really infer that cloakroom to store these.

728
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,200
 And that's what I like.

729
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
 I'd be lovely if there was a smaller hat table

730
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,640
 with, you know, and a hat's menu.

731
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,400
 Right, well, they all got to hang out together.

732
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,160
 OK, should we move on to our final fact?

733
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,880
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

734
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
 And that is my fact.

735
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,280
 My fact this week is that the Brazilian frog, known

736
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,040
 as the Pumpkin Toadlet, has a mating call

737
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,680
 that can be heard by every animal out there,

738
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,720
 except for one other Pumpkin Toadlets.

739
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,200
 It turns out they're deaf.

740
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,240
 [LAUGHTER]

741
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,840
 They do these croaks to get their attention.

742
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,000
 And they keep getting eaten.

743
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,440
 They're probably going, why am I exposing myself so much?

744
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,040
 And it turns out it must be an evolutionary thing

745
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
 where they did used to be able to hear.

746
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,360
 And somewhere along the line, they went deaf,

747
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,080
 the entire species.

748
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,360
 I think they're subspecies within the Pumpkin Toadlet.

749
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,320
 So there's two species, specifically, that are deaf.

750
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,840
 And what they think is that when they're doing the call,

751
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,160
 the way it moves their neck, another Pumpkin Toadlet,

752
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,160
 female Pumpkin Toadlet sees the moves of the shakes

753
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,320
 or whatever of the toad.

754
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,000
 And they're like, that looks like he might be saying something.

755
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,960
 I have no idea.

756
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,280
 But it looks hot, so I'll go over.

757
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,680
 But what usually would happen in evolution purposes

758
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,280
 is that you would lose the call because you would

759
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,680
 protect yourself from predators.

760
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,520
 But they haven't.

761
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,240
 And it's the first case that we've ever

762
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,160
 found of an animal that hasn't lost the call

763
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,400
 when it's redundant and exposes it to predators.

764
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,960
 But it will be getting there presumably.

765
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
 We're always surprised when we find animals

766
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,280
 that haven't evolved into this perfect being.

767
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,440
 But presumably in a few million years it's there.

768
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,080
 We're just in the ship phase.

769
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,480
 Yeah, you're right.

770
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,560
 We're in the learning phase.

771
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,680
 When you're in the ship phase, you do often die out.

772
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,800
 You get extinct, don't you?

773
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,440
 Yeah, that is a risk for the toadlet.

774
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,480
 Apparently they do little waves as well.

775
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,000
 Yeah.

776
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Like this.

777
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,920
 Well, I can understand why the females come aflocking.

778
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,600
 LAUGHTER

779
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,200
 I must have it, that is a great podcast material, is it?

780
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,600
 Yeah, yeah.

781
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,760
 Well James was doing is.

782
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,040
 He was making a gesture that made it seem like he was trying

783
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,960
 to, like, work out somebody's height.

784
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,040
 It's like, you have a child and you're going,

785
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,840
 is that four-foot, five-foot, four-point-five?

786
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,160
 Yeah, that's what he was like, four metres, three metres,

787
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,080
 or so.

788
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,920
 Five or six metres.

789
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,480
 Five or six metres, OK.

790
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,480
 Yeah, so, unfortunately, for the frog, it happens to be the case

791
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,720
 that, and it's like a bright orange colour.

792
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,080
 Yeah, they're really tiny, aren't they?

793
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,880
 They're really tiny.

794
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,440
 I like the size of your thumbnail almost.

795
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,640
 They're really super small.

796
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,160
 Yeah, and their call is quite soft as a result.

797
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,080
 But they still can be heard by the predators.

798
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,360
 But they are incredibly toxic.

799
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,800
 So if they do get eaten, they might end up

800
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,160
 killing the predator anyway.

801
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,480
 So they're probably just actually just being really cocky.

802
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,440
 And they're just going, hey, I'm here, I'm here, what are you going to do?

803
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,240
 What are you going to do, nothing?

804
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
 Do you know that there's a type of frog called a cocky frog?

805
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
 No, really?

806
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,760
 It's in-- I can't remember where they're from.

807
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,840
 They're from an island somewhere, but they're now on Hawaii,

808
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,240
 which is also an island, but it's different islands where they're from.

809
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,960
 But they're on Hawaii, and they make a hell of a racket.

810
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,520
 They're really, really loud.

811
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,800
 And the load of people in Hawaii are really hastiness

812
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,160
 because it keeps them awake at night when they're mating.

813
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,000
 Just get loads of horny frogs just making loads and loads of lies.

814
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,280
 That's like there's something called the--

815
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,040
 I thought I was looking at other sounds that animals could make.

816
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,400
 And I was wondering, do fish make mating calls?

817
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,480
 And they make really loud ones.

818
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,080
 So there's a fish called the plainfish midshipman fish,

819
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,880
 which is in the Toadfish family.

820
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,720
 So it's got Toad relations.

821
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,480
 And it hums to attract mates.

822
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,400
 So it makes its hum which sounds like a guitar amplifier,

823
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,080
 or it sounds like a flock of bees.

824
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,960
 -Flock of bees. -Sure, a flock of bees.

825
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,480
 Yeah.

826
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,040
 And it turns out that they make so much noise

827
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,080
 that they live in California and they're constant complaints

828
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,320
 to the police for the noise that they make,

829
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,640
 because they're disrupting people's sleep

830
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,560
 and drowning out people's conversations.

831
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,640
 And they growl and they grunt as well to keep out intruders.

832
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,280
 And they didn't know what it was for a long time.

833
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,680
 So people were calling the police saying,

834
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,720
 "Someone's keeping me awake all night."

835
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,480
 And it's them.

836
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,040
 And the person who eventually found out about this weird noise

837
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,560
 that they make as a researcher called Andrew Bass,

838
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,480
 B-A-Double-S, which is the first case

839
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,960
 of double nominative determinism I've ever found.

840
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,120
 -As in-- -Double.

841
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,040
 It's a fish.

842
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,920
 And it's the bassy noise that the fish make.

843
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,160
 Oh, I thought there was a fish species called Andrew.

844
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,040
 [LAUGHTER]

845
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,440
 That makes more sense.

846
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,240
 -The Andrew fish. -Yeah.

847
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,320
 Did you guys know some frogs call so much

848
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,000
 and so vociferously for a mate that, once they've got a mate,

849
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,760
 they're too tired to follow through and have sex with the female.

850
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
 The female arrives and they say, "I'm sorry, I can't.

851
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,240
 "I'm no good to you now."

852
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,720
 They lose loads of weight, don't they?

853
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,960
 They can't eat.

854
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,880
 They can't sleep, and they're so weak that they've just

855
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,000
 a floppy mess.

856
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,760
 And it feels like--

857
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,480
 [LAUGHTER]

858
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,720
 Everyone's had a night like that.

859
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,200
 I mean, that is it.

860
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
 [LAUGHTER]

861
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,160
 I've never done it.

862
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
 I've found the really cool one.

863
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
 There's a frog in Taiwan.

864
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,080
 It's an urban city frog, and it does a mating call,

865
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,160
 but it's worked out how to make their mating call better.

866
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,400
 It goes to storm drains, and it uses it as a megaphone.

867
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
 [LAUGHTER]

868
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,200
 So it gets to the top of a storm drain.

869
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,080
 And it literally, it's just whatever it's you're,

870
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,440
 "I'm super horny."

871
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,920
 "Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey."

872
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,120
 And they found that the female frog goes to the edge

873
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,920
 of the storm drain, so it works for them.

874
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,480
 But do the females know that it's not--

875
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,360
 because it must sound like a massive frog.

876
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,760
 Oh, that sound like a super frog.

877
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,560
 It must, you're right, yeah.

878
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,840
 Do you know the biggest frog that's ever lived

879
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,080
 is about the size of a beach ball and it at dinosaurs?

880
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,840
 Wow.

881
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,800
 It's not like T-Rex's, though.

882
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,040
 No, like baby dinosaurs, you know.

883
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,560
 So the comment told the Latin name for that is Bufo, Bufo.

884
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,760
 And this frog, it was known as-- or is known as Bielza Bufo.

885
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,120
 Oh, hi.

886
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,960
 That's his official name, as well.

887
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,240
 That's not--

888
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,800
 but it was the size of a beach ball.

889
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,720
 And they worked out how strong it's bite was.

890
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,680
 And its bite was about 2,200 newtons,

891
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,320
 which is about the same as a lion's bite.

892
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,080
 Wow.

893
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,920
 Wow.

894
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,760
 Yeah.

895
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,520
 Do you know how porcupines attract to each other?

896
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,680
 Or how male porcupines attract females?

897
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,840
 This really bite was.

898
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,240
 Really awesome spikes.

899
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,840
 It is actually-- well, it's in a way, yeah.

900
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,240
 They stand up on their hind legs,

901
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,280
 and they move, they shuffle towards the female just

902
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,480
 with their penis fully erect.

903
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
 And that's how they do it.

904
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,120
 It's a sun uncompromisingly direct flirting method.

905
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,160
 It's good.

906
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,960
 There's no question over what he's after.

907
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,800
 We like that.

908
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,720
 Or sometimes, and you can see pictures of this, they hop.

909
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,360
 They lift one arm, their front paw off the ground,

910
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,400
 and they hop on the other one, whilst clutching their crotch

911
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,280
 with the one that's off the ground.

912
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,680
 They do.

913
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,200
 And this attracts the women.

914
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,160
 And if the woman or the female porcupine likes that enough,

915
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,360
 the crotch dance, then she'll allow them to have sex with her.

916
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,600
 And usually, if she's not up for sex,

917
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,120
 then a male porcupine can't get in there,

918
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,440
 because she's so spiny.

919
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,800
 And then the way you know that she likes you

920
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,320
 is she puts her tail up, and it covers all of her spines,

921
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,040
 which means that you will not be impaled.

922
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,520
 She's a very good, very good system.

923
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,000
 Do you know that some frogs change color

924
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,240
 to make their life easier when they're in orgies?

925
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,040
 Really?

926
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,080
 If you've been in orgie, your life doesn't get much easier, does it?

927
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,360
 Yeah, you've made it.

928
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,600
 You're fine.

929
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,560
 Well, it does, if you're a frog, you see,

930
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,160
 because there's a lot of them.

931
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,760
 There's loads and loads of frogs all get together.

932
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,040
 Might be a particularly nice puddle or something.

933
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,160
 But these are in some species.

934
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,320
 They all get together, and they'll just

935
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,720
 shag anything.

936
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,760
 Male, female, tennis ball, whatever.

937
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,160
 There are some pictures of tennis balls

938
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,800
 landing into this orgie of frogs,

939
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,000
 and all the frogs just go for it.

940
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Really?

941
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,760
 What happens to the match?

942
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,720
 The charge is six going down, you know?

943
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,800
 So that's what happens.

944
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,320
 And, but there are some species.

945
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,840
 A lot of these species who do this kind of group mating,

946
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,320
 they also change colour, and no one was really sure why,

947
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,800
 and it seems that the reason they do it is to say,

948
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,560
 "I'm a man, or I'm a woman, you know, keep off me."

949
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,040
 Oh, wow, it's like when you go to those parties at union,

950
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,760
 you have to wear a traffic light colour depending

951
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,800
 on how available you are.

952
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,000
 Yeah, exactly.

953
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,160
 But the problem is, at the start, they're all green.

954
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,320
 [LAUGHTER]

955
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,160
 Have you heard of this thing?

956
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,080
 So when frogs have, it's called explosive breeding, isn't it?

957
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,360
 They do this thing called explosive breeding,

958
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
 which is instead of mating all year round,

959
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,640
 they have one session, you know, every year.

960
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,520
 And all the mating happens then.

961
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,760
 So some females, because there's a horrible crush of bodies,

962
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,480
 some females are crushed to death in these things.

963
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,680
 Unfortunately, it's already unfortunate, yeah.

964
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,640
 Let me rephrase it, put the column in a different place.

965
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,760
 Some females are crushed to death, unfortunately.

966
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,320
 [LAUGHTER]

967
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,720
 But the male frogs will still mate with them successfully,

968
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,040
 successfully.

969
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,400
 OK, so it's all about the mating habits

970
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,480
 outside the body, because the female produces eggs.

971
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,040
 The male produces sperm, and they meet outside the body.

972
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,040
 So the males sort of go up and squeeze the females.

973
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,240
 Oh, God.

974
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,320
 And they squeeze.

975
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,480
 It's just nature, guys.

976
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,280
 It's just nature.

977
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,160
 It can't be gross if it's just nature.

978
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,440
 [LAUGHTER]

979
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,960
 No, that's not a defense for anything.

980
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,040
 [LAUGHTER]

981
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,720
 Yeah, and they squeeze the eggs out of the body

982
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
 and then mate with them.

983
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,800
 Amazing.

984
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,640
 Yeah, it is messed up.

985
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,760
 I'm sorry.

986
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,080
 So Seahawks, look at that.

987
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,360
 Don't boo the frogs.

988
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,720
 It's their instincts.

989
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,920
 I don't think the frogs are the ones being booed.

990
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,160
 [LAUGHTER]

991
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,360
 He's pointing at me.

992
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,560
 I don't, mate.

993
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,920
 [LAUGHTER]

994
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,800
 So Seahawks has the best mating rituals,

995
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,080
 the best way of attracting each other,

996
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,680
 which people might have seen, but it's so great.

997
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,720
 So they change colour as well to attract mates.

998
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,440
 And then when they've got something they think they fancy,

999
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,600
 they swim for hours and hours together,

1000
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,120
 and they get their tails intertwined,

1001
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,160
 and they go snout to snout.

1002
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,240
 And they spin around, and they do this incredible dance.

1003
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,680
 But another thing they do is when they're in the flirting period,

1004
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,640
 they meet up every morning, and they hang out together

1005
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,600
 for a couple of hours.

1006
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,320
 And then they part ways again.

1007
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,840
 They date each other.

1008
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,440
 I know.

1009
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,760
 It's so sweet.

1010
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,560
 And so they do this sort of pre-dawn dance

1011
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
 where they meet up.

1012
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,200
 They do that.

1013
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,440
 And then once they're ready, on like the fourth or fifth date,

1014
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,720
 or whenever you think is appropriate,

1015
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,320
 then they do the full eight hour corp chip dance,

1016
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,960
 the ends in pregnancy.

1017
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,560
 And that's--

1018
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,160
 You see, Andy, this is how you tell a story about animal mating.

1019
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
 [LAUGHTER]

1020
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
 Yeah.

1021
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,600
 There's no food we can go to now.

1022
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1023
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,440
 Does the sea horse then die?

1024
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,320
 And then they just punches it in their head until the eggs come out?

1025
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,960
 It's--

1026
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,720
 Yep.

1027
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,800
 That's the romantic climate.

1028
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
 Right.

1029
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1030
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
 Sorry.

1031
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1032
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,600
 I didn't think it was interesting.

1033
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,520
 And I realized it's just horrible.

1034
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
 I'm sorry.

1035
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,840
 David Attenborough doesn't get this shit, does he?

1036
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,160
 Necro is David Attenborough.

1037
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,680
 He picks his targets carefully.

1038
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,160
 [LAUGHTER]

1039
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,320
 We need to wrap up shortly.

1040
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,080
 [LAUGHTER]

1041
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,800
 We need to get in the van and leave this town.

1042
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1043
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,920
 Thank you for listening to the last episode.

1044
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
 That's such a big surprise.

1045
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1046
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,800
 You guys have anything before we do?

1047
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,000
 I can give you some names of frogs.

1048
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,880
 Great.

1049
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,920
 I read a list of all the names of all the frogs.

1050
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
 Andrew, Billy, Bobby.

1051
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,280
 Well, Andrew's a fish as we've established our name.

1052
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,520
 So there is the demonic poison frog.

1053
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,640
 They all have amazing names.

1054
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,320
 The hole in the head frog.

1055
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,040
 The brilliant thigh to poison frog.

1056
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,680
 And the Pobblebunk.

1057
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,480
 [LAUGHTER]

1058
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,760
 Pobblebunk.

1059
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,560
 Pobblebunk.

1060
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,760
 You have to say it like that.

1061
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,080
 That's appropriate, because someone had a frog in their throat

1062
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,280
 as they named that animal.

1063
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1064
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,120
 All right, let's wrap up, guys.

1065
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,920
 OK, that's it.

1066
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,960
 That is all of our facts.

1067
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,480

 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1069
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,520
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,240
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1071
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,880
 I'm on @Sriberland.

1072
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,840
 Andy, please just don't contact him this way.

1073
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,880
 [LAUGHTER]

1074
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,800
 James.

1075
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,000
 That's James Harkin.

1076
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,080
 Ed Shazinski.

1077
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,040
 You can email podcast@QI.com.

1078
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,540
 Yep.

1079
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,720
 Or you can go to his jet ski.

1080
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,480
 You want to say you're there, don't you?

1081
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,320
 No.

1082
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,200
 I'm immediately setting myself to private.

1083
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,480
 [LAUGHTER]

1084
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,800
 You can get our group account, which is at no such thing,

1085
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
 or you can go to our website.

1086
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,320
 No such thing is a fish.com.

1087
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,560
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

1088
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,120
 And we also have a link to our book, which is now out,

1089
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,800
 which we're about to give a copy away to one of the members

1090
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 of our audience who sent us in a fact.

1091
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,680
 And that fact, Anna, you have it.

1092
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,200
 Yes.

1093
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,400
 This fact is from Hannah Winterborn, who I think is in here somewhere.

1094
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,480
 Yes.

1095
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
 And this fact-- this is the fact that--

1096
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,360
 Oh, the six of her.

1097
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,080
 [LAUGHTER]

1098
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,040
 This is the fact that British Army soldiers

1099
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,360
 can wear the same underwear for three months straight, apparently.

1100
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,280
 And that is because it's antibacterial underwear, I believe.

1101
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,680
 And Hannah, who is here tonight, has worn this underwear for three

1102
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,800
 months straight.

1103
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
 Wow.

1104
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,040
 That's really exciting.

1105
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,560
 Yeah.

1106
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,040
 Cool.

1107
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,560
 OK.

1108
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,400
 Well, yeah, we'll give you a book after the show.

1109
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,320
 Guys, thank you so much for being here tonight.

1110
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,160
 We hope you had fun.

1111
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,120
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1112
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,800
 See you then.

1113
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
 Goodbye.

1114
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,720

1117
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,020
