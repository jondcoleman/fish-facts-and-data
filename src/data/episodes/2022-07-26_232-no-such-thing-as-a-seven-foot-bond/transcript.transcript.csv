00:00:15,00:00:21,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming
00:00:21,00:00:24,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and"
00:00:29,00:00:33,Anich Zinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:33,00:00:39,facts from the last seven days and a no particular order here we go.
00:00:39,00:00:44,"Starting with my fact this week, my fact is that the legendary sumo wrestler, my noomi"
00:00:44,00:00:50,"Shuhei, injected silicone into his scalp so that he could meet the height requirements"
00:00:50,00:00:52,to become a sumo.
00:00:52,00:00:53,What were they?
00:00:53,00:01:01,"You had to be 173 centimeters tall, this was back in the day up until the 90s so that was"
00:01:01,00:01:02,the height requirements.
00:01:02,00:01:03,Is that about 5 foot 9?
00:01:03,00:01:05,"Yeah, I believe that about 5 foot 9."
00:01:05,00:01:09,"Yeah, and so a lot of wrestlers were very close, 5 foot 8, 5 foot 7 and they just weren't"
00:01:09,00:01:15,quite there and 172 centimeters and so what they used to do and this is what this wrestler
00:01:15,00:01:21,"Shuhei did, he went to a doctor and he had surgically inserted into his scalp a little"
00:01:21,00:01:26,bag that could be filled with silicon and the silicon would go up to 4 centimeters high.
00:01:26,00:01:29,The other thing that they used to do before the silicon thing was bash themselves on the
00:01:29,00:01:33,"head so they get a lump which would then be just, you know like in a cartoon how it goes"
00:01:33,00:01:36,"no, that's what they genuinely don't get that."
00:01:36,00:01:39,You can't guarantee you're going to bruise like that.
00:01:39,00:01:43,I would concentrate on growing hair instead of beating myself on the head.
00:01:43,00:01:46,"No, but they push, they push us a ruler down on your head, yeah."
00:01:46,00:01:49,Also all sumo's have that quite flat hair don't they?
00:01:49,00:01:55,"Yeah, yeah, so this guy I just want to apologize if I've pronounced his name wrong."
00:01:55,00:01:58,"In fact, I'm just going to refer to him by his nickname I think instead."
00:01:58,00:02:01,"Yeah, you should worry about him because he's pretty tall these days."
00:02:01,00:02:02,He's definitely have you in a fight.
00:02:02,00:02:05,"Yeah, he's like 7 foot tall now."
00:02:05,00:02:06,"Yeah, it's funny."
00:02:06,00:02:07,He keeps going.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Yeah.
00:02:08,00:02:09,"No, he doesn't."
00:02:09,00:02:11,You get one enlargement and then after a while it's not enough.
00:02:11,00:02:12,Exactly.
00:02:12,00:02:13,Yeah.
00:02:13,00:02:18,So he has a nickname which he's known by to the fans which is Waza no Depato translates
00:02:18,00:02:20,roughly as Department Store of Techniques.
00:02:20,00:02:21,So I will refer to him.
00:02:21,00:02:22,Department Store.
00:02:22,00:02:25,Why do you think you could say the nickname easier than you could say my new Mishu?
00:02:25,00:02:29,I actually just flew over that and then headed straight to the Department Store of Techniques.
00:02:29,00:02:31,The Department Store of Techniques.
00:02:31,00:02:32,He was an amazing guy.
00:02:32,00:02:37,So he was known for using 33 different what they call Kimmerite which are basically finishing
00:02:37,00:02:39,moves.
00:02:39,00:02:42,He did one which was a triple attack force out.
00:02:42,00:02:47,"So he's simultaneously trapped the guy's leg, grabbed another and pushed his head into his"
00:02:47,00:02:48,chest.
00:02:48,00:02:50,The opponent's head into the opponent's chest.
00:02:50,00:02:51,"Oh, sorry."
00:02:51,00:02:52,What?
00:02:52,00:02:54,He pushed his opponent's head into his opponent's chest.
00:02:54,00:02:55,Yeah.
00:02:55,00:02:58,So he brought his head down in there while tripping him up and while grabbing a leg and that's
00:02:58,00:02:59,called a triple threat.
00:02:59,00:03:02,So it's kind of like you're forcing someone into a forward sort of thing.
00:03:02,00:03:04,You trip them over and then you bend their head down.
00:03:04,00:03:05,Yeah.
00:03:05,00:03:09,So you don't push their head just straight down so it goes back into their chest.
00:03:09,00:03:13,Which means maybe that they then don't need the height requirement.
00:03:13,00:03:14,Automatic win.
00:03:14,00:03:20,And these days you can qualify through speed and agility as well as height or instead of
00:03:20,00:03:21,height.
00:03:21,00:03:22,Can you?
00:03:22,00:03:23,Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:27,"If you're really fast, really agile and tiny."
00:03:27,00:03:32,"There is one move in Sumo, one technique called Henker which I don't know if this guy did"
00:03:32,00:03:38,but it's the way that the winner of the Sumo championships in 2016 won it and the Henker
00:03:38,00:03:43,is when your rival like hurdles towards you super fast to take you down and then you
00:03:43,00:03:47,just step to the side like you're in a cartoon and your rival goes plummeting out of the ring
00:03:47,00:03:48,and then you win that way.
00:03:48,00:03:53,Does he run out of the ring and then not realise he's actually above the ground for a few seconds
00:03:53,00:03:54,and then plummet.
00:03:54,00:03:55,"Yes, exactly."
00:03:55,00:03:58,And I will pop out of his head and stuff.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"But the thing about this move is that even though it's a winning move, it's really frowned"
00:04:01,00:04:02,upon.
00:04:02,00:04:06,So Sumo is a lot about honor and respect and you get booted by the crowds for doing this.
00:04:06,00:04:11,"So he won this championship, he's called Hakuho and he was massively booted by the crowds."
00:04:11,00:04:14,A lot of them left before even listening to his victory speech and when he gave his post
00:04:14,00:04:18,"match speech, he just immediately apologised, he was on the verge of tears and said, ""You"
00:04:18,00:04:22,"know, I never thought that I'd win doing that move but I guess I did."""
00:04:22,00:04:23,Wow.
00:04:23,00:04:24,Sorry.
00:04:24,00:04:26,You know they all have this sort of bun of hair.
00:04:26,00:04:27,Yes.
00:04:27,00:04:28,They have the same bun.
00:04:28,00:04:29,I have read.
00:04:29,00:04:33,"I can't quite believe this but I've read that they're the only, you have to have that"
00:04:33,00:04:37,"bun and if you're not in the game, you're not allowed to have the bun and when you retire,"
00:04:37,00:04:40,your bun gets cut off by your friends and family and colleagues and you're trained
00:04:40,00:04:42,to cut the last strand of the bun.
00:04:42,00:04:48,That's when you retire but there are only 55 master hairdressers who are allowed to do
00:04:48,00:04:49,this bun.
00:04:49,00:04:50,That's very cool.
00:04:50,00:04:51,Yeah.
00:04:51,00:04:56,And so they trained specifically as hairdressers in the art of that one specific thing.
00:04:56,00:05:01,We've reached the limits of my knowledge and we've hurtled beyond it.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"The ritual when they cut it off is a major thing though, isn't it?"
00:05:03,00:05:04,There's often crying then.
00:05:04,00:05:05,"Oh, it's really sad."
00:05:05,00:05:06,"You seem like an emotional, emotional people."
00:05:06,00:05:07,Very sad.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"Yeah, losing your bun."
00:05:08,00:05:11,"I suppose your whole life is being a sumo, isn't it?"
00:05:11,00:05:12,That's all they do.
00:05:12,00:05:13,You don't do anything else.
00:05:13,00:05:14,Yeah.
00:05:14,00:05:15,And that's the symbol of it.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Yeah.
00:05:16,00:05:17,That was the symbol of doing this podcast.
00:05:17,00:05:18,"Typing with your hands, I suppose."
00:05:18,00:05:20,"Yeah, so much like your fingers off at the end."
00:05:20,00:05:21,I'd cry.
00:05:21,00:05:22,Yeah.
00:05:22,00:05:25,"For the last episode, we all have to cut off, cut each other's fingers off."
00:05:25,00:05:26,Yeah.
00:05:26,00:05:27,I think it's just taking our microphone.
00:05:27,00:05:28,Yes.
00:05:28,00:05:30,I didn't think it.
00:05:30,00:05:31,They relieved.
00:05:31,00:05:37,"You know Sumo's before they start to fight, they clap their hands and they do that thing"
00:05:37,00:05:40,where they'll clap and then they spread their arms out really wide.
00:05:40,00:05:41,Do you know why they do that?
00:05:41,00:05:45,Is it to make themselves look bigger to their opponents so they're more scared?
00:05:45,00:05:48,It definitely does serve that purpose and the way they do it does imply that's the reason.
00:05:48,00:05:54,"But officially, it is to show that you're not armed because you can't, you can't be armed"
00:05:54,00:05:55,in Sumo.
00:05:55,00:05:58,I think also the stamping that they do is to drive away evil spirits or it traditionally
00:05:58,00:05:59,is.
00:05:59,00:06:00,Yes.
00:06:00,00:06:01,And therefore it survives as a kind of remnant of that.
00:06:01,00:06:02,Yeah.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"Because they also sprinkle salt, don't they, on the ring before going into it, which is"
00:06:05,00:06:07,also to purify it.
00:06:07,00:06:08,And don't allow women in.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"Yep, that's true."
00:06:09,00:06:10,To purify it as well.
00:06:10,00:06:11,"But that is right, though, isn't it?"
00:06:11,00:06:12,That's what they say.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Yes.
00:06:13,00:06:16,And there were two women went in this year in the news.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:18,And I can't remember what happened.
00:06:18,00:06:20,They basically had a heart attack.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Or something like that.
00:06:22,00:06:23,They passed out.
00:06:23,00:06:24,The women jumped in.
00:06:24,00:06:27,They were qualified doctors and nurses and they jumped in and they immediately got told
00:06:27,00:06:28,to get out of there.
00:06:28,00:06:29,Yeah.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Oh, this guy was dying."
00:06:30,00:06:32,"And then because they've been women in there, they had to throw a load of extra salt"
00:06:32,00:06:33,in.
00:06:33,00:06:34,Yeah.
00:06:34,00:06:38,"In fact, they were skidding around on the salt and it ruined the whole match."
00:06:38,00:06:39,It proves it's bad luck.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"There was a guy who was known for the salt, particularly."
00:06:42,00:06:45,He used to throw just a lot of salt in the ring.
00:06:45,00:06:47,So his name was Salt Shaker.
00:06:47,00:06:48,That was his nickname.
00:06:48,00:06:53,"And yeah, that was sort of his pre-match ritual, which became his thing."
00:06:53,00:06:55,Is it related to the fact that you throw salt over your shoulder?
00:06:55,00:06:58,So do you throw salt over your left shoulder when have you eaten salt?
00:06:58,00:06:59,"Yeah, a little bit."
00:06:59,00:07:00,Whenever you eat salt.
00:07:00,00:07:01,Yeah.
00:07:01,00:07:02,My dad's always done it's a huge way.
00:07:02,00:07:04,"Actually, we do it when we spill salt."
00:07:04,00:07:05,I thought it was when he spilled salt.
00:07:05,00:07:06,"Oh, really?"
00:07:06,00:07:07,It's bad luck to spill salt.
00:07:07,00:07:08,"Oh, right."
00:07:08,00:07:12,And that therefore you have to throw a bit more over your shoulder to counteract the evil.
00:07:12,00:07:15,But I also do it if I have too much salt in my hands when I'm cooking.
00:07:15,00:07:16,I have a bit left over.
00:07:16,00:07:18,It goes over the shoulder rather than in the belly.
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:22,Under the pretence of doing it for good luck when really you're just too lazy to bother
00:07:22,00:07:23,actually clearing up.
00:07:23,00:07:28,I actually do that with all kitchen waste.
00:07:28,00:07:30,Just something on high restrictions.
00:07:30,00:07:33,So I did you know that MI5 has high restrictions?
00:07:33,00:07:34,No.
00:07:34,00:07:38,And these were introduced in 2004 and it makes a lot of sense.
00:07:38,00:07:42,"So as a man, you're not allowed to be taller than 5 for 11 as a woman you're not allowed to"
00:07:42,00:07:43,be taller than 5 for 8.
00:07:43,00:07:46,"Which is actually, you know, a lot of men are obviously taller than 5 11."
00:07:46,00:07:49,But it's just so you don't stand out as much in a crowd.
00:07:49,00:07:50,Literally.
00:07:50,00:07:51,Yeah.
00:07:51,00:07:52,It literally.
00:07:52,00:07:53,I wonder how tall the James Bond is.
00:07:53,00:07:54,I thought you might ask that.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Yeah.
00:07:55,00:07:56,I've heard an answer actually.
00:07:56,00:07:57,Did you?
00:07:57,00:07:58,So have you got them all?
00:07:58,00:07:59,"I have, yeah."
00:07:59,00:08:00,6.
00:08:00,00:08:01,I know that.
00:08:01,00:08:02,So is it?
00:08:02,00:08:03,MI6 have different high requirements.
00:08:03,00:08:06,"Apparently, MI6 has unofficial ones which are quite similar, but MI5s were official."
00:08:06,00:08:11,But all the James Bond would not have been able to get into the Secret Service under these
00:08:11,00:08:14,rules except for Daniel Craig who just slots in under.
00:08:14,00:08:18,So I think he's 5 for 10 and a quarter and all the others are taller than 5 11.
00:08:18,00:08:21,Could you have like part of your head removed to keep you underneath?
00:08:21,00:08:25,"Oh, that may be very, you've all conspicuous, I guess, if you have a flat head."
00:08:25,00:08:30,"But if you always wore a very boring hat, but that would make you seem taller."
00:08:30,00:08:31,"Yeah, that's true."
00:08:31,00:08:32,Yeah.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Maybe you need to cut off the bottom of your feet.
00:08:33,00:08:34,Yeah.
00:08:34,00:08:38,"Well, I was going to say, I would have my feet extended as a sumo rather than my head."
00:08:38,00:08:40,Because it's much less dangerous having foot surgery isn't it?
00:08:40,00:08:41,I see.
00:08:41,00:08:42,Extended as in like heels.
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Yeah, platform."
00:08:43,00:08:44,Platforms underneath.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Platform feet.
00:08:45,00:08:46,"Wow, that's cool."
00:08:46,00:08:48,That would be a very good thing for a super villain to do to James Bond.
00:08:48,00:08:52,"It's just, instead of killing him, just give him massive leg extensions internally so"
00:08:52,00:08:54,he's 7 for 9 and he can't go any way.
00:08:54,00:08:57,"I think they are making a new James Bond, aren't they?"
00:08:57,00:08:58,Yeah.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"Presumably, there's still time to slip that into the script."
00:09:00,00:09:03,I think they're looking for a director at the moment.
00:09:03,00:09:04,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:04,00:09:05,Because Daddy Files not doing it.
00:09:05,00:09:09,I think the first four person directed James Bond film.
00:09:09,00:09:13,"I was reading in China that if you want to become a teacher, you have to be a certain"
00:09:13,00:09:14,height as well.
00:09:14,00:09:15,School teachers.
00:09:15,00:09:19,So this was a story that the BBC published this year about a lady who had qualified
00:09:19,00:09:22,for her teaching certificate.
00:09:22,00:09:25,She'd done the years of studying and at graduation.
00:09:25,00:09:27,They measured her and she wasn't tall enough.
00:09:27,00:09:30,You can't teach if you're under four foot nine.
00:09:30,00:09:32,Speaking of restrictions in China.
00:09:32,00:09:37,"So theme park rides often have a high restriction, but there's a new theme park ride in China"
00:09:37,00:09:40,"or a new restriction on it, which is a weight restriction."
00:09:40,00:09:45,But this is more that you have to be over a certain weight in order to ride for free.
00:09:45,00:09:49,So this is a theme park called Tang Paradise Park and it gives free entry to any women
00:09:49,00:09:55,"who's faster than it's really famous, really respected and admired concubine called Yang Guifei,"
00:09:55,00:10:00,who's an eight century consort and she's like one of China's four great beauties apparently.
00:10:00,00:10:05,"And if you're heavier than she is, so she was 61.8 kilos, you ride for free and it's trying"
00:10:05,00:10:08,to destigmatise chobbiness.
00:10:08,00:10:13,But you do have to get on a giant pair of weighing scales before you get on the ride.
00:10:13,00:10:14,Does that do the job?
00:10:14,00:10:15,Kind of a shaming.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"It's a real fat shaming, but here's your consolation prize, a roller coaster."
00:10:18,00:10:19,"And I just say, I don't."
00:10:19,00:10:23,"It's a roller coaster of emotions, but I like this one."
00:10:23,00:10:33,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:10:33,00:10:38,"Okay, my fact this week is that a quarter of all mentions of teeth in the Bible also include"
00:10:38,00:10:39,the word gnashing.
00:10:39,00:10:43,I mainly know the word gnashing from gnashing.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Oh yeah.
00:10:44,00:10:48,"His dog in the bino, I reckon he got his name from the biblical word."
00:10:48,00:10:50,I guess he must have done.
00:10:50,00:10:51,He was very devout.
00:10:51,00:10:59,"So for the QI fact book, I had to find a fact which was related to both teeth and the Bible"
00:10:59,00:11:01,because all the facts are in order.
00:11:01,00:11:06,And so I went on to the Bible gateway and searched the King James Bible for mentions of teeth
00:11:06,00:11:12,and there are 56 that I found and 15 of them have the word gnash in one of its various forms.
00:11:12,00:11:18,"The first one is in Job and he says he terreth me in his wrath, who hated me."
00:11:18,00:11:23,"He gnasheth upon me with his teeth, mine enemy sharp enough his eyes upon me."
00:11:23,00:11:27,"So basically just, it's a lot of gnashing of teeth, a lot of people go to hell, a lot of"
00:11:27,00:11:29,"people, you know, not so happy in the Bible."
00:11:29,00:11:30,Is gnashing of teeth?
00:11:30,00:11:31,Is that like a...
00:11:31,00:11:36,"Yeah, it's like grinding your teeth in and usually it's in anger or in pain or in agony"
00:11:36,00:11:37,or something like that.
00:11:37,00:11:38,Yeah.
00:11:38,00:11:43,"It's called teeth gnashing, you're gnashing your teeth and it's a dental problem for many"
00:11:43,00:11:44,people.
00:11:44,00:11:46,So I think one in ten people grind their teeth.
00:11:46,00:11:50,"So it officially is grinding, but grind their teeth and gnash their teeth at night."
00:11:50,00:11:51,But it is bad.
00:11:51,00:11:52,It's interesting.
00:11:52,00:11:58,"So people who are teeth, people who are sleep brookses, as they're called, will be gnashing"
00:11:58,00:12:04,their teeth for up to 40 minutes per hour and that's with a force of about 250 pounds.
00:12:04,00:12:07,"So that's a huge amount, you know, that's two or three people."
00:12:07,00:12:11,"And that's compared to sitting in your mouth, just sitting in your mouth on your jaw, gnashing"
00:12:11,00:12:12,your teeth together.
00:12:12,00:12:13,That's bad.
00:12:13,00:12:17,"And that's compared to in the daytime, if you're an awake brookster, it's just 20 minutes"
00:12:17,00:12:21,per day as opposed to 40 minutes an hour and it's only 20 pounds of force.
00:12:21,00:12:24,So that's quite a lot of force you're exercising on your little mouth in your sleep.
00:12:24,00:12:25,Yeah.
00:12:25,00:12:31,I was reading about teeth just throughout the ages and the one that I had not heard about
00:12:31,00:12:33,before was what the Mayans used to do with their teeth.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"Oh, what do they do?"
00:12:34,00:12:35,Have we spoken about this before?
00:12:35,00:12:36,I don't think we have.
00:12:36,00:12:38,So they were not only very proud of their teeth.
00:12:38,00:12:44,They had a lot of dentistry work done to them and their dentists have been said when people
00:12:44,00:12:47,have looked through the records of the different type of things that they don't quite advance
00:12:47,00:12:48,for their time.
00:12:48,00:12:53,And one thing they wanted to do was pimp up their teeth just to make it really shiny and
00:12:53,00:12:54,beautiful.
00:12:54,00:12:56,So there were two things that they could do.
00:12:56,00:12:59,One is that they would just cut into each tooth and give it a little indentation.
00:12:59,00:13:04,So it just looked a bit more interesting than you just your regular flat tooth and they
00:13:04,00:13:05,would leave that as was.
00:13:05,00:13:10,"But sometimes they would create this indentation, this little crater and they would put little bits"
00:13:10,00:13:16,"of jewelry inside that would sit kind of like how a lot of rappers, like Kanye West did"
00:13:16,00:13:17,that recent.
00:13:17,00:13:22,"Not the jewels, but I heard that Mick Jagger got that done with the jewel, but I don't think"
00:13:22,00:13:23,he did.
00:13:23,00:13:24,I think that's just a story I got told.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"It's not a good rumor, is it?"
00:13:26,00:13:29,"Surely you could just look at his face and say, oh no, he didn't do that."
00:13:29,00:13:31,"I think he's had it taken out now, but I think you got a bit of an emerald put in and"
00:13:31,00:13:34,"someone said, oh, you people kept saying to him, oh, you got spinach in your teeth."
00:13:34,00:13:38,But this is a very vague memory.
00:13:38,00:13:39,Yeah.
00:13:39,00:13:40,So I don't think it's true.
00:13:40,00:13:43,Can't believe that's the most exciting rumours I'm going to make up about Mick Jagger.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"I mean, his whole life consists of things more exciting than that."
00:13:46,00:13:50,"So you know what the minds would have been digging into, they would have been digging into"
00:13:50,00:13:55,"the skin of the teeth, which is another phrase from the King James Bible."
00:13:55,00:13:56,Yeah.
00:13:56,00:14:00,"And it's a very weird one as well, because the job says he'd just escaped by the skin of"
00:14:00,00:14:01,his teeth.
00:14:01,00:14:02,But what does it actually mean?
00:14:02,00:14:07,"Well, a lot of job is, there's a lot of gnashing in job because basically he's him being"
00:14:07,00:14:10,"tormented by God and the devil and everyone, right?"
00:14:10,00:14:12,He's just having a pretty bad time of it.
00:14:12,00:14:13,Awful.
00:14:13,00:14:19,"And so this, in this case, he says, my bone cleave to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped"
00:14:19,00:14:20,with the skin of my teeth.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Wow.
00:14:21,00:14:24,"But it is so unclear what it means and everyone says, oh, I suppose that means you escape"
00:14:24,00:14:29,"with as narrow a margin as the skin on your teeth is narrow, but when you read that sentence,"
00:14:29,00:14:31,"it's not really what that would mean in English, is it?"
00:14:31,00:14:33,Maybe a few few stepskin.
00:14:33,00:14:35,I think that's the obvious conclusion.
00:14:35,00:14:36,We were talking a long time ago.
00:14:36,00:14:40,And people always left it all at once.
00:14:40,00:14:44,"So it loads, I mean, you know, bite the dust is a thing that's from the Bible, but I look"
00:14:44,00:14:49,"for the, well, it's supposedly it is, but the phrase is, they that dwell in the wilderness"
00:14:49,00:14:52,"shall bow before him and his enemies shall lick the dust, which is slightly different"
00:14:52,00:14:53,to bite the dust.
00:14:53,00:14:54,It is.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:56,It's another one.
00:14:56,00:14:57,I'll lick the dust.
00:14:57,00:14:58,It does not say ring.
00:14:58,00:14:59,I've got a quiz question for you guys.
00:14:59,00:15:00,Okay.
00:15:00,00:15:06,In which religious book does Satan appear to tempt Adam and Eve to eat forbidden fruit?
00:15:06,00:15:07,Yep.
00:15:07,00:15:08,The Bible.
00:15:08,00:15:09,James Harkin.
00:15:09,00:15:10,It is not the Bible.
00:15:10,00:15:11,The Torah.
00:15:11,00:15:12,I'm afraid.
00:15:12,00:15:13,No.
00:15:13,00:15:14,Keep going.
00:15:14,00:15:17,I'm the grunth of seekers of all you've gone too obscure.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"Oh, you've gone too obscure."
00:15:18,00:15:19,The Book of Mormon.
00:15:19,00:15:20,It's the Quran.
00:15:20,00:15:21,Ah.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"So in Genesis in the Bible, there is no mention of the fact that it's Satan."
00:15:25,00:15:26,It's just a snake.
00:15:26,00:15:29,And this was an interpretation that was put on it many centuries later.
00:15:29,00:15:33,It was in the inter-testimental period between all the New Testament.
00:15:33,00:15:35,"They thought, I bet that was Satan."
00:15:35,00:15:38,"But actually, it's just a snake in Genesis."
00:15:38,00:15:43,"But in the Quran, when it describes a story, it says that Adam was tempted by Satan."
00:15:43,00:15:44,Wow.
00:15:44,00:15:45,I've got a fact about Bibles.
00:15:45,00:15:46,Go on.
00:15:46,00:15:49,Do you know about the space Bibles?
00:15:49,00:15:50,Space Bibles.
00:15:50,00:15:51,No.
00:15:51,00:15:53,So are they Bibles that have been sent into space?
00:15:53,00:15:54,Exactly.
00:15:54,00:15:55,Apollo 13.
00:15:55,00:15:58,"Well, they're exactly literally what they did."
00:15:58,00:15:59,You're good at this.
00:15:59,00:16:00,Apollo 13.
00:16:00,00:16:01,And 300 Bibles.
00:16:01,00:16:02,300?
00:16:02,00:16:03,No.
00:16:03,00:16:04,Where?
00:16:04,00:16:05,Where?
00:16:05,00:16:05,No.
00:16:05,00:16:06,No.
00:16:06,00:16:07,No.
00:16:07,00:16:08,There were 300.
00:16:08,00:16:09,What?
00:16:09,00:16:10,"They needed so much rocket fuel for that, surely."
00:16:10,00:16:11,I know.
00:16:11,00:16:14,But you need to be able to convert the aliens when you meet them.
00:16:14,00:16:19,"So what it was, you don't remember a microfilm, you know, of making things incredibly small."
00:16:19,00:16:24,"So they were all one inch by one inch, and each of them was printed with all the Holy"
00:16:24,00:16:25,Scriptures.
00:16:25,00:16:29,"And obviously Apollo 13 went pretty badly wrong, but the Bible survived."
00:16:29,00:16:34,"And they went up again with Apollo 14, and 100 of them went to the moon."
00:16:34,00:16:37,And the other 200 just went up into space.
00:16:37,00:16:38,Don't you think that that seems like a bad omen?
00:16:38,00:16:43,I wouldn't want to be on Apollo 14 with the same Bibles that were on Apollo 13.
00:16:43,00:16:45,I just think that God was angry for some reason.
00:16:45,00:16:52,"Do you know that you're, as of last year, you're no longer allowed to sell biblical teeth,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,or any relic-y teeth?
00:16:54,00:17:00,"And these days, they now have started giving a certificate of authenticity to relics."
00:17:00,00:17:02,"They've always had that though, haven't they?"
00:17:02,00:17:05,"Well, I think they now saying officially that these are the only ones recognized by the"
00:17:05,00:17:06,church.
00:17:06,00:17:11,"So if there's a museum that has, for example, I read one has Jesus Christ's bread cutting"
00:17:11,00:17:16,"knife from the Last Supper, claims to have it, unless that now has a certificate it cannot"
00:17:16,00:17:17,be considered.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"Who could just wander around going, ""Yeah, that one looks real."""
00:17:20,00:17:21,"No, that was not."
00:17:21,00:17:23,"I mean, who's deciding what gets a certificate?"
00:17:23,00:17:24,Obviously none of them are real.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Well, sorry guys."
00:17:25,00:17:27,"They would disagree with that, I imagine."
00:17:27,00:17:29,"Yeah, because they would say none of them is real."
00:17:29,00:17:30,Is real.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Is real.
00:17:31,00:17:37,"I don't always make it about that, Andy."
00:17:37,00:17:50,"Okay, it is time to move on to fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:17:50,00:17:56,"My fact is that if you bought land in Australia before 1891, you had the legal right to the land"
00:17:56,00:18:00,stretching all the way to the centre of the earth.
00:18:00,00:18:01,Pretty cool.
00:18:01,00:18:02,That was amazing.
00:18:02,00:18:03,Yeah.
00:18:03,00:18:04,And that's why they always say it's so hot in Australia.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"They're all living on there, right in the cool."
00:18:06,00:18:11,"And so this was an old law, and there was a sort of historical Latin phrase, ""Cueoess,"
00:18:11,00:18:16,"S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Quaid, Coilham, Ed, Ed, Ed, Imferos,"" which means whoever owns"
00:18:16,00:18:21,the soil holds title up to the heavens and down to the depths of hell.
00:18:21,00:18:24,So that was a legal principle that you just owned all the land.
00:18:24,00:18:28,So does the heavens extend as far as the infinite universe?
00:18:28,00:18:29,Like where does that end?
00:18:29,00:18:30,"Well, that's the thing."
00:18:30,00:18:32,I think it was before people really knew about the infinite universe.
00:18:32,00:18:34,So they really undersold it when they...
00:18:34,00:18:35,Yeah.
00:18:35,00:18:36,They should have tried more.
00:18:36,00:18:37,But the heaven was up there.
00:18:37,00:18:40,"That's true, which feels blasphemous to us selling a slice of heaven."
00:18:40,00:18:41,Yeah.
00:18:41,00:18:42,"No, up to the heavens."
00:18:42,00:18:43,They didn't say penetrates of heaven.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"Oh, right."
00:18:44,00:18:45,They didn't say up to the heavens.
00:18:45,00:18:46,Yeah.
00:18:46,00:18:47,Up to the heavens.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"But it was problematic, wasn't it?"
00:18:48,00:18:50,Because this was before airplanes were invented and before spades were invented.
00:18:50,00:18:54,So you couldn't go very far off or down in those days.
00:18:54,00:18:55,Exactly.
00:18:55,00:18:56,Yeah.
00:18:56,00:18:57,And then hot air ballooning was the thing which changed it.
00:18:57,00:18:59,"Because people kept being worried about hot air balloons and saying, ""Oh, you've trespassed"
00:18:59,00:19:00,"over my house."""
00:19:00,00:19:02,And you're hot air ballooning way up there.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Yeah.
00:19:03,00:19:06,"But on the court case, wasn't there with the guy who invented Grenada."
00:19:06,00:19:07,Okay.
00:19:07,00:19:08,And he owned a house.
00:19:08,00:19:11,He's called the Baron of Lee or something like that.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Is this the...
00:19:12,00:19:13,Is this the chicken guy?
00:19:13,00:19:14,Oh.
00:19:14,00:19:20,"Because there was a farm called Thomas Lee Corsby who in 1945, and he sued the US government"
00:19:20,00:19:23,because they'd been flying the airplanes above his property.
00:19:23,00:19:25,So about 83 feet above his property.
00:19:25,00:19:29,"And it was causing his chickens to fly into the walls and kill themselves, apparently."
00:19:29,00:19:30,He argued.
00:19:30,00:19:32,And he said he'd have to give up farming because so many of his chickens have died.
00:19:32,00:19:37,"And that's when it was kind of enshrined in law, how much land you were entitled to above"
00:19:37,00:19:38,you.
00:19:38,00:19:40,"And it was established that you're not entitled to all of it, but you're entitled to enough"
00:19:40,00:19:42,land above your house that all your chickens don't die.
00:19:42,00:19:43,Yeah.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"Actually, my one was the British law."
00:19:45,00:19:46,So...
00:19:46,00:19:47,Yeah.
00:19:47,00:19:48,So that was the American one.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Got it.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Australia changed it too.
00:19:50,00:19:51,I'm very sad to say.
00:19:51,00:19:52,Did they?
00:19:52,00:19:53,"Yeah, 1891."
00:19:53,00:19:54,They changed it.
00:19:54,00:19:56,"You'd know only get 15 meters down, as opposed to..."
00:19:56,00:19:57,It's not very much at all.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"Well, when you think it used to be 6,371 kilometers, yeah."
00:20:00,00:20:01,Exactly.
00:20:01,00:20:02,"Denton, probably."
00:20:02,00:20:03,"Wait, is that half the earth?"
00:20:03,00:20:04,Was that the whole thing?
00:20:04,00:20:05,That's to the core.
00:20:05,00:20:06,From the surface.
00:20:06,00:20:07,Yeah.
00:20:07,00:20:13,I looked into actually what was going on in Australia in 1891 as a partial Aussie.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"I was sort of thinking, I have no idea what life was like back then."
00:20:16,00:20:21,"So, population of Australia back in 1891 was just over 3 million."
00:20:21,00:20:22,Wow.
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:27,"So, the population of London at the exact same time was 5 million something."
00:20:27,00:20:33,"So, the whole population of Australia, yeah, still underneath the city of London, they"
00:20:33,00:20:35,had really cool names for all of their leaders at the time.
00:20:35,00:20:38,The Premier of New South Wales was called Henry Parks.
00:20:38,00:20:40,Then you had the Premier of Western Australia who was called John Forrest.
00:20:40,00:20:41,"So, it's all sort of..."
00:20:41,00:20:42,Right.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Greenery-based.
00:20:43,00:20:46,"And then there's Philip Fish, Premier of Tasmania."
00:20:46,00:20:47,He was very cool.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"But the most exciting thing was Banjo Patterson, who was our sort of greatest poet, really"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"songwriter, Banjo Patterson."
00:20:53,00:20:57,So he wrote Waltzing Matilda and he wrote Man from Snowy River.
00:20:57,00:21:00,He wrote in 1891 his Masterpiece.
00:21:00,00:21:01,Which was?
00:21:01,00:21:03,"No, it was called his Masterpiece."
00:21:03,00:21:04,It was a poem.
00:21:04,00:21:05,It's very obscure and no one's really heard of it.
00:21:05,00:21:06,Very good.
00:21:06,00:21:07,Yeah.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Thank you.
00:21:08,00:21:09,Thank you.
00:21:09,00:21:12,Do you know what the deepest building in the world is?
00:21:12,00:21:13,No.
00:21:13,00:21:15,"Well, according to my research, which was..."
00:21:15,00:21:16,"Wait, is this a quiz question?"
00:21:16,00:21:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:17,00:21:18,Why don't you do that?
00:21:18,00:21:24,"But you could get it, actually, think of a country where the rules at one stage were that you"
00:21:24,00:21:25,"could go really, really deep..."
00:21:25,00:21:26,Australia.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Australia.
00:21:27,00:21:28,So it's the deepest building.
00:21:28,00:21:29,So the Sydney Opera House.
00:21:29,00:21:30,It's correct.
00:21:30,00:21:31,"Oh, yes."
00:21:31,00:21:34,"Well, this is according to ConstructionWeekOnline.com and I couldn't really find much evidence"
00:21:34,00:21:35,apart from that.
00:21:35,00:21:40,"But apparently, the Car Park extends 12 stories into the earth and that's the deepest"
00:21:40,00:21:41,basement in the world.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Wow.
00:21:42,00:21:43,It's so really.
00:21:43,00:21:48,It's also the fifth deepest that we've ever dug as a sort of operating building in
00:21:48,00:21:49,the world.
00:21:49,00:21:52,So that's 120 feet deep.
00:21:52,00:21:59,"The second deepest we've ever gone is the Large Hadron Collider, which is 575 feet deep."
00:21:59,00:22:01,But the deepest of all.
00:22:01,00:22:02,Do you guys know?
00:22:02,00:22:03,There's like boreholes that they have to have.
00:22:03,00:22:05,So this is where people work.
00:22:05,00:22:07,So this is like a building effectively.
00:22:07,00:22:08,"Oh, I'm fine."
00:22:08,00:22:09,"No, okay."
00:22:09,00:22:10,Have we heard of this building?
00:22:10,00:22:11,"No, it's a laboratory in China."
00:22:11,00:22:12,How are we supposed to get that?
00:22:12,00:22:13,"Well, no."
00:22:13,00:22:14,I was going to ask you more.
00:22:14,00:22:19,"So if the second deepest is 575 feet, what do you think the deepest is?"
00:22:19,00:22:20,575.5.
00:22:20,00:22:21,Wow.
00:22:21,00:22:22,No.
00:22:22,00:22:23,No.
00:22:23,00:22:24,"No, very far away."
00:22:24,00:22:25,12 kilometers.
00:22:25,00:22:27,"It's 7,900 feet deep."
00:22:27,00:22:28,What?
00:22:28,00:22:32,"And that is a, yes, deepest building in the world or laboratory."
00:22:32,00:22:34,It's inside a mountain.
00:22:34,00:22:37,"But I thought that's a cheat because a mountain is above ground, but actually it starts."
00:22:37,00:22:38,They start counting it.
00:22:38,00:22:41,I believe from the bottom of the mountain going down into the earth.
00:22:41,00:22:42,And which supervillain lives there?
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yes.
00:22:43,00:22:45,That's in China.
00:22:45,00:22:46,"Yeah, it's in China."
00:22:46,00:22:47,What is it?
00:22:47,00:22:52,The idea is that so it's a laboratory and I think they want to study the background radiation
00:22:52,00:22:53,and dark matter and so on.
00:22:53,00:22:57,"And the lower you go, radiation becomes less, so they do it from there, but I don't know"
00:22:57,00:22:58,how they can see.
00:22:58,00:22:59,But yeah.
00:22:59,00:23:00,How they can see.
00:23:00,00:23:01,They'll be electric lights and stuff.
00:23:01,00:23:02,There we go.
00:23:02,00:23:03,They probably do have that technology.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Yeah.
00:23:04,00:23:08,"Since we, you know, we're investigating dark, mushroom background radiation now."
00:23:08,00:23:10,I think they're going to bring a candle down at the very least.
00:23:10,00:23:20,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:23:20,00:23:22,And that is Chazinski.
00:23:22,00:23:27,My fact this week is that jumping spiders that wear eyeliner are more likely to be eastern
00:23:27,00:23:28,by their mate.
00:23:28,00:23:29,"Well, yeah."
00:23:29,00:23:33,"So the way this works is, and this is some experiments that are being done in a lab in"
00:23:33,00:23:34,Florida.
00:23:34,00:23:37,It's a lab of a behavioral ecologist called Lisa Taylor.
00:23:37,00:23:40,And she was looking at how jumping spiders kind of flirt with each other.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"And so if you're jumping spider male, one of the problems is with a lot of spiders is"
00:23:44,00:23:48,"that if you're trying to flirt with a female, there's sort of an equal chance that she'll"
00:23:48,00:23:49,eat you instead.
00:23:49,00:23:54,"So I think about one in five jumping spiders who tried to flirt with females, then get attacked"
00:23:54,00:23:55,and they tried to eat them.
00:23:55,00:23:59,I like those odds.
00:23:59,00:24:02,And she noticed that some of them have these really bright red and white stripes on their
00:24:02,00:24:06,faces to make themselves look a bit toxic so that it doesn't get eaten by the mate.
00:24:06,00:24:11,"And so she was like, ""If I put some black eyeliner on their eyes to cover up these red stripes,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"they now won't look toxic and they'll get eaten."""
00:24:13,00:24:18,"And she said, ""She did find that suddenly they stopped eating them."""
00:24:18,00:24:19,Wow.
00:24:19,00:24:20,Once the stripes were taken.
00:24:20,00:24:22,I thought it was that the red complexion signifies health.
00:24:22,00:24:26,"And the females were noticing the colour and saying, ""Oh, good, nice and healthy."""
00:24:26,00:24:27,"Well, it's both."
00:24:27,00:24:28,It's a combination.
00:24:28,00:24:29,So red signifies health.
00:24:29,00:24:30,"So they think, ""Oh, good."
00:24:30,00:24:31,"I want to shag that."""
00:24:31,00:24:33,But it also signifies toxicity.
00:24:33,00:24:34,"So they think, ""I don't want to eat it."""
00:24:34,00:24:38,"So that's exactly what you want as a male because you want sex, but you don't want to be eaten."
00:24:38,00:24:41,That's why are they not all red all the time?
00:24:41,00:24:43,"Evolution doesn't start at the end point, James, does it?"
00:24:43,00:24:44,You're quite right.
00:24:44,00:24:45,It just takes time.
00:24:45,00:24:49,And they're doing more experiments on them now where they're putting false eyelashes on
00:24:49,00:24:50,the top of their heads.
00:24:50,00:24:51,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:51,00:24:54,So some of them have these tufts which may indicate genetic fitness.
00:24:54,00:24:57,And so they're gluing little bits of false eyelashes onto the top of their heads to get
00:24:57,00:25:01,them extra tuft and seeing if that indicates anything to the females.
00:25:01,00:25:06,"So they're basically making themselves very, very slightly taller to improve their amazing,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,amazing.
00:25:07,00:25:08,Yeah.
00:25:08,00:25:09,But it's interesting.
00:25:09,00:25:14,It sounds like the tests are aimed at helping a helpless male as in it's trying to walk
00:25:14,00:25:19,because the jumping spider basically doesn't even know which is his own species when
00:25:19,00:25:20,he woos.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:21,00:25:26,"He just, whatever he walks up to, whichever spider he starts dancing and trying to woo, even"
00:25:26,00:25:28,"if they can't breed, and it leads to nothing."
00:25:28,00:25:32,"So he exerts all this energy for nothing, he just has no idea."
00:25:32,00:25:33,He doesn't just lead to nothing.
00:25:33,00:25:37,They frequently get eaten because they approach the spider of the wrong species and start
00:25:37,00:25:38,flirting.
00:25:38,00:25:39,Yeah.
00:25:39,00:25:40,That's like flirting with a lion.
00:25:40,00:25:41,Yeah.
00:25:41,00:25:42,Isn't it?
00:25:42,00:25:45,If you couldn't tell a woman from a lion just every now and then you think I'm in here
00:25:45,00:25:46,and then you get eaten.
00:25:46,00:25:47,That'd be awful.
00:25:47,00:25:52,"Oh, I'm just going to pop down into that lovely ladies enclosure."
00:25:52,00:25:57,"And they dance for about 20 minutes, which is a long time if you're a spider because"
00:25:57,00:25:59,they only live for two years.
00:25:59,00:26:01,So that's equivalent.
00:26:01,00:26:05,"If every time we had sex, we had to do an 11 hour caught ship dance, that's equivalent"
00:26:05,00:26:06,of that.
00:26:06,00:26:07,Wow.
00:26:07,00:26:08,"Oh, my God."
00:26:08,00:26:09,That's amazing.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Which is worth a try.
00:26:10,00:26:11,I think it is.
00:26:11,00:26:12,You'd be too tired by the end though.
00:26:12,00:26:13,You'd be.
00:26:13,00:26:14,You don't have to evolve.
00:26:14,00:26:17,It'll never know as to that it's a lion.
00:26:17,00:26:21,"I was reading about how jumping spiders jump how they get the, why they're given that name"
00:26:21,00:26:23,because they can leap huge heights.
00:26:23,00:26:27,"I think one was found in the UK recently that could leap six foot, which I think is"
00:26:27,00:26:28,a record.
00:26:28,00:26:32,What I thought was it must be their muscular legs that allows a jumping spider to leap.
00:26:32,00:26:33,That's not the case.
00:26:33,00:26:37,"What they do is they segment their muscles into different, so basically their leg is broken"
00:26:37,00:26:39,up into two different bits.
00:26:39,00:26:44,And the leap comes from them slamming blood into the bottom of their legs.
00:26:44,00:26:48,"And that just lobs them off, gives their legs a reaction to jump."
00:26:48,00:26:49,It's not actual muscle.
00:26:49,00:26:50,Wow.
00:26:50,00:26:52,"So they must feel really lightheaded when they do it, right?"
00:26:52,00:26:54,Because all the blood's gone to their legs.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:56,That's true.
00:26:56,00:26:58,"So do you think every time they jump, they pass out in the air."
00:26:58,00:26:59,"It must be, right?"
00:26:59,00:27:00,Yeah.
00:27:00,00:27:02,But the other thing is that they can stop halfway through a jump.
00:27:02,00:27:03,What?
00:27:03,00:27:04,It's pretty cool.
00:27:04,00:27:05,What do you mean by that?
00:27:05,00:27:10,So they can spin a really quick line of silk and then use that as a drag line to create
00:27:10,00:27:11,air resistance.
00:27:11,00:27:12,That's fine.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Yeah.
00:27:13,00:27:17,"Like, basically, yeah, just like Spider-Man, so they can just stop halfway through a jumping"
00:27:17,00:27:18,if they decide it's a bad idea.
00:27:18,00:27:19,Yeah.
00:27:19,00:27:20,Or slow down dramatically on there.
00:27:20,00:27:24,"And they always, a lot of them often do it to make sure they don't massively crash land."
00:27:24,00:27:28,"So if you just jump with no drag line, then you face first teeth out."
00:27:28,00:27:31,"But with the drag line, they can sort of reorient themselves in the air."
00:27:31,00:27:32,Yeah.
00:27:32,00:27:33,It's very clever.
00:27:33,00:27:36,"I read about the dancing and how it evolved, because like Hannah says, you don't start"
00:27:36,00:27:39,the end with evolution.
00:27:39,00:27:44,"And in this article, they said that basically you do your dance as a spider and the female"
00:27:44,00:27:46,is generally not interested.
00:27:46,00:27:50,"And so you have to do a slightly better dance, and then she is interested."
00:27:50,00:27:54,"And then the next generation does that slightly better dance, but then their generation isn't"
00:27:54,00:27:55,that interested.
00:27:55,00:27:59,"So that's why the dances are so long and complicated, because basically over the millions and millions"
00:27:59,00:28:03,"of years, they've been improving their dance moves, but do they do the better and better?"
00:28:03,00:28:06,Do they do the history of all the dance moves until they get to the end?
00:28:06,00:28:07,New move.
00:28:07,00:28:08,That's why it's 20 minutes.
00:28:08,00:28:09,Yeah.
00:28:09,00:28:13,"So basically you're doing, if you try to do the dance moves that you'll great, great, great,"
00:28:13,00:28:17,"great, great, great grandfather did, it wouldn't work on the current crop of spider-Man."
00:28:17,00:28:22,"I can't confirm that if you do the Charleston, it will get exactly as very little interest."
00:28:22,00:28:27,"That certainly means that we're much less involved in spiders, because they're doing that"
00:28:27,00:28:28,and we've got flossing.
00:28:28,00:28:32,"After millions of years of evolution, humans have managed to do a flossing dance."
00:28:32,00:28:36,Or is it true that the flossing is the absolute epitome of the possibility of dancing this
00:28:36,00:28:37,millions of years?
00:28:37,00:28:41,"No, I don't think it is true."
00:28:41,00:28:46,"So after a female jumping spider's mate for the first time, many of them will never have"
00:28:46,00:28:47,any interest in sex ever again.
00:28:47,00:28:48,Oh.
00:28:48,00:28:49,I know.
00:28:49,00:28:50,This is just like my marriage.
00:28:50,00:28:54,I don't even know why it's so much like that.
00:28:54,00:28:55,It's completely fine.
00:28:55,00:28:56,It's completely fine.
00:28:56,00:28:57,And you're a comedian.
00:28:57,00:28:58,It's the law.
00:28:58,00:29:11,"I wasn't saying my wife was fat, but she got into every Chinese theme part for free."
00:29:11,00:29:12,My goodness.
00:29:12,00:29:13,Okay.
00:29:13,00:29:18,"So there's a species called Survivor Incana, and it was called and tested and they have sex"
00:29:18,00:29:19,only once.
00:29:19,00:29:23,"And then the females, they just have all the sperm they need for the rest of their life."
00:29:23,00:29:25,So they can produce lots of generations.
00:29:25,00:29:26,Yeah.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"So they keep the sperm ready, don't they?"
00:29:29,00:29:30,They just store it.
00:29:30,00:29:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:31,00:29:33,So that's all they need of one chick.
00:29:33,00:29:34,Sometimes two.
00:29:34,00:29:36,Sometimes they go back for one more portion of sex.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Wow.
00:29:37,00:29:38,Luckily guys.
00:29:38,00:29:39,Yeah.
00:29:39,00:29:44,So every poor husband is desperately hoping for that second chick.
00:29:44,00:29:45,His whole life.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"So there's a really cool thing about some jumping spiders, actually at least 30 different"
00:29:48,00:29:52,"species, which practice bondage with females."
00:29:52,00:29:55,And this is actually a quite a good way of not letting them attack an EU.
00:29:55,00:29:59,And so they sort of tie them up in silk before sex.
00:29:59,00:30:02,So you cripple the woman by tying her to your wearable tying her legs together.
00:30:02,00:30:06,"And then you're giving me a look like that's unfair, but she is going to eat you if you don't"
00:30:06,00:30:07,do it.
00:30:07,00:30:08,"No, no."
00:30:08,00:30:09,And that's true.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Yeah.
00:30:10,00:30:11,And that's true.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yeah.
00:30:12,00:30:13,And that's true.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:15,And that's true.
00:30:15,00:30:16,Yeah.
00:30:16,00:30:21,"They're known quite swiftly as bridal veils, these things in the quite euphemistically you"
00:30:21,00:30:22,might say.
00:30:22,00:30:23,"Well, yes, indeed."
00:30:23,00:30:27,"Because the bridal veil isn't massive and doesn't have weight all around it, so cure the"
00:30:27,00:30:28,woman to the floor.
00:30:28,00:30:31,How do you think I got married?
00:30:31,00:30:32,Again.
00:30:32,00:30:34,Can't help it.
00:30:34,00:30:38,"Well, that is, yeah, that's where something."
00:30:38,00:30:39,Yeah.
00:30:39,00:30:40,Yeah.
00:30:40,00:30:41,It's handy.
00:30:41,00:30:46,And they actually tested this because a scientist wanted to work out if the ones who
00:30:46,00:30:49,were unable to spin these things got eaten more regularly.
00:30:49,00:30:54,"And so again, they did this very cool experiment where they put dental silicon into their web"
00:30:54,00:30:57,"spinning apparatus, which means that they can't use it anymore."
00:30:57,00:30:59,And the way they immobilize spiders so that they're able to do this is they put them
00:30:59,00:31:00,in the freezer.
00:31:00,00:31:03,And apparently that temporary immobilizes a spider.
00:31:03,00:31:05,So this is just scientists always do this.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Okay.
00:31:06,00:31:10,"So there's jumping spiders, some jumping spiders, they call it singing, basically they rub"
00:31:10,00:31:14,the body segments together and it makes vibrations which get communicated to the female
00:31:14,00:31:18,"and the females hear it through a slit in their legs, which is quite cool."
00:31:18,00:31:22,And every spider has its own special embellishments that he adds.
00:31:22,00:31:28,"So 7% of courtships, whether that happens, end in the male being eaten, which is not great"
00:31:28,00:31:29,"odds, but not terrible."
00:31:29,00:31:34,But researchers then incapacitated the males and stopped them from singing.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"I don't know how, whether they just, you know, put that made their bodies stiffer so they"
00:31:38,00:31:40,couldn't rub the sections together.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Are you ashamed of them?
00:31:41,00:31:43,If you just say that was really out of tune or something?
00:31:43,00:31:44,"Yeah, they're ashamed of them."
00:31:44,00:31:47,They did something stop them from singing.
00:31:47,00:31:51,"And if the males aren't allowed to sing by researchers, 30% get eaten."
00:31:51,00:31:52,And really?
00:31:52,00:31:55,So there are at least three separate experiments where researchers have stopped male spiders
00:31:55,00:31:57,from not being eaten in their courtships.
00:31:57,00:31:58,It's a bit of a theme.
00:31:58,00:32:02,"Yeah, and these researchers are starting to look like the bad guys aren't they?"
00:32:02,00:32:03,Think about it.
00:32:03,00:32:08,"So there are, there are actually animals in the wild that sort of wear and make up themselves"
00:32:08,00:32:10,without scientists supplying it to them.
00:32:10,00:32:11,Okay.
00:32:11,00:32:16,"And before about, there was that, um, vulture, uh, the bearded vulture, uh, rubs its head"
00:32:16,00:32:20,"in its bottom in, in soil and it sort of gets its face or scruffy."
00:32:20,00:32:25,"It gives it a reddish brown hue that it then uses to attract, uh, and probably intimidate"
00:32:25,00:32:26,possibly.
00:32:26,00:32:31,"But relevant to the jumping spider of the fact, um, there are assassin bugs, uh, that go"
00:32:31,00:32:36,around wearing the dead carcasses of the ants that they've killed.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"As a, what the article said is a sort of backpack."
00:32:38,00:32:42,So they just wear a bunch of them and it's to trick jumping spiders into not eating them.
00:32:42,00:32:45,So it's effectively a backpack of camouflage.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"And this is makeup, we're saying, right?"
00:32:47,00:32:52,"This is, uh, it's more, uh, sort of, you've done your makeup, you now need your bag."
00:32:52,00:32:53,It's in the putramons.
00:32:53,00:32:54,You're going out.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Yeah.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Imagine if you had your makeup artist.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"You're ready to go and tell me, and what would you like some blusher?"
00:32:59,00:33:05,"Could I have a few corpses piled onto my back please, and it's all around my body?"
00:33:05,00:33:06,Flamingos wear makeup.
00:33:06,00:33:07,Don't they?
00:33:07,00:33:08,Yeah.
00:33:08,00:33:09,But they sort of generate their own makeup.
00:33:09,00:33:11,So it's like having a mascara gland.
00:33:11,00:33:12,Really?
00:33:12,00:33:13,Yeah.
00:33:13,00:33:17,"So they have this oil, which they, uh, they secrete from a gland near their tails and, uh,"
00:33:17,00:33:18,it has various health effects.
00:33:18,00:33:23,"So it's not just used for cosmetic reasons, but they dorb the oil onto their feathers from"
00:33:23,00:33:24,the gland.
00:33:24,00:33:28,And one of the effects it has is to make them a deeper pink and scientists have observed
00:33:28,00:33:32,"that during the mating season, they do it much more often."
00:33:32,00:33:36,"So that seems to be an indication that they are, because, because being deep pink is"
00:33:36,00:33:37,"quite sexy, to a flamingo."
00:33:37,00:33:38,"It's like, well, it's like a fake tan."
00:33:38,00:33:39,"Yeah, a fake tan?"
00:33:39,00:33:41,"It's sort of real tan, actually, isn't it?"
00:33:41,00:33:46,"It's like having a sun cream gland near your bottom, which squirts out all over your body."
00:33:46,00:33:47,Yeah.
00:33:47,00:33:52,Would you rather have that or a ham for a ham?
00:33:52,00:33:53,That's such a nice--
00:33:53,00:33:54,"That's quite niche, that isn't it?"
00:33:54,00:33:55,Yeah.
00:33:55,00:33:56,The people who get it are going to love it.
00:33:56,00:33:57,It's going to explode.
00:33:57,00:34:01,That's incredible crossover.
00:34:01,00:34:07,"Okay, that's it."
