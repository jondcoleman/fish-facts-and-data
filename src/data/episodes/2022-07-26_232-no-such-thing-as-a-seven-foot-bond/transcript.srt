1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,980
 *starts playing*

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,380
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,300
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,020
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,460
 Anich Zinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,140
 facts from the last seven days and a no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,940
 Starting with my fact this week, my fact is that the legendary sumo wrestler, my noomi

8
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,860
 Shuhei, injected silicone into his scalp so that he could meet the height requirements

9
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,420
 to become a sumo.

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,420
 What were they?

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:01,500
 You had to be 173 centimeters tall, this was back in the day up until the 90s so that was

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 the height requirements.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 Is that about 5 foot 9?

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,340
 Yeah, I believe that about 5 foot 9.

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,560
 Yeah, and so a lot of wrestlers were very close, 5 foot 8, 5 foot 7 and they just weren't

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,680
 quite there and 172 centimeters and so what they used to do and this is what this wrestler

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,300
 Shuhei did, he went to a doctor and he had surgically inserted into his scalp a little

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,100
 bag that could be filled with silicon and the silicon would go up to 4 centimeters high.

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,500
 The other thing that they used to do before the silicon thing was bash themselves on the

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,540
 head so they get a lump which would then be just, you know like in a cartoon how it goes

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,940
 no, that's what they genuinely don't get that.

22
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,340
 You can't guarantee you're going to bruise like that.

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,540
 I would concentrate on growing hair instead of beating myself on the head.

24
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,980
 No, but they push, they push us a ruler down on your head, yeah.

25
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,620
 Also all sumo's have that quite flat hair don't they?

26
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,020
 Yeah, yeah, so this guy I just want to apologize if I've pronounced his name wrong.

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,940
 In fact, I'm just going to refer to him by his nickname I think instead.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,060
 Yeah, you should worry about him because he's pretty tall these days.

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,900
 He's definitely have you in a fight.

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,060
 Yeah, he's like 7 foot tall now.

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,060
 Yeah, it's funny.

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,060
 He keeps going.

33
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,060
 Yeah.

34
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
 No, he doesn't.

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,820
 You get one enlargement and then after a while it's not enough.

36
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,820
 Exactly.

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,820
 Yeah.

38
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,140
 So he has a nickname which he's known by to the fans which is Waza no Depato translates

39
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,260
 roughly as Department Store of Techniques.

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,260
 So I will refer to him.

41
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,260
 Department Store.

42
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,900
 Why do you think you could say the nickname easier than you could say my new Mishu?

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,940
 I actually just flew over that and then headed straight to the Department Store of Techniques.

44
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,340
 The Department Store of Techniques.

45
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,340
 He was an amazing guy.

46
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,740
 So he was known for using 33 different what they call Kimmerite which are basically finishing

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,140
 moves.

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,460
 He did one which was a triple attack force out.

49
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,180
 So he's simultaneously trapped the guy's leg, grabbed another and pushed his head into his

50
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,180
 chest.

51
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,020
 The opponent's head into the opponent's chest.

52
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
 Oh, sorry.

53
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
 What?

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,100
 He pushed his opponent's head into his opponent's chest.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
 Yeah.

56
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,180
 So he brought his head down in there while tripping him up and while grabbing a leg and that's

57
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
 called a triple threat.

58
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,980
 So it's kind of like you're forcing someone into a forward sort of thing.

59
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,780
 You trip them over and then you bend their head down.

60
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,780
 Yeah.

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,660
 So you don't push their head just straight down so it goes back into their chest.

62
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,500
 Which means maybe that they then don't need the height requirement.

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,460
 Automatic win.

64
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,860
 And these days you can qualify through speed and agility as well as height or instead of

65
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,860
 height.

66
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,860
 Can you?

67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,860
 Yeah.

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,300
 If you're really fast, really agile and tiny.

69
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,780
 There is one move in Sumo, one technique called Henker which I don't know if this guy did

70
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,500
 but it's the way that the winner of the Sumo championships in 2016 won it and the Henker

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,340
 is when your rival like hurdles towards you super fast to take you down and then you

72
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,180
 just step to the side like you're in a cartoon and your rival goes plummeting out of the ring

73
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,460
 and then you win that way.

74
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,260
 Does he run out of the ring and then not realise he's actually above the ground for a few seconds

75
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,260
 and then plummet.

76
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,260
 Yes, exactly.

77
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,780
 And I will pop out of his head and stuff.

78
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,980
 But the thing about this move is that even though it's a winning move, it's really frowned

79
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
 upon.

80
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,340
 So Sumo is a lot about honor and respect and you get booted by the crowds for doing this.

81
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,020
 So he won this championship, he's called Hakuho and he was massively booted by the crowds.

82
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,580
 A lot of them left before even listening to his victory speech and when he gave his post

83
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,340
 match speech, he just immediately apologised, he was on the verge of tears and said, "You

84
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,820
 know, I never thought that I'd win doing that move but I guess I did."

85
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
 Wow.

86
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
 Sorry.

87
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,300
 You know they all have this sort of bun of hair.

88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
 Yes.

89
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,780
 They have the same bun.

90
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
 I have read.

91
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,580
 I can't quite believe this but I've read that they're the only, you have to have that

92
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,180
 bun and if you're not in the game, you're not allowed to have the bun and when you retire,

93
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,980
 your bun gets cut off by your friends and family and colleagues and you're trained

94
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
 to cut the last strand of the bun.

95
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,180
 That's when you retire but there are only 55 master hairdressers who are allowed to do

96
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
 this bun.

97
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
 That's very cool.

98
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,180
 Yeah.

99
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,620
 And so they trained specifically as hairdressers in the art of that one specific thing.

100
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,420
 We've reached the limits of my knowledge and we've hurtled beyond it.

101
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,900
 The ritual when they cut it off is a major thing though, isn't it?

102
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,900
 There's often crying then.

103
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
 Oh, it's really sad.

104
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
 You seem like an emotional, emotional people.

105
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
 Very sad.

106
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
 Yeah, losing your bun.

107
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,580
 I suppose your whole life is being a sumo, isn't it?

108
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
 That's all they do.

109
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
 You don't do anything else.

110
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,580
 Yeah.

111
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,580
 And that's the symbol of it.

112
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
 Yeah.

113
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
 That was the symbol of doing this podcast.

114
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
 Typing with your hands, I suppose.

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,620
 Yeah, so much like your fingers off at the end.

116
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,620
 I'd cry.

117
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
 Yeah.

118
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,940
 For the last episode, we all have to cut off, cut each other's fingers off.

119
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
 Yeah.

120
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
 I think it's just taking our microphone.

121
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
 Yes.

122
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
 I didn't think it.

123
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,940
 They relieved.

124
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,740
 You know Sumo's before they start to fight, they clap their hands and they do that thing

125
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,180
 where they'll clap and then they spread their arms out really wide.

126
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,580
 Do you know why they do that?

127
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,420
 Is it to make themselves look bigger to their opponents so they're more scared?

128
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,940
 It definitely does serve that purpose and the way they do it does imply that's the reason.

129
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,140
 But officially, it is to show that you're not armed because you can't, you can't be armed

130
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
 in Sumo.

131
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,700
 I think also the stamping that they do is to drive away evil spirits or it traditionally

132
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
 is.

133
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
 Yes.

134
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
 And therefore it survives as a kind of remnant of that.

135
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
 Yeah.

136
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,500
 Because they also sprinkle salt, don't they, on the ring before going into it, which is

137
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,100
 also to purify it.

138
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
 And don't allow women in.

139
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
 Yep, that's true.

140
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
 To purify it as well.

141
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,460
 But that is right, though, isn't it?

142
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,460
 That's what they say.

143
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,460
 Yes.

144
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,300
 And there were two women went in this year in the news.

145
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
 Yeah.

146
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
 And I can't remember what happened.

147
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
 They basically had a heart attack.

148
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
 Yeah.

149
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
 Or something like that.

150
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
 They passed out.

151
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
 The women jumped in.

152
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,280
 They were qualified doctors and nurses and they jumped in and they immediately got told

153
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
 to get out of there.

154
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
 Yeah.

155
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
 Oh, this guy was dying.

156
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,900
 And then because they've been women in there, they had to throw a load of extra salt

157
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
 in.

158
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
 Yeah.

159
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,060
 In fact, they were skidding around on the salt and it ruined the whole match.

160
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,220
 It proves it's bad luck.

161
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,220
 There was a guy who was known for the salt, particularly.

162
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,700
 He used to throw just a lot of salt in the ring.

163
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,020
 So his name was Salt Shaker.

164
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,340
 That was his nickname.

165
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,020
 And yeah, that was sort of his pre-match ritual, which became his thing.

166
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,300
 Is it related to the fact that you throw salt over your shoulder?

167
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,100
 So do you throw salt over your left shoulder when have you eaten salt?

168
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
 Yeah, a little bit.

169
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
 Whenever you eat salt.

170
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
 Yeah.

171
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,300
 My dad's always done it's a huge way.

172
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,140
 Actually, we do it when we spill salt.

173
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
 I thought it was when he spilled salt.

174
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
 Oh, really?

175
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,300
 It's bad luck to spill salt.

176
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
 Oh, right.

177
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,980
 And that therefore you have to throw a bit more over your shoulder to counteract the evil.

178
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,900
 But I also do it if I have too much salt in my hands when I'm cooking.

179
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
 I have a bit left over.

180
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,740
 It goes over the shoulder rather than in the belly.

181
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
 Yeah.

182
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,260
 Under the pretence of doing it for good luck when really you're just too lazy to bother

183
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
 actually clearing up.

184
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,780
 I actually do that with all kitchen waste.

185
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,580
 Just something on high restrictions.

186
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,660
 So I did you know that MI5 has high restrictions?

187
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
 No.

188
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,580
 And these were introduced in 2004 and it makes a lot of sense.

189
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,140
 So as a man, you're not allowed to be taller than 5 for 11 as a woman you're not allowed to

190
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,580
 be taller than 5 for 8.

191
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,380
 Which is actually, you know, a lot of men are obviously taller than 5 11.

192
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,140
 But it's just so you don't stand out as much in a crowd.

193
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
 Literally.

194
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
 Yeah.

195
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,140
 It literally.

196
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,860
 I wonder how tall the James Bond is.

197
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
 I thought you might ask that.

198
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
 Yeah.

199
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
 I've heard an answer actually.

200
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
 Did you?

201
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
 So have you got them all?

202
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
 I have, yeah.

203
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
 6.

204
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
 I know that.

205
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
 So is it?

206
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
 MI6 have different high requirements.

207
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,620
 Apparently, MI6 has unofficial ones which are quite similar, but MI5s were official.

208
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,420
 But all the James Bond would not have been able to get into the Secret Service under these

209
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,260
 rules except for Daniel Craig who just slots in under.

210
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,540
 So I think he's 5 for 10 and a quarter and all the others are taller than 5 11.

211
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,860
 Could you have like part of your head removed to keep you underneath?

212
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,900
 Oh, that may be very, you've all conspicuous, I guess, if you have a flat head.

213
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,340
 But if you always wore a very boring hat, but that would make you seem taller.

214
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
 Yeah, that's true.

215
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
 Yeah.

216
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,580
 Maybe you need to cut off the bottom of your feet.

217
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
 Yeah.

218
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,420
 Well, I was going to say, I would have my feet extended as a sumo rather than my head.

219
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,740
 Because it's much less dangerous having foot surgery isn't it?

220
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
 I see.

221
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
 Extended as in like heels.

222
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
 Yeah, platform.

223
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
 Platforms underneath.

224
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
 Platform feet.

225
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
 Wow, that's cool.

226
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,740
 That would be a very good thing for a super villain to do to James Bond.

227
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,060
 It's just, instead of killing him, just give him massive leg extensions internally so

228
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,620
 he's 7 for 9 and he can't go any way.

229
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,900
 I think they are making a new James Bond, aren't they?

230
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
 Yeah.

231
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
 Presumably, there's still time to slip that into the script.

232
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,020
 I think they're looking for a director at the moment.

233
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
 Oh, yeah.

234
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
 Because Daddy Files not doing it.

235
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,020
 I think the first four person directed James Bond film.

236
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,780
 I was reading in China that if you want to become a teacher, you have to be a certain

237
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,780
 height as well.

238
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
 School teachers.

239
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,620
 So this was a story that the BBC published this year about a lady who had qualified

240
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,700
 for her teaching certificate.

241
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,900
 She'd done the years of studying and at graduation.

242
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
 They measured her and she wasn't tall enough.

243
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,580
 You can't teach if you're under four foot nine.

244
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
 Speaking of restrictions in China.

245
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,140
 So theme park rides often have a high restriction, but there's a new theme park ride in China

246
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,940
 or a new restriction on it, which is a weight restriction.

247
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,460
 But this is more that you have to be over a certain weight in order to ride for free.

248
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,580
 So this is a theme park called Tang Paradise Park and it gives free entry to any women

249
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,220
 who's faster than it's really famous, really respected and admired concubine called Yang Guifei,

250
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,100
 who's an eight century consort and she's like one of China's four great beauties apparently.

251
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,460
 And if you're heavier than she is, so she was 61.8 kilos, you ride for free and it's trying

252
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,740
 to destigmatise chobbiness.

253
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,220
 But you do have to get on a giant pair of weighing scales before you get on the ride.

254
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
 Does that do the job?

255
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
 Kind of a shaming.

256
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,620
 It's a real fat shaming, but here's your consolation prize, a roller coaster.

257
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
 And I just say, I don't.

258
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,620
 It's a roller coaster of emotions, but I like this one.

259
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:33,340
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

260
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,740
 Okay, my fact this week is that a quarter of all mentions of teeth in the Bible also include

261
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,820
 the word gnashing.

262
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,580
 I mainly know the word gnashing from gnashing.

263
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
 Oh yeah.

264
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,460
 His dog in the bino, I reckon he got his name from the biblical word.

265
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
 I guess he must have done.

266
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,860
 He was very devout.

267
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:59,780
 So for the QI fact book, I had to find a fact which was related to both teeth and the Bible

268
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,500
 because all the facts are in order.

269
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,420
 And so I went on to the Bible gateway and searched the King James Bible for mentions of teeth

270
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,860
 and there are 56 that I found and 15 of them have the word gnash in one of its various forms.

271
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,060
 The first one is in Job and he says he terreth me in his wrath, who hated me.

272
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,260
 He gnasheth upon me with his teeth, mine enemy sharp enough his eyes upon me.

273
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,180
 So basically just, it's a lot of gnashing of teeth, a lot of people go to hell, a lot of

274
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,540
 people, you know, not so happy in the Bible.

275
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,540
 Is gnashing of teeth?

276
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,540
 Is that like a...

277
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,460
 Yeah, it's like grinding your teeth in and usually it's in anger or in pain or in agony

278
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,460
 or something like that.

279
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
 Yeah.

280
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,220
 It's called teeth gnashing, you're gnashing your teeth and it's a dental problem for many

281
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
 people.

282
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,060
 So I think one in ten people grind their teeth.

283
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,860
 So it officially is grinding, but grind their teeth and gnash their teeth at night.

284
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
 But it is bad.

285
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
 It's interesting.

286
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,700
 So people who are teeth, people who are sleep brookses, as they're called, will be gnashing

287
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,500
 their teeth for up to 40 minutes per hour and that's with a force of about 250 pounds.

288
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,260
 So that's a huge amount, you know, that's two or three people.

289
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,820
 And that's compared to sitting in your mouth, just sitting in your mouth on your jaw, gnashing

290
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
 your teeth together.

291
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
 That's bad.

292
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,300
 And that's compared to in the daytime, if you're an awake brookster, it's just 20 minutes

293
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,100
 per day as opposed to 40 minutes an hour and it's only 20 pounds of force.

294
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,500
 So that's quite a lot of force you're exercising on your little mouth in your sleep.

295
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 Yeah.

296
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,140
 I was reading about teeth just throughout the ages and the one that I had not heard about

297
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,700
 before was what the Mayans used to do with their teeth.

298
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
 Oh, what do they do?

299
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
 Have we spoken about this before?

300
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
 I don't think we have.

301
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,980
 So they were not only very proud of their teeth.

302
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,540
 They had a lot of dentistry work done to them and their dentists have been said when people

303
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,860
 have looked through the records of the different type of things that they don't quite advance

304
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
 for their time.

305
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,260
 And one thing they wanted to do was pimp up their teeth just to make it really shiny and

306
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,260
 beautiful.

307
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,180
 So there were two things that they could do.

308
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,900
 One is that they would just cut into each tooth and give it a little indentation.

309
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,340
 So it just looked a bit more interesting than you just your regular flat tooth and they

310
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,860
 would leave that as was.

311
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,180
 But sometimes they would create this indentation, this little crater and they would put little bits

312
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,700
 of jewelry inside that would sit kind of like how a lot of rappers, like Kanye West did

313
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
 that recent.

314
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,820
 Not the jewels, but I heard that Mick Jagger got that done with the jewel, but I don't think

315
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
 he did.

316
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
 I think that's just a story I got told.

317
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,260
 It's not a good rumor, is it?

318
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,260
 Surely you could just look at his face and say, oh no, he didn't do that.

319
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,540
 I think he's had it taken out now, but I think you got a bit of an emerald put in and

320
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,300
 someone said, oh, you people kept saying to him, oh, you got spinach in your teeth.

321
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,380
 But this is a very vague memory.

322
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,380
 Yeah.

323
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,380
 So I don't think it's true.

324
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,820
 Can't believe that's the most exciting rumours I'm going to make up about Mick Jagger.

325
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,980
 I mean, his whole life consists of things more exciting than that.

326
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,500
 So you know what the minds would have been digging into, they would have been digging into

327
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,300
 the skin of the teeth, which is another phrase from the King James Bible.

328
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
 Yeah.

329
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,900
 And it's a very weird one as well, because the job says he'd just escaped by the skin of

330
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
 his teeth.

331
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
 But what does it actually mean?

332
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,780
 Well, a lot of job is, there's a lot of gnashing in job because basically he's him being

333
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,900
 tormented by God and the devil and everyone, right?

334
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,860
 He's just having a pretty bad time of it.

335
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,860
 Awful.

336
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,220
 And so this, in this case, he says, my bone cleave to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped

337
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,220
 with the skin of my teeth.

338
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
 Wow.

339
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,780
 But it is so unclear what it means and everyone says, oh, I suppose that means you escape

340
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,220
 with as narrow a margin as the skin on your teeth is narrow, but when you read that sentence,

341
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,420
 it's not really what that would mean in English, is it?

342
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,620
 Maybe a few few stepskin.

343
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,460
 I think that's the obvious conclusion.

344
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,780
 We were talking a long time ago.

345
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,380
 And people always left it all at once.

346
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,380
 So it loads, I mean, you know, bite the dust is a thing that's from the Bible, but I look

347
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,300
 for the, well, it's supposedly it is, but the phrase is, they that dwell in the wilderness

348
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,900
 shall bow before him and his enemies shall lick the dust, which is slightly different

349
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
 to bite the dust.

350
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
 It is.

351
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
 Yeah.

352
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
 It's another one.

353
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
 I'll lick the dust.

354
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
 It does not say ring.

355
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
 I've got a quiz question for you guys.

356
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
 Okay.

357
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,660
 In which religious book does Satan appear to tempt Adam and Eve to eat forbidden fruit?

358
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
 Yep.

359
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
 The Bible.

360
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
 James Harkin.

361
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
 It is not the Bible.

362
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
 The Torah.

363
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
 I'm afraid.

364
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
 No.

365
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
 Keep going.

366
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,140
 I'm the grunth of seekers of all you've gone too obscure.

367
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
 Oh, you've gone too obscure.

368
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
 The Book of Mormon.

369
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,260
 It's the Quran.

370
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,260
 Ah.

371
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,700
 So in Genesis in the Bible, there is no mention of the fact that it's Satan.

372
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,860
 It's just a snake.

373
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,780
 And this was an interpretation that was put on it many centuries later.

374
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,780
 It was in the inter-testimental period between all the New Testament.

375
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,580
 They thought, I bet that was Satan.

376
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,260
 But actually, it's just a snake in Genesis.

377
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,100
 But in the Quran, when it describes a story, it says that Adam was tempted by Satan.

378
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
 Wow.

379
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
 I've got a fact about Bibles.

380
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
 Go on.

381
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,660
 Do you know about the space Bibles?

382
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
 Space Bibles.

383
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,660
 No.

384
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
 So are they Bibles that have been sent into space?

385
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
 Exactly.

386
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
 Apollo 13.

387
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,660
 Well, they're exactly literally what they did.

388
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
 You're good at this.

389
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,660
 Apollo 13.

390
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
 And 300 Bibles.

391
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
 300?

392
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
 No.

393
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
 Where?

394
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
 Where?

395
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:05,660
 No.

396
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
 No.

397
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
 No.

398
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
 There were 300.

399
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
 What?

400
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
 They needed so much rocket fuel for that, surely.

401
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
 I know.

402
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,660
 But you need to be able to convert the aliens when you meet them.

403
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,980
 So what it was, you don't remember a microfilm, you know, of making things incredibly small.

404
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,060
 So they were all one inch by one inch, and each of them was printed with all the Holy

405
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,540
 Scriptures.

406
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,620
 And obviously Apollo 13 went pretty badly wrong, but the Bible survived.

407
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,180
 And they went up again with Apollo 14, and 100 of them went to the moon.

408
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,140
 And the other 200 just went up into space.

409
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,940
 Don't you think that that seems like a bad omen?

410
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,740
 I wouldn't want to be on Apollo 14 with the same Bibles that were on Apollo 13.

411
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,820
 I just think that God was angry for some reason.

412
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,100
 Do you know that you're, as of last year, you're no longer allowed to sell biblical teeth,

413
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,180
 or any relic-y teeth?

414
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,540
 And these days, they now have started giving a certificate of authenticity to relics.

415
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,140
 They've always had that though, haven't they?

416
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,420
 Well, I think they now saying officially that these are the only ones recognized by the

417
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
 church.

418
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,820
 So if there's a museum that has, for example, I read one has Jesus Christ's bread cutting

419
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,220
 knife from the Last Supper, claims to have it, unless that now has a certificate it cannot

420
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
 be considered.

421
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,420
 Who could just wander around going, "Yeah, that one looks real."

422
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
 No, that was not.

423
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,180
 I mean, who's deciding what gets a certificate?

424
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,620
 Obviously none of them are real.

425
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
 Well, sorry guys.

426
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,580
 They would disagree with that, I imagine.

427
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,860
 Yeah, because they would say none of them is real.

428
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
 Is real.

429
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
 Is real.

430
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,340
 I don't always make it about that, Andy.

431
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:50,640
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number three, and that is Andy.

432
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,100
 My fact is that if you bought land in Australia before 1891, you had the legal right to the land

433
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,060
 stretching all the way to the centre of the earth.

434
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,060
 Pretty cool.

435
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
 That was amazing.

436
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
 Yeah.

437
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
 And that's why they always say it's so hot in Australia.

438
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,660
 They're all living on there, right in the cool.

439
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,500
 And so this was an old law, and there was a sort of historical Latin phrase, "Cueoess,

440
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,140
 S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Quaid, Coilham, Ed, Ed, Ed, Imferos," which means whoever owns

441
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,100
 the soil holds title up to the heavens and down to the depths of hell.

442
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,020
 So that was a legal principle that you just owned all the land.

443
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,100
 So does the heavens extend as far as the infinite universe?

444
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
 Like where does that end?

445
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
 Well, that's the thing.

446
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,180
 I think it was before people really knew about the infinite universe.

447
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,020
 So they really undersold it when they...

448
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
 Yeah.

449
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
 They should have tried more.

450
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,340
 But the heaven was up there.

451
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,900
 That's true, which feels blasphemous to us selling a slice of heaven.

452
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
 Yeah.

453
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
 No, up to the heavens.

454
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
 They didn't say penetrates of heaven.

455
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
 Oh, right.

456
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
 They didn't say up to the heavens.

457
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
 Yeah.

458
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
 Up to the heavens.

459
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
 But it was problematic, wasn't it?

460
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
 Because this was before airplanes were invented and before spades were invented.

461
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,580
 So you couldn't go very far off or down in those days.

462
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
 Exactly.

463
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
 Yeah.

464
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
 And then hot air ballooning was the thing which changed it.

465
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,980
 Because people kept being worried about hot air balloons and saying, "Oh, you've trespassed

466
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
 over my house."

467
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,020
 And you're hot air ballooning way up there.

468
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
 Yeah.

469
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,940
 But on the court case, wasn't there with the guy who invented Grenada.

470
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
 Okay.

471
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,940
 And he owned a house.

472
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,020
 He's called the Baron of Lee or something like that.

473
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
 Is this the...

474
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,260
 Is this the chicken guy?

475
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,260
 Oh.

476
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:20,220
 Because there was a farm called Thomas Lee Corsby who in 1945, and he sued the US government

477
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,180
 because they'd been flying the airplanes above his property.

478
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,220
 So about 83 feet above his property.

479
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,260
 And it was causing his chickens to fly into the walls and kill themselves, apparently.

480
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
 He argued.

481
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,980
 And he said he'd have to give up farming because so many of his chickens have died.

482
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,020
 And that's when it was kind of enshrined in law, how much land you were entitled to above

483
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
 you.

484
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,540
 And it was established that you're not entitled to all of it, but you're entitled to enough

485
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,780
 land above your house that all your chickens don't die.

486
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,780
 Yeah.

487
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,980
 Actually, my one was the British law.

488
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
 So...

489
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
 Yeah.

490
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
 So that was the American one.

491
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,980
 Got it.

492
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
 Australia changed it too.

493
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
 I'm very sad to say.

494
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,980
 Did they?

495
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
 Yeah, 1891.

496
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
 They changed it.

497
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
 You'd know only get 15 meters down, as opposed to...

498
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
 It's not very much at all.

499
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,980
 Well, when you think it used to be 6,371 kilometers, yeah.

500
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
 Exactly.

501
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
 Denton, probably.

502
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
 Wait, is that half the earth?

503
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
 Was that the whole thing?

504
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
 That's to the core.

505
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
 From the surface.

506
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
 Yeah.

507
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,700
 I looked into actually what was going on in Australia in 1891 as a partial Aussie.

508
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,660
 I was sort of thinking, I have no idea what life was like back then.

509
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,940
 So, population of Australia back in 1891 was just over 3 million.

510
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
 Wow.

511
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
 Yeah.

512
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,100
 So, the population of London at the exact same time was 5 million something.

513
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,220
 So, the whole population of Australia, yeah, still underneath the city of London, they

514
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,380
 had really cool names for all of their leaders at the time.

515
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,180
 The Premier of New South Wales was called Henry Parks.

516
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,820
 Then you had the Premier of Western Australia who was called John Forrest.

517
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
 So, it's all sort of...

518
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
 Right.

519
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
 Greenery-based.

520
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,380
 And then there's Philip Fish, Premier of Tasmania.

521
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
 He was very cool.

522
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,900
 But the most exciting thing was Banjo Patterson, who was our sort of greatest poet, really

523
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,820
 songwriter, Banjo Patterson.

524
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,340
 So he wrote Waltzing Matilda and he wrote Man from Snowy River.

525
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,300
 He wrote in 1891 his Masterpiece.

526
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
 Which was?

527
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,060
 No, it was called his Masterpiece.

528
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
 It was a poem.

529
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,740
 It's very obscure and no one's really heard of it.

530
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
 Very good.

531
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
 Yeah.

532
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,740
 Thank you.

533
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
 Thank you.

534
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,940
 Do you know what the deepest building in the world is?

535
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,940
 No.

536
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,940
 Well, according to my research, which was...

537
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
 Wait, is this a quiz question?

538
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,940
 Oh, yeah.

539
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,940
 Why don't you do that?

540
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,260
 But you could get it, actually, think of a country where the rules at one stage were that you

541
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,500
 could go really, really deep...

542
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 Australia.

543
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 Australia.

544
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 So it's the deepest building.

545
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 So the Sydney Opera House.

546
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
 It's correct.

547
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 Oh, yes.

548
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,980
 Well, this is according to ConstructionWeekOnline.com and I couldn't really find much evidence

549
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
 apart from that.

550
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,940
 But apparently, the Car Park extends 12 stories into the earth and that's the deepest

551
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
 basement in the world.

552
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
 Wow.

553
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
 It's so really.

554
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,860
 It's also the fifth deepest that we've ever dug as a sort of operating building in

555
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,860
 the world.

556
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,820
 So that's 120 feet deep.

557
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:59,580
 The second deepest we've ever gone is the Large Hadron Collider, which is 575 feet deep.

558
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,100
 But the deepest of all.

559
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
 Do you guys know?

560
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,420
 There's like boreholes that they have to have.

561
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,820
 So this is where people work.

562
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
 So this is like a building effectively.

563
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,820
 Oh, I'm fine.

564
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,820
 No, okay.

565
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
 Have we heard of this building?

566
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
 No, it's a laboratory in China.

567
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
 How are we supposed to get that?

568
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
 Well, no.

569
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
 I was going to ask you more.

570
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,900
 So if the second deepest is 575 feet, what do you think the deepest is?

571
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
 575.5.

572
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
 Wow.

573
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
 No.

574
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
 No.

575
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
 No, very far away.

576
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
 12 kilometers.

577
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,540
 It's 7,900 feet deep.

578
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
 What?

579
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,380
 And that is a, yes, deepest building in the world or laboratory.

580
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,180
 It's inside a mountain.

581
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,380
 But I thought that's a cheat because a mountain is above ground, but actually it starts.

582
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
 They start counting it.

583
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,140
 I believe from the bottom of the mountain going down into the earth.

584
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
 And which supervillain lives there?

585
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,140
 Yes.

586
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
 That's in China.

587
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
 Yeah, it's in China.

588
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
 What is it?

589
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,300
 The idea is that so it's a laboratory and I think they want to study the background radiation

590
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,620
 and dark matter and so on.

591
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,660
 And the lower you go, radiation becomes less, so they do it from there, but I don't know

592
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
 how they can see.

593
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,660
 But yeah.

594
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
 How they can see.

595
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
 They'll be electric lights and stuff.

596
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
 There we go.

597
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
 They probably do have that technology.

598
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
 Yeah.

599
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,100
 Since we, you know, we're investigating dark, mushroom background radiation now.

600
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,700
 I think they're going to bring a candle down at the very least.

601
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:20,540
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

602
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,620
 And that is Chazinski.

603
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,140
 My fact this week is that jumping spiders that wear eyeliner are more likely to be eastern

604
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
 by their mate.

605
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
 Well, yeah.

606
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,300
 So the way this works is, and this is some experiments that are being done in a lab in

607
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
 Florida.

608
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,220
 It's a lab of a behavioral ecologist called Lisa Taylor.

609
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,500
 And she was looking at how jumping spiders kind of flirt with each other.

610
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,980
 And so if you're jumping spider male, one of the problems is with a lot of spiders is

611
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,220
 that if you're trying to flirt with a female, there's sort of an equal chance that she'll

612
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,380
 eat you instead.

613
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,540
 So I think about one in five jumping spiders who tried to flirt with females, then get attacked

614
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
 and they tried to eat them.

615
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,300
 I like those odds.

616
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,060
 And she noticed that some of them have these really bright red and white stripes on their

617
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,700
 faces to make themselves look a bit toxic so that it doesn't get eaten by the mate.

618
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,660
 And so she was like, "If I put some black eyeliner on their eyes to cover up these red stripes,

619
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,540
 they now won't look toxic and they'll get eaten."

620
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,380
 And she said, "She did find that suddenly they stopped eating them."

621
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
 Wow.

622
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
 Once the stripes were taken.

623
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,740
 I thought it was that the red complexion signifies health.

624
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,540
 And the females were noticing the colour and saying, "Oh, good, nice and healthy."

625
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
 Well, it's both.

626
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
 It's a combination.

627
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
 So red signifies health.

628
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
 So they think, "Oh, good.

629
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
 I want to shag that."

630
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
 But it also signifies toxicity.

631
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,940
 So they think, "I don't want to eat it."

632
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,540
 So that's exactly what you want as a male because you want sex, but you don't want to be eaten.

633
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,100
 That's why are they not all red all the time?

634
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,620
 Evolution doesn't start at the end point, James, does it?

635
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
 You're quite right.

636
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
 It just takes time.

637
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,340
 And they're doing more experiments on them now where they're putting false eyelashes on

638
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
 the top of their heads.

639
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,340
 Oh, yeah.

640
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,660
 So some of them have these tufts which may indicate genetic fitness.

641
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,540
 And so they're gluing little bits of false eyelashes onto the top of their heads to get

642
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,260
 them extra tuft and seeing if that indicates anything to the females.

643
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,020
 So they're basically making themselves very, very slightly taller to improve their amazing,

644
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
 amazing.

645
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
 Yeah.

646
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
 But it's interesting.

647
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:14,260
 It sounds like the tests are aimed at helping a helpless male as in it's trying to walk

648
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,780
 because the jumping spider basically doesn't even know which is his own species when

649
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
 he woos.

650
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,780
 Oh, yeah.

651
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,820
 He just, whatever he walks up to, whichever spider he starts dancing and trying to woo, even

652
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,980
 if they can't breed, and it leads to nothing.

653
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,300
 So he exerts all this energy for nothing, he just has no idea.

654
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
 He doesn't just lead to nothing.

655
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,420
 They frequently get eaten because they approach the spider of the wrong species and start

656
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
 flirting.

657
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
 Yeah.

658
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
 That's like flirting with a lion.

659
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
 Yeah.

660
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
 Isn't it?

661
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,420
 If you couldn't tell a woman from a lion just every now and then you think I'm in here

662
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
 and then you get eaten.

663
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
 That'd be awful.

664
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,780
 Oh, I'm just going to pop down into that lovely ladies enclosure.

665
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,460
 And they dance for about 20 minutes, which is a long time if you're a spider because

666
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,780
 they only live for two years.

667
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,380
 So that's equivalent.

668
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,460
 If every time we had sex, we had to do an 11 hour caught ship dance, that's equivalent

669
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
 of that.

670
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
 Wow.

671
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
 Oh, my God.

672
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,460
 That's amazing.

673
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
 Which is worth a try.

674
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
 I think it is.

675
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,460
 You'd be too tired by the end though.

676
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,460
 You'd be.

677
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460
 You don't have to evolve.

678
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 It'll never know as to that it's a lion.

679
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,540
 I was reading about how jumping spiders jump how they get the, why they're given that name

680
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,220
 because they can leap huge heights.

681
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,380
 I think one was found in the UK recently that could leap six foot, which I think is

682
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,380
 a record.

683
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,300
 What I thought was it must be their muscular legs that allows a jumping spider to leap.

684
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,420
 That's not the case.

685
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,820
 What they do is they segment their muscles into different, so basically their leg is broken

686
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,980
 up into two different bits.

687
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,900
 And the leap comes from them slamming blood into the bottom of their legs.

688
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,460
 And that just lobs them off, gives their legs a reaction to jump.

689
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
 It's not actual muscle.

690
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
 Wow.

691
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,740
 So they must feel really lightheaded when they do it, right?

692
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,540
 Because all the blood's gone to their legs.

693
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
 Yeah.

694
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
 That's true.

695
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,940
 So do you think every time they jump, they pass out in the air.

696
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
 It must be, right?

697
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
 Yeah.

698
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,740
 But the other thing is that they can stop halfway through a jump.

699
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
 What?

700
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,740
 It's pretty cool.

701
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
 What do you mean by that?

702
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,300
 So they can spin a really quick line of silk and then use that as a drag line to create

703
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 air resistance.

704
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,300
 That's fine.

705
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
 Yeah.

706
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,040
 Like, basically, yeah, just like Spider-Man, so they can just stop halfway through a jumping

707
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,380
 if they decide it's a bad idea.

708
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,380
 Yeah.

709
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,580
 Or slow down dramatically on there.

710
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,580
 And they always, a lot of them often do it to make sure they don't massively crash land.

711
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,500
 So if you just jump with no drag line, then you face first teeth out.

712
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,880
 But with the drag line, they can sort of reorient themselves in the air.

713
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
 Yeah.

714
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
 It's very clever.

715
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,940
 I read about the dancing and how it evolved, because like Hannah says, you don't start

716
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,220
 the end with evolution.

717
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,460
 And in this article, they said that basically you do your dance as a spider and the female

718
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,300
 is generally not interested.

719
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,020
 And so you have to do a slightly better dance, and then she is interested.

720
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,260
 And then the next generation does that slightly better dance, but then their generation isn't

721
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,260
 that interested.

722
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,780
 So that's why the dances are so long and complicated, because basically over the millions and millions

723
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,340
 of years, they've been improving their dance moves, but do they do the better and better?

724
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,700
 Do they do the history of all the dance moves until they get to the end?

725
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
 New move.

726
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
 That's why it's 20 minutes.

727
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
 Yeah.

728
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,780
 So basically you're doing, if you try to do the dance moves that you'll great, great, great,

729
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,300
 great, great, great grandfather did, it wouldn't work on the current crop of spider-Man.

730
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,940
 I can't confirm that if you do the Charleston, it will get exactly as very little interest.

731
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,300
 That certainly means that we're much less involved in spiders, because they're doing that

732
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 and we've got flossing.

733
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,420
 After millions of years of evolution, humans have managed to do a flossing dance.

734
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,700
 Or is it true that the flossing is the absolute epitome of the possibility of dancing this

735
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
 millions of years?

736
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,980
 No, I don't think it is true.

737
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,060
 So after a female jumping spider's mate for the first time, many of them will never have

738
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,940
 any interest in sex ever again.

739
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
 Oh.

740
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
 I know.

741
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
 This is just like my marriage.

742
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,020
 I don't even know why it's so much like that.

743
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
 It's completely fine.

744
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
 It's completely fine.

745
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
 And you're a comedian.

746
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
 It's the law.

747
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:11,220
 I wasn't saying my wife was fat, but she got into every Chinese theme part for free.

748
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
 My goodness.

749
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
 Okay.

750
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,380
 So there's a species called Survivor Incana, and it was called and tested and they have sex

751
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
 only once.

752
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,000
 And then the females, they just have all the sperm they need for the rest of their life.

753
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,740
 So they can produce lots of generations.

754
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
 Yeah.

755
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,620
 So they keep the sperm ready, don't they?

756
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
 They just store it.

757
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,620
 Yeah, yeah.

758
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,140
 So that's all they need of one chick.

759
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
 Sometimes two.

760
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,980
 Sometimes they go back for one more portion of sex.

761
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
 Wow.

762
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
 Luckily guys.

763
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
 Yeah.

764
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,300
 So every poor husband is desperately hoping for that second chick.

765
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
 His whole life.

766
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,900
 So there's a really cool thing about some jumping spiders, actually at least 30 different

767
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,860
 species, which practice bondage with females.

768
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,940
 And this is actually a quite a good way of not letting them attack an EU.

769
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,340
 And so they sort of tie them up in silk before sex.

770
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,940
 So you cripple the woman by tying her to your wearable tying her legs together.

771
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,580
 And then you're giving me a look like that's unfair, but she is going to eat you if you don't

772
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,580
 do it.

773
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,580
 No, no.

774
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,580
 And that's true.

775
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
 Yeah.

776
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,580
 And that's true.

777
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,580
 Yeah.

778
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,580
 And that's true.

779
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
 Yeah.

780
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
 And that's true.

781
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,580
 Yeah.

782
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,340
 They're known quite swiftly as bridal veils, these things in the quite euphemistically you

783
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
 might say.

784
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
 Well, yes, indeed.

785
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,260
 Because the bridal veil isn't massive and doesn't have weight all around it, so cure the

786
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,260
 woman to the floor.

787
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,300
 How do you think I got married?

788
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
 Again.

789
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,580
 Can't help it.

790
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,740
 Well, that is, yeah, that's where something.

791
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
 Yeah.

792
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
 Yeah.

793
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
 It's handy.

794
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,220
 And they actually tested this because a scientist wanted to work out if the ones who

795
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,380
 were unable to spin these things got eaten more regularly.

796
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,060
 And so again, they did this very cool experiment where they put dental silicon into their web

797
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,020
 spinning apparatus, which means that they can't use it anymore.

798
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,700
 And the way they immobilize spiders so that they're able to do this is they put them

799
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
 in the freezer.

800
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,460
 And apparently that temporary immobilizes a spider.

801
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,900
 So this is just scientists always do this.

802
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
 Okay.

803
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,700
 So there's jumping spiders, some jumping spiders, they call it singing, basically they rub

804
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,780
 the body segments together and it makes vibrations which get communicated to the female

805
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,700
 and the females hear it through a slit in their legs, which is quite cool.

806
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,860
 And every spider has its own special embellishments that he adds.

807
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:28,180
 So 7% of courtships, whether that happens, end in the male being eaten, which is not great

808
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,740
 odds, but not terrible.

809
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,780
 But researchers then incapacitated the males and stopped them from singing.

810
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,620
 I don't know how, whether they just, you know, put that made their bodies stiffer so they

811
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,420
 couldn't rub the sections together.

812
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,420
 Are you ashamed of them?

813
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,340
 If you just say that was really out of tune or something?

814
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
 Yeah, they're ashamed of them.

815
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,540
 They did something stop them from singing.

816
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,420
 And if the males aren't allowed to sing by researchers, 30% get eaten.

817
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
 And really?

818
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,260
 So there are at least three separate experiments where researchers have stopped male spiders

819
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,740
 from not being eaten in their courtships.

820
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
 It's a bit of a theme.

821
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,140
 Yeah, and these researchers are starting to look like the bad guys aren't they?

822
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,860
 Think about it.

823
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,020
 So there are, there are actually animals in the wild that sort of wear and make up themselves

824
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
 without scientists supplying it to them.

825
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
 Okay.

826
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:16,540
 And before about, there was that, um, vulture, uh, the bearded vulture, uh, rubs its head

827
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,340
 in its bottom in, in soil and it sort of gets its face or scruffy.

828
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,500
 It gives it a reddish brown hue that it then uses to attract, uh, and probably intimidate

829
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
 possibly.

830
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,860
 But relevant to the jumping spider of the fact, um, there are assassin bugs, uh, that go

831
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,020
 around wearing the dead carcasses of the ants that they've killed.

832
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,700
 As a, what the article said is a sort of backpack.

833
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,940
 So they just wear a bunch of them and it's to trick jumping spiders into not eating them.

834
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,300
 So it's effectively a backpack of camouflage.

835
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,220
 And this is makeup, we're saying, right?

836
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,060
 This is, uh, it's more, uh, sort of, you've done your makeup, you now need your bag.

837
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,060
 It's in the putramons.

838
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
 You're going out.

839
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,060
 Yeah.

840
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
 Imagine if you had your makeup artist.

841
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,020
 You're ready to go and tell me, and what would you like some blusher?

842
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:05,620
 Could I have a few corpses piled onto my back please, and it's all around my body?

843
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
 Flamingos wear makeup.

844
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
 Don't they?

845
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
 Yeah.

846
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,980
 But they sort of generate their own makeup.

847
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,660
 So it's like having a mascara gland.

848
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
 Really?

849
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,660
 Yeah.

850
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,940
 So they have this oil, which they, uh, they secrete from a gland near their tails and, uh,

851
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
 it has various health effects.

852
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,260
 So it's not just used for cosmetic reasons, but they dorb the oil onto their feathers from

853
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
 the gland.

854
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,500
 And one of the effects it has is to make them a deeper pink and scientists have observed

855
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,340
 that during the mating season, they do it much more often.

856
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,500
 So that seems to be an indication that they are, because, because being deep pink is

857
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
 quite sexy, to a flamingo.

858
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,980
 It's like, well, it's like a fake tan.

859
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
 Yeah, a fake tan?

860
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,940
 It's sort of real tan, actually, isn't it?

861
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,900
 It's like having a sun cream gland near your bottom, which squirts out all over your body.

862
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
 Yeah.

863
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,300
 Would you rather have that or a ham for a ham?

864
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,820
 That's such a nice--

865
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,820
 That's quite niche, that isn't it?

866
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
 Yeah.

867
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,820
 The people who get it are going to love it.

868
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,820
 It's going to explode.

869
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,780
 That's incredible crossover.

870
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:07,580
 Okay, that's it.

871
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,580
 That is all of our facts.

872
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,980
 Thank you so much for listening.

873
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,940
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over

874
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,860
 the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

875
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,020
 I'm on @Sriberland, Andy at UnderhunterM.

876
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,020
 James.

877
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
 @JamesHarkin and Chazinski.

878
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
 You can email podcast@ky.com.

879
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
 Yep.

880
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,820
 We also have a group account, which is @nosuchthing.

881
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,820
 We have a Facebook page.

882
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
 No such thing as a fish.

883
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,340
 Just go on there and put that in, or go to nosuchthing as a fish.com.

884
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,740
 This is our newly rebooted website.

885
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,140
 It has links to all of our episodes, our upcoming book, our tour dates, everything that

886
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,140
 you'd want from us.

887
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
 It's on there.

888
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,140
 So please head there, no such thing as a fish.com.

889
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,660
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

890
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
 We'll see you then.

891
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
 Goodbye.

892
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,660
 Bye.

893
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,660
 Bye.

894
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,260
 I'm trying to eat that again.

895
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,620
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

896
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

897
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,560
