00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of the No Such Things A Fish International Fact Ball.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.000
 Brought to you by the QILs and visit england.com.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.440
 Today I'm joined by John Mitchinson, Molly Oldfield and James Harkin.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.720
 My name's Anna Tishinski and today we'll be putting Greece against Japan to find out which

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.880
 is the most quite interesting country. Let's kick off with Greece.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720
 Oh, I've got a good fact about Greece. Nobody knows how many islands there are.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 The estimates are between 1400 and 6000. Wow.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.080
 But there are only 227 are inhabited so that's like 1 in 26 if you go for the higher estimate.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.320
 That means there's a load of Greek islands up for grabs.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.360
 Yeah. You're saying we could claim them as our own?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.480
 Well, why not? So during austerity last year, which was obviously a tough time for the Greek,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.880
 a TV program was cancelled live on air, which I would usually look up.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.920
 It's pretty awkward. I can't tell what they're saying because I'm not fluent in Greek.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.760
 But it looks like a news program and people just walk on at the end of it and like pack up all

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.800
 their stuff around them. It's kind of sad. Wow. Lions used to live in Europe and the last

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.760
 place they were before they died out was in Greece. Really? Yeah. What happened was they were

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.280
 hunted to extinction because they needed them for the gladiator fights and eventually they died

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 out because of that. But yeah, lions on Greece. Really? Until when?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.720
 That was until around 1 AD. Oh, okay. A while ago. Yeah. It's not like there are probably some

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.440
 still roaming around out there. Unfound. Could be on one of the uncounted 4,000 islands, you know?

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.640
 So, do you know what the Greeks call themselves? They don't call themselves Greeks.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.920
 Hellenic? Well, yeah. It's the Hellenic Republic. But I was quite interested to discover that every

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.320
 single European country except for one calls them some version of Greece. So it's, you know,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.240
 Gretcher in Italian or Gretia in Spanish. But there's one country in Europe that calls them

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 Hellas. And that's weirdly Norwegian. Really? Yeah.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.800
 Random. That's weird. The Hellas. And you know what the Turks call them? This is even more

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 interesting. Unannistan. Unann is the Persian for Greece because the bit of Greece that used to be

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.480
 in Asia Minor called Ionia, which they were all kicked out of in the early 20th century. That's

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 how they got the name. So, but Unannistan. Weird. Greece don't like Macedonia, do they? They don't like

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.640
 them taking that name. No. Because they think the Macedonia is actually in Greece. And there is a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 Macedonia in Greece. And then there's a bit of Bulgaria that's also called Macedonia. And they're all

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.600
 trying to claim Macedonia because they all want to be the place where. By just calling themselves

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.720
 Macedonia, like if I living in the village of Chiselhampton called it Rome, I could tell people

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.200
 that I lived in Rome. And that works. All roads lead to Chiselhampton. Chiselhampton. It's brilliant.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.840
 So the Greek flag is blue, right? Blue and white. Blue and white, right? So what do we know about

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.760
 the Greeks and blue? They have no word for it? Oh yeah. Yeah. It's kind of weird. It must be

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.760
 difficult for Greek commentators. You see our beautiful flag over there that is white and that other

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.360
 thing that's strange color. I think it speaks for itself. Well, Homer called the sea bronze, didn't he?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.960
 Yeah, he did. The idea is that the Homeric colors were more like intensities of light and shade rather

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.080
 than natural colors. So Aristotle said there were seven shades of color, all of which derived from

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.280
 black and white. How many shades of grey did he see? I don't know, but I know you got a good fact

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.960
 about shades of grey. That was the deliberate shoe hog. But yeah, I went on the Pantone website to see

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.880
 how many shades of grey they sell and they sell 104 shades of grey. Brilliant. Nice. Between

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.680
 1920 and 1983, letpracy was specified in Greek law as grounds for divorce. That's fair enough,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.840
 really. I mean, what do I use that as a grounds for divorce? Would you not? I wish I could leave a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.800
 little something of yourself behind with your loved one. Or maybe if your ring finger fell off.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.160
 About 10% of people worldwide have got something called Greek foot. Do you think any of you have it?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.920
 It's when your second toe is longer than your big toe and it was a really idealised form in Greek

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.720
 sculpture. And actually, these are statue of liberty. It's got Greek feet. Wow. I have that.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.880
 You have Greek foot. Yeah, definitely. Second toe longer. Cool. You've gone down very well in ancient

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.600
 Greece. Yeah, my sixth toe is the longest. Is that normal? Yeah, join a circus. Speaking of Greek

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.040
 statues. So we always imagine them. I guess we always see them in that grey colour, but they were

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.360
 really colourful. So they've done lots of colour sampling now. We've got modern technology which

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 can tell us what colour Greek statues were, what colour the path none was. And they used like

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.760
 really bright primary colours. And the path and then they found really bright blue. I think it's

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.960
 called Egyptian blue. Although they would have just called it Egyptian, that colour that is quite

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.120
 sort of bright. Tourism in Greece. Oh yeah. Huge 20 million visitors a year. One in six of those

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.480
 visitors of British. We, I think, are the biggest single tourist body in Greece, which is

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.960
 interesting. Closely followed, of course, by the Germans. Yeah. We're usually closely following

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.880
 them to the sun lounges. So weirdly, the Greeks didn't have pockets in their clothes. So

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.560
 apparently, when they went shopping, they used to carry small change in their mouth. This is the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.680
 ancient Greeks, right? Yeah. Yeah. How did they ask for things? When they were full out.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.960
 Do you think that's why when you die in Greece, you put a coin in the mouth of the dead

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.840
 person. Do you? Yeah, exactly. Speaking of death, Greece is the only European country without a

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.640
 crematorium. Really? Do they just bury them? I think the Greek Orthodox don't agree with

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.640
 the kind of thing. Yeah, that makes sense. There were two Greek Orthodox churches on the island of

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.440
 Kiosk and every Easter, they fire rockets at each other. Oh yeah, I've read about this. 80,000

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.560
 rockets are fired on the evening of Easter. Yeah, it's really the thing to see all these things,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.320
 but until 1889, they used real cannons. And now they just use home fireworks, which is probably just

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.560
 as dangerous in a way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. I actually read some ancient Greek jokes.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.320
 Oh yeah? So just going to round off on a really, really bad ancient Greek joke.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.760
 So, wanting to train his donkey not to eat, an idiot stopped giving him any food. When the donkey

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.160
 died of starvation, the man said, "What a loss. Just when he learned not to eat, he died."

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.040
 Well, Mitch likes that one. I'm chuckling. Oh, that's good. That's the half time whistle, I think.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.000
 So now it's time for our visit england.com quiz about England. And I think each of my three fellow

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.080
 panelists have brought a question about England. Let's start off with James. What's your question?

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.200
 My question is relating to the town of my birth, Bolton. When Icelandic footballer Goodenbergs

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:53.280
 and left Bolton, what did he say he would miss the most? Was it you? Oh, no. No, that didn't seem plausible.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.360
 Okay, that's James's question. Molly, what's yours? My question is, what did Harold Godwinson

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.760
 have tattooed on his chest? Was it my name? Unfortunately not. No, seemed unlikely as well.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.480
 Mitch. My question is, rugby school, where the game of rugby union was invented,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.160
 had, as it's part of its first official kit, an item of formal wear. What was it?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.240
 Interesting. And freaking. Okay, thanks guys. And if any of you listening to this one,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.600
 I hear the answers to those questions. You're going to have to listen to the rest of the podcast

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.720
 because that's when we're going to reveal them. Or you can fast forward to the end.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:36.080
 I mean, that's the whistle to kick off with the second half. And we're going to go with Japan.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.720
 Anything interesting about Japan, anyone? Well, the Japanese at least do know how many islands they have.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:50.560
 There are 6,852 islands, although only four make up 97% of the whole land area of Japan.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.120
 And more than 80% of Japan is forest. Do you guys know what innemoury is? No.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.880
 So it's a positive thing and it literally means sleeping whilst present. And it's sleeping on the

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.120
 job. And it sort of is a good thing in Japan because it's symptomatic of like a really hard worker.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.120
 And the prime minister's been seen doing it. People have faked it so that their bosses

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.920
 seem they're working really hard. So it's really a great thing to do. That probably explains why

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.200
 Dan's been asleep all the way through this podcast. The average Japanese person gets two hours

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.400
 less sleep per night than the average Chinese person. What about during the day? They catch up then.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.640
 Yeah, I guess they do. Nintendo translates to English as leave luck to heaven. And Canon used to be

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.560
 called Huanon after a Buddhist goddess. Oh, really? That's quite good. So Canon's a good example of

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.880
 this thing they do in Japan, which means that 98% of their adoptions are men in their 20s and 30s.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.840
 Really? Yeah, because so there's a strong history of family businesses that pass down through

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.240
 the family. But the Japanese worked out in the 16th century. I think it was the 17th century

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.160
 that if you pass it down through the bloodline, often your son's a bit crap and ruins the business.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.800
 So rather than just say we're going to stop passing through the bloodline, they now adopt people.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.120
 So like examples of this are Canon, Toyota, Suzuki, and in almost every generation, rather than

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.680
 handing down the business to their son, they adopt a 20 or 30 something guy to take it over and it's

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.640
 much more successful than companies that don't do it. That is a nice idea, but I imagine the real

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.520
 son must get really annoyed. There must be so many resentful sons in Japan. And vent killings.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:33.200
 Well, I'm not blaming anyone. I've said about Greece how leprosy was grounds for divorce.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.840
 Well, in the early 20th century, left-handedness in a wife was sufficient to divorce her.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:46.560
 I love vending machines in Japan. There's one vending machine for every 23 people

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.080
 that you find them everywhere and you can get pretty much anything from pot plants and live

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.800
 lobsters to, well, sexual lubricants, that kind of thing. I love the idea of a vending machine for a

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.960
 live lobster. That's just a brilliant idea. For dinner or? Well, I guess. I don't suppose there's a pet.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.920
 Gerald the Neval. He had a pet one that he used to take out. They can live for a week out of water.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.520
 Well, I'm not sure they love doing it, but they can, as long as they're moist. But there is a

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.560
 machine at the summit of Mt Fuji, a vending machine at the summit of Mt Fuji. What does it sound?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.720
 Coffee in a can or Pocari Sweat. What is Pocari Sweat? Pocari Sweat is a soft drink. It's salty.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.640
 I don't know that it is particularly salty. It's just been advertised on the moon. It's the first

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.600
 piece of advertising to happen on the moon. They sent a can of Pocari Sweat up there as a PR campaign

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.600
 and it's now. That's where it is. Here's a fact for you. Just out of the blue.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.920
 The Mariko Ayoki phenomenon is a phenomenon consisting of the urge to defecate while visiting

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.360
 a bookstore. Originating in Japan, it is named for the woman who first publicized such an urge.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.440
 That is getting your name to live on in history, isn't it?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.400
 Did you publicize it by acting it out? I think she just wrote about it.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.720
 Okay. I didn't know this was a phenomenon. It's never occurred to me, but has it? Have you felt that

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.480
 sensation? Yes, yes, I have. But I used to work in a bookstore. So I felt almost everything.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:21.520
 Almost every known human emotion I have at some point. Maybe I'll just switch these microphones off.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.200
 Speaking of emotion, there's something called Paris Syndrome, which is when about a dozen also

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.880
 Japanese people a year have to be repatriated after they go to Paris and they think, oh my goodness,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.760
 this place is not what I imagined. People are mean to them. It's really noisy and polluted and

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.840
 they just totally freak out. Oh, really?

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.560
 Adopt nappies, outsell, baby nappies in Japan. Oh, yeah, they do. They wear them on the train to go home.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.800
 Like, on the holidays, there's like so many people traveling on the train that nobody can use the

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.080
 loot so they wear nappies to go home. Maybe. There's only one of them in bookshops.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:04.720
 Indeed they do. Tintin in Japanese is tantan because tintin means penis in Japanese.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.960
 So they just thought they ought to. It's not not a great name for a character. It's not ideal.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.640
 Oh, so they have an annual penis festival in Japan. It's called Festival of the Steele Fallos.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.960
 And it's in Canemara. It's the first Sunday of every April. And there's a legend behind it saying

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.000
 there's a demon who invaded a woman's vagina and bit of any penises coming her way

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.960
 until a blacksmith forced a steele fallos that defeated the demon. And if you google the photos,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.040
 it's pretty mental. There's just giant pink wheelies everywhere. I think I'd rather not.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:44.400
 I also like the idea of any penis coming her way. They're just walking down the street and they say,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:51.920
 we should wrap up on that. I think I just heard the full-time whistle in fact.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:59.120
 Nope, there it is. There it is. Yeah. And that's the end of the match. So before we reveal who

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:06.240
 won, it's time to tell you the answers to our visit england.com quiz. So James, what was your question

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.040
 and the answer to it? My question was relating to Icelandic footballer Gugney Bergsson and what

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.160
 did he miss most about Bolton when he left? Well, he missed the good old Bolton drizzle.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:23.120
 Why wouldn't you? He just liked this very fine rain we get in Bolton that they don't get in Iceland.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.080
 Okay, thanks for that. Molly, what was your question? My question was, what did Harold Godwinson have

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.360
 tattooed on his chest? According to William of Portia, he had Edith, which was his wife's name,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.160
 an england tattooed on his chest. And it came in handy when he lost the battle of Hastings because

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.760
 that's how Edith identified his body. Mitch, what was your question? My question was which

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.720
 bit of the original rugby school rugby union kit was a piece of formalware. And the answer was

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.760
 they had a bow tie, which is kind of fantastic. You could imagine, yeah, you could imagine it now

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.960
 sort of round the thick neck of the England front row. Okay, so there are all the answers. Of

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.720
 course, you didn't get to win any prizes even if you knew all the answers, but you can win a prize if

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.920
 you go to visit england.com where you'll have the chance to enter a ballot and win some marvellous

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.440
 QI goodies. And if you would like to confront any of these guys about their questions and answers,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.960
 you can get James on that eggshops, you can get Molly on at Molly Oldfield, you can get Mitch on

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:33.600
 at John Mitchinson and you can get me on else at qi.com. But his for the grand finale, the climax

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.680
 of the whole event, who's going to be the winner of this match and someone's going to pick a random

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.640
 and I think it's going to be Mitch, who do you think should win? James? Oh, which country? Oh, I see

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:51.040
 of the game. Oh, I understand. Two teams. Oh, I think absolutely Greece without a shadow of a doubt.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.440
 Greece without a shadow of a doubt. There we go. There you go. That's the answer. Thanks a lot for

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.920
 listening guys and tune in tomorrow when it's going to be. It's going to be a triple threat much

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:09.120
 between Iran, Argentina and Ecuador. Okay, so join us without three way tomorrow. See you then. Bye. Bye.
