00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of the No Such Things A Fish International Fact Ball.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,000
 Brought to you by the QILs and visit england.com.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,440
 Today I'm joined by John Mitchinson, Molly Oldfield and James Harkin.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,720
 My name's Anna Tishinski and today we'll be putting Greece against Japan to find out which

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,880
 is the most quite interesting country. Let's kick off with Greece.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,720
 Oh, I've got a good fact about Greece. Nobody knows how many islands there are.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,040
 The estimates are between 1400 and 6000. Wow.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,080
 But there are only 227 are inhabited so that's like 1 in 26 if you go for the higher estimate.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,320
 That means there's a load of Greek islands up for grabs.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
 Yeah. You're saying we could claim them as our own?

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,480
 Well, why not? So during austerity last year, which was obviously a tough time for the Greek,

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,880
 a TV program was cancelled live on air, which I would usually look up.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,920
 It's pretty awkward. I can't tell what they're saying because I'm not fluent in Greek.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,760
 But it looks like a news program and people just walk on at the end of it and like pack up all

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,800
 their stuff around them. It's kind of sad. Wow. Lions used to live in Europe and the last

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,760
 place they were before they died out was in Greece. Really? Yeah. What happened was they were

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,280
 hunted to extinction because they needed them for the gladiator fights and eventually they died

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
 out because of that. But yeah, lions on Greece. Really? Until when?

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,720
 That was until around 1 AD. Oh, okay. A while ago. Yeah. It's not like there are probably some

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,440
 still roaming around out there. Unfound. Could be on one of the uncounted 4,000 islands, you know?

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,640
 So, do you know what the Greeks call themselves? They don't call themselves Greeks.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,920
 Hellenic? Well, yeah. It's the Hellenic Republic. But I was quite interested to discover that every

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,320
 single European country except for one calls them some version of Greece. So it's, you know,

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,240
 Gretcher in Italian or Gretia in Spanish. But there's one country in Europe that calls them

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,960
 Hellas. And that's weirdly Norwegian. Really? Yeah.

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,800
 Random. That's weird. The Hellas. And you know what the Turks call them? This is even more

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 interesting. Unannistan. Unann is the Persian for Greece because the bit of Greece that used to be

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,480
 in Asia Minor called Ionia, which they were all kicked out of in the early 20th century. That's

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,920
 how they got the name. So, but Unannistan. Weird. Greece don't like Macedonia, do they? They don't like

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
 them taking that name. No. Because they think the Macedonia is actually in Greece. And there is a

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,640
 Macedonia in Greece. And then there's a bit of Bulgaria that's also called Macedonia. And they're all

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,600
 trying to claim Macedonia because they all want to be the place where. By just calling themselves

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,720
 Macedonia, like if I living in the village of Chiselhampton called it Rome, I could tell people

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,200
 that I lived in Rome. And that works. All roads lead to Chiselhampton. Chiselhampton. It's brilliant.

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,840
 So the Greek flag is blue, right? Blue and white. Blue and white, right? So what do we know about

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,760
 the Greeks and blue? They have no word for it? Oh yeah. Yeah. It's kind of weird. It must be

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,760
 difficult for Greek commentators. You see our beautiful flag over there that is white and that other

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,360
 thing that's strange color. I think it speaks for itself. Well, Homer called the sea bronze, didn't he?

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,960
 Yeah, he did. The idea is that the Homeric colors were more like intensities of light and shade rather

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,080
 than natural colors. So Aristotle said there were seven shades of color, all of which derived from

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,280
 black and white. How many shades of grey did he see? I don't know, but I know you got a good fact

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,960
 about shades of grey. That was the deliberate shoe hog. But yeah, I went on the Pantone website to see

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,880
 how many shades of grey they sell and they sell 104 shades of grey. Brilliant. Nice. Between

44
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,680
 1920 and 1983, letpracy was specified in Greek law as grounds for divorce. That's fair enough,

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,840
 really. I mean, what do I use that as a grounds for divorce? Would you not? I wish I could leave a

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,800
 little something of yourself behind with your loved one. Or maybe if your ring finger fell off.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:04,160
 About 10% of people worldwide have got something called Greek foot. Do you think any of you have it?

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,920
 It's when your second toe is longer than your big toe and it was a really idealised form in Greek

49
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,720
 sculpture. And actually, these are statue of liberty. It's got Greek feet. Wow. I have that.

50
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,880
 You have Greek foot. Yeah, definitely. Second toe longer. Cool. You've gone down very well in ancient

51
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,600
 Greece. Yeah, my sixth toe is the longest. Is that normal? Yeah, join a circus. Speaking of Greek

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
 statues. So we always imagine them. I guess we always see them in that grey colour, but they were

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,360
 really colourful. So they've done lots of colour sampling now. We've got modern technology which

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
 can tell us what colour Greek statues were, what colour the path none was. And they used like

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,760
 really bright primary colours. And the path and then they found really bright blue. I think it's

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,960
 called Egyptian blue. Although they would have just called it Egyptian, that colour that is quite

57
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:57,120
 sort of bright. Tourism in Greece. Oh yeah. Huge 20 million visitors a year. One in six of those

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,480
 visitors of British. We, I think, are the biggest single tourist body in Greece, which is

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,960
 interesting. Closely followed, of course, by the Germans. Yeah. We're usually closely following

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,880
 them to the sun lounges. So weirdly, the Greeks didn't have pockets in their clothes. So

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,560
 apparently, when they went shopping, they used to carry small change in their mouth. This is the

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,680
 ancient Greeks, right? Yeah. Yeah. How did they ask for things? When they were full out.

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,960
 Do you think that's why when you die in Greece, you put a coin in the mouth of the dead

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,840
 person. Do you? Yeah, exactly. Speaking of death, Greece is the only European country without a

65
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,640
 crematorium. Really? Do they just bury them? I think the Greek Orthodox don't agree with

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,640
 the kind of thing. Yeah, that makes sense. There were two Greek Orthodox churches on the island of

67
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:49,440
 Kiosk and every Easter, they fire rockets at each other. Oh yeah, I've read about this. 80,000

68
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,560
 rockets are fired on the evening of Easter. Yeah, it's really the thing to see all these things,

69
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,320
 but until 1889, they used real cannons. And now they just use home fireworks, which is probably just

70
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,560
 as dangerous in a way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. I actually read some ancient Greek jokes.

71
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,320
 Oh yeah? So just going to round off on a really, really bad ancient Greek joke.

72
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,760
 So, wanting to train his donkey not to eat, an idiot stopped giving him any food. When the donkey

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,160
 died of starvation, the man said, "What a loss. Just when he learned not to eat, he died."

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,040
 Well, Mitch likes that one. I'm chuckling. Oh, that's good. That's the half time whistle, I think.

75
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:34,000
 So now it's time for our visit england.com quiz about England. And I think each of my three fellow

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
 panelists have brought a question about England. Let's start off with James. What's your question?

77
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,200
 My question is relating to the town of my birth, Bolton. When Icelandic footballer Goodenbergs

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:53,280
 and left Bolton, what did he say he would miss the most? Was it you? Oh, no. No, that didn't seem plausible.

79
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,360
 Okay, that's James's question. Molly, what's yours? My question is, what did Harold Godwinson

80
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,760
 have tattooed on his chest? Was it my name? Unfortunately not. No, seemed unlikely as well.

81
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,480
 Mitch. My question is, rugby school, where the game of rugby union was invented,

82
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,160
 had, as it's part of its first official kit, an item of formal wear. What was it?

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,240
 Interesting. And freaking. Okay, thanks guys. And if any of you listening to this one,

84
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,600
 I hear the answers to those questions. You're going to have to listen to the rest of the podcast

85
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,720
 because that's when we're going to reveal them. Or you can fast forward to the end.

86
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,080
 I mean, that's the whistle to kick off with the second half. And we're going to go with Japan.

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,720
 Anything interesting about Japan, anyone? Well, the Japanese at least do know how many islands they have.

88
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:50,560
 There are 6,852 islands, although only four make up 97% of the whole land area of Japan.

89
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
 And more than 80% of Japan is forest. Do you guys know what innemoury is? No.

90
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,880
 So it's a positive thing and it literally means sleeping whilst present. And it's sleeping on the

91
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,120
 job. And it sort of is a good thing in Japan because it's symptomatic of like a really hard worker.

92
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
 And the prime minister's been seen doing it. People have faked it so that their bosses

93
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,920
 seem they're working really hard. So it's really a great thing to do. That probably explains why

94
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,200
 Dan's been asleep all the way through this podcast. The average Japanese person gets two hours

95
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,400
 less sleep per night than the average Chinese person. What about during the day? They catch up then.

96
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,640
 Yeah, I guess they do. Nintendo translates to English as leave luck to heaven. And Canon used to be

97
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,560
 called Huanon after a Buddhist goddess. Oh, really? That's quite good. So Canon's a good example of

98
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,880
 this thing they do in Japan, which means that 98% of their adoptions are men in their 20s and 30s.

99
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,840
 Really? Yeah, because so there's a strong history of family businesses that pass down through

100
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,240
 the family. But the Japanese worked out in the 16th century. I think it was the 17th century

101
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
 that if you pass it down through the bloodline, often your son's a bit crap and ruins the business.

102
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,800
 So rather than just say we're going to stop passing through the bloodline, they now adopt people.

103
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,120
 So like examples of this are Canon, Toyota, Suzuki, and in almost every generation, rather than

104
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
 handing down the business to their son, they adopt a 20 or 30 something guy to take it over and it's

105
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,640
 much more successful than companies that don't do it. That is a nice idea, but I imagine the real

106
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,520
 son must get really annoyed. There must be so many resentful sons in Japan. And vent killings.

107
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:33,200
 Well, I'm not blaming anyone. I've said about Greece how leprosy was grounds for divorce.

108
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,840
 Well, in the early 20th century, left-handedness in a wife was sufficient to divorce her.

109
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:46,560
 I love vending machines in Japan. There's one vending machine for every 23 people

110
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,080
 that you find them everywhere and you can get pretty much anything from pot plants and live

111
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,800
 lobsters to, well, sexual lubricants, that kind of thing. I love the idea of a vending machine for a

112
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,960
 live lobster. That's just a brilliant idea. For dinner or? Well, I guess. I don't suppose there's a pet.

113
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,920
 Gerald the Neval. He had a pet one that he used to take out. They can live for a week out of water.

114
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,520
 Well, I'm not sure they love doing it, but they can, as long as they're moist. But there is a

115
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,560
 machine at the summit of Mt Fuji, a vending machine at the summit of Mt Fuji. What does it sound?

116
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,720
 Coffee in a can or Pocari Sweat. What is Pocari Sweat? Pocari Sweat is a soft drink. It's salty.

117
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,640
 I don't know that it is particularly salty. It's just been advertised on the moon. It's the first

118
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,600
 piece of advertising to happen on the moon. They sent a can of Pocari Sweat up there as a PR campaign

119
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
 and it's now. That's where it is. Here's a fact for you. Just out of the blue.

120
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,920
 The Mariko Ayoki phenomenon is a phenomenon consisting of the urge to defecate while visiting

121
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,360
 a bookstore. Originating in Japan, it is named for the woman who first publicized such an urge.

122
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
 That is getting your name to live on in history, isn't it?

123
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,400
 Did you publicize it by acting it out? I think she just wrote about it.

124
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,720
 Okay. I didn't know this was a phenomenon. It's never occurred to me, but has it? Have you felt that

125
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,480
 sensation? Yes, yes, I have. But I used to work in a bookstore. So I felt almost everything.

126
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,520
 Almost every known human emotion I have at some point. Maybe I'll just switch these microphones off.

127
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,200
 Speaking of emotion, there's something called Paris Syndrome, which is when about a dozen also

128
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,880
 Japanese people a year have to be repatriated after they go to Paris and they think, oh my goodness,

129
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
 this place is not what I imagined. People are mean to them. It's really noisy and polluted and

130
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,840
 they just totally freak out. Oh, really?

131
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,560
 Adopt nappies, outsell, baby nappies in Japan. Oh, yeah, they do. They wear them on the train to go home.

132
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,800
 Like, on the holidays, there's like so many people traveling on the train that nobody can use the

133
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,080
 loot so they wear nappies to go home. Maybe. There's only one of them in bookshops.

134
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:04,720
 Indeed they do. Tintin in Japanese is tantan because tintin means penis in Japanese.

135
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,960
 So they just thought they ought to. It's not not a great name for a character. It's not ideal.

136
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,640
 Oh, so they have an annual penis festival in Japan. It's called Festival of the Steele Fallos.

137
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,960
 And it's in Canemara. It's the first Sunday of every April. And there's a legend behind it saying

138
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,000
 there's a demon who invaded a woman's vagina and bit of any penises coming her way

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,960
 until a blacksmith forced a steele fallos that defeated the demon. And if you google the photos,

140
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,040
 it's pretty mental. There's just giant pink wheelies everywhere. I think I'd rather not.

141
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,400
 I also like the idea of any penis coming her way. They're just walking down the street and they say,

142
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:51,920
 we should wrap up on that. I think I just heard the full-time whistle in fact.

143
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:59,120
 Nope, there it is. There it is. Yeah. And that's the end of the match. So before we reveal who

144
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,240
 won, it's time to tell you the answers to our visit england.com quiz. So James, what was your question

145
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,040
 and the answer to it? My question was relating to Icelandic footballer Gugney Bergsson and what

146
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,160
 did he miss most about Bolton when he left? Well, he missed the good old Bolton drizzle.

147
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,120
 Why wouldn't you? He just liked this very fine rain we get in Bolton that they don't get in Iceland.

148
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,080
 Okay, thanks for that. Molly, what was your question? My question was, what did Harold Godwinson have

149
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,360
 tattooed on his chest? According to William of Portia, he had Edith, which was his wife's name,

150
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,160
 an england tattooed on his chest. And it came in handy when he lost the battle of Hastings because

151
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,760
 that's how Edith identified his body. Mitch, what was your question? My question was which

152
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,720
 bit of the original rugby school rugby union kit was a piece of formalware. And the answer was

153
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,760
 they had a bow tie, which is kind of fantastic. You could imagine, yeah, you could imagine it now

154
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,960
 sort of round the thick neck of the England front row. Okay, so there are all the answers. Of

155
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,720

160
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,680
 of the whole event, who's going to be the winner of this match and someone's going to pick a random

161
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,640
 and I think it's going to be Mitch, who do you think should win? James? Oh, which country? Oh, I see

162
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,040
 of the game. Oh, I understand. Two teams. Oh, I think absolutely Greece without a shadow of a doubt.

163
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,440
 Greece without a shadow of a doubt. There we go. There you go. That's the answer. Thanks a lot for

 listening guys and tune in tomorrow when it's going to be. It's going to be a triple threat much

165
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:09,120
 between Iran, Argentina and Ecuador. Okay, so join us without three way tomorrow. See you then. Bye. Bye.
