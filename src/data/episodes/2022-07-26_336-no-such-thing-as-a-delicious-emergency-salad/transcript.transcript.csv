00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, just so you don't think that Anna has suddenly"
00:00:05,00:00:12,"affected a East London accent, she is still away and in her stead this week we have the"
00:00:12,00:00:19,"absolutely fantastically funny, brilliant, smart, amazing comedian Sarah Pasco."
00:00:19,00:00:25,"Now Sarah has a book that's just come out in paperback, it's called Sex Power Money"
00:00:25,00:00:31,and that book has an accompanying podcast which is also called Sex Power Money which
00:00:31,00:00:36,"you can find in all your normal podcast providers. Both of those things are absolutely brilliant,"
00:00:36,00:00:40,"you should definitely check them out but for now, on with the podcast."
00:00:54,00:01:00,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:00,00:01:05,"from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew"
00:01:05,00:01:11,"Hunter Murray, James Harkin and special guest Sarah Pasco and once again we have gathered"
00:01:11,00:01:15,around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:01:15,00:01:26,"order here we go. Starting with you, Sarah. Hello everybody, my fact is for 15 years German police"
00:01:26,00:01:36,"hunted a serial killer who didn't exist. Wow, amazing. It is amazing but it's also quite dark,"
00:01:36,00:01:40,"it does involve things like murders, so it isn't like a trigger warning but I know that your show"
00:01:40,00:01:47,is sometimes just like 'oh this ladybird bought a hat' so if anyone is listening... I think you're
00:01:47,00:01:54,confusing us with play school. Yeah I mean more like this ladybird looks like she bought a hat
00:01:54,00:02:01,but actually it's a very interesting evolutionary shadow. So I just wanted to say to people who
00:02:01,00:02:05,are listening like if there are children I'm not going to go into any great detail about murders
00:02:05,00:02:15,but it does mention murders. So in 2007 two police officers were shot in Hellbron so obviously it's
00:02:15,00:02:22,terrible a 22 year old female officer is killed and her male colleague was badly injured. Now they
00:02:22,00:02:28,found the DNA of the killer at the scene and they ran it through a database where obviously DNA has
00:02:28,00:02:37,been stored from other crimes and they found multiple matches. In 2001 a 61 year old furniture
00:02:37,00:02:43,dealer in Freiburg Germany had been murdered by strangulation and the DNA of the killer of the
00:02:43,00:02:50,police was found in his apartment and so this is completely befuddling for the police because this
00:02:50,00:02:56,"is completely different MO, this is a manual strangulation of a furniture dealer and then this"
00:02:56,00:03:01,murder of the police which seemed to be completely different because they couldn't connect the reasons
00:03:01,00:03:06,why you would commit those murders. This becomes even more confusing when they found a match to a
00:03:06,00:03:14,very very cold case from 1993 a 62 year old woman and again a different murder MO. They tried to
00:03:14,00:03:19,find links between those two victims the 61 year old and the 62 year old but they weren't connected
00:03:19,00:03:26,in any way at all. So they've got a serial killer and it turns out from this DNA that this is a woman
00:03:26,00:03:32,which is incredibly rare to have a female serial killer. She's been working for nearly 20 years
00:03:32,00:03:40,not working I know it's not working she's been employed as a serial killer for like for like
00:03:40,00:03:44,two decades. They're going back through all of these cold cases going through the data and the
00:03:44,00:03:50,stuff that's coming up on her is just so incredulous. So at the end of October in 2001 in
00:03:50,00:03:56,Budenheim Germany there's a break-in in a trailer right so no murders are committed because it was
00:03:56,00:04:04,empty at the time and her DNA is found on a half eaten cookie on the side of this trailer so they
00:04:04,00:04:09,don't know what she was doing there but they now have a name for this this serial killer this woman
00:04:09,00:04:14,they call her the Phantom of Hell Brune. Now if I was if I was the German police at this point in
00:04:14,00:04:19,the case I would have called her the Cookie Monster because she's killed three people.
00:04:19,00:04:25,I think that the reason they had no sense of humour about it is because she'd killed a police
00:04:25,00:04:30,officer I think I think if she I think if she hadn't they'd have had a lot more fun with the
00:04:30,00:04:36,naming. But Sarah you're saying she didn't exist what's going on? Well well at the moment at the
00:04:36,00:04:43,moment she does exist very much. Sorry that sounded so play school Andy that I think Sarah's justified
00:04:43,00:04:52,in The Lady Bird with a Hat. But what happened? So it's completely incredible at this point they
00:04:52,00:04:57,now have a whole room of police officers who are just completely focused on catching her they also
00:04:57,00:05:02,call her the woman without a face because also so far they have no witnesses. Why wait a minute how
00:05:02,00:05:08,did she eat the cookie if she didn't have a face? This is why she's so mysterious. So
00:05:08,00:05:15,so the woman makes no sense she's killing she's robbing she's snacking and there's no consistent
00:05:15,00:05:23,MO and by 2007 she is now in another country she is in Austria robbing an optometrist and now
00:05:23,00:05:27,because her crimes have gone into Austria they actually have different rules in terms of what
00:05:27,00:05:34,they can do with DNA and so they find out that this woman is of very likely of Eastern European
00:05:34,00:05:42,descent. So between 2003-2007 the phantoms DNA is found at over 20 burglaries or motorcycle thefts
00:05:42,00:05:49,they've got a reward of 300 000 euros for her capture and over 16 000 hours of overtime have
00:05:49,00:05:56,already been paid for the police force and I've also I looked at some of the press from the time
00:05:56,00:06:02,so this is this is from 2007 now this was quite a big deal because they found her DNA on a syringe
00:06:02,00:06:08,that was half full of heroin so perhaps she was also an addict did that was that why her
00:06:08,00:06:12,perspire was so unpredictable such an old story isn't it you start on the cookies and then you
00:06:12,00:06:17,just work your way up to the really hard stuff or maybe because you're so I don't know if heroin
00:06:17,00:06:24,gives you the munchies but maybe that's why she was like I'm busy I'm busy robbing but also I would
00:06:24,00:06:30,love a biscuit so this is from Time Magazine in 2009 the phantom was not only a brutal killer
00:06:30,00:06:35,suspected of committing six homicides but also a common thief she had been involved in a car
00:06:35,00:06:40,dealership robbery and a school break-in but in both cases others convicted of those crimes
00:06:40,00:06:47,denied her existence no one had ever seen her no security camera had ever captured her image
00:06:47,00:06:53,but when witnesses described her they sometimes said she looked like a man so this is what those
00:06:54,00:07:00,so this is what those police are dealing with right so this criminal is this eastern European
00:07:00,00:07:06,woman who looks like a man is so incredible at her job and that and everyone is so scared of her
00:07:06,00:07:11,that even people who they definitely know were in the same place as her doing the same crimes
00:07:11,00:07:16,they're like no no no there was no woman what woman are you talking about um it's crazy it's
00:07:16,00:07:22,like Kaiser Soce it's like this mythical stupor boss that everyone probably thinks they're working
00:07:22,00:07:28,under exactly that like so who is this woman it's starting to sound to me like she doesn't exist
00:07:28,00:07:35,where was the clue was it in the original fact where Sarah said she didn't exist
00:07:35,00:07:44,so the story ends in 2009 they found the burned body of a male asylum seeker they took his DNA
00:07:44,00:07:50,in an attempt to identify him and their results had a hit on the database it was the phantom
00:07:50,00:07:56,of Hel Brune they found him but the DNA is definitely female so they've got this man
00:07:56,00:08:04,who's been killed but then the DNA is coming up as this definitely definitely female DNA
00:08:04,00:08:11,so obviously I've written what the fuck was going on was probably what the police said in that
00:08:11,00:08:19,task force like what the hell is this and that's when they realised that this must be a
00:08:19,00:08:25,contamination all of the places that had had shown up the the phantom of Hel Brune's DNA
00:08:25,00:08:33,the cotton swabs that are used to take DNA traces they um they all came from exactly the same factory
00:08:33,00:08:39,in Bavaria where they employed Eastern European women and the reason that this had been allowed
00:08:39,00:08:44,to happen was that those swabs were supposed to be for medical use not for forensic police use
00:08:45,00:08:49,so there was never an instruction to them that they couldn't like lick the swabs
00:08:49,00:08:53,I mean they're not licking the medical swabs though are they
00:08:53,00:08:57,no I don't think so I think they're just maybe not having the same you know like air
00:08:57,00:09:02,airtight completely safe things and so yeah it was just this incredible DNA mistake and
00:09:02,00:09:08,there have been other DNA mistakes and do you think Sarah because it's like everyone trusts
00:09:08,00:09:14,DNA so much don't they it's like this basically if DNA says it's right then it must be right and
00:09:14,00:09:18,all of the other evidence pointing to it being wrong must be wrong do you know what I mean
00:09:18,00:09:22,but people who are really scared of DNA it's for that exact reason like so we've had cases in the
00:09:22,00:09:27,UK there's a case I think his name's Adam Scott which you guys might have read about but he was
00:09:27,00:09:31,sent to prison for four and a half months for a crime in Manchester it was a really brutal
00:09:31,00:09:36,crime on a woman and um and he said that he was in Plymouth or Portsmouth he was one of those
00:09:36,00:09:42,places down south he said he said I was definitely there so he he had an absolutely watertight alibi
00:09:42,00:09:46,which they didn't check because they had his DNA on the victim and then after four and a half
00:09:46,00:09:50,months of being in prison and obviously he was he was actually in a paedophile and rapist's
00:09:50,00:09:56,wing of a prison so he's also having like a terrible time um it then turned out that his
00:09:56,00:10:02,crime actually what he'd done is he spat in the street and they'd taken his um saliva and they'd
00:10:02,00:10:07,they'd in the lab they'd confused the samples one from a brutal crime one from one from spitting
00:10:08,00:10:13,and he'd gone to prison for nearly five months now I'm not saying that that's an appropriate
00:10:13,00:10:17,sentence to spend five months in a paedophile wing of a prison for spitting in the street
00:10:17,00:10:23,but I it's not far off yeah I do hate spitting I do but but also I think a lot of premiership
00:10:23,00:10:29,footballers are going to suddenly be in prison oh god can I just ask do we know who this Bavarian
00:10:29,00:10:34,woman is and was she informed of all her crimes yeah she's the she's the phantom of hell broom
00:10:36,00:10:40,did so did we did they track her down I actually couldn't get to the bottom of that I'm sure
00:10:40,00:10:45,she really maybe wouldn't want to be identified yeah there must be data protection issues about
00:10:45,00:10:50,that although although if I was a serial killer uh and I wanted to commit crimes across multiple
00:10:50,00:10:55,jurisdictions across multiple years I would definitely get a job in a factory that packed
00:10:55,00:10:59,cotton swabs and then I would just crack the cotton swabs to where they had been that's a lot
00:10:59,00:11:05,of work and I'd commit my crimes there Andy that's just second novel right there there was a murder
00:11:05,00:11:11,called the time travel murder it was in the 90s and what happened was they found the body
00:11:11,00:11:17,and they took DNA from it and they matched it with someone who had died a few years ago and they
00:11:17,00:11:22,were like how on earth could that happen you know how can you have someone who who died and then
00:11:22,00:11:27,committed the murder and what it was is they've been using the same nail clippers to cut the
00:11:27,00:11:33,fingernails to test right and from now on they always use disposable fingernail clippers whenever
00:11:33,00:11:39,they're taking any fingernail stuff and they always put the clippers in with the clippings
00:11:39,00:11:44,so whenever you take the DNA you always have the item which found the DNA in the first place
00:11:44,00:11:50,I found a case like that as well so this is this is in America in California um so a man called
00:11:50,00:11:56,Lucas Anderson was considered as the main suspect in the murder of a silicone valley millionaire
00:11:56,00:12:00,but what happened was that paramedics had treated him earlier in the day so he hadn't died
00:12:00,00:12:05,but they'd then accidentally transferred his DNA to the crime scene when they attended with the
00:12:05,00:12:10,victim later on they must have thought that's such a coincidence as well god that's so weird that
00:12:10,00:12:14,that bloke we were treating earlier today turns out to have been here murdering someone but I don't
00:12:14,00:12:18,know if it's the same one but there was one that was like that where the guy was being treated because
00:12:18,00:12:23,basically he was blind drunk and they took him into the hospital and obviously all this kind of
00:12:23,00:12:27,contamination happened but then when they arrested him afterwards he was like well I was drunk I might
00:12:27,00:12:36,have killed someone I guess it's pretty bad but you can like if um if you shake hands with someone
00:12:36,00:12:42,for two minutes and then the person that you shook hands with is uh touches a knife then your DNA
00:12:42,00:12:47,will be on that knife that's another great plot that's a great plot line and it's the handshake
00:12:47,00:12:52,murderer um no no no it is two minutes he's when he's very friendly who can you convince to shake
00:12:52,00:12:59,your hand for two minutes I bet Darren Brown could do it that's true I found a DNA related crime this
00:12:59,00:13:05,year that was a good this is a good result for the police but it's not a human one it's the police
00:13:05,00:13:11,in south wales there's just been this year a trial about a missing cow oh yeah um so this cow went
00:13:11,00:13:17,missing very expensive cow cost three thousand pounds it was worth that and um the farmer who had
00:13:17,00:13:22,owned it he suspected one of his neighbouring farmers so they've took blood samples and this
00:13:22,00:13:26,by the way this all happened three years ago and it's come to trial now I imagine there was a very
00:13:26,00:13:32,lengthy pre-trial procedure but they took blood samples they compared with them with samples from
00:13:32,00:13:39,the complainant's farm from the victim's farm and it proved that the cows were related so it's a good
00:13:39,00:13:45,result well that's a good news story yeah no one was murdered and the guy got his cow back
00:13:45,00:13:48,you know what 2020 hasn't been that bad at all
00:13:48,00:13:59,um have you guys heard of soulmate um you're gonna have to give us more context so I've
00:13:59,00:14:03,been looking into lots of different ways that you can you can bust a criminal and obviously it's
00:14:03,00:14:09,from DNA through to looking at prints there's so many different ways and soulmate is a really
00:14:09,00:14:15,interesting thing that's been set up which is they also track the footprints of criminals as
00:14:15,00:14:20,they're leaving and arriving and often you can see the print of the soul of a shoe but you don't
00:14:20,00:14:26,necessarily know immediately what that shoe is a soulmate is a database that has over 31 000 individual
00:14:26,00:14:31,footwear records that quickly helps you to identify so on the spot you can put in the shape you can
00:14:31,00:14:35,put in the logo you can put in the crime scene print basically and it matches it to an existing
00:14:35,00:14:39,type of footwear it's remarkable how they can track down if it's a new shoe they can find out who
00:14:39,00:14:44,bought the shoes in the area and so on yeah andy another one for your novel maybe is like someone
00:14:44,00:14:48,takes some converse and cuts the soul off and then puts them on the bottom of some duck martins or
00:14:48,00:14:56,something oh that's really good different size um some more ideas for your novel andy while we're
00:14:56,00:15:02,still brainstorming so um if you get a bone marrow transplant from someone then your DNA will be the
00:15:02,00:15:08,same as the person who gave you the transplant so that's quite a good one that's wow that's amazing
00:15:08,00:15:15,and also you know um they kind of one use of DNA is to find species in the wild right you might take
00:15:15,00:15:20,a bit of soil and then sequence the DNA and you can tell what animals have been there and stuff
00:15:20,00:15:25,like that well the best way of doing that is not by collecting samples but by collecting stuff
00:15:25,00:15:31,from spider's webs because whenever an animal hits a spider's web they leave some DNA in that web
00:15:31,00:15:35,and so you can take the webs and you can work out what animals live in a forest for instance
00:15:35,00:15:40,so maybe your murderer kind of is running through a forest gets caught in a massive spider's web
00:15:40,00:15:46,and they use that as a as a thing I love that okay so how about this while you're shaking hands with
00:15:46,00:15:51,someone for two minutes right you're the killer um you use that they're distracted by the handshake
00:15:51,00:15:57,and you use that time to inject them with some of your bone marrow right so then they've got your
00:15:57,00:16:02,DNA inside them but you've got their DNA on your hand and then you can go and commit the crime it's
00:16:02,00:16:07,like face off uh but slightly wow but hang on if you if you're able to transfer the bone marrow
00:16:07,00:16:12,as the murderer isn't that all you need to do transfer the bone marrow and then drop them off
00:16:12,00:16:17,outside a police station and they would be busted as you for all the crimes but Andy's just going
00:16:17,00:16:21,for a second level I think I haven't committed the crime yet Dan because I need their DNA on my
00:16:21,00:16:25,hand before I hold them in yeah I think the third level in what you're forgetting is actually
00:16:25,00:16:30,it should be a spider because they've got eight hands they can they can shake hands with eight
00:16:30,00:16:36,people at the same time they can get eight lots of DNA while catching people in their webs and
00:16:36,00:16:41,stealing their DNA and also no one will suspect them because they're a spider and then imagine
00:16:41,00:16:49,how small their fake converse will be oh well guys thank you you've put so much thought into
00:16:49,00:16:58,what is going to be easily the worst novel published okay it's time for fact number two
00:16:58,00:17:05,and that is Andy my fact is that to run a Boeing 747 you need a binder full of floppy disks
00:17:05,00:17:12,okay is that like the key is that the key to turn it on a floppy it's not the key to turn it on no
00:17:12,00:17:20,wouldn't that be nice but this is a fact that's been revealed recently or I mean I think a lot
00:17:20,00:17:26,of people who work in 747s will have known it already but Boeing 747s and in fact a lot of planes
00:17:26,00:17:34,Boeing 747 737s they were products of the late 80s and at that time the most effective way to store
00:17:34,00:17:41,information was with the floppy disk and there was a recently a cyber security firm did a walkthrough
00:17:41,00:17:48,for of a decommission 747 and someone spotted a drive in there and said oh that's a that's a
00:17:48,00:17:54,floppy disk drive that's very old-fashioned now this isn't every 747 some of them will have
00:17:54,00:17:59,been updated by now but it is still quite a few of them wow didn't we have a very similar
00:17:59,00:18:07,discovery a few years ago about trident yes yeah yes the nukes were all uh well certainly
00:18:07,00:18:11,american nukes were all on floppy disks I think until like only last year or something right
00:18:11,00:18:17,the american ones yeah it's amazing it's it's terrible it's kind of terrifying and it's kind
00:18:17,00:18:21,of terrifying because I guess you know as long as you have the equipment to read these things
00:18:21,00:18:26,does it even matter what there are no exactly I like the idea of the old-fashioned technology
00:18:26,00:18:31,because I like I always really liked clippy the microsoft paperclip and I really like the idea
00:18:31,00:18:37,that he might be just like popping up on things I was like hello it looks like you're trying to
00:18:37,00:18:44,launch a nuclear missile and so Andy what do they use these I read I think that they have like the
00:18:44,00:18:50,details of where the airports are and the flight paths and things like that right yeah exactly and
00:18:50,00:18:56,there is a problem though because these disks they they can store I think a standard like three
00:18:56,00:19:01,and a half inch floppy disk can store about 1.4 megabytes on it give or take um but the database
00:19:01,00:19:06,is that they are loading onto the planes are getting a bit bigger and sometimes you have to
00:19:06,00:19:11,load up to eight disks in sequence and get all the information off them and onto the plane wow
00:19:11,00:19:15,but there might be a bad disk and you might have loaded seven floppy disks with the stuff on
00:19:15,00:19:20,and then you find one of the disks is flawed or corrupted in some way and then you need to start
00:19:20,00:19:24,all over again it'd be a bit disconcerting if you got through seven of the floppy disks and
00:19:24,00:19:29,you had to start again if I was a passenger and I heard an announcement saying from the captain
00:19:29,00:19:34,apologies this flight is going to be taking off late the floppy disks are not respond does anyone
00:19:34,00:19:40,have floppy disk number eight for the London two Barcelona route just on the off track do you know
00:19:40,00:19:45,that Tim Berners-Lee used to go door to door with the internet on a floppy disk no yeah
00:19:45,00:19:50,in order in order to because the big problem obviously when you were telling people about
00:19:50,00:19:54,how the internet would work is that you would need to show them but the reason he invented the
00:19:54,00:19:58,worldwide web is because computers weren't talking to each other if he'd sent them something
00:19:58,00:20:02,their computer was running on different systems it wouldn't necessarily translate it so he had on
00:20:02,00:20:07,a floppy disk in his computer which he would carry around with him he would go to different places
00:20:07,00:20:13,and show them the first website the original CERN website that he'd created and it lived on a floppy
00:20:13,00:20:17,disk and there's a project that's going on at the moment where there's a guy who works at CERN
00:20:17,00:20:24,he works a couple of offices down from where Berners-Lee worked and he's trying to preserve the
00:20:24,00:20:29,earliest bit of the internet where we have the first websites and so on and the very first website
00:20:29,00:20:34,is missing which is the one that Tim Berners-Lee created wow that's very cool and what we don't
00:20:34,00:20:38,know where the earliest one is we don't know if they're convinced it's out there somewhere they
00:20:38,00:20:43,think that there's a disk out there and it was lost at some sort of conference in California
00:20:43,00:20:48,one night uh someone disappeared with this and so it should be out there still there's a hunt
00:20:48,00:20:53,going on they've asked the globe that's a job for the work experience kid isn't it can you just go
00:20:53,00:20:58,through these five billion disks one of them should have the first website on it if there are any
00:20:58,00:21:02,pilots listening can you just have a little look around the cockpit if there is there is a spare
00:21:02,00:21:08,disk just check what's on there I would think that the work experience kid wouldn't even know
00:21:08,00:21:14,what a floppy disk was did you see this survey in 2018 that asked children under the age of 18
00:21:14,00:21:21,what each of these things are so they showed them like a floppy disk and a teletext or a postcard
00:21:21,00:21:27,or whatever and 67% of children didn't know what a floppy disk was yeah I think that's fair I think
00:21:27,00:21:33,that's fair I think it would be higher for things like the mini disk which um we have an extensive
00:21:33,00:21:38,mini disk collection at the family home and yeah well you know my parents got really into
00:21:38,00:21:44,storing things on on mini disks which didn't take off spoiler sorry it's weird isn't it that
00:21:44,00:21:50,basically everything that we use now is just going to become obsolete and it doesn't even matter
00:21:50,00:21:55,what kind of things we're saving or whatever it's all in a hundred years time no one will be able
00:21:55,00:22:00,to read any of it it's not like a book where you can everyone will always be able to read the book
00:22:00,00:22:04,well maybe not always but for a long time they will be able to it's like they've come up with a
00:22:04,00:22:11,new way of storing data on like a little quartz thing and it'll last for 13.8 billion years it
00:22:11,00:22:16,lasts forever but of course the problem is that in about 20 years no one even know how to access it
00:22:16,00:22:21,it's going to look like a bit of rock yeah I find that really interesting it'd be really cool though
00:22:21,00:22:28,if like the next rosetta stone is literally a little stone oh wow yeah it could be like the
00:22:28,00:22:35,next rosetta stone they get a usb stick and a mini disk and a floppy disk and they're like how do
00:22:35,00:22:40,we get the data out of this one it's a bit like getting the data out of that one and stuff um
00:22:40,00:22:46,James just on what you're saying there the bbc in 1986 they made a what they call it digital
00:22:46,00:22:52,doomsday book okay so I'm not sure if it was a copy of the real doomsday book or if it was
00:22:52,00:22:58,an example of what civilization was like in 1986 but they made it on an acorn computer
00:22:58,00:23:05,and they used a video disc player so for the storage device anyway 13 years later by 1999 it was
00:23:05,00:23:10,completely unreadable and a team of researchers had to spend three years developing the software
00:23:10,00:23:16,to access something from 1986 oh my god so yeah it's a problem it's cool though there is a lot of
00:23:16,00:23:22,floppy disk archaeology going on which is quite fun so um for example andy warhol a lot of art of
00:23:22,00:23:27,andy warhols is saved onto floppy disks that we don't have and I think it originates with there
00:23:27,00:23:33,was a party that yoko ono threw for shawn lennon when he was young just after john lennon had died
00:23:33,00:23:38,and at the party was andy warhol and one of the guests was steve jobs and steve jobs brought
00:23:38,00:23:44,him the original apple mac computer as a present and he was showing shawn lennon the paint function
00:23:44,00:23:49,on it where he was drawing and andy warhol spotted that and went over and started doing his own
00:23:49,00:23:53,drawings on it and he was fascinated by it and that led to a whole thing of andy warhol doing
00:23:53,00:24:01,original art purely on his his apple on paint or on another computer sorry wow unpack was on paint
00:24:01,00:24:05,wow that yeah and they say he saved them to floppy disks we never published them and so people
00:24:05,00:24:10,have been finding lost andy warhol art on all these floppy disks that are kept in his archives
00:24:10,00:24:15,are going through all the floppies god he might have the original internet yeah he might do i've
00:24:15,00:24:22,got just one more thing on floppy disks which is about prince um oh so cool yes the artist prince
00:24:22,00:24:27,the musician prince prince we all know who i'm talking about when i say prince um so you may remember
00:24:27,00:24:33,in 1993 he changed his name to a symbol which he called the love symbol and it was a combination of
00:24:33,00:24:38,the you know the male and female symbols symbols with the arrow and the cross and things um and it
00:24:38,00:24:42,had entered his consciousness during meditation and so obviously he wanted to get it out there
00:24:42,00:24:47,but the thing is nobody knew how to print it and so his management warner brothers they did
00:24:47,00:24:52,put it up online as well but they also sent out floppy disks of the symbol to various magazines
00:24:52,00:24:59,saying this is what you have to call prince now this is his name um and so yeah that was how they
00:24:59,00:25:04,distributed the new name of prince that's really cool yeah i think he did it also because he was
00:25:04,00:25:09,very annoyed with his management um yes because he had a lot a lot of beef with them he had 500
00:25:09,00:25:15,songs that he wanted to release and warner brothers said that might flood the market for prince songs
00:25:15,00:25:20,just a little bit could you not do that and so he was furious about that and as a result he changed
00:25:20,00:25:25,his name to that um i got one tiny thing which is referencing back to our first fact which is
00:25:25,00:25:31,that um there was an american serial killer who was um they were on the hunt for him and they were
00:25:31,00:25:38,reaching out to this guy to communicate with him and the guy asked out in various channels whether
00:25:38,00:25:44,or not he could communicate with them not in person but via floppy disk and they said yes to that
00:25:44,00:25:49,and they did that by putting it in a newspaper by saying rex it will be okay as a message to him
00:25:49,00:25:54,but they said he couldn't be tracked wasn't that the thing as in yeah yeah it'll be completely
00:25:54,00:25:59,anonymous if you send us a floppy disk exactly he was asking will this be okay will i be will
00:25:59,00:26:03,it be anonymous and they said yes anyway they he sent in the floppy disk they were able to trace
00:26:03,00:26:09,it back to his church and then um they called him this is extraordinary and he was furious how did
00:26:09,00:26:13,they catch him because they used they found out that he'd used the floppy disk on a particular
00:26:13,00:26:18,library computer yeah something like this and they said who's who's a member of the library and it
00:26:18,00:26:22,turns out he was i think ahead of a church yeah yeah they like so basically they lied to him he
00:26:22,00:26:27,said that they won't you can't trace computer like geographic information via floppy disk and they
00:26:27,00:26:33,said no you can't but they they can yeah and he was really annoyed with them for febbing about that
00:26:33,00:26:41,when he murdered multiple people yeah lying is also against the law andy yeah is it yeah you don't
00:26:41,00:26:49,expect the police to be also criminals it's like you can't trust anyone anymore why they're called
00:26:49,00:26:54,floppy disks when they're not floppy i'm so glad you asked james they should actually they should
00:26:54,00:26:59,be called stiffies in south africa they're called stiffies aren't they yes are they it's because
00:26:59,00:27:04,the very original ones but i think also if you're on an aeroplane and you hear the captain saying
00:27:04,00:27:12,there's anyone seen my stiffie then that's going to be even more worried isn't it okay it's time
00:27:12,00:27:19,for fact number three and that is james okay my fact this week is that in the 1920 us election
00:27:19,00:27:24,which was the first after women got the vote in america only one woman in the whole of georgia
00:27:24,00:27:32,managed to cast a vote um so this is the 19th amendment uh it was ratified in august 1920
00:27:32,00:27:38,and it granted women the vote but the election took place on the 2nd of november so it's only
00:27:38,00:27:43,a few months later and most of the states kind of facilitated the new voters like they came up
00:27:43,00:27:47,with ways to make sure that people could register in time but mississippi and georgia especially
00:27:47,00:27:52,were so against the idea they were so massively against the idea of women voting that they tried
00:27:52,00:27:58,to make it as difficult as possible for women to vote and in georgia they said you had to be
00:27:58,00:28:04,you had to have registered six months before the election in order to cast a vote and obviously
00:28:04,00:28:10,six months before the election they hadn't ratified the law yet but luckily there was one lady called
00:28:10,00:28:18,mary jara white who somehow on april the first signed her name on her poll tax and also registered
00:28:18,00:28:22,to vote at that time no one's quite sure how she managed to do it the time traveling vote
00:28:25,00:28:29,it's so strange because it seems like she shouldn't have been allowed to do it but
00:28:29,00:28:35,whoever was organising it um allowed her and she was allowed to vote in november and she did
00:28:35,00:28:40,but she voted for the losing candidate but she still managed to vote i like i like the idea that
00:28:40,00:28:45,they were like um or what harm can she do she's silly idea or let us sign she'll never be able to
00:28:45,00:28:54,actually use our vote yeah also april first not the best day to sort of have what looks like a prank
00:28:54,00:28:57,a woman finally voting yeah to know if you'd believe it oh do you think that's what she
00:28:57,00:29:02,was doing in april fools and her husband she came home like guess what i've got the vote
00:29:02,00:29:11,and then at midday she's like ah got you um yeah but georgia um at the time uh 58 percent of the
00:29:11,00:29:16,population of georgia were baptists and um the baptist religion uh certainly then is still now
00:29:16,00:29:21,but certainly then it was very much against women being allowed to do anything they were
00:29:21,00:29:27,subservient to the men the men organised the family uh and the women just if they had any
00:29:27,00:29:31,influence they were supposed to influence their husbands and then their husbands would influence
00:29:31,00:29:37,society um georgia's constitution said that females are not entitled to the privilege
00:29:37,00:29:43,of the elective franchise nor can they hold any civil office or perform any civil functions
00:29:43,00:29:48,and there was only one position in office that they were allowed to hold and it was state librarian
00:29:49,00:29:54,if librarian was the only job that i was allowed and i was to be subservient what i would do is cut
00:29:54,00:30:02,the last page out of every single novel in the library and then i would like fuck you men oh my
00:30:02,00:30:06,god imagine getting through all the way through and the second novel and not finding out that it
00:30:06,00:30:11,was a spider after all all the reveals are on the last page in this novel as well i'm really
00:30:11,00:30:19,patting it right under the end um i was looking into sort of other examples of uh women voting
00:30:19,00:30:24,early or sort of other earliest women to vote in various places um this was a really weird thing
00:30:24,00:30:32,after the american revolution for three decades in new jersey women and men had exactly the same
00:30:32,00:30:38,voting rights and women were allowed to vote not in national elections but in new jersey they could
00:30:38,00:30:43,and um and they did vote so that the people have been looking through old electoral lists and they
00:30:43,00:30:49,found lots of women's names in some places it's not 50 50 but it's up to about 15 percent of voters
00:30:49,00:30:56,were women uh there and it was um it was racially equal to as whether you were black or white and
00:30:56,00:31:05,then um it was restricted in 1807 to white men it was seen as some kind of oversight that had happened
00:31:05,00:31:10,because there were all these charges of uh the people said there were petticoat electors
00:31:10,00:31:15,which is women who'd been manipulated you know they they couldn't possibly know make an informed
00:31:15,00:31:19,decision about who they were voting for um so that was one supposed problem with the system
00:31:19,00:31:24,and the other problem was apparently men putting on dresses to vote and then voting six or seven
00:31:24,00:31:28,times for the same person i'm manipulating the vote that way which i would have thought would
00:31:28,00:31:36,make you more conspicuous as a as a voter it's not clear to me how that helps yeah and how come
00:31:36,00:31:41,they're not petticoat manipulators if they're dressed as women surely that's also yeah yeah andy
00:31:41,00:31:50,again i i'm not saying that i approve of this lockdown that happened on i'm voting but i think
00:31:50,00:31:55,that's amazing that that was such an early sort of aberration there yeah again not aberration in a
00:31:55,00:32:00,bad sense as an aberration a positive aberration from the norm but actually before 1920 there are
00:32:00,00:32:07,a few different states that allowed women to vote so uh wyoming had full women's suffrage from 1869
00:32:07,00:32:12,but the reason they did that is because they wanted to attract single women to the state
00:32:12,00:32:18,really yeah they had a lot of kind of migrant male workers who were working in wyoming and they
00:32:18,00:32:22,thought well how can we get more women here well let's let them vote they should have done what
00:32:22,00:32:31,nightclubs did in Essex on a friday which is make it free hooch free hooch for ladies in groups they
00:32:31,00:32:38,don't have a man with them what what is what is hooch Sarah oh you're so young what hooch is
00:32:38,00:32:46,no it's not young what it's poshness um so you remember alco pops uh yeah yeah yeah so so hooch
00:32:46,00:32:54,was kind of one of the original mass marketed uh it was it was a lemon flavor drink uh so like uh uh
00:32:54,00:32:59,i guess that and it was marketed towards women okay well i like hooch as well okay but i mean
00:32:59,00:33:05,when i say marketed towards i absolutely don't mean that it was supposed to be in a feminine drink
00:33:05,00:33:09,but it was like a if women don't like the taste of beer then you've got this now sweet drink you
00:33:09,00:33:14,can drink out of a bottle at a nightclub actually i quite liked watermelon bacardi breezes as well
00:33:14,00:33:19,so maybe i was just of course you did you've got a heart taste buds
00:33:19,00:33:28,and the other state which had full women's suffrage um at the time was utah and the reason they did
00:33:28,00:33:32,it is because they wanted to show the rest of the country that the women were not oppressed by the
00:33:32,00:33:38,practice of polygamy and they're saying no no but look they can vote they can vote yeah i read about
00:33:38,00:33:44,this and they also didn't they hope that women would vote for um the the non-church leaders so
00:33:44,00:33:49,they would perhaps this this was a way of ending the practice of polygamy was to allow women to
00:33:49,00:33:53,vote and then they would vote against it unfortunately they kept voting for it and then
00:33:53,00:33:57,people said all right well let's take the vote away from women in utah after all so backfired
00:33:57,00:34:02,but that was the thing wasn't it they they sort of worried that once women were given the vote
00:34:02,00:34:07,that it was a sort of useless vote anyway because of the nature of the relationship between husbands
00:34:07,00:34:11,being this dominant character in the relationship they would only vote for what the husband told
00:34:11,00:34:17,them to vote for anyway so it was a sort of it was a canceled out vote in terms of if they'd go the
00:34:17,00:34:22,other way which is really interesting because there's been recent polls that show that had it not been
00:34:22,00:34:29,for the voting of women in recent elections in america between 1968 and 2004 republicans would
00:34:29,00:34:34,have swept every single presidential race in that period uh when they broke it down and looked at it
00:34:34,00:34:39,yeah so interesting but also that's why it's so important that voting is secret because then of
00:34:39,00:34:44,course even if you did have somebody oppressive in your household you can always say oh yeah i voted
00:34:44,00:34:48,for exactly who you told me to but you still have your autonomy and your freedom to cast the vote for
00:34:48,00:34:53,you yes all of you believe if all of your wives are telling you to vote one way you've got to have
00:34:53,00:34:59,the freedom to say yeah of course yeah i love the idea that the women in utah were like why would we
00:34:59,00:35:06,get rid of polygamy i don't want a husband all to myself god just spread him out between i only
00:35:06,00:35:15,have to see him once every eight days when the 19th amendment was passed um the president at the time
00:35:15,00:35:24,was woodrow wilson but woodrow wilson had had a stroke um in october of 1919 and actually his
00:35:24,00:35:31,wife was the de facto president of america around that time so the doctors came in kind of secretly
00:35:31,00:35:36,and didn't really want anyone to know that he was really sick uh and they said he said well
00:35:36,00:35:41,obviously woodrow wilson can't really do anything but what we're going to say is maybe edith wilson
00:35:41,00:35:46,can kind of run everything on the sidelines and he can kind of just be there and not do any press
00:35:46,00:35:53,and stuff like that so technically or not technically but de facto lee um the president of the united
00:35:53,00:35:59,states when the 19th amendment was passed was edith wilson female i knew it was suspicious i knew it
00:35:59,00:36:07,was suspicious well on the other hand um she was very much anti suffragettes i think possibly
00:36:07,00:36:12,because she had to be uh and because you know obviously they were fighting against the president
00:36:12,00:36:17,at the time but um she called the suffragettes the devils of the workhouse so yeah that's reverse
00:36:17,00:36:23,psychology that's how you that's that's how you get yourself into a powerful position no no that's
00:36:23,00:36:30,the last thing i want to say got it have you guys heard of um the suffragette cookbooks that were
00:36:30,00:36:37,published in the usa no this is very weird so you don't associate um the suffragist movement with
00:36:37,00:36:42,you know the home economics thing and and publishing cookbooks but this is exactly why
00:36:42,00:36:48,they were published so the the kind of stock impression or uh that was given by opponents
00:36:48,00:36:52,of the suffragette movement was that you know these women were neglecting their families
00:36:52,00:36:57,they were letting their children go hungry they weren't looking after the home so the the movement
00:36:57,00:37:03,got together and published lots of um cookbooks with kind of suffragette recipes and um they were
00:37:03,00:37:08,quite they were quite good one of them was for emergency salad which is one part onion to
00:37:08,00:37:16,nine parts apple with any dressing that's the salad so how bad is this emergency you're going to eat
00:37:16,00:37:25,an onion um yeah and so these books had lots of stuff in one of the one of the women inside
00:37:25,00:37:31,there was alice bunker stockham who was the uh only the fifth female doctor in the usa and she
00:37:31,00:37:36,was openly pro masturbation for men and for women alike which was her that was her big thing was
00:37:36,00:37:50,this is part of the recipe he did say any dressing i don't know if if one of my criticisms of the
00:37:50,00:37:55,suffragettes was that these women aren't neglecting their domestic duties i don't think the apple
00:37:55,00:38:00,onion salad would convince me otherwise that's a good point i think that would be my proof of
00:38:00,00:38:09,life look at what these lazy bitches are calling it dinner it's an onion and an apple you're
00:38:09,00:38:17,kidding me i want lasagna i didn't realize what an influence the british suffragettes had on the
00:38:17,00:38:23,american ones um i've read a few articles about this and it's so for example emeline pankhurst
00:38:23,00:38:30,did tours of america talking to huge groups of people about the the fight for women's rights
00:38:30,00:38:36,and she played madison square garden which as you know we're all performers here like what a gig
00:38:36,00:38:42,madison square garden yeah do you think that was already like i've broken america exactly she
00:38:42,00:38:47,didn't fill it she had 3000 people there but i mean that's that's as big a gig as you know the three
00:38:47,00:38:51,of us from fish have ever played that's you compare those sorts of things as a fish to the
00:38:51,00:38:58,suffragette movement to the usa can i just say also dan we we played 3300 at the um hammer smith
00:38:58,00:39:06,apollos so slightly more actually than the pankhurst yeah okay what is the capacity of madison
00:39:06,00:39:13,square gardens it's it's over 30 000 i think oh okay so actually she did she did really badly
00:39:13,00:39:19,she definitely tanked it maybe she said it's socially distanced
00:39:20,00:39:29,yes spanish fluv yeah gotta be careful yeah sorry it's 19810 just to just to lessen the bombing
00:39:29,00:39:34,of the sales for her um no but that is that is that that's the depressing thing when you get the
00:39:34,00:39:42,email every sunday with your ticket sales and she's sending out loads of tweets like plenty of tickets
00:39:42,00:39:48,left bring your friends two for one can't find out about british feminism there'll be a free emergency
00:39:48,00:39:59,salad for everyone who buys a ticket okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is
00:39:59,00:40:03,my fact my fact this week is that there is a species of japanese water beetle that survives
00:40:03,00:40:08,being swallowed by a frog by crawling through the frog's body and escaping out of its anus
00:40:08,00:40:16,now wow this is amazing it's the first documented example of prey doing this through a predator
00:40:16,00:40:21,escaping via the digestive system it has to literally crawl all the way through the digestive
00:40:21,00:40:27,system and make its way out the back and it's um it's a thing that was discovered at kobi university
00:40:27,00:40:34,where a frog was put into this enclosure see-through box and this water beetle was in there
00:40:34,00:40:40,water beetle got swallowed and there was nothing for 115 minutes and then suddenly you see and
00:40:40,00:40:46,there's videos online you can watch crawling out of the bumhole of this frog is this full
00:40:46,00:40:50,water beetle that's covered a bit in feces you can't really see that but they tell you it is
00:40:50,00:40:55,and it just wanders off and we've never seen this before so it's very exciting i'm a bit
00:40:55,00:40:59,i'm a bit worried that you sold that so well that you could go online and watch a video of a beetle
00:40:59,00:41:03,crawling out of a frog's anus covered in feces that probably no one's listening now they've
00:41:03,00:41:09,probably all gone to watch it oh that's true okay well welcome back to the show you've seen it now
00:41:09,00:41:16,amazing isn't it um so yeah so uh this is um this is a guy by the way who experiments a lot on
00:41:16,00:41:21,the defense mechanisms the defense mechanisms that he says are sort of impossible defense
00:41:21,00:41:25,mechanisms that you could not predict and he's found a number of things that are really interesting
00:41:25,00:41:30,a bombardier beetle being swallowed by a frog will eventually be vomited back up because of an
00:41:30,00:41:35,explosion of chemicals inside he's he's responsible for us documenting all that stuff and this is his
00:41:35,00:41:40,latest discovery we should say this guy's name he's called Shinji Sugiyura and he's an ecologist
00:41:40,00:41:46,at Kev University and he's got loads of form on this as you say Dan it's unbelievable
00:41:46,00:41:52,and so he he he wanted to test properly because the frog doesn't have teeth when it eats the beetle
00:41:52,00:41:58,so that's partly why the beetle survives um but i say it's a really big part of the reason oh yeah
00:41:58,00:42:03,yeah they happen i because i feel like all the animals who can't escape from bum holes or from
00:42:03,00:42:08,mouths like it is because they've been chewed up by the the the person or the animal eating that
00:42:08,00:42:14,it's not because they haven't evolved to be clever enough no no you're right it's yeah it's a major
00:42:14,00:42:20,part of the success strategy make sure you're eaten by someone which has no teeth um but he
00:42:20,00:42:24,wanted to test how they do it and so he took some of the beetles that he was going to be testing on
00:42:24,00:42:29,and he glued their legs together with sticky wax so basically he turned them into harry houdini
00:42:30,00:42:36,beetles and then he let them be swallowed by the frog and those ones uh were immobilized as it were
00:42:36,00:42:43,and those ones did not manage to make their way out so his hypothesis at the moment is that
00:42:43,00:42:48,what they're what they're doing with when their legs are free and they're swallowed is that they're
00:42:48,00:42:53,using their legs not only to propel themselves through but to hammer on the sphincter of the frog
00:42:53,00:42:59,and and convince it to expel them i read it as tickle the cloacal opening rather than hammering
00:42:59,00:43:04,right i may have sexed it up a little bit i'm sorry for you know sorry that andy sexed it's
00:43:04,00:43:09,hammering over tickling is more sexy well it depends how it depends how you want to kind
00:43:09,00:43:14,of anthropomorphise the beetle is it terrified it's going get me out of here or is it going oh
00:43:14,00:43:21,this is fun i really don't like this hypothesis where he's like i wonder if things are harder if
00:43:21,00:43:28,your hand comes oh yes it turns out it's actually more difficult to do things it's interesting
00:43:28,00:43:32,though because the tickling at the end almost suggests that that's a bit of information that's
00:43:32,00:43:37,passed on to all the beetles that once you get to the end the way to open the magic gate is there's
00:43:37,00:43:42,a little tickly thing and you've got to tickle that that sounds to me more like that's you have to
00:43:42,00:43:46,have inherent knowledge whereas the hammering can we use the technical words like anus rather than
00:43:46,00:43:53,magic gate we tell you this every week dan what you just said sounded like what used to happen
00:43:53,00:43:58,in like just seventeen and more magazine it's like if you want your guy to speed up there's a magic
00:43:58,00:44:05,button up he's gone tickle the magic gate has very different overtones to hammer on the anus
00:44:05,00:44:14,yeah it's a terrible children's book but yeah the hammering sounds more like the right hypothesis
00:44:14,00:44:18,i would say it's sort of just uh i'm at the end i'm trying to keep going it's like when you know
00:44:18,00:44:22,when you're running out of seconds at the crystal maze get me out you know it's that kind of moment
00:44:22,00:44:29,but also presumably if you've been struggling all of the way down through the frog's body anyway
00:44:29,00:44:34,like you would still be moving there it's just that because because human beings have two sphincters
00:44:34,00:44:39,don't we we have kind of one that we have no conscious control over and one that we do have
00:44:39,00:44:45,conscious control over and and so obviously if there's movement in a part of your body where
00:44:45,00:44:51,it's kind of automatic you would just then feel the need to go to the toilet yeah it's a way yeah
00:44:51,00:44:57,it's how you can have emergencies because the the non the part of the your sphincter you don't have
00:44:57,00:45:01,conscious control over will be like right i'm ready to go and then the conscious part goes oh my god
00:45:01,00:45:07,this is an emergency situation why did we why did we evolve to have a dumb sphincter and a smart
00:45:07,00:45:12,sphincter i think maybe it's a safety thing as in it might there might be scenarios where it's more
00:45:12,00:45:18,dangerous to draw attention to yourself yeah if you're trying to stay very quiet and avoid a predator
00:45:18,00:45:23,and then yeah yeah which doesn't make sense because actually it's a fantastic weapon to
00:45:23,00:45:30,have to hand yeah if you are in danger what just randomly pooing with no no because then you could
00:45:30,00:45:35,just throw you could just throw it at the lion or whatever or the the or the bad monkey
00:45:35,00:45:42,so just very quickly on the rest of this study so the really interesting thing is we
00:45:42,00:45:49,we do know of other animals that pass through the digestive system of another animal right
00:45:49,00:45:53,there are a few of those but what is really interesting about this is the fact that we
00:45:53,00:45:58,we think that they're actually actively crawling through there and the reason that we know that
00:45:58,00:46:03,is because like you say they he salitates his legs together or whatever glued the legs together
00:46:03,00:46:10,but also that the bugs can get out with as little time as like six minutes whereas normally it would
00:46:10,00:46:14,take a couple of days for a frog to digest its food but they can get out there in six minutes
00:46:14,00:46:20,six minutes is the real that is the real crystal maze thing isn't it yeah imagine eating a meal
00:46:20,00:46:25,completely unaware and then feeling terrible and realizing that your meal is still alive
00:46:25,00:46:32,and it's yeah it's got a destination in mind there is a beetle called the coffee berry borough
00:46:32,00:46:41,that lives exclusively on coffee beans but it can't eat caffeine so it only eats coffee but
00:46:41,00:46:46,it doesn't like caffeine and the only way they can do it is they have a special bacteria inside them
00:46:46,00:46:52,that kind of deals with the caffeine and if you take all the bacteria out of it out of this beetle
00:46:52,00:46:56,by giving it antibiotics or whatever it'll die because it can't can't deal with the coffee
00:46:56,00:47:01,so it only likes to eat science is so awful and if you and if you glue all their hands together
00:47:01,00:47:06,no they can't even pick up anymore coffee beans what's an interesting science experiment
00:47:06,00:47:13,yeah you're right i mean how are you going to learn things but at the same time
00:47:13,00:47:17,for the individual coffee berry borough why can't we just all appreciate life's mysteries
00:47:17,00:47:26,have you guys heard of the epomis beetle in fact i i i don't think we've mentioned this before
00:47:26,00:47:32,again frogs pry on it uh the frog bites it but at the moment where the frog bites it this beetle
00:47:32,00:47:39,lover sinks its teeth into the frog's tongue right and then it starts releasing enzymes
00:47:39,00:47:46,which melt the frog's flesh and this oh my god this goes on for a few days unfortunately for the
00:47:46,00:47:51,frog and the frog is just stuck there with what it thought was its lunch and it's slowly being eaten
00:47:51,00:47:58,by its lunch it's basically it gets turned into a straw through which the beetle lover is drinking
00:47:58,00:48:02,and eventually the frog is just a part of skin and bones it's dead and the the lava wanders off
00:48:02,00:48:09,so the scientists who were testing this they observed 400 standoffs between these two the
00:48:09,00:48:15,beetle always wins oh my god there was one case there was one case where a toad managed to grab
00:48:15,00:48:20,the beetle and quickly swallow it and then it started looking a bit peaky two hours later it
00:48:20,00:48:26,threw up and then the beetle ate the toad oh my god and andy can you let me know is there
00:48:26,00:48:34,anywhere i can watch this on youtube uh yeah yeah it's funny pranks for toads there's there's another
00:48:34,00:48:41,beetle the male diving beetle it has sperm which uh team up with each other so this is very rare
00:48:41,00:48:47,obviously yeah normally sperm is a kind of um one of those games it's sort of one versus everybody
00:48:47,00:48:53,you know zero sum game i'm yeah like british bulldog it's like british bulldog sorry sarah
00:48:53,00:48:57,came up with a proper academic answer what i was trying to say was it's like british bulldog
00:48:57,00:49:06,so but this is the really weird thing the male diving beetle their sperm effectively do a conga
00:49:06,00:49:11,and they team up hundreds of them and and even thousands of them and they all go in a line or
00:49:11,00:49:16,they sometimes go in a crocodile they'll go in pairs and it's because the female diving beetles
00:49:16,00:49:22,reproductive tract is unbelievably complicated and um the female will often store sperm for
00:49:22,00:49:29,for months or years to fertilize herself later and um the males kind of form a train trying to
00:49:29,00:49:34,just get through to the area they need to be to fertilize the egg um because otherwise they will
00:49:34,00:49:40,just be lost what's in it for the other sperms the sperms at the back of the conga i don't know
00:49:40,00:49:45,i guess but it will probably improve all of their chances of getting there even if they're not the
00:49:45,00:49:50,person at the front i suppose and you all have this very similar genetic material don't you so
00:49:50,00:49:54,you're still passing it on that's a good point but what as as you say what is the point of being at
00:49:54,00:49:58,the back of a conga what's the point of being in a conga well sometimes it splits off and you become
00:49:58,00:50:04,the front that's very stressful i wonder if that happens with these sperms not at the back though
00:50:04,00:50:10,you can't let go at the back that's just a person walking if you're still kicking your legs out to
00:50:10,00:50:16,the side then it's still a conga even if it's just you i've never had that happen to me doing a
00:50:16,00:50:20,conga but i would be terrified that it would i would cling on for dear life to avoid the
00:50:20,00:50:25,responsibility of becoming the king but sometimes the conga sometimes like flips around in a way
00:50:25,00:50:30,you're not expecting and no one has a good enough grip to hold on to the person oh my god or it
00:50:30,00:50:33,goes it goes into a place you don't want to go like it's they start going they think it'd be
00:50:33,00:50:37,funny to go into the toilet so it's like it's a wedding i don't want to go and look at people at
00:50:37,00:50:46,the urinals and i think if they have like very complicated labyrinthine um uh vaginas that probably
00:50:46,00:50:50,that is exactly what we're saying about there will be conga and splits off and things going around and
00:50:50,00:50:55,also getting becoming becoming very tired the energy exerted means that some of them will get
00:50:55,00:51:00,tired at the front and i think it will be a collective yeah it'll still give you a good
00:51:00,00:51:04,chance because that also happens in a conga sometimes you get like a wave of speed don't you
00:51:04,00:51:08,like some of the people at the front go a bit too fast and then some of the slower people can't
00:51:08,00:51:12,hold on and then they become the front of the conga that's very cool i feel like biology is
00:51:12,00:51:25,actually so easy you just use a conga analogy okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you
00:51:25,00:51:29,so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that
00:51:29,00:51:33,we have said over the course of this podcast we can be found on our twitter accounts i'm on at
