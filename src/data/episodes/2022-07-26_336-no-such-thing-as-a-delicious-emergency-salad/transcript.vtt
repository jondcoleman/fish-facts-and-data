00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, just so you don't think that Anna has suddenly

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.300
 affected a East London accent, she is still away and in her stead this week we have the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.040
 absolutely fantastically funny, brilliant, smart, amazing comedian Sarah Pasco.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.040
 Now Sarah has a book that's just come out in paperback, it's called Sex Power Money

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.040
 and that book has an accompanying podcast which is also called Sex Power Money which

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.320
 you can find in all your normal podcast providers. Both of those things are absolutely brilliant,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.560
 you should definitely check them out but for now, on with the podcast.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.680
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.040
 Hunter Murray, James Harkin and special guest Sarah Pasco and once again we have gathered

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.600
 around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:26.560
 order here we go. Starting with you, Sarah. Hello everybody, my fact is for 15 years German police

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:36.880
 hunted a serial killer who didn't exist. Wow, amazing. It is amazing but it's also quite dark,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 it does involve things like murders, so it isn't like a trigger warning but I know that your show

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.920
 is sometimes just like 'oh this ladybird bought a hat' so if anyone is listening... I think you're

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.160
 confusing us with play school. Yeah I mean more like this ladybird looks like she bought a hat

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.200
 but actually it's a very interesting evolutionary shadow. So I just wanted to say to people who

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.440
 are listening like if there are children I'm not going to go into any great detail about murders

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:15.680
 but it does mention murders. So in 2007 two police officers were shot in Hellbron so obviously it's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.000
 terrible a 22 year old female officer is killed and her male colleague was badly injured. Now they

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.560
 found the DNA of the killer at the scene and they ran it through a database where obviously DNA has

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:37.040
 been stored from other crimes and they found multiple matches. In 2001 a 61 year old furniture

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.280
 dealer in Freiburg Germany had been murdered by strangulation and the DNA of the killer of the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.640
 police was found in his apartment and so this is completely befuddling for the police because this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.000
 is completely different MO, this is a manual strangulation of a furniture dealer and then this

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.360
 murder of the police which seemed to be completely different because they couldn't connect the reasons

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.080
 why you would commit those murders. This becomes even more confusing when they found a match to a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.320
 very very cold case from 1993 a 62 year old woman and again a different murder MO. They tried to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.200
 find links between those two victims the 61 year old and the 62 year old but they weren't connected

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.640
 in any way at all. So they've got a serial killer and it turns out from this DNA that this is a woman

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.560
 which is incredibly rare to have a female serial killer. She's been working for nearly 20 years

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.400
 not working I know it's not working she's been employed as a serial killer for like for like

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.960
 two decades. They're going back through all of these cold cases going through the data and the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.720
 stuff that's coming up on her is just so incredulous. So at the end of October in 2001 in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.320
 Budenheim Germany there's a break-in in a trailer right so no murders are committed because it was

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:04.400
 empty at the time and her DNA is found on a half eaten cookie on the side of this trailer so they

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.680
 don't know what she was doing there but they now have a name for this this serial killer this woman

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.880
 they call her the Phantom of Hell Brune. Now if I was if I was the German police at this point in

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.360
 the case I would have called her the Cookie Monster because she's killed three people.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 I think that the reason they had no sense of humour about it is because she'd killed a police

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.080
 officer I think I think if she I think if she hadn't they'd have had a lot more fun with the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.960
 naming. But Sarah you're saying she didn't exist what's going on? Well well at the moment at the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.440
 moment she does exist very much. Sorry that sounded so play school Andy that I think Sarah's justified

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:52.800
 in The Lady Bird with a Hat. But what happened? So it's completely incredible at this point they

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.360
 now have a whole room of police officers who are just completely focused on catching her they also

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.160
 call her the woman without a face because also so far they have no witnesses. Why wait a minute how

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.560
 did she eat the cookie if she didn't have a face? This is why she's so mysterious. So

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.200
 so the woman makes no sense she's killing she's robbing she's snacking and there's no consistent

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.120
 MO and by 2007 she is now in another country she is in Austria robbing an optometrist and now

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.200
 because her crimes have gone into Austria they actually have different rules in terms of what

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.400
 they can do with DNA and so they find out that this woman is of very likely of Eastern European

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:42.400
 descent. So between 2003-2007 the phantoms DNA is found at over 20 burglaries or motorcycle thefts

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.360
 they've got a reward of 300 000 euros for her capture and over 16 000 hours of overtime have

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.400
 already been paid for the police force and I've also I looked at some of the press from the time

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.720
 so this is this is from 2007 now this was quite a big deal because they found her DNA on a syringe

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.480
 that was half full of heroin so perhaps she was also an addict did that was that why her

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.640
 perspire was so unpredictable such an old story isn't it you start on the cookies and then you

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.760
 just work your way up to the really hard stuff or maybe because you're so I don't know if heroin

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.240
 gives you the munchies but maybe that's why she was like I'm busy I'm busy robbing but also I would

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.880
 love a biscuit so this is from Time Magazine in 2009 the phantom was not only a brutal killer

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.280
 suspected of committing six homicides but also a common thief she had been involved in a car

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.080
 dealership robbery and a school break-in but in both cases others convicted of those crimes

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.760
 denied her existence no one had ever seen her no security camera had ever captured her image

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.600
 but when witnesses described her they sometimes said she looked like a man so this is what those

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:00.080
 so this is what those police are dealing with right so this criminal is this eastern European

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.880
 woman who looks like a man is so incredible at her job and that and everyone is so scared of her

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.840
 that even people who they definitely know were in the same place as her doing the same crimes

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.400
 they're like no no no there was no woman what woman are you talking about um it's crazy it's

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.240
 like Kaiser Soce it's like this mythical stupor boss that everyone probably thinks they're working

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.320
 under exactly that like so who is this woman it's starting to sound to me like she doesn't exist

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.120
 where was the clue was it in the original fact where Sarah said she didn't exist

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:44.320
 so the story ends in 2009 they found the burned body of a male asylum seeker they took his DNA

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.000
 in an attempt to identify him and their results had a hit on the database it was the phantom

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.080
 of Hel Brune they found him but the DNA is definitely female so they've got this man

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:04.400
 who's been killed but then the DNA is coming up as this definitely definitely female DNA

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:11.760
 so obviously I've written what the fuck was going on was probably what the police said in that

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:19.040
 task force like what the hell is this and that's when they realised that this must be a

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.760
 contamination all of the places that had had shown up the the phantom of Hel Brune's DNA

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.200
 the cotton swabs that are used to take DNA traces they um they all came from exactly the same factory

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.440
 in Bavaria where they employed Eastern European women and the reason that this had been allowed

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.480
 to happen was that those swabs were supposed to be for medical use not for forensic police use

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.120
 so there was never an instruction to them that they couldn't like lick the swabs

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.840
 I mean they're not licking the medical swabs though are they

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.520
 no I don't think so I think they're just maybe not having the same you know like air

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.960
 airtight completely safe things and so yeah it was just this incredible DNA mistake and

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.240
 there have been other DNA mistakes and do you think Sarah because it's like everyone trusts

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:14.240
 DNA so much don't they it's like this basically if DNA says it's right then it must be right and

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.720
 all of the other evidence pointing to it being wrong must be wrong do you know what I mean

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.880
 but people who are really scared of DNA it's for that exact reason like so we've had cases in the

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.360
 UK there's a case I think his name's Adam Scott which you guys might have read about but he was

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.360
 sent to prison for four and a half months for a crime in Manchester it was a really brutal

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.080
 crime on a woman and um and he said that he was in Plymouth or Portsmouth he was one of those

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:42.000
 places down south he said he said I was definitely there so he he had an absolutely watertight alibi

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.560
 which they didn't check because they had his DNA on the victim and then after four and a half

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.560
 months of being in prison and obviously he was he was actually in a paedophile and rapist's

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.720
 wing of a prison so he's also having like a terrible time um it then turned out that his

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.400
 crime actually what he'd done is he spat in the street and they'd taken his um saliva and they'd

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.760
 they'd in the lab they'd confused the samples one from a brutal crime one from one from spitting

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.440
 and he'd gone to prison for nearly five months now I'm not saying that that's an appropriate

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.280
 sentence to spend five months in a paedophile wing of a prison for spitting in the street

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.200
 but I it's not far off yeah I do hate spitting I do but but also I think a lot of premiership

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.520
 footballers are going to suddenly be in prison oh god can I just ask do we know who this Bavarian

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.720
 woman is and was she informed of all her crimes yeah she's the she's the phantom of hell broom

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.960
 did so did we did they track her down I actually couldn't get to the bottom of that I'm sure

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.680
 she really maybe wouldn't want to be identified yeah there must be data protection issues about

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.960
 that although although if I was a serial killer uh and I wanted to commit crimes across multiple

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.520
 jurisdictions across multiple years I would definitely get a job in a factory that packed

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.360
 cotton swabs and then I would just crack the cotton swabs to where they had been that's a lot

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:05.600
 of work and I'd commit my crimes there Andy that's just second novel right there there was a murder

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.200
 called the time travel murder it was in the 90s and what happened was they found the body

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.440
 and they took DNA from it and they matched it with someone who had died a few years ago and they

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.400
 were like how on earth could that happen you know how can you have someone who who died and then

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.040
 committed the murder and what it was is they've been using the same nail clippers to cut the

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.840
 fingernails to test right and from now on they always use disposable fingernail clippers whenever

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.600
 they're taking any fingernail stuff and they always put the clippers in with the clippings

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.640
 so whenever you take the DNA you always have the item which found the DNA in the first place

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.320
 I found a case like that as well so this is this is in America in California um so a man called

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.080
 Lucas Anderson was considered as the main suspect in the murder of a silicone valley millionaire

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.720
 but what happened was that paramedics had treated him earlier in the day so he hadn't died

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.040
 but they'd then accidentally transferred his DNA to the crime scene when they attended with the

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.320
 victim later on they must have thought that's such a coincidence as well god that's so weird that

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.640
 that bloke we were treating earlier today turns out to have been here murdering someone but I don't

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.720
 know if it's the same one but there was one that was like that where the guy was being treated because

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.520
 basically he was blind drunk and they took him into the hospital and obviously all this kind of

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.920
 contamination happened but then when they arrested him afterwards he was like well I was drunk I might

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:36.000
 have killed someone I guess it's pretty bad but you can like if um if you shake hands with someone

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.400
 for two minutes and then the person that you shook hands with is uh touches a knife then your DNA

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.120
 will be on that knife that's another great plot that's a great plot line and it's the handshake

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.720
 murderer um no no no it is two minutes he's when he's very friendly who can you convince to shake

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.920
 your hand for two minutes I bet Darren Brown could do it that's true I found a DNA related crime this

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.200
 year that was a good this is a good result for the police but it's not a human one it's the police

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.600
 in south wales there's just been this year a trial about a missing cow oh yeah um so this cow went

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.120
 missing very expensive cow cost three thousand pounds it was worth that and um the farmer who had

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.480
 owned it he suspected one of his neighbouring farmers so they've took blood samples and this

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.160
 by the way this all happened three years ago and it's come to trial now I imagine there was a very

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.400
 lengthy pre-trial procedure but they took blood samples they compared with them with samples from

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:39.440
 the complainant's farm from the victim's farm and it proved that the cows were related so it's a good

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.120
 result well that's a good news story yeah no one was murdered and the guy got his cow back

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.160
 you know what 2020 hasn't been that bad at all

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:59.600
 um have you guys heard of soulmate um you're gonna have to give us more context so I've

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.760
 been looking into lots of different ways that you can you can bust a criminal and obviously it's

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.040
 from DNA through to looking at prints there's so many different ways and soulmate is a really

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.040
 interesting thing that's been set up which is they also track the footprints of criminals as

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.240
 they're leaving and arriving and often you can see the print of the soul of a shoe but you don't

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.400
 necessarily know immediately what that shoe is a soulmate is a database that has over 31 000 individual

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.360
 footwear records that quickly helps you to identify so on the spot you can put in the shape you can

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.760
 put in the logo you can put in the crime scene print basically and it matches it to an existing

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.920
 type of footwear it's remarkable how they can track down if it's a new shoe they can find out who

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.400
 bought the shoes in the area and so on yeah andy another one for your novel maybe is like someone

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.960
 takes some converse and cuts the soul off and then puts them on the bottom of some duck martins or

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:56.400
 something oh that's really good different size um some more ideas for your novel andy while we're

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.880
 still brainstorming so um if you get a bone marrow transplant from someone then your DNA will be the

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.320
 same as the person who gave you the transplant so that's quite a good one that's wow that's amazing

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:15.440
 and also you know um they kind of one use of DNA is to find species in the wild right you might take

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.000
 a bit of soil and then sequence the DNA and you can tell what animals have been there and stuff

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.600
 like that well the best way of doing that is not by collecting samples but by collecting stuff

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.440
 from spider's webs because whenever an animal hits a spider's web they leave some DNA in that web

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.920
 and so you can take the webs and you can work out what animals live in a forest for instance

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.560
 so maybe your murderer kind of is running through a forest gets caught in a massive spider's web

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.960
 and they use that as a as a thing I love that okay so how about this while you're shaking hands with

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.760
 someone for two minutes right you're the killer um you use that they're distracted by the handshake

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:57.040
 and you use that time to inject them with some of your bone marrow right so then they've got your

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.240
 DNA inside them but you've got their DNA on your hand and then you can go and commit the crime it's

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.840
 like face off uh but slightly wow but hang on if you if you're able to transfer the bone marrow

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.480
 as the murderer isn't that all you need to do transfer the bone marrow and then drop them off

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.120
 outside a police station and they would be busted as you for all the crimes but Andy's just going

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.280
 for a second level I think I haven't committed the crime yet Dan because I need their DNA on my

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.920
 hand before I hold them in yeah I think the third level in what you're forgetting is actually

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.160
 it should be a spider because they've got eight hands they can they can shake hands with eight

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.800
 people at the same time they can get eight lots of DNA while catching people in their webs and

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.200
 stealing their DNA and also no one will suspect them because they're a spider and then imagine

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:49.120
 how small their fake converse will be oh well guys thank you you've put so much thought into

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:58.480
 what is going to be easily the worst novel published okay it's time for fact number two

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:05.760
 and that is Andy my fact is that to run a Boeing 747 you need a binder full of floppy disks

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:12.800
 okay is that like the key is that the key to turn it on a floppy it's not the key to turn it on no

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:20.560
 wouldn't that be nice but this is a fact that's been revealed recently or I mean I think a lot

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.720
 of people who work in 747s will have known it already but Boeing 747s and in fact a lot of planes

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:34.160
 Boeing 747 737s they were products of the late 80s and at that time the most effective way to store

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:41.280
 information was with the floppy disk and there was a recently a cyber security firm did a walkthrough

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:48.000
 for of a decommission 747 and someone spotted a drive in there and said oh that's a that's a

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.160
 floppy disk drive that's very old-fashioned now this isn't every 747 some of them will have

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.600
 been updated by now but it is still quite a few of them wow didn't we have a very similar

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:07.200
 discovery a few years ago about trident yes yeah yes the nukes were all uh well certainly

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.520
 american nukes were all on floppy disks I think until like only last year or something right

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.280
 the american ones yeah it's amazing it's it's terrible it's kind of terrifying and it's kind

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.920
 of terrifying because I guess you know as long as you have the equipment to read these things

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.320
 does it even matter what there are no exactly I like the idea of the old-fashioned technology

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.920
 because I like I always really liked clippy the microsoft paperclip and I really like the idea

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.040
 that he might be just like popping up on things I was like hello it looks like you're trying to

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:44.320
 launch a nuclear missile and so Andy what do they use these I read I think that they have like the

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:50.080
 details of where the airports are and the flight paths and things like that right yeah exactly and

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:56.800
 there is a problem though because these disks they they can store I think a standard like three

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.840
 and a half inch floppy disk can store about 1.4 megabytes on it give or take um but the database

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.400
 is that they are loading onto the planes are getting a bit bigger and sometimes you have to

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.520
 load up to eight disks in sequence and get all the information off them and onto the plane wow

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.920
 but there might be a bad disk and you might have loaded seven floppy disks with the stuff on

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.160
 and then you find one of the disks is flawed or corrupted in some way and then you need to start

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.480
 all over again it'd be a bit disconcerting if you got through seven of the floppy disks and

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.200
 you had to start again if I was a passenger and I heard an announcement saying from the captain

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.320
 apologies this flight is going to be taking off late the floppy disks are not respond does anyone

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.400
 have floppy disk number eight for the London two Barcelona route just on the off track do you know

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.680
 that Tim Berners-Lee used to go door to door with the internet on a floppy disk no yeah

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.480
 in order in order to because the big problem obviously when you were telling people about

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.800
 how the internet would work is that you would need to show them but the reason he invented the

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.640
 worldwide web is because computers weren't talking to each other if he'd sent them something

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.560
 their computer was running on different systems it wouldn't necessarily translate it so he had on

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.200
 a floppy disk in his computer which he would carry around with him he would go to different places

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.520
 and show them the first website the original CERN website that he'd created and it lived on a floppy

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.920
 disk and there's a project that's going on at the moment where there's a guy who works at CERN

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:24.000
 he works a couple of offices down from where Berners-Lee worked and he's trying to preserve the

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.760
 earliest bit of the internet where we have the first websites and so on and the very first website

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.160
 is missing which is the one that Tim Berners-Lee created wow that's very cool and what we don't

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.240
 know where the earliest one is we don't know if they're convinced it's out there somewhere they

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.600
 think that there's a disk out there and it was lost at some sort of conference in California

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.800
 one night uh someone disappeared with this and so it should be out there still there's a hunt

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.280
 going on they've asked the globe that's a job for the work experience kid isn't it can you just go

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.080
 through these five billion disks one of them should have the first website on it if there are any

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.560
 pilots listening can you just have a little look around the cockpit if there is there is a spare

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:08.400
 disk just check what's on there I would think that the work experience kid wouldn't even know

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:14.400
 what a floppy disk was did you see this survey in 2018 that asked children under the age of 18

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:21.200
 what each of these things are so they showed them like a floppy disk and a teletext or a postcard

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.680
 or whatever and 67% of children didn't know what a floppy disk was yeah I think that's fair I think

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.280
 that's fair I think it would be higher for things like the mini disk which um we have an extensive

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.800
 mini disk collection at the family home and yeah well you know my parents got really into

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.800
 storing things on on mini disks which didn't take off spoiler sorry it's weird isn't it that

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.560
 basically everything that we use now is just going to become obsolete and it doesn't even matter

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.600
 what kind of things we're saving or whatever it's all in a hundred years time no one will be able

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.240
 to read any of it it's not like a book where you can everyone will always be able to read the book

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.400
 well maybe not always but for a long time they will be able to it's like they've come up with a

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:11.280
 new way of storing data on like a little quartz thing and it'll last for 13.8 billion years it

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.720
 lasts forever but of course the problem is that in about 20 years no one even know how to access it

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.840
 it's going to look like a bit of rock yeah I find that really interesting it'd be really cool though

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:28.720
 if like the next rosetta stone is literally a little stone oh wow yeah it could be like the

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:35.040
 next rosetta stone they get a usb stick and a mini disk and a floppy disk and they're like how do

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.480
 we get the data out of this one it's a bit like getting the data out of that one and stuff um

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.800
 James just on what you're saying there the bbc in 1986 they made a what they call it digital

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.640
 doomsday book okay so I'm not sure if it was a copy of the real doomsday book or if it was

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.720
 an example of what civilization was like in 1986 but they made it on an acorn computer

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:05.760
 and they used a video disc player so for the storage device anyway 13 years later by 1999 it was

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.800
 completely unreadable and a team of researchers had to spend three years developing the software

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:16.480
 to access something from 1986 oh my god so yeah it's a problem it's cool though there is a lot of

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.480
 floppy disk archaeology going on which is quite fun so um for example andy warhol a lot of art of

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.520
 andy warhols is saved onto floppy disks that we don't have and I think it originates with there

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.200
 was a party that yoko ono threw for shawn lennon when he was young just after john lennon had died

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.640
 and at the party was andy warhol and one of the guests was steve jobs and steve jobs brought

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.720
 him the original apple mac computer as a present and he was showing shawn lennon the paint function

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.280
 on it where he was drawing and andy warhol spotted that and went over and started doing his own

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.760
 drawings on it and he was fascinated by it and that led to a whole thing of andy warhol doing

00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:01.120
 original art purely on his his apple on paint or on another computer sorry wow unpack was on paint

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.760
 wow that yeah and they say he saved them to floppy disks we never published them and so people

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.720
 have been finding lost andy warhol art on all these floppy disks that are kept in his archives

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.920
 are going through all the floppies god he might have the original internet yeah he might do i've

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:22.160
 got just one more thing on floppy disks which is about prince um oh so cool yes the artist prince

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.920
 the musician prince prince we all know who i'm talking about when i say prince um so you may remember

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.520
 in 1993 he changed his name to a symbol which he called the love symbol and it was a combination of

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.560
 the you know the male and female symbols symbols with the arrow and the cross and things um and it

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.640
 had entered his consciousness during meditation and so obviously he wanted to get it out there

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.920
 but the thing is nobody knew how to print it and so his management warner brothers they did

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.320
 put it up online as well but they also sent out floppy disks of the symbol to various magazines

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:59.200
 saying this is what you have to call prince now this is his name um and so yeah that was how they

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.160
 distributed the new name of prince that's really cool yeah i think he did it also because he was

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:09.360
 very annoyed with his management um yes because he had a lot a lot of beef with them he had 500

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.040
 songs that he wanted to release and warner brothers said that might flood the market for prince songs

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.320
 just a little bit could you not do that and so he was furious about that and as a result he changed

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.040
 his name to that um i got one tiny thing which is referencing back to our first fact which is

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:31.600
 that um there was an american serial killer who was um they were on the hunt for him and they were

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:38.320
 reaching out to this guy to communicate with him and the guy asked out in various channels whether

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:44.800
 or not he could communicate with them not in person but via floppy disk and they said yes to that

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.840
 and they did that by putting it in a newspaper by saying rex it will be okay as a message to him

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.800
 but they said he couldn't be tracked wasn't that the thing as in yeah yeah it'll be completely

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.600
 anonymous if you send us a floppy disk exactly he was asking will this be okay will i be will

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.440
 it be anonymous and they said yes anyway they he sent in the floppy disk they were able to trace

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.760
 it back to his church and then um they called him this is extraordinary and he was furious how did

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.680
 they catch him because they used they found out that he'd used the floppy disk on a particular

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.080
 library computer yeah something like this and they said who's who's a member of the library and it

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.160
 turns out he was i think ahead of a church yeah yeah they like so basically they lied to him he

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.920
 said that they won't you can't trace computer like geographic information via floppy disk and they

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.280
 said no you can't but they they can yeah and he was really annoyed with them for febbing about that

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:41.840
 when he murdered multiple people yeah lying is also against the law andy yeah is it yeah you don't

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:49.520
 expect the police to be also criminals it's like you can't trust anyone anymore why they're called

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.320
 floppy disks when they're not floppy i'm so glad you asked james they should actually they should

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.520
 be called stiffies in south africa they're called stiffies aren't they yes are they it's because

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.000
 the very original ones but i think also if you're on an aeroplane and you hear the captain saying

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:12.160
 there's anyone seen my stiffie then that's going to be even more worried isn't it okay it's time

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:19.120
 for fact number three and that is james okay my fact this week is that in the 1920 us election

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.960
 which was the first after women got the vote in america only one woman in the whole of georgia

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:32.400
 managed to cast a vote um so this is the 19th amendment uh it was ratified in august 1920

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.080
 and it granted women the vote but the election took place on the 2nd of november so it's only

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.280
 a few months later and most of the states kind of facilitated the new voters like they came up

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.920
 with ways to make sure that people could register in time but mississippi and georgia especially

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.960
 were so against the idea they were so massively against the idea of women voting that they tried

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.000
 to make it as difficult as possible for women to vote and in georgia they said you had to be

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.320
 you had to have registered six months before the election in order to cast a vote and obviously

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.320
 six months before the election they hadn't ratified the law yet but luckily there was one lady called

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:18.320
 mary jara white who somehow on april the first signed her name on her poll tax and also registered

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.800
 to vote at that time no one's quite sure how she managed to do it the time traveling vote

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.600
 it's so strange because it seems like she shouldn't have been allowed to do it but

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.680
 whoever was organising it um allowed her and she was allowed to vote in november and she did

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.640
 but she voted for the losing candidate but she still managed to vote i like i like the idea that

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.920
 they were like um or what harm can she do she's silly idea or let us sign she'll never be able to

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:54.000
 actually use our vote yeah also april first not the best day to sort of have what looks like a prank

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.760
 a woman finally voting yeah to know if you'd believe it oh do you think that's what she

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.960
 was doing in april fools and her husband she came home like guess what i've got the vote

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:11.840
 and then at midday she's like ah got you um yeah but georgia um at the time uh 58 percent of the

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.960
 population of georgia were baptists and um the baptist religion uh certainly then is still now

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.280
 but certainly then it was very much against women being allowed to do anything they were

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.680
 subservient to the men the men organised the family uh and the women just if they had any

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.600
 influence they were supposed to influence their husbands and then their husbands would influence

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.040
 society um georgia's constitution said that females are not entitled to the privilege

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:43.040
 of the elective franchise nor can they hold any civil office or perform any civil functions

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.160
 and there was only one position in office that they were allowed to hold and it was state librarian

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.800
 if librarian was the only job that i was allowed and i was to be subservient what i would do is cut

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:02.400
 the last page out of every single novel in the library and then i would like fuck you men oh my

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.320
 god imagine getting through all the way through and the second novel and not finding out that it

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.760
 was a spider after all all the reveals are on the last page in this novel as well i'm really

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:19.440
 patting it right under the end um i was looking into sort of other examples of uh women voting

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.160
 early or sort of other earliest women to vote in various places um this was a really weird thing

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:32.000
 after the american revolution for three decades in new jersey women and men had exactly the same

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.800
 voting rights and women were allowed to vote not in national elections but in new jersey they could

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.040
 and um and they did vote so that the people have been looking through old electoral lists and they

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:49.520
 found lots of women's names in some places it's not 50 50 but it's up to about 15 percent of voters

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.720
 were women uh there and it was um it was racially equal to as whether you were black or white and

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:05.040
 then um it was restricted in 1807 to white men it was seen as some kind of oversight that had happened

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.400
 because there were all these charges of uh the people said there were petticoat electors

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.120
 which is women who'd been manipulated you know they they couldn't possibly know make an informed

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.840
 decision about who they were voting for um so that was one supposed problem with the system

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.560
 and the other problem was apparently men putting on dresses to vote and then voting six or seven

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.800
 times for the same person i'm manipulating the vote that way which i would have thought would

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:36.080
 make you more conspicuous as a as a voter it's not clear to me how that helps yeah and how come

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:41.760
 they're not petticoat manipulators if they're dressed as women surely that's also yeah yeah andy

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:50.240
 again i i'm not saying that i approve of this lockdown that happened on i'm voting but i think

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.360
 that's amazing that that was such an early sort of aberration there yeah again not aberration in a

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.880
 bad sense as an aberration a positive aberration from the norm but actually before 1920 there are

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:07.600
 a few different states that allowed women to vote so uh wyoming had full women's suffrage from 1869

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.240
 but the reason they did that is because they wanted to attract single women to the state

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.320
 really yeah they had a lot of kind of migrant male workers who were working in wyoming and they

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.480
 thought well how can we get more women here well let's let them vote they should have done what

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:31.120
 nightclubs did in Essex on a friday which is make it free hooch free hooch for ladies in groups they

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:38.480
 don't have a man with them what what is what is hooch Sarah oh you're so young what hooch is

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:46.640
 no it's not young what it's poshness um so you remember alco pops uh yeah yeah yeah so so hooch

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:54.320
 was kind of one of the original mass marketed uh it was it was a lemon flavor drink uh so like uh uh

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.760
 i guess that and it was marketed towards women okay well i like hooch as well okay but i mean

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.440
 when i say marketed towards i absolutely don't mean that it was supposed to be in a feminine drink

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.520
 but it was like a if women don't like the taste of beer then you've got this now sweet drink you

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.240
 can drink out of a bottle at a nightclub actually i quite liked watermelon bacardi breezes as well

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.280
 so maybe i was just of course you did you've got a heart taste buds

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:28.720
 and the other state which had full women's suffrage um at the time was utah and the reason they did

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.960
 it is because they wanted to show the rest of the country that the women were not oppressed by the

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.240
 practice of polygamy and they're saying no no but look they can vote they can vote yeah i read about

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.800
 this and they also didn't they hope that women would vote for um the the non-church leaders so

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.200
 they would perhaps this this was a way of ending the practice of polygamy was to allow women to

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.280
 vote and then they would vote against it unfortunately they kept voting for it and then

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.920
 people said all right well let's take the vote away from women in utah after all so backfired

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.240
 but that was the thing wasn't it they they sort of worried that once women were given the vote

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.280
 that it was a sort of useless vote anyway because of the nature of the relationship between husbands

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.840
 being this dominant character in the relationship they would only vote for what the husband told

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.120
 them to vote for anyway so it was a sort of it was a canceled out vote in terms of if they'd go the

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.160
 other way which is really interesting because there's been recent polls that show that had it not been

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:29.040
 for the voting of women in recent elections in america between 1968 and 2004 republicans would

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.240
 have swept every single presidential race in that period uh when they broke it down and looked at it

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.280
 yeah so interesting but also that's why it's so important that voting is secret because then of

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.320
 course even if you did have somebody oppressive in your household you can always say oh yeah i voted

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.640
 for exactly who you told me to but you still have your autonomy and your freedom to cast the vote for

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.280
 you yes all of you believe if all of your wives are telling you to vote one way you've got to have

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:59.200
 the freedom to say yeah of course yeah i love the idea that the women in utah were like why would we

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:06.720
 get rid of polygamy i don't want a husband all to myself god just spread him out between i only

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:15.280
 have to see him once every eight days when the 19th amendment was passed um the president at the time

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:24.960
 was woodrow wilson but woodrow wilson had had a stroke um in october of 1919 and actually his

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:31.040
 wife was the de facto president of america around that time so the doctors came in kind of secretly

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.000
 and didn't really want anyone to know that he was really sick uh and they said he said well

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.280
 obviously woodrow wilson can't really do anything but what we're going to say is maybe edith wilson

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.800
 can kind of run everything on the sidelines and he can kind of just be there and not do any press

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:53.680
 and stuff like that so technically or not technically but de facto lee um the president of the united

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.760
 states when the 19th amendment was passed was edith wilson female i knew it was suspicious i knew it

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:07.040
 was suspicious well on the other hand um she was very much anti suffragettes i think possibly

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.160
 because she had to be uh and because you know obviously they were fighting against the president

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.680
 at the time but um she called the suffragettes the devils of the workhouse so yeah that's reverse

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:23.360
 psychology that's how you that's that's how you get yourself into a powerful position no no that's

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:30.800
 the last thing i want to say got it have you guys heard of um the suffragette cookbooks that were

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.120
 published in the usa no this is very weird so you don't associate um the suffragist movement with

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.240
 you know the home economics thing and and publishing cookbooks but this is exactly why

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:48.960
 they were published so the the kind of stock impression or uh that was given by opponents

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.640
 of the suffragette movement was that you know these women were neglecting their families

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.440
 they were letting their children go hungry they weren't looking after the home so the the movement

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.360
 got together and published lots of um cookbooks with kind of suffragette recipes and um they were

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.480
 quite they were quite good one of them was for emergency salad which is one part onion to

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:16.480
 nine parts apple with any dressing that's the salad so how bad is this emergency you're going to eat

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:25.440
 an onion um yeah and so these books had lots of stuff in one of the one of the women inside

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.360
 there was alice bunker stockham who was the uh only the fifth female doctor in the usa and she

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.560
 was openly pro masturbation for men and for women alike which was her that was her big thing was

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:50.240
 this is part of the recipe he did say any dressing i don't know if if one of my criticisms of the

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.520
 suffragettes was that these women aren't neglecting their domestic duties i don't think the apple

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.240
 onion salad would convince me otherwise that's a good point i think that would be my proof of

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:09.840
 life look at what these lazy bitches are calling it dinner it's an onion and an apple you're

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:17.040
 kidding me i want lasagna i didn't realize what an influence the british suffragettes had on the

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:23.840
 american ones um i've read a few articles about this and it's so for example emeline pankhurst

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:30.160
 did tours of america talking to huge groups of people about the the fight for women's rights

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:36.400
 and she played madison square garden which as you know we're all performers here like what a gig

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:42.320
 madison square garden yeah do you think that was already like i've broken america exactly she

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.680
 didn't fill it she had 3000 people there but i mean that's that's as big a gig as you know the three

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.520
 of us from fish have ever played that's you compare those sorts of things as a fish to the

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:58.560
 suffragette movement to the usa can i just say also dan we we played 3300 at the um hammer smith

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:06.160
 apollos so slightly more actually than the pankhurst yeah okay what is the capacity of madison

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:13.440
 square gardens it's it's over 30 000 i think oh okay so actually she did she did really badly

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.040
 she definitely tanked it maybe she said it's socially distanced

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:29.920
 yes spanish fluv yeah gotta be careful yeah sorry it's 19810 just to just to lessen the bombing

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.400
 of the sales for her um no but that is that is that that's the depressing thing when you get the

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:42.080
 email every sunday with your ticket sales and she's sending out loads of tweets like plenty of tickets

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:48.640
 left bring your friends two for one can't find out about british feminism there'll be a free emergency

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:59.280
 salad for everyone who buys a ticket okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.680
 my fact my fact this week is that there is a species of japanese water beetle that survives

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.960
 being swallowed by a frog by crawling through the frog's body and escaping out of its anus

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:16.880
 now wow this is amazing it's the first documented example of prey doing this through a predator

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.680
 escaping via the digestive system it has to literally crawl all the way through the digestive

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:27.920
 system and make its way out the back and it's um it's a thing that was discovered at kobi university

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:34.480
 where a frog was put into this enclosure see-through box and this water beetle was in there

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.240
 water beetle got swallowed and there was nothing for 115 minutes and then suddenly you see and

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:46.000
 there's videos online you can watch crawling out of the bumhole of this frog is this full

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.160
 water beetle that's covered a bit in feces you can't really see that but they tell you it is

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:55.280
 and it just wanders off and we've never seen this before so it's very exciting i'm a bit

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.920
 i'm a bit worried that you sold that so well that you could go online and watch a video of a beetle

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.920
 crawling out of a frog's anus covered in feces that probably no one's listening now they've

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.120
 probably all gone to watch it oh that's true okay well welcome back to the show you've seen it now

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:16.880
 amazing isn't it um so yeah so uh this is um this is a guy by the way who experiments a lot on

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.440
 the defense mechanisms the defense mechanisms that he says are sort of impossible defense

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.760
 mechanisms that you could not predict and he's found a number of things that are really interesting

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.400
 a bombardier beetle being swallowed by a frog will eventually be vomited back up because of an

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.760
 explosion of chemicals inside he's he's responsible for us documenting all that stuff and this is his

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.800
 latest discovery we should say this guy's name he's called Shinji Sugiyura and he's an ecologist

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.400
 at Kev University and he's got loads of form on this as you say Dan it's unbelievable

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.240
 and so he he he wanted to test properly because the frog doesn't have teeth when it eats the beetle

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.000
 so that's partly why the beetle survives um but i say it's a really big part of the reason oh yeah

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.360
 yeah they happen i because i feel like all the animals who can't escape from bum holes or from

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.880
 mouths like it is because they've been chewed up by the the the person or the animal eating that

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:14.320
 it's not because they haven't evolved to be clever enough no no you're right it's yeah it's a major

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.080
 part of the success strategy make sure you're eaten by someone which has no teeth um but he

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.960
 wanted to test how they do it and so he took some of the beetles that he was going to be testing on

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.840
 and he glued their legs together with sticky wax so basically he turned them into harry houdini

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.800
 beetles and then he let them be swallowed by the frog and those ones uh were immobilized as it were

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:43.920
 and those ones did not manage to make their way out so his hypothesis at the moment is that

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.000
 what they're what they're doing with when their legs are free and they're swallowed is that they're

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.600
 using their legs not only to propel themselves through but to hammer on the sphincter of the frog

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.360
 and and convince it to expel them i read it as tickle the cloacal opening rather than hammering

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.400
 right i may have sexed it up a little bit i'm sorry for you know sorry that andy sexed it's

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.600
 hammering over tickling is more sexy well it depends how it depends how you want to kind

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.720
 of anthropomorphise the beetle is it terrified it's going get me out of here or is it going oh

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:21.040
 this is fun i really don't like this hypothesis where he's like i wonder if things are harder if

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:28.640
 your hand comes oh yes it turns out it's actually more difficult to do things it's interesting

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.560
 though because the tickling at the end almost suggests that that's a bit of information that's

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.440
 passed on to all the beetles that once you get to the end the way to open the magic gate is there's

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:42.320
 a little tickly thing and you've got to tickle that that sounds to me more like that's you have to

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.560
 have inherent knowledge whereas the hammering can we use the technical words like anus rather than

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:53.280
 magic gate we tell you this every week dan what you just said sounded like what used to happen

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.160
 in like just seventeen and more magazine it's like if you want your guy to speed up there's a magic

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:05.520
 button up he's gone tickle the magic gate has very different overtones to hammer on the anus

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:14.240
 yeah it's a terrible children's book but yeah the hammering sounds more like the right hypothesis

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.720
 i would say it's sort of just uh i'm at the end i'm trying to keep going it's like when you know

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.560
 when you're running out of seconds at the crystal maze get me out you know it's that kind of moment

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:29.840
 but also presumably if you've been struggling all of the way down through the frog's body anyway

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.560
 like you would still be moving there it's just that because because human beings have two sphincters

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.440
 don't we we have kind of one that we have no conscious control over and one that we do have

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:45.680
 conscious control over and and so obviously if there's movement in a part of your body where

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:51.040
 it's kind of automatic you would just then feel the need to go to the toilet yeah it's a way yeah

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:57.440
 it's how you can have emergencies because the the non the part of the your sphincter you don't have

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.360
 conscious control over will be like right i'm ready to go and then the conscious part goes oh my god

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:07.760
 this is an emergency situation why did we why did we evolve to have a dumb sphincter and a smart

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.800
 sphincter i think maybe it's a safety thing as in it might there might be scenarios where it's more

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:18.800
 dangerous to draw attention to yourself yeah if you're trying to stay very quiet and avoid a predator

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.600
 and then yeah yeah which doesn't make sense because actually it's a fantastic weapon to

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:30.240
 have to hand yeah if you are in danger what just randomly pooing with no no because then you could

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.280
 just throw you could just throw it at the lion or whatever or the the or the bad monkey

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:42.720
 so just very quickly on the rest of this study so the really interesting thing is we

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:49.200
 we do know of other animals that pass through the digestive system of another animal right

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.200
 there are a few of those but what is really interesting about this is the fact that we

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.960
 we think that they're actually actively crawling through there and the reason that we know that

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.920
 is because like you say they he salitates his legs together or whatever glued the legs together

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:10.160
 but also that the bugs can get out with as little time as like six minutes whereas normally it would

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.960
 take a couple of days for a frog to digest its food but they can get out there in six minutes

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:20.080
 six minutes is the real that is the real crystal maze thing isn't it yeah imagine eating a meal

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.680
 completely unaware and then feeling terrible and realizing that your meal is still alive

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:32.320
 and it's yeah it's got a destination in mind there is a beetle called the coffee berry borough

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:41.440
 that lives exclusively on coffee beans but it can't eat caffeine so it only eats coffee but

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:46.560
 it doesn't like caffeine and the only way they can do it is they have a special bacteria inside them

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:52.320
 that kind of deals with the caffeine and if you take all the bacteria out of it out of this beetle

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.880
 by giving it antibiotics or whatever it'll die because it can't can't deal with the coffee

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.840
 so it only likes to eat science is so awful and if you and if you glue all their hands together

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.800
 no they can't even pick up anymore coffee beans what's an interesting science experiment

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:13.200
 yeah you're right i mean how are you going to learn things but at the same time

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.600
 for the individual coffee berry borough why can't we just all appreciate life's mysteries

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:26.160
 have you guys heard of the epomis beetle in fact i i i don't think we've mentioned this before

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:32.560
 again frogs pry on it uh the frog bites it but at the moment where the frog bites it this beetle

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:39.840
 lover sinks its teeth into the frog's tongue right and then it starts releasing enzymes

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:46.480
 which melt the frog's flesh and this oh my god this goes on for a few days unfortunately for the

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.120
 frog and the frog is just stuck there with what it thought was its lunch and it's slowly being eaten

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:58.080
 by its lunch it's basically it gets turned into a straw through which the beetle lover is drinking

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:02.640
 and eventually the frog is just a part of skin and bones it's dead and the the lava wanders off

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:09.280
 so the scientists who were testing this they observed 400 standoffs between these two the

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:15.920
 beetle always wins oh my god there was one case there was one case where a toad managed to grab

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.560
 the beetle and quickly swallow it and then it started looking a bit peaky two hours later it

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:26.640
 threw up and then the beetle ate the toad oh my god and andy can you let me know is there

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:34.240
 anywhere i can watch this on youtube uh yeah yeah it's funny pranks for toads there's there's another

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:41.760
 beetle the male diving beetle it has sperm which uh team up with each other so this is very rare

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:47.840
 obviously yeah normally sperm is a kind of um one of those games it's sort of one versus everybody

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.680
 you know zero sum game i'm yeah like british bulldog it's like british bulldog sorry sarah

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.360
 came up with a proper academic answer what i was trying to say was it's like british bulldog

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:06.320
 so but this is the really weird thing the male diving beetle their sperm effectively do a conga

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.600
 and they team up hundreds of them and and even thousands of them and they all go in a line or

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.720
 they sometimes go in a crocodile they'll go in pairs and it's because the female diving beetles

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:22.800
 reproductive tract is unbelievably complicated and um the female will often store sperm for

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:29.280
 for months or years to fertilize herself later and um the males kind of form a train trying to

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.640
 just get through to the area they need to be to fertilize the egg um because otherwise they will

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.320
 just be lost what's in it for the other sperms the sperms at the back of the conga i don't know

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:45.840
 i guess but it will probably improve all of their chances of getting there even if they're not the

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.240
 person at the front i suppose and you all have this very similar genetic material don't you so

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.320
 you're still passing it on that's a good point but what as as you say what is the point of being at

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.880
 the back of a conga what's the point of being in a conga well sometimes it splits off and you become

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:04.960
 the front that's very stressful i wonder if that happens with these sperms not at the back though

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.560
 you can't let go at the back that's just a person walking if you're still kicking your legs out to

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:16.240
 the side then it's still a conga even if it's just you i've never had that happen to me doing a

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:20.560
 conga but i would be terrified that it would i would cling on for dear life to avoid the

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:25.760
 responsibility of becoming the king but sometimes the conga sometimes like flips around in a way

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.400
 you're not expecting and no one has a good enough grip to hold on to the person oh my god or it

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.600
 goes it goes into a place you don't want to go like it's they start going they think it'd be

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.440
 funny to go into the toilet so it's like it's a wedding i don't want to go and look at people at

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:46.400
 the urinals and i think if they have like very complicated labyrinthine um uh vaginas that probably

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.880
 that is exactly what we're saying about there will be conga and splits off and things going around and

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:55.840
 also getting becoming becoming very tired the energy exerted means that some of them will get

00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:00.160
 tired at the front and i think it will be a collective yeah it'll still give you a good

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.320
 chance because that also happens in a conga sometimes you get like a wave of speed don't you

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.640
 like some of the people at the front go a bit too fast and then some of the slower people can't

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.960
 hold on and then they become the front of the conga that's very cool i feel like biology is

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:25.840
 actually so easy you just use a conga analogy okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.280
