00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,800
 Hey, Club Fish members.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,400
 Welcome to your bonus bit of content.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,000
 We have a compilation episode for you this week.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,480
 A lot of great stuff in here.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,840
 There's conveyor belt chat.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,720
 There's Eric the eel chat, Usain Bolt chat,

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,880
 country music star chat.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,760
 It's a good one.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,440
 We also have a few guest voices that you're

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,640
 going to hear along the way.

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,360
 There's Johnny Knoxville of Jackass,

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,960
 and there is Dan Snow of History Hit.

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,360
 So I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.

15
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,080
 Just want to quickly remind you, though,

16
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,400
 that we are still mid-tour.

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,840
 We're having an amazing time.

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,200
 We just got back from Gothenburg in Sweden on the weekend,

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,280
 did a couple of shows there.

20
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,000
 Well, we recorded one episode.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,400
 And then in the evening, Andy James and I

22
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,000
 did a really odd sort of sitting in a really noisy bar episode.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,480
 It's not going to go out.

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,120
 Maybe it will go out on Club Fish,

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,200
 where we just chatted about our favorite facts

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,360
 while about 600 people tried to order drinks at the bar.

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,400
 It was so fun, though.

28
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,840
 It was really fun, amazing time on tour.

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
 And the tour is continuing.

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,480
 We're going to be in Cardiff on the 16th of October.

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 We are going to be at London's Theatre Royal in Drury Lane

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,960
 on the 23rd and the 24th.

33
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,400
 And then we are going to wrap up the UK tour

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,960
 on the 27th of October at Manchester.

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,080
 But otherwise, let's get on with this show.

36
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,880
 So a compilation.

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
 And we begin the chat with Johnny Knoxville chatting

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
 about interesting and odd country music stars.

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,240
 Here we go.

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,960
 [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

42
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:41,960
 I think that one of the early outlaws

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,360
 was a guy called Ernest Tubb.

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,440
 Oh, Ernest Tubb was an amazing, amazing singer.

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,920
 I think he was maybe a bit early, like late '50s.

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,040
 Yeah.

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,880
 And he was known as the Texas Troubadour.

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,520
 But he was a massive liability.

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,360
 He was one of these always drunk,

50
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,040
 kicked the windows out of his limo

51
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,800
 once, which was really impressive.

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,000
 His own record label had to hire someone

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,120
 to go around with him to wrestle him to the ground

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,880
 when he got too rowdy.

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,000
 And he just walked into the National Life Building,

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,280
 which I think was maybe the home of country music in Nashville.

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
 It was where all the big stars were put on.

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
 Walked in there with a magnum in order

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,800
 to shoot a producer over some feud they had.

60
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,440
 This producer, Jim Denney.

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,200
 And I think he was so drunk that he couldn't really see straight.

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,760
 And he just mistook someone else for him and shot him instead.

63
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,800
 Oh, my God.

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,840
 And he was just a public drunkenness, as he would.

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,880
 [LAUGHTER]

66
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,240
 He was all geared to shoot somebody.

67
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,880
 You've got to shoot somebody when you're in that mood.

68
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,160
 So this is pre these guys.

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,240
 But I'm more old school country listener

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
 and love Hank Williams.

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,840
 And I've always loved about Hank Williams.

72
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,480
 The fact that when he got married,

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,880
 he had a matinee and an evening performance of it.

74
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,640
 And his wedding was--

75
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
 You mean he did a gig?

76
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,200
 Well, his wedding was a gig.

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,880
 He sold tickets to his wedding.

78
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,320
 He invited 28,000 people.

79
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,240
 James, you just made a noise as if you're annoyed with yourself

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
 that you didn't think of that.

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
 I'm so annoyed.

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,440
 My wedding was so expensive.

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
 Imagine why I could have squeezed out of them.

84
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,240
 28,000 people?

85
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,920
 Yeah, yeah.

86
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,040
 How many people were sitting on the bride side?

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,800
 Because I feel that would be really heavy, that gig.

88
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,400
 [LAUGHTER]

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,360
 And yeah, it was his second marriage, in fact.

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,640
 And it was in Louisiana.

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,000
 And yeah, they held two ceremonies.

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But he has the--

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,960
 I just did not know how he died.

94
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,920
 It's the weirdest story.

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,400
 Oh, yeah?

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,320
 Yeah.

97
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,760
 He, A, he died so young.

98
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
 And when I listen to Hank Williams,

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,560
 he sounds like he's got an old voice.

100
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,320
 He died when he was 30.

101
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,880
 And he died--

102
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,320
 He looked like he was 50.

103
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
 He did look older.

104
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,800
 I think lifestyle, maybe, had something to do with it.

105
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,440
 But yeah, he really did, didn't he?

106
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,120
 And he died on New Year's Day, I think,

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,080
 or maybe January the 2nd.

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
 But he'd been on his way to a gig.

109
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,240
 And I think the flight had been canceled.

110
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,800
 And he randomly asked a student called Charles Carr,

111
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,080
 fittingly, to drive his car to the gig.

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,560
 And basically, weirdly, the last place they were in, Johnny,

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,640
 was Knoxville, Tennessee.

114
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
 Yes.

115
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,960
 You proud of that?

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,280
 Well, my father used to brag, you know, Hank Williams died

117
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,960
 at the hotel right uptown.

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
 And in reality, he died between that hotel and the gig.

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
 But dad was very proud that Hank Williams died at that hotel.

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,800
 Why wouldn't you be?

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,280
 You know?

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,960
 Yeah.

123
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,600
 I don't know.

124
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,520
 It's a great claim to fame for you.

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
 But it's so dark, there's guys driving him to the gig

126
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,920
 and realize that Hank Williams had just

127
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,720
 been dead in the back of his car for a relatively long period

128
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,640
 of time and then had to go into a gas station

129
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,880
 and say, hey, this is going to sound so weird,

130
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,000
 but Hank Williams was sort of biggest star in the country.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,840
 He's in the back of my car and he's dead.

132
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,800
 Can you help me?

133
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,280
 What a mad way to go.

134
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,880
 Yeah.

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,280
 And what a mad anecdote for that guy, Charles Carr,

136
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,880
 a student Charles Carr, to have for the rest of his life.

137
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,640
 Yeah, it feels more weird for him than Hank.

138
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,920
 Yeah, I didn't have TikTok or anything to tell anyone.

139
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,600
 No, I think that might have breached TikTok's regulations.

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,040
 Speaking of deaths, I was looking

141
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,840
 at people who had been shot for bad reasons.

142
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
 Oh, yeah.

143
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,280
 If you go to Tombstone, there's a graveyard there,

144
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,520
 the Boothill Graveyard.

145
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
 And there's lots of people buried and they're all

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
 from the Wild West and they all have quite good stories.

147
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
 So there was a guy called Billy Kinsman.

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 Someone played a trick on him and put an advert in the paper

149
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,320
 saying that he was planning to marry someone called May Woodman.

150
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,440
 He then took out an advert saying it wasn't true.

151
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,800
 And May Woodman was so upset by it that she shot him.

152
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,280
 Oh, wow.

153
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,840
 That's on the headstone?

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,240
 No, no, people did research afterwards.

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,520
 It goes down three different tombstones.

156
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,560
 We need more headstones.

157
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
 Yeah.

158
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,720
 There was a guy called Tom Jay Waters,

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,040
 who was shot to death during a fight about a blue and black

160
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,680
 plaid shirt that he was wearing that day.

161
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,280
 Wait, was it one of those arguments about,

162
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,720
 oh, is this blue and black?

163
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,000
 Or is it red and silver?

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,920
 Those internet meme things.

165
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,040
 I'm afraid not.

166
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,280
 Apparently, people kept making jokes about his new shirt.

167
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,080
 And he said, I'll knock down any man who opens his mouth

168
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,600
 about my shirt again.

169
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,160
 And some of the blog walks in the bar,

170
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,120
 made a joke about his shirt.

171
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,560
 Walter's knocked him unconscious.

172
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,160
 And the next day, he shot him.

173
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,560
 Oh.

174
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,200
 Hang on, he shot the guy he knocked unconscious

175
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,240
 or the unconscious guy shot him?

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
 No, the unconscious guy.

177
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,800
 Basically, it just come in, made a perfectly normal joke,

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,880
 being punched in the face, decided, no, you're going to get it.

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,240
 We mentioned briefly Baron Coubertin,

180
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,440
 who was the sort of father of the modern Olympics.

181
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,600
 And he was French.

182
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,040
 And he wanted the Olympics to happen because of the Franco

183
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
 Prussian War, partly.

184
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,520
 Because that happened in 1870, didn't it?

185
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,480
 And he would have been seven years old at the time.

186
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,480
 And I think he was caught up in it as a seven-year-old.

187
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,040
 I'm not heavily involved, but he was--

188
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,440
 I think it was basically, it was quite an embarrassment

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,560
 for France, wasn't it, the Franco-Prussian War?

190
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,840
 And I think the whole--

191
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,440
 even seven-year-olds in the playground were going,

192
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,640
 oh, this is awful.

193
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,120
 It's awful.

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 You're absolutely right.

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
 It was embarrassing.

197
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,600
 We shouldn't even be mentioning it during the Olympics now,

198
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
 because it was a bad war for France.

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,240
 And in fact, Prussian soldiers were at his home.

200
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,320
 And they took away his croquet box.

201
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,680
 And they filled it with explosives.

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,600
 And they blew it up on a nearby railway.

203
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,400
 That is a dangerous thing to put.

204
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,600
 Did they put those grenades that look a little bit

205
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,720
 like croquet bowls?

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,600
 Yeah, and they took a huge mallet.

207
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,360
 And then they just walloped it, and it blew up the railway.

208
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
 But I think he was trying to restore French vitality,

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,760
 but also international unity.

210
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,800
 He wanted peace rather than national pride,

211
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,240
 which is ironic, considering the mega competition

212
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,840
 that it leads to.

213
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,440
 Yeah, he was.

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,160
 He basically, I think, from memory from the book,

215
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
 A Load of All Balls, a QI Book of Sport,

216
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,080
 in which this is mentioned.

217
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,960
 I think he--

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,640
 by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

219
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,000
 With a lot of ghosting from Dan Shriver and Andrew Hunter

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,120
 Murray, I think we should add.

221
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,160
 Ghosting, as in you just never reply to our emails.

222
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,600
 I've haunted the book.

223
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,120
 I'll put a curse on it.

224
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,320
 Just as this fact is about notable swimmers

225
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,960
 that had a bad time of it at the Olympics,

226
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,320
 I thought it'd be worth mentioning the very famous one

227
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,440
 from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric the Eel.

228
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,720
 Eric Mosambani, he famously was brought in on a wild card

229
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,360
 for developing nations, and he logged the slowest ever time

230
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,160
 for a 50-meter swim in Olympic history, one minute, 52

231
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,240
 seconds.

232
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,960
 I just find what was amazing about it

233
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,520
 is that he didn't give up after it,

234
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,040
 and his story sort of goes on.

235
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
 Because this is a guy who was swimming in lakes

236
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
 in order to train for the Olympics.

237
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,640
 The longest pool that he had was at a hotel

238
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,120
 that was 12 meters long, and he was only

239
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
 allowed to practice between 5 and 6 AM.

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,280
 When he actually rocked up for the Olympics

241
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,200
 and started doing the events, he was wearing sort of really

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
 weird swimming shorts.

243
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
 He didn't have speedos, and they had

244
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,880
 to be lent to him by a South African swimming coach.

245
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
 But after the Olympics, he became the swimming--

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,360
 he became the coach for the national swimming

247
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,080
 squad of Equatorial Guinea.

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,960
 And he also kept swimming himself

249
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,960
 and got himself to a personal best time of 52.18 seconds,

250
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,480
 which means he would have won gold medal at the 1956 Olympics.

251
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,320
 Yeah, he was only five seconds behind the gold medalist

252
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
 of the 2000 Olympics.

253
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,280
 That's how much training he continued to do.

254
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,840
 So he is now a legit brilliant swimmer.

255
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,120
 We shouldn't forget also Paula the Crawler,

256
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,680
 who was the female Equatorial Guinea swimmer at that Olympics.

257
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,640
 So basically, Eric the Eel became really, really famous.

258
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,120
 And then all the journalists were like, oh, wait a minute.

259
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,640
 There's another swimmer from Equatorial Guinea as well.

260
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,720
 And they went over and she did loads and loads of interviews.

261
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,360
 She was the supermarket cashier.

262
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
 And she became a celebrity even before the race started.

263
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
 She was really, really famous.

264
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,680
 And she came last, but she didn't come last by nearly

265
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,960
 as much as Eric did.

266
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,720
 Oh, yeah, she--

267
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
 Eric the Eel.

268
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,600
 Yeah, Eric the Eel was like, he almost drowned.

269
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,880
 That's the thing.

270
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,400
 I think you've got to shoot the moon.

271
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,920
 If you're going to come last, then you

272
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,040
 have to come really, really, really last to get super famous.

273
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,680
 What's amazing as well is, I didn't know this,

274
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,400
 but as a rule within swimming, if you touch the side lanes,

275
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,360
 if you touch those boys that are attached,

276
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,840
 you're disqualified from the match.

277
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,520
 And if you watch the final leg of Eric the Eel,

278
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 he is literally sitting right next to it.

279
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,040
 And his arms getting so close.

280
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
 And that could have just been a disaster.

281
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
 It could have been disqualified from the match,

282
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,440
 but he did it.

283
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 It's amazing guy.

284
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
 I don't know if it would have been more of a disaster

285
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,280
 if he was disqualified.

286
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,560
 To be fair, I don't think he was like, thank God I avoided that.

287
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,240
 I think I probably wished he had been.

288
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,720
 That's true.

289
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
 Do you remember that thing of--

290
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
 it was a headline from a couple of years ago,

291
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,480
 and occasionally just around the line.

292
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,920
 It's an outraged headline about the Navy buying a five inch

293
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,640
 gun and spending like $100 million,

294
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,320
 couldn't it?

295
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,960
 And the journalist who wrote the article

296
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,560
 assumes that the gun is five inches long rather than the width

297
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,040
 of the barrel being five inches.

298
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
 And it could fire quite good shells.

299
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,200
 It's fantastic.

300
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,520
 The conveyor belt, just one side of it,

301
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,920
 is the bit that you walk on, or the bit

302
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,960
 that your luggage goes on, or something like that.

303
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,280
 But they did invent a Mobius Strip conveyor belt a few years

304
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,840
 ago.

305
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
 And actually, that became quite popular,

306
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,360
 because what it meant was you get twice as much wear out

307
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,560
 of it, because--

308
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,440
 In my head, it's just making all your suitcases

309
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,400
 fall off it half way through.

310
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,200
 But OK, explain.

311
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
 The twist in the Mobius Strip, which

312
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,680
 means that as you follow the surface,

313
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,120
 you actually go all the way on the top of it,

314
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,760
 and then go all the way on the bottom of it

315
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
 before you get back to the same point again.

316
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,240
 But the twist was out of range of the--

317
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
 it was underneath the conveyor belt, if you know what I mean.

318
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,160
 Lovely.

319
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,400
 It's after the discharge point.

320
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,920
 After the discharge point, yeah, exactly.

321
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,080
 But yeah, these are really, really--

322
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,680
 well, they weren't really popular, but they did exist.

323
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,560
 Every home had one for a spell in the early noughties.

324
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,120
 Do you not remember the Mobius Strip conveyor belt day

325
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,600
 that we had?

326
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
 Your parents would.

327
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
 Right.

328
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,520
 Have you guys, by the way, ever used--

329
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,080
 and I've never seen this in a Pizza Hut--

330
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,040
 the subconscious menu.

331
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,960
 This is in--

332
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,160
 This is in 2014.

333
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
 And it sounds like it was going to be rolled out,

334
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,880
 but I certainly have never seen it.

335
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,160
 It's a Darren Brown thing.

336
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,560
 I've never been to a Pizza Hut.

337
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
 Have you never?

338
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,800
 No.

339
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,560
 From just memes and stuff, do they have a salad place?

340
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,080
 Yeah.

341
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,560
 Yeah.

342
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,840
 And all you can eat pizza and stuff like that.

343
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,320
 Yeah.

344
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
 You've got two options, ordering, or you do the buffet,

345
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,160
 and you go up, and yeah, it's the sort of all you can eat.

346
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,040
 We can't-- this podcast can't turn to a Pizza Hut explainer

347
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
 for the uninitiated.

348
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
 No, but it's like--

349
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,840
 their game is we bet we can fill you up with dough

350
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,480
 before you make money off us on the toppings.

351
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
 That's effectively the battle you're in, the battle of wits

352
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,880
 you're in, but the Pizza Hut had quarters.

353
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,960
 No, it was ever beaten then.

354
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,680
 Well, supposedly, they launched this thing,

355
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,800
 the subconscious menu.

356
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 And the idea is that it was done in conjunction

357
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,840
 with this thing called Tobii Technology,

358
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,400
 and they developed eye recognition software

359
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,480
 so that if you were confused about what toppings you wanted

360
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,600
 on a pizza, you stared at a screen,

361
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,640
 and within 2.5 seconds, it can analyze what your eyes were

362
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,800
 going, ooh, or no.

363
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,880
 And it uses your eye language, whatever

364
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,800
 that was conveying, to then say, oh, you want a pizza

365
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,080
 with all these random things on it,

366
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,040
 and you say, yes, that's right.

367
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,800
 And that's the way you can order there, the sweet dishes.

368
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
 What if all your eyes are saying is,

369
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,560
 I don't eat at places with pictures on the menu?

370
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,160
 They send you across the food straight to brands.

371
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,640
 Dan, are you surprised they didn't roll out

372
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,000
 an incredibly expensive-sounding high-tech system

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,680
 for a very low-margin business model?

374
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,160
 I am, because they said that the response was very

375
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,200
 incredibly positive.

376
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,680
 98% of people were happy with the recommended toppings.

377
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
 It sounds like a girl.

378
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,280
 Really?

379
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,080
 Yeah.

380
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,120
 And how did it react if people's eyes were rolling back

381
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,000
 into their heads and seeing this ridiculous technology?

382
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
 Yeah, I don't know.

383
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,800
 One last silly news story from this month from the BBC.

384
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,760
 OK, I'm just going to read you the first sentence of it.

385
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,680
 "Justice was served extra hot when police

386
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,920
 seized a food delivery bike, then delivered the pizza.

387
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,400
 And it's from North Wales.

388
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,120
 And as he's police, they spotted an uninsured driver.

389
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,280
 They seized his motorbike.

390
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,200
 He was on his way to deliver a pizza at the time.

391
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,120
 They then delivered the pizza to the address, right?

392
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,560
 And it was just-- they were so excited whoever was writing

393
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
 this article to get some jokes in.

394
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
 So after finding out the driver's insurance had run out

395
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,040
 two months ago, police were keen to dish out

396
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,360
 law and brackets of pizza.

397
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,160
 Close brackets.

398
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,520
 Order."

399
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,440
 Oh, yeah, OK.

400
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,600
 They went from being officers of the peace

401
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,840
 to officers of the pizza.

402
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
 I don't know if someone is keen to use jokes.

403
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,480
 I'm not sure he's fully nailed them.

404
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,320
 Andy, was it just those two?

405
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,640
 There are a couple more, but I don't think I heard that.

406
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,840
 Although that's a strong thing to bring up in the show

407
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,200
 for those two jokes.

408
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,920
 What?

409
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,000
 It was a good haul.

410
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,760
 Do you mean weak?

411
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,560
 Do you mean it's a weak thing to bring up in the show?

412
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,120
 Absolutely not.

413
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,320
 It's your words, not mine.

414
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,760
 But you know what they can do for these conveyor belts?

415
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,920
 They can't adjust the temperatures,

416
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,000
 but they can adjust the cheese.

417
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,640
 And that has been done.

418
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,040
 So let's say you go into a hotter oven

419
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,320
 and the cheese that you've bought

420
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,360
 is going and being cooked through it.

421
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,400
 That might burn because the cheese is now

422
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,360
 being exposed to a higher heat at a quicker rate or whatever.

423
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,920
 But there's a man who's called James Leprino,

424
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,360
 AKA the Willy Wonka of cheese,

425
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,480
 who supplies 85% of all the cheese

426
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,480
 that are used for major pizza companies

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,000
 like Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's.

428
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
 He is the cheese man.

429
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
 In the world?

430
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,080
 In the world.

431
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,440
 85%.

432
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,960
 How big is this herd of cows?

433
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,640
 This is impossible.

434
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,560
 That's incredible.

435
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,320
 They make, he's worth three billion.

436
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,920
 They make that roughly annually.

437
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,680
 It is a giant operation.

438
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,640
 They deal in mozzarella, mainly.

439
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,040
 And what they do is they adapt the cheese

440
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,720
 for the circumstances of the cooking

441
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,760
 of these major companies.

442
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,600
 So with the Pizza Hut conveyor belt,

443
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,000
 the cheese was burning.

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,920
 So yeah, Willy Wonka of cheese jumped back into the factory

445
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,200
 and he made it so--

446
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
 Don't call it the Willy Wonka.

447
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,040
 Yeah, it's horrible.

448
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,400
 Dad, Dad, I know we won a golden ticket,

449
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,480
 but I don't want to go to the cheese factory.

450
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,840
 I can't believe, so the solution to the burning the pizza

451
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,360
 wasn't figure out a way to make your ovens cold.

452
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,640
 They're like all other ovens.

453
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,200
 It was OK.

454
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,840
 Let's change the cheese.

455
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,160
 I'll change cheese.

456
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,280
 Well, yeah, because he's got nothing to do with the ovens.

457
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,240
 He's just the cheese supplier and he wants to remain it.

458
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,280
 So he has to adapt.

459
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,520
 With Domino's, when they started delivering it to your house,

460
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,680
 he had to adapt it so that the cheese didn't go stale

461
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,880
 and weird in the process.

462
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
 And they made it a longer lasting cheese

463
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,600
 that looked fresh and hot by the time it got to you.

464
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,760
 So he is, yeah, the Willy Wonka of cheese.

465
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,680
 Clever Willy.

466
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,080
 Something about Eleanor of Aquitaine

467
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
 that is not often said.

468
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,240
 So Queen of France, Queen of England.

469
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,280
 Not many people have done the double.

470
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,120
 Not many people.

471
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,000
 I think the only one.

472
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
 Mary Queen of Scots claimed it.

473
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,760
 I'll controversial, you know, could have claimed it.

474
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,120
 Her followers might have claimed it.

475
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,360
 But one extra one I'd like to throw into the mix.

476
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,800
 Queen of the Christmas movie.

477
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,320
 Have you heard of the movie called The Lion in Winter?

478
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,240
 Oh, yeah, it's huge.

479
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,640
 Huge movie, right?

480
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,800
 It's 1183 AD.

481
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,960
 King Henry II's three sons all want to inherit the throne,

482
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,240
 but he won't commit to a choice.

483
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,080
 When he allows his imprisoned wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine,

484
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
 out for a Christmas visit,

485
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,160
 they all variously plot to force him into a decision.

486
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,920
 And this movie, which was starring Catherine Hepburn.

487
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,160
 Yeah, it was an all-star cast.

488
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,840
 Yeah, Peter O'Toole.

489
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,280
 And this is a movie that Aaron Sorkin says

490
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,720
 is his favorite film of all time.

491
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,680
 Sylvester Stallone says the same thing.

492
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,160
 It's a movie that is massively--

493
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,440
 I just don't know how much I trust Sylvester Stallone.

494
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,600
 He made some great films, though, but I do.

495
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,680
 But it's quite different vibe to the Rocky movie, isn't it?

496
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,800
 They're the two best movie critics in history.

497
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
 We're talking here.

498
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,640
 Well, Sorkin, I mean, he would--

499
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,960
 he integrated dialogue from it into the West Wing.

500
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,640
 Like, that's how much it means to him.

501
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,880
 Yeah.

502
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,840
 But Eleanor of Aquitaine was basically--

503
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,600
 she was imprisoned by Henry II for decades, right,

504
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,720
 while he was in rule.

505
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,360
 But he would often let her out during Christmas periods

506
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,320
 and little moments where she could--

507
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,280
 so that was her period where the people saw her again.

508
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,560
 He put her on top of the tree, didn't he?

509
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,280
 Yeah, well, she was suddenly allowed back into public

510
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,040
 for those moments.

511
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,840
 And as a result, this is one of the most influential movies

512
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,320
 that we've had in recent years.

513
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
 Sorry, Kim, I've lost a little bit.

514
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
 Yeah.

515
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,120
 So he let Eleanor out on Christmas.

516
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,760
 Yeah.

517
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,880
 And there is a movie.

518
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,600
 Where do the two things collide?

519
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,080
 Well, this is a Christmas movie in the way

520
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,240
 that Die Hard's a Christmas movie, you know.

521
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,800
 But I don't think they only made that movie

522
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
 because they let Eleanor out on Christmas.

523
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,520
 Oh, is the movie set in Christmas when they let her out?

524
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,400
 Yeah, yeah.

525
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,600
 Oh, it's set.

526
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,000
 I just read you the blurb, yeah.

527
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,120
 Yeah, sorry, it was out of context a little bit.

528
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,520
 It was just-- you just read it.

529
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,000
 So in the movie, she's one of the characters in the movie.

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,960
 Yeah, yeah, she's basically a Christmas movie

531
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,200
 without being, obviously, a Christmas movie.

532
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,320
 But a lot of her big moments happen during Christmas periods

533
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,960
 because that's when she was let out

534
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,840
 and involved with her son's lives.

535
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,760
 And I think that this is someone who, arguably,

536
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,240
 is a Queen of Christmas.

537
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
 Wow.

538
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
 I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

539
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,440
 Father Christmas, King of Christmas,

540
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,640
 Eleanor Backham, Queen of Christmas.

541
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,040
 I was reading just while we're on the subject of, like,

542
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,760
 exiles as part of the topic.

543
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,680
 There used to be a thing, which probably still goes on,

544
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,320
 but it was much more of a term that was used,

545
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,720
 called the remittance man.

546
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,680
 And have you heard the remittance man?

547
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,120
 It's basically the idea, you have a member of your family

548
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,840
 who is so embarrassing that you just say, listen,

549
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,160
 can you move to Canada and then we'll just pay you monthly

550
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,840
 to just not come back?

551
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
 This is your night.

552
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,440
 I see why this wakes you up at night.

553
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
 That's very realistic.

554
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,160
 How are your family in Australia, Doug?

555
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,360
 [LAUGHTER]

556
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,800
 Wait, they did fund 20 years of life until I met my wife.

557
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,560
 That's a good idea.

558
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,800
 I find interesting about going back to the tribes in Europe

559
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,480
 around that time, around the Roman Empire.

560
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,320
 The names that they're--

561
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,080
 well, today they sound kind of weird.

562
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,760
 The Allens, the Franks, the Normans, the Harries, the Charlies.

563
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,000
 Like, they just seem to be--

564
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,560
 The Charlies were always really pepped up, weren't they?

565
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
 Up for a fight.

566
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,840
 The Grannies?

567
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,080
 The Grannies.

568
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,880
 The Grannies, apparently, were a Germanic tribe living

569
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,720
 in Scandinavia, mentioned only once by historian Jodanez,

570
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,920
 one of his works.

571
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,040
 We don't know anything about them,

572
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 apart from he had a list of a load of barbarians.

573
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,640
 We don't like blades inside walking sticks,

574
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
 nothing like that.

575
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,760
 There's in the frames that double up as machine guns.

576
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,400
 It's really weird.

577
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,560
 Were the other ones that you mentioned,

578
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,360
 were they all British or were they--

579
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,160
 No, they would be mostly living in Europe.

580
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,600
 So the Franks, obviously, were the French come from,

581
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,240
 the Normans, the--

582
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,200
 Well, in fact, the Franks technically are German,

583
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
 aren't they?

584
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,960
 And the Germans are technically French.

585
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
 Yeah, it's so weird when you're looking for them.

586
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
 The Normans are obviously from the north.

587
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 Oh, yes, yes, exactly, Normans Scandinavian.

588
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,840
 And the Belgi, after whom Belgium were named,

589
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,280
 they were living around Winchester for quite a long time.

590
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,560
 What are they?

591
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,760
 The Parisei were living in Hull, where we get Paris from.

592
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,440
 So they're all moving all over the place.

593
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,840
 Oh, Hull, the Paris of Britain.

594
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,480
 Paris of the north.

595
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,520
 And Brittany, speaking of the Roman Empire falling,

596
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,840
 that's where all the Roman Britons went to escape to France,

597
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,120
 which was marginally safer, to Brittany.

598
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,200
 Is that why it's Brittany?

599
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
 I didn't know that.

600
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 That's the Britons, yeah, yeah.

601
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,840
 Right.

602
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,160
 So the English, the Angles, and they came to England,

603
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
 the Brits all went to Brittany.

604
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,120
 The Welsh is what the Anglo-Saxons called strangers.

605
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,360
 So Welsh is the equivalent of Barbarian, isn't it?

606
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,400
 Well, no, the Welsh--

607
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,440
 Ethnologically, shortly.

608
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,000
 Welsh is-- yeah, I guess.

609
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,240
 So one old Welsh would be sort of foreign, right?

610
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,360
 Yeah, same as Barbarian, right?

611
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,760
 And Greek Barbaros originally meant foreigner.

612
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,160
 Yeah, I guess so.

613
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,920
 That's what you call just like those weirdos next door.

614
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,760
 Yeah, exactly.

615
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,840
 Yeah.

616
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,360
 Do you know who's really into Barbarians?

617
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 Barack Obama.

618
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,240
 OK.

619
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,320
 A very specific one.

620
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
 The rugby team?

621
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,360
 Conan the Barbarian.

622
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
 Oh, Conan the Barbarian.

623
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
 It was revealed by someone close to him

624
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
 that he collects Conan the Barbarian comics.

625
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,080
 Yeah, he's obsessed with them, right?

626
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,920
 He has a big collection.

627
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,480
 Not so.

628
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,280
 And when the people who make Conan the Barbarian

629
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,840
 found that out, a collaboration happened,

630
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
 not with Barack Obama, but just with someone

631
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,000
 who had the idea and the makers of the comic.

632
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,560
 And they did a whole series of Barack the Barbarian.

633
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,120
 I've seen them, and they are wild.

634
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,880
 He is there scantily clad on the front cover

635
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,800
 with a naked woman virtually holding onto his leg.

636
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,960
 Did he OK this?

637
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,680
 The things people do is try and get a co-lab on Instagram.

638
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,760
 Yeah, astonishing.

639
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,120
 Yeah.

640
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,600
 I do think it would be very cool.

641
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,320
 We're getting close to doing something like this,

642
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,680
 where you can create an app.

643
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,880
 So you know you've got apps now that you can point at a tree

644
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,760
 and it'll tell you what the type of tree is.

645
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,120
 But a historical app that tells you, like, oh, this tree,

646
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,760
 this is the tree where a drunken moose got stuck in.

647
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,520
 You know, this is the tree where--

648
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,240
 Well, I think that might be slightly more complicated.

649
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
 You might have GPS on there as well.

650
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,520
 Not just looking at the tree.

651
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,000
 Yeah, it's totally doable.

652
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,240
 I think that'd be great.

653
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,640
 Every tree must have a story in central London, for example.

654
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,760
 It feels like it's the job of someone like us

655
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,120
 to go around and actually write the history so that it

656
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,400
 can be accessible by app.

657
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,920
 History.

658
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,440
 You've got the time?

659
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,280
 Yes, tree.

660
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,640
 OK, you've got the app name.

661
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,440
 Oh, my days.

662
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,680
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

663
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,760
 But it feels like you guys should do loads and loads of work,

664
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,320
 only for some tech bro to come along,

665
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 like slice all that off the internet for free,

666
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,800
 not credit you, and then stick it on an app

667
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,760
 that he sells for millions.

668
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,880
 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

669
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,360
 Let's do that.

670
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,120
 Yeah, I'm going to do the second one, the tech bro thing.

671
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,000
 Oh.

672
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,080
 I'll be the second guy.

673
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,400
 And then they have a year of zero acorns.

674
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,440
 Oh.

675
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,000
 So they're like, the oak tree keeps everyone guessing.

676
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 They're like a cicada.

677
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
 Why do they have--

678
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
 They come out on prime numbers, right?

679
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,080
 So you confuse their predators.

680
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,800
 So confuses any animals who are like,

681
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,040
 I'm just going to hang out in this oak tree

682
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,120
 and every year I'm going to eat all its offspring.

683
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,520
 Because, like, no offspring this year.

684
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,160
 Piggy, piggy.

685
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,480
 He's going to eat something else.

686
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,040
 And then one year or just absolutely shed.

687
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,240
 And you see it in the new forest.

688
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,560
 These oak trees, absolute loads and loads of acorns.

689
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,120
 It's like, I imagine it's like seeing--

690
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,520
 you know, when you see a fruit machine that hasn't paid out

691
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,200
 for ages or something, just looking up at the tree.

692
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,040
 Like, it's heavy.

693
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,560
 I know it's coming.

694
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
 That's what exactly it's like.

695
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,440
 And then there was an admiral, I think it was Jarvis.

696
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,680
 I can't remember, First Lord of the Admiralty or St. Vincent,

697
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,640
 who, one of Nelson's contemporaries basically,

698
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,960
 who would go around with his pockets full of acorns.

699
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,040
 Because oak tree is so important for the Royal Navy.

700
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,520
 As he was walking around with his mates,

701
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,680
 he'd just be spraying acorns all over the floor

702
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,840
 from his pocket.

703
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,560
 Johnny Apple seed kind of person.

704
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,480
 Yeah, that's cool.

705
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,280
 That's how interesting.

706
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,920
 A weird gig.

707
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,440
 It's like the Green Party, what you to do, like, rogue,

708
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,680
 you know, wildflowering now, don't you?

709
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
 Right, yeah, yeah.

710
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
 Which I don't believe works,

711
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,520
 because I've scattered wildflower seeds before

712
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,120
 and never have I seen a flower.

713
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,360
 Yeah, it's a nightmare.

714
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,760
 It's another nightmare for us.

715
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,200
 But you have to denude the soil first, I think, don't you?

716
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
 You have to get all the grass off.

717
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,960
 Yeah, I haven't done that.

718
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,440
 That's why it was all-- that's why the First World War was--

719
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,040
 Bad in many ways.

720
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,960
 But interesting from the point of view

721
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,640
 of a wildflower enthusiast.

722
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,680
 Oh, because you smash every living thing,

723
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,440
 you scour the ground,

724
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,080
 and you aerate different seeds

725
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,560
 because you're churning up the earth.

726
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,200
 Brilliant.

727
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,280
 So maybe there's a conspiracy theory that says

728
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,360
 it was all a wildflower plot.

729
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,840
 Yes, it is the wildflower enthusiast.

730
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,040
 Yes, that's a novel, I'd read.

731
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,320
 Gabriello Prinship was, in fact.

732
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,000
 A huge wildflower.

733
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,880
 A wildflower.

734
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,200
 I was reading about Thomas Jefferson's garden.

735
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,880
 He had, in Monticello, a really beautiful garden.

736
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,920
 And there was a thing that, in 1987, suddenly,

737
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,280
 the DEA in America, the Drug Enforcement Agency,

738
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,120
 suddenly stormed them and said,

739
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,960
 you guys need to sort something out ASAP

740
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,080
 or you're all going to jail,

741
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,880
 which is they were maintaining all the things

742
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,760
 that he had in his garden.

743
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,360
 But Jefferson used to have opium poppies

744
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,400
 growing in his garden.

745
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,200
 And for some reason, they thought that was OK

746
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,600
 to just continue doing.

747
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,520
 So until 1987--

748
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,160
 Well, they grew up.

749
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,760
 They grew up.

750
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,400
 I mean, they'll grow.

752
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,440
 Indeed, if you dig up the sile in war.

753
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,000
 Yeah, exactly.

754
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,080
 First things to come up, they--

755
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,760
 Yeah, so they maintained it.

756
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,120
 They were growing.

757
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,320
 And they said, this needs to be eradicated immediately.

758
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,320
 Otherwise, you were all in serious trouble.

759
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,400
 And so there was this huge panic where they just were--

760
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,280
 they were burning it all.

761
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,240
 They were getting rid of it.

762
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,320
 They were running into that.

763
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,200
 They were burning all the merchandise in their store

764
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
 because they sold Thomas Jefferson t-shirts.

765
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
 I had opium poppies all over them.

766
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,200
 So all their merch had to go.

767
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,320
 It was this just mass moment of panic.

768
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,640
 This Monticello in his--

769
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,600
 No, no, when were they doing--

770
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
 '87, 1987.

771
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,120
 More on drugs.

772
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,280
 That's just too far isn't that more on drugs.

773
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,240
 You've got to be making opium from the poppies

774
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,960
 before you get it confiscated, surely?

775
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,920
 I love that quote from John JFK when he's--

777
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,120
 he welcomed all his Nobel laureates into the White House.

778
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
 They had a bit of a do.

779
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,280
 And then he said, this is the greatest collection

780
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:27,080
 of mines in this room since Thomas Jefferson dined alone.

781
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
 Nice.

782
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,000
 That's a great quote.

783
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,680
 You know, Finnish musicians make money in a way

784
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,640
 that I think possibly no other country has their musicians

785
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,160
 making it.

786
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,080
 And that is through the taxi drivers of the country,

787
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,120
 because the Supreme Court passed a rule which meant

788
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,640
 that cabbies have to pay royalties when they have

789
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,920
 their radios on when they have passengers in the car.

790
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
 So it's like a PRS thing.

791
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,800
 And this was done--

792
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,120
 what I couldn't ascertain--

793
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
 Yeah, so they have to pay--

794
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,000
 When they play radio?

795
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,400
 Yeah, so 14 pounds every year needs

796
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,320
 to be paid to the Finnish Composer's Copyright Society.

797
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,680
 What I couldn't get to the bottom of

798
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,440
 was whether or not the money goes to the global artists,

799
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,480
 because the article does say that it's very specifically

800
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,000
 to help the local acts get a slice of the fare.

801
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,080
 That's really interesting, because you think the radio

802
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,320
 pay PRS anyway?

803
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,520
 Yeah, right, exactly.

804
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,800
 Yeah, so--

805
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,280
 And this was passed a while ago, so maybe they've overturned it.

806
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,040
 But definitely for a while, that was happening.

807
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,920
 And it led to a lot of backlash, obviously,

808
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,280
 from the taxi drivers who either just turned their radios off

809
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,800
 altogether, or I think tried to work out

810
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,760
 how to increase the fares to make up for the money.

811
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,560
 I was going to say, pass on the cost.

812
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,400
 Just do what supermarkets do.

813
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,480
 Wait, 14 quid a year?

814
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,360
 Yeah.

815
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,960
 We just felt like an odd tax to give to the taxis.

816
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,880
 Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.

817
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
 I think the other thing is, whenever

818
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,080
 I've been in the taxi in Britain,

819
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,680
 the taxi driver isn't playing music for me.

820
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,360
 I don't want to listen to--

821
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,000
 what's that radio channel that they all listen to?

822
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,520
 LBC.

823
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,080
 LBC.

824
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,560
 I don't want to listen to LBC.

825
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,880
 They listen to it for themselves.

826
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,080
 Yeah, that's a really good point, actually.

827
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,880
 That is true.

828
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,760
 Maybe they should just test, and as long as it's something

829
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,880
 the passengers don't want to listen to,

830
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,440
 then you don't have to pay.

831
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,800
 You have to put in your app what music you hate.

832
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,000
 Yeah.

833
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,960
 There's a place in Australia where

834
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,640
 it rains less frequently.

835
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,480
 But when it does, they get loads of tourists.

836
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,400
 This place called Andamooka.

837
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,400
 Can you guess why the rain brings the tourists?

838
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
 It cleans something.

839
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,680
 They've got a big glass building, but they can't clean it.

840
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,600
 They can't be bothered to clean it.

841
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,400
 And the tourists come because they're like, oh, it's clean.

842
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,240
 I can see it now.

843
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,880
 Yeah.

844
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,320
 Is it very craterous?

845
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,040
 And then it's kind of like ponds.

846
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,600
 It's pools.

847
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,880
 It's swimming areas all of a sudden.

848
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,760
 And that leads to life.

849
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,400
 That is something breeds in the ponds.

850
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
 Tourists breed.

851
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,800
 Tourists need to breed.

852
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,000
 There's a rare frog that comes out only when it rains.

853
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,280
 No, it's something less alive, but it

854
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,560
 is something that comes out.

855
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,640
 A rock.

856
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,120
 Bones.

857
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,280
 It's fossil hunting.

858
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,800
 I'll give you rock.

859
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,280
 Basically, it's an opal area, like lots of those areas

860
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,960
 in the middle of Australia are.

861
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
 And whenever there's really heavy rain,

862
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,880
 basically, opals just flush down to the streets.

863
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,160
 And you could just walk down the street and pick opals up.

864
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,840
 No.

865
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,920
 Dick Worthington.

866
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,560
 Isn't that cool?

867
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,360
 Yeah, the streets are made of opal.

868
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,080
 Wow.

869
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
 Australia's mad.

870
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,040
 It is just a mad.

871
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,520
 It is a mad country.

872
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,680
 I mean, it's a great country.

873
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,560
 And anyone living there should come to our shows.

874
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,800
 But as we've sold them out, it's fine.

875
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,560
 You can say it's shit.

876
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,800
 OK, they cheese at cricket, fine.

877
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,360
 But the thing about this place is that it's rained.

878
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,480
 The opals have come down.

879
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,320
 But then, of course, it's the middle of Australia.

880
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,360
 It's now sunny again.

881
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,040
 And so you can just see the light blinting off the opal.

882
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,600
 So you don't even have to look.

883
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,800
 It's almost like you're walking down.

884
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
 Something gets in your eye.

885
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
 You look down, and it's an opal.

886
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
 So they're flushed into the town by--

887
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,720
 they're in the ground, and then they get sort of--

888
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,600
 It kind of washes the topside off.

889
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,720
 And they're kind of flushed down into the main street.

890
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,440
 It is.

891
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,800
 You're making it sound like there's a sort of a Sunan

892
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,480
 avalanche, but it just cascades through.

893
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,600
 Like cars have to clear the way, people are knocked over.

894
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
 Can I just do one more quick, quick thing

895
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,080
 about the Finnish language?

896
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,640
 So they have the longest multi-word palindrome

897
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,600
 of any language.

898
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,000
 Multi-word palindrome.

899
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,840
 So if you think like race car, that's two words.

900
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,560
 But if you read it backwards, you can still say race car,

901
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
 right?

902
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
 A man, a plan, a canal, a pan.

903
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,440
 That's a more famous one.

904
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,040
 Yeah, yeah.

905
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,560
 But multi-language.

906
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,800
 No, it's multi-word in one language.

907
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
 Again, then.

908
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,400
 It's just that listening thing, isn't it?

909
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,280
 This has come up--

910
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,840
 Talk slower, guys.

911
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
 Come on.

912
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,480
 This has come up by a guy called Timu Pavelainen in 1992,

913
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,560
 and it's just so contrived.

914
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,680
 It starts off.

915
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,600
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

916
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:57,520
 And that means Emma is already bringing the pot, Liro.

917
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,960
 The suitable installer gingerly placed his balls.

918
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,480
 And then it goes on for another page and a half.

919
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,400
 Wow.

920
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,440
 That's not wow.

921
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,600
 That's what you're going to get so many emails, I hope,

922
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
 in the inbox from people making longer palindromes

923
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,640
 in that of their own language.

924
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,480
 If you want to see a great one, and it is out there,

925
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,120
 Dmitri Marden in his book does a palindrome that is about,

926
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,840
 I think, like five pages long.

927
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,240
 It's insane.

928
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,360
 That's good, really.

929
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,480
 Maybe not as long as that, but it's pages, yeah.

930
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,880
 I've got it in my mind that there's a novel that was written,

931
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,560
 but maybe not.

932
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,200
 But if not, there should be as a palindrome.

933
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,560
 I don't-- can that be?

934
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,480
 Maybe it could.

935
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,120
 It would not be a good novel.

936
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,720
 Imagine not being able to get the final word right.

937
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,680
 Have you ever read that book where they don't use the letter

938
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,480
 E at all?

939
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,880
 Yeah, I've heard of it.

940
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
 I've never read it.

941
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,320
 Otter, otter drivel.

942
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
 Yeah, no, no.

943
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,000
 One last thing.

944
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
 Super quickly, Usain Bolt.

945
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,160
 He's a dad now.

946
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,640
 Yeah.

947
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,000
 Do you know what his kids are called?

948
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,960
 Have you called Lightning?

949
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,800
 He named his son.

950
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,640
 He's just had twins.

951
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,080
 He named his son Thunder.

952
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,720
 Brilliant.

953
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,600
 Yeah.

954
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,520
 And then Underbolt.

955
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,160
 And that's Thunderbolt.

956
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,040
 Oh, right, because of Thunderbolt, thank candy.

957
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,680
 Wait a minute.

958
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,160
 You said he had twins, what's the other one called?

959
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,080
 The other one's called Saint Leo.

960
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,480
 And then he has a one-year-old daughter.

961
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,640
 So the twins are younger.

962
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,720
 And she's called Olympia Lightning.

963
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,120
 Brilliant.

964
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,040
 Brilliant.

965
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,640
 Bolt.

966
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,040
 Also like Lightning Bolt.

967
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,400
 Yeah, that's so good.

968
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,280
 He also has another one called Wingnut.

969
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,480
 OK, that's it.

970
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,200
 That is all of our outtakes.

971
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
 Hope you enjoyed that.

972
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,240
 If there's anything you want to discuss further

973
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,400
 about the things that we have said,

974
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,600
 you can message us on podcast@qi.com.

975
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,520
 And yeah, I mean, if you're around in Cardiff on the 16th,

976
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,560
 do come say hi.

977
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,320
 London, 23rd, 24th.

978
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,080
 Do say hi.

979
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,200
 27th in Manchester.

980
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,880
 These are all October dates.

981
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,160
 As you may have seen, we've turned it into a party of a night.

982
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,560
 We've got quizzes going on.

983
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,240
 We have special guests coming on who have been facts on the show

984
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,560
 that I've discovered in the local areas

985
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,720
 and get the guys to guess who I've secretly brought onto stage.

986
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,560
 And we induct them into a Hall of Fame.

987
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,040
 It's a really fun show this year.

988
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,240
 We're incredibly proud of it.

989
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,400
 And it's been so much fun meeting everyone

990
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,240
 who hangs around at the end for a photo.

991
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,560
 We've been doing these in the lobby photos with everyone.

992
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,000
 And yeah, really awesome to meet so many listeners of the show.

993
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,400
 We never get to do that, so this is our one big chance.

994
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,000
 Anyway, that's it.

995
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,520
 We'll be back again with more club fishy stuff in the future.

996
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,040
 And yeah, see you soon.

997
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,080
 All right, off with the compilation.

998
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,660
 (upbeat music)
