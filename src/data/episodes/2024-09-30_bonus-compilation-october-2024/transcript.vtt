 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.800
 Hey, Club Fish members.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.400
 Welcome to your bonus bit of content.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.000
 We have a compilation episode for you this week.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.480
 A lot of great stuff in here.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.840
 There's conveyor belt chat.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.720
 There's Eric the eel chat, Usain Bolt chat,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.880
 country music star chat.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.760
 It's a good one.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.440
 We also have a few guest voices that you're

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.640
 going to hear along the way.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.360
 There's Johnny Knoxville of Jackass,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.960
 and there is Dan Snow of History Hit.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.360
 So I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.080
 Just want to quickly remind you, though,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.400
 that we are still mid-tour.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.840
 We're having an amazing time.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.200
 We just got back from Gothenburg in Sweden on the weekend,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.280
 did a couple of shows there.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.000
 Well, we recorded one episode.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.400
 And then in the evening, Andy James and I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 did a really odd sort of sitting in a really noisy bar episode.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.480
 It's not going to go out.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.120
 Maybe it will go out on Club Fish,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.200
 where we just chatted about our favorite facts

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.360
 while about 600 people tried to order drinks at the bar.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.400
 It was so fun, though.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.840
 It was really fun, amazing time on tour.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 And the tour is continuing.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.480
 We're going to be in Cardiff on the 16th of October.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 We are going to be at London's Theatre Royal in Drury Lane

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 on the 23rd and the 24th.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.400
 And then we are going to wrap up the UK tour

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.960
 on the 27th of October at Manchester.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.080
 But otherwise, let's get on with this show.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.880
 So a compilation.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.840
 And we begin the chat with Johnny Knoxville chatting

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.880
 about interesting and odd country music stars.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.240
 Here we go.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.960
 [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 I think that one of the early outlaws

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.360
 was a guy called Ernest Tubb.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 Oh, Ernest Tubb was an amazing, amazing singer.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.920
 I think he was maybe a bit early, like late '50s.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.040
 Yeah.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.880
 And he was known as the Texas Troubadour.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 But he was a massive liability.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.360
 He was one of these always drunk,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.040
 kicked the windows out of his limo

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.800
 once, which was really impressive.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.000
 His own record label had to hire someone

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.120
 to go around with him to wrestle him to the ground

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.880
 when he got too rowdy.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.000
 And he just walked into the National Life Building,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 which I think was maybe the home of country music in Nashville.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040
 It was where all the big stars were put on.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.520
 Walked in there with a magnum in order

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.800
 to shoot a producer over some feud they had.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.440
 This producer, Jim Denney.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.200
 And I think he was so drunk that he couldn't really see straight.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.760
 And he just mistook someone else for him and shot him instead.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.800
 Oh, my God.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.840
 And he was just a public drunkenness, as he would.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.240
 He was all geared to shoot somebody.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.880
 You've got to shoot somebody when you're in that mood.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.160
 So this is pre these guys.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.240
 But I'm more old school country listener

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.400
 and love Hank Williams.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.840
 And I've always loved about Hank Williams.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.480
 The fact that when he got married,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.880
 he had a matinee and an evening performance of it.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.640
 And his wedding was--

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640
 You mean he did a gig?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.200
 Well, his wedding was a gig.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.880
 He sold tickets to his wedding.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.320
 He invited 28,000 people.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.240
 James, you just made a noise as if you're annoyed with yourself

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 that you didn't think of that.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.640
 I'm so annoyed.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.440
 My wedding was so expensive.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.440
 Imagine why I could have squeezed out of them.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.240
 28,000 people?

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.040
 How many people were sitting on the bride side?

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.800
 Because I feel that would be really heavy, that gig.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.360
 And yeah, it was his second marriage, in fact.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.640
 And it was in Louisiana.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.000
 And yeah, they held two ceremonies.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 But he has the--

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.960
 I just did not know how he died.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.920
 It's the weirdest story.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.400
 Oh, yeah?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.320
 Yeah.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.760
 He, A, he died so young.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.080
 And when I listen to Hank Williams,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.560
 he sounds like he's got an old voice.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.320
 He died when he was 30.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.880
 And he died--

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.320
 He looked like he was 50.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.960
 He did look older.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.800
 I think lifestyle, maybe, had something to do with it.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.440
 But yeah, he really did, didn't he?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.120
 And he died on New Year's Day, I think,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.080
 or maybe January the 2nd.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.360
 But he'd been on his way to a gig.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.240
 And I think the flight had been canceled.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.800
 And he randomly asked a student called Charles Carr,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.080
 fittingly, to drive his car to the gig.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.560
 And basically, weirdly, the last place they were in, Johnny,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.640
 was Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.640
 Yes.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.960
 You proud of that?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.280
 Well, my father used to brag, you know, Hank Williams died

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.960
 at the hotel right uptown.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.320
 And in reality, he died between that hotel and the gig.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.840
 But dad was very proud that Hank Williams died at that hotel.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.800
 Why wouldn't you be?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.280
 You know?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.960
 Yeah.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.600
 I don't know.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.520
 It's a great claim to fame for you.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.240
 But it's so dark, there's guys driving him to the gig

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.920
 and realize that Hank Williams had just

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.720
 been dead in the back of his car for a relatively long period

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.640
 of time and then had to go into a gas station

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.880
 and say, hey, this is going to sound so weird,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.000
 but Hank Williams was sort of biggest star in the country.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.840
 He's in the back of my car and he's dead.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.800
 Can you help me?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.280
 What a mad way to go.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.880
 Yeah.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.280
 And what a mad anecdote for that guy, Charles Carr,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.880
 a student Charles Carr, to have for the rest of his life.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.640
 Yeah, it feels more weird for him than Hank.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.920
 Yeah, I didn't have TikTok or anything to tell anyone.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.600
 No, I think that might have breached TikTok's regulations.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.040
 Speaking of deaths, I was looking

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.840
 at people who had been shot for bad reasons.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.280
 If you go to Tombstone, there's a graveyard there,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.520
 the Boothill Graveyard.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.360
 And there's lots of people buried and they're all

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.520
 from the Wild West and they all have quite good stories.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.800
 So there was a guy called Billy Kinsman.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 Someone played a trick on him and put an advert in the paper

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.320
 saying that he was planning to marry someone called May Woodman.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.440
 He then took out an advert saying it wasn't true.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.800
 And May Woodman was so upset by it that she shot him.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.280
 Oh, wow.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.840
 That's on the headstone?

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.240
 No, no, people did research afterwards.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.520
 It goes down three different tombstones.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.560
 We need more headstones.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.800
 Yeah.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.720
 There was a guy called Tom Jay Waters,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.040
 who was shot to death during a fight about a blue and black

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.680
 plaid shirt that he was wearing that day.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.280
 Wait, was it one of those arguments about,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.720
 oh, is this blue and black?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.000
 Or is it red and silver?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.920
 Those internet meme things.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.040
 I'm afraid not.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.280
 Apparently, people kept making jokes about his new shirt.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.080
 And he said, I'll knock down any man who opens his mouth

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.600
 about my shirt again.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.160
 And some of the blog walks in the bar,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.120
 made a joke about his shirt.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.560
 Walter's knocked him unconscious.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.160
 And the next day, he shot him.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.560
 Oh.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.200
 Hang on, he shot the guy he knocked unconscious

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.240
 or the unconscious guy shot him?

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.920
 No, the unconscious guy.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.800
 Basically, it just come in, made a perfectly normal joke,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.880
 being punched in the face, decided, no, you're going to get it.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.240
 We mentioned briefly Baron Coubertin,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.440
 who was the sort of father of the modern Olympics.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.600
 And he was French.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.040
 And he wanted the Olympics to happen because of the Franco

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.040
 Prussian War, partly.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.520
 Because that happened in 1870, didn't it?

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.480
 And he would have been seven years old at the time.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.480
 And I think he was caught up in it as a seven-year-old.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.040
 I'm not heavily involved, but he was--

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.440
 I think it was basically, it was quite an embarrassment

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.560
 for France, wasn't it, the Franco-Prussian War?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.840
 And I think the whole--

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.440
 even seven-year-olds in the playground were going,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.640
 oh, this is awful.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.120
 It's awful.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720
 You're absolutely right.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720
 It was embarrassing.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.600
 We shouldn't even be mentioning it during the Olympics now,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.000
 because it was a bad war for France.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.240
 And in fact, Prussian soldiers were at his home.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.320
 And they took away his croquet box.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.680
 And they filled it with explosives.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.600
 And they blew it up on a nearby railway.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.400
 That is a dangerous thing to put.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.600
 Did they put those grenades that look a little bit

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.720
 like croquet bowls?

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.600
 Yeah, and they took a huge mallet.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.360
 And then they just walloped it, and it blew up the railway.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.000
 But I think he was trying to restore French vitality,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.760
 but also international unity.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.800
 He wanted peace rather than national pride,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.240
 which is ironic, considering the mega competition

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.840
 that it leads to.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.440
 Yeah, he was.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.160
 He basically, I think, from memory from the book,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
 A Load of All Balls, a QI Book of Sport,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.080
 in which this is mentioned.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.960
 I think he--

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.640
 by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.000
 With a lot of ghosting from Dan Shriver and Andrew Hunter

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.120
 Murray, I think we should add.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.160
 Ghosting, as in you just never reply to our emails.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.600
 I've haunted the book.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.120
 I'll put a curse on it.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.320
 Just as this fact is about notable swimmers

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.960
 that had a bad time of it at the Olympics,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.320
 I thought it'd be worth mentioning the very famous one

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.440
 from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric the Eel.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.720
 Eric Mosambani, he famously was brought in on a wild card

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.360
 for developing nations, and he logged the slowest ever time

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.160
 for a 50-meter swim in Olympic history, one minute, 52

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.240
 seconds.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.960
 I just find what was amazing about it

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.520
 is that he didn't give up after it,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.040
 and his story sort of goes on.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.600
 Because this is a guy who was swimming in lakes

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.800
 in order to train for the Olympics.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.640
 The longest pool that he had was at a hotel

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.120
 that was 12 meters long, and he was only

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.360
 allowed to practice between 5 and 6 AM.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.280
 When he actually rocked up for the Olympics

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.200
 and started doing the events, he was wearing sort of really

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.360
 weird swimming shorts.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.760
 He didn't have speedos, and they had

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.880
 to be lent to him by a South African swimming coach.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.000
 But after the Olympics, he became the swimming--

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.360
 he became the coach for the national swimming

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.080
 squad of Equatorial Guinea.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.960
 And he also kept swimming himself

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.960
 and got himself to a personal best time of 52.18 seconds,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.480
 which means he would have won gold medal at the 1956 Olympics.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.320
 Yeah, he was only five seconds behind the gold medalist

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.920
 of the 2000 Olympics.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.280
 That's how much training he continued to do.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.840
 So he is now a legit brilliant swimmer.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.120
 We shouldn't forget also Paula the Crawler,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.680
 who was the female Equatorial Guinea swimmer at that Olympics.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.640
 So basically, Eric the Eel became really, really famous.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.120
 And then all the journalists were like, oh, wait a minute.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.640
 There's another swimmer from Equatorial Guinea as well.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.720
 And they went over and she did loads and loads of interviews.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.360
 She was the supermarket cashier.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.360
 And she became a celebrity even before the race started.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.480
 She was really, really famous.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.680
 And she came last, but she didn't come last by nearly

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.960
 as much as Eric did.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.720
 Oh, yeah, she--

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.720
 Eric the Eel.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.600
 Yeah, Eric the Eel was like, he almost drowned.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.880
 That's the thing.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.400
 I think you've got to shoot the moon.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.920
 If you're going to come last, then you

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.040
 have to come really, really, really last to get super famous.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.680
 What's amazing as well is, I didn't know this,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.400
 but as a rule within swimming, if you touch the side lanes,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.360
 if you touch those boys that are attached,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.840
 you're disqualified from the match.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.520
 And if you watch the final leg of Eric the Eel,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.520
 he is literally sitting right next to it.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.040
 And his arms getting so close.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.040
 And that could have just been a disaster.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.800
 It could have been disqualified from the match,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.440
 but he did it.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440
 It's amazing guy.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.080
 I don't know if it would have been more of a disaster

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.280
 if he was disqualified.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.560
 To be fair, I don't think he was like, thank God I avoided that.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.240
 I think I probably wished he had been.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.720
 That's true.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.320
 Do you remember that thing of--

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.920
 it was a headline from a couple of years ago,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.480
 and occasionally just around the line.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.920
 It's an outraged headline about the Navy buying a five inch

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.640
 gun and spending like $100 million,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.320
 couldn't it?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.960
 And the journalist who wrote the article

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.560
 assumes that the gun is five inches long rather than the width

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.040
 of the barrel being five inches.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.560
 And it could fire quite good shells.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.200
 It's fantastic.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.520
 The conveyor belt, just one side of it,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.920
 is the bit that you walk on, or the bit

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.960
 that your luggage goes on, or something like that.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.280
 But they did invent a Mobius Strip conveyor belt a few years

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.840
 ago.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.520
 And actually, that became quite popular,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.360
 because what it meant was you get twice as much wear out

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.560
 of it, because--

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.440
 In my head, it's just making all your suitcases

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.400
 fall off it half way through.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.200
 But OK, explain.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.400
 The twist in the Mobius Strip, which

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.680
 means that as you follow the surface,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.120
 you actually go all the way on the top of it,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.760
 and then go all the way on the bottom of it

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.760
 before you get back to the same point again.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.240
 But the twist was out of range of the--

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.720
 it was underneath the conveyor belt, if you know what I mean.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.160
 Lovely.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.400
 It's after the discharge point.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.920
 After the discharge point, yeah, exactly.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.080
 But yeah, these are really, really--

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.680
 well, they weren't really popular, but they did exist.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.560
 Every home had one for a spell in the early noughties.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.120
 Do you not remember the Mobius Strip conveyor belt day

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.600
 that we had?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.800
 Your parents would.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.480
 Right.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.520
 Have you guys, by the way, ever used--

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.080
 and I've never seen this in a Pizza Hut--

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.040
 the subconscious menu.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.960
 This is in--

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.160
 This is in 2014.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.480
 And it sounds like it was going to be rolled out,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.880
 but I certainly have never seen it.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.160
 It's a Darren Brown thing.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.560
 I've never been to a Pizza Hut.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560
 Have you never?

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.800
 No.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.560
 From just memes and stuff, do they have a salad place?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.080
 Yeah.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.560
 Yeah.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.840
 And all you can eat pizza and stuff like that.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.320
 Yeah.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.800
 You've got two options, ordering, or you do the buffet,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.160
 and you go up, and yeah, it's the sort of all you can eat.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.040
 We can't-- this podcast can't turn to a Pizza Hut explainer

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040
 for the uninitiated.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.880
 No, but it's like--

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.840
 their game is we bet we can fill you up with dough

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.480
 before you make money off us on the toppings.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.000
 That's effectively the battle you're in, the battle of wits

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.880
 you're in, but the Pizza Hut had quarters.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.960
 No, it was ever beaten then.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.680
 Well, supposedly, they launched this thing,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.800
 the subconscious menu.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.800
 And the idea is that it was done in conjunction

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.840
 with this thing called Tobii Technology,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.400
 and they developed eye recognition software

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.480
 so that if you were confused about what toppings you wanted

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.600
 on a pizza, you stared at a screen,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.640
 and within 2.5 seconds, it can analyze what your eyes were

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.800
 going, ooh, or no.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.880
 And it uses your eye language, whatever

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.800
 that was conveying, to then say, oh, you want a pizza

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.080
 with all these random things on it,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.040
 and you say, yes, that's right.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.800
 And that's the way you can order there, the sweet dishes.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.600
 What if all your eyes are saying is,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.560
 I don't eat at places with pictures on the menu?

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.160
 They send you across the food straight to brands.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.640
 Dan, are you surprised they didn't roll out

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.000
 an incredibly expensive-sounding high-tech system

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.680
 for a very low-margin business model?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.160
 I am, because they said that the response was very

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.200
 incredibly positive.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.680
 98% of people were happy with the recommended toppings.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.800
 It sounds like a girl.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.280
 Really?

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.080
 Yeah.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.120
 And how did it react if people's eyes were rolling back

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.000
 into their heads and seeing this ridiculous technology?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.760
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.800
 One last silly news story from this month from the BBC.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.760
 OK, I'm just going to read you the first sentence of it.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.680
 "Justice was served extra hot when police

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.920
 seized a food delivery bike, then delivered the pizza.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.400
 And it's from North Wales.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.120
 And as he's police, they spotted an uninsured driver.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.280
 They seized his motorbike.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.200
 He was on his way to deliver a pizza at the time.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.120
 They then delivered the pizza to the address, right?

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.560
 And it was just-- they were so excited whoever was writing

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.160
 this article to get some jokes in.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.760
 So after finding out the driver's insurance had run out

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.040
 two months ago, police were keen to dish out

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.360
 law and brackets of pizza.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.160
 Close brackets.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.520
 Order."

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.440
 Oh, yeah, OK.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.600
 They went from being officers of the peace

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.840
 to officers of the pizza.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840
 I don't know if someone is keen to use jokes.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.480
 I'm not sure he's fully nailed them.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.320
 Andy, was it just those two?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.640
 There are a couple more, but I don't think I heard that.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.840
 Although that's a strong thing to bring up in the show

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.200
 for those two jokes.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.920
 What?

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.000
 It was a good haul.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.760
 Do you mean weak?

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.560
 Do you mean it's a weak thing to bring up in the show?

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.120
 Absolutely not.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.320
 It's your words, not mine.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.760
 But you know what they can do for these conveyor belts?

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.920
 They can't adjust the temperatures,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.000
 but they can adjust the cheese.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.640
 And that has been done.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.040
 So let's say you go into a hotter oven

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.320
 and the cheese that you've bought

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.360
 is going and being cooked through it.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.400
 That might burn because the cheese is now

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.360
 being exposed to a higher heat at a quicker rate or whatever.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.920
 But there's a man who's called James Leprino,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.360
 AKA the Willy Wonka of cheese,

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.480
 who supplies 85% of all the cheese

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.480
 that are used for major pizza companies

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.000
 like Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.320
 He is the cheese man.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.200
 In the world?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.080
 In the world.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.440
 85%.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.960
 How big is this herd of cows?

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.640
 This is impossible.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.560
 That's incredible.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.320
 They make, he's worth three billion.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.920
 They make that roughly annually.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.680
 It is a giant operation.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.640
 They deal in mozzarella, mainly.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.040
 And what they do is they adapt the cheese

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.720
 for the circumstances of the cooking

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.760
 of these major companies.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.600
 So with the Pizza Hut conveyor belt,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.000
 the cheese was burning.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.920
 So yeah, Willy Wonka of cheese jumped back into the factory

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.200
 and he made it so--

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200
 Don't call it the Willy Wonka.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.040
 Yeah, it's horrible.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.400
 Dad, Dad, I know we won a golden ticket,

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.480
 but I don't want to go to the cheese factory.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.840
 I can't believe, so the solution to the burning the pizza

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.360
 wasn't figure out a way to make your ovens cold.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.640
 They're like all other ovens.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.200
 It was OK.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:08.840
 Let's change the cheese.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.160
 I'll change cheese.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.280
 Well, yeah, because he's got nothing to do with the ovens.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.240
 He's just the cheese supplier and he wants to remain it.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.280
 So he has to adapt.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.520
 With Domino's, when they started delivering it to your house,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.680
 he had to adapt it so that the cheese didn't go stale

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.880
 and weird in the process.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.480
 And they made it a longer lasting cheese

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.600
 that looked fresh and hot by the time it got to you.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.760
 So he is, yeah, the Willy Wonka of cheese.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.680
 Clever Willy.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.080
 Something about Eleanor of Aquitaine

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.080
 that is not often said.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.240
 So Queen of France, Queen of England.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.280
 Not many people have done the double.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.120
 Not many people.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.000
 I think the only one.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.400
 Mary Queen of Scots claimed it.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.760
 I'll controversial, you know, could have claimed it.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.120
 Her followers might have claimed it.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.360
 But one extra one I'd like to throw into the mix.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.800
 Queen of the Christmas movie.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.320
 Have you heard of the movie called The Lion in Winter?

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.240
 Oh, yeah, it's huge.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.640
 Huge movie, right?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.800
 It's 1183 AD.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.960
 King Henry II's three sons all want to inherit the throne,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.240
 but he won't commit to a choice.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.080
 When he allows his imprisoned wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.000
 out for a Christmas visit,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.160
 they all variously plot to force him into a decision.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.920
 And this movie, which was starring Catherine Hepburn.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.160
 Yeah, it was an all-star cast.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.840
 Yeah, Peter O'Toole.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.280
 And this is a movie that Aaron Sorkin says

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.720
 is his favorite film of all time.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.680
 Sylvester Stallone says the same thing.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.160
 It's a movie that is massively--

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.440
 I just don't know how much I trust Sylvester Stallone.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.600
 He made some great films, though, but I do.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.680
 But it's quite different vibe to the Rocky movie, isn't it?

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.800
 They're the two best movie critics in history.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.240
 We're talking here.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.640
 Well, Sorkin, I mean, he would--

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.960
 he integrated dialogue from it into the West Wing.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.640
 Like, that's how much it means to him.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.880
 Yeah.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.840
 But Eleanor of Aquitaine was basically--

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.600
 she was imprisoned by Henry II for decades, right,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.720
 while he was in rule.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.360
 But he would often let her out during Christmas periods

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.320
 and little moments where she could--

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.280
 so that was her period where the people saw her again.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.560
 He put her on top of the tree, didn't he?

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.280
 Yeah, well, she was suddenly allowed back into public

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.040
 for those moments.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.840
 And as a result, this is one of the most influential movies

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.320
 that we've had in recent years.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.400
 Sorry, Kim, I've lost a little bit.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.000
 Yeah.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.120
 So he let Eleanor out on Christmas.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.760
 Yeah.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.880
 And there is a movie.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.600
 Where do the two things collide?

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.080
 Well, this is a Christmas movie in the way

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.240
 that Die Hard's a Christmas movie, you know.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.800
 But I don't think they only made that movie

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.000
 because they let Eleanor out on Christmas.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.520
 Oh, is the movie set in Christmas when they let her out?

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.600
 Oh, it's set.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.000
 I just read you the blurb, yeah.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.120
 Yeah, sorry, it was out of context a little bit.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.520
 It was just-- you just read it.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.000
 So in the movie, she's one of the characters in the movie.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.960
 Yeah, yeah, she's basically a Christmas movie

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.200
 without being, obviously, a Christmas movie.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.320
 But a lot of her big moments happen during Christmas periods

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.960
 because that's when she was let out

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.840
 and involved with her son's lives.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.760
 And I think that this is someone who, arguably,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.240
 is a Queen of Christmas.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240
 Wow.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240
 I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.440
 Father Christmas, King of Christmas,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.640
 Eleanor Backham, Queen of Christmas.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.040
 I was reading just while we're on the subject of, like,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.760
 exiles as part of the topic.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.680
 There used to be a thing, which probably still goes on,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.320
 but it was much more of a term that was used,

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.720
 called the remittance man.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.680
 And have you heard the remittance man?

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.120
 It's basically the idea, you have a member of your family

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.840
 who is so embarrassing that you just say, listen,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.160
 can you move to Canada and then we'll just pay you monthly

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.840
 to just not come back?

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.840
 This is your night.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.440
 I see why this wakes you up at night.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.000
 That's very realistic.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.160
 How are your family in Australia, Doug?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.800
 Wait, they did fund 20 years of life until I met my wife.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.560
 That's a good idea.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.800
 I find interesting about going back to the tribes in Europe

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.480
 around that time, around the Roman Empire.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.320
 The names that they're--

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.080
 well, today they sound kind of weird.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.760
 The Allens, the Franks, the Normans, the Harries, the Charlies.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.000
 Like, they just seem to be--

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.560
 The Charlies were always really pepped up, weren't they?

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560
 Up for a fight.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.840
 The Grannies?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.080
 The Grannies.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.880
 The Grannies, apparently, were a Germanic tribe living

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.720
 in Scandinavia, mentioned only once by historian Jodanez,

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.920
 one of his works.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.040
 We don't know anything about them,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.040
 apart from he had a list of a load of barbarians.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.640
 We don't like blades inside walking sticks,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.640
 nothing like that.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.760
 There's in the frames that double up as machine guns.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.400
 It's really weird.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.560
 Were the other ones that you mentioned,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.360
 were they all British or were they--

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.160
 No, they would be mostly living in Europe.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.600
 So the Franks, obviously, were the French come from,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.240
 the Normans, the--

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.200
 Well, in fact, the Franks technically are German,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200
 aren't they?

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.960
 And the Germans are technically French.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.440
 Yeah, it's so weird when you're looking for them.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.600
 The Normans are obviously from the north.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.600
 Oh, yes, yes, exactly, Normans Scandinavian.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.840
 And the Belgi, after whom Belgium were named,

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.280
 they were living around Winchester for quite a long time.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.560
 What are they?

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.760
 The Parisei were living in Hull, where we get Paris from.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.440
 So they're all moving all over the place.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.840
 Oh, Hull, the Paris of Britain.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.480
 Paris of the north.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.520
 And Brittany, speaking of the Roman Empire falling,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.840
 that's where all the Roman Britons went to escape to France,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.120
 which was marginally safer, to Brittany.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.200
 Is that why it's Brittany?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.200
 I didn't know that.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200
 That's the Britons, yeah, yeah.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.840
 Right.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.160
 So the English, the Angles, and they came to England,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160
 the Brits all went to Brittany.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.120
 The Welsh is what the Anglo-Saxons called strangers.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.360
 So Welsh is the equivalent of Barbarian, isn't it?

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.400
 Well, no, the Welsh--

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.440
 Ethnologically, shortly.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.000
 Welsh is-- yeah, I guess.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.240
 So one old Welsh would be sort of foreign, right?

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.360
 Yeah, same as Barbarian, right?

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.760
 And Greek Barbaros originally meant foreigner.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.160
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.920
 That's what you call just like those weirdos next door.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.840
 Yeah.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.360
 Do you know who's really into Barbarians?

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 Barack Obama.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.240
 OK.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.320
 A very specific one.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.480
 The rugby team?

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.360
 Conan the Barbarian.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.360
 Oh, Conan the Barbarian.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.520
 It was revealed by someone close to him

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.600
 that he collects Conan the Barbarian comics.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.080
 Yeah, he's obsessed with them, right?

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:51.920
 He has a big collection.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.480
 Not so.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.280
 And when the people who make Conan the Barbarian

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.840
 found that out, a collaboration happened,

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.880
 not with Barack Obama, but just with someone

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.000
 who had the idea and the makers of the comic.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.560
 And they did a whole series of Barack the Barbarian.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.120
 I've seen them, and they are wild.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.880
 He is there scantily clad on the front cover

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.800
 with a naked woman virtually holding onto his leg.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.960
 Did he OK this?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.680
 The things people do is try and get a co-lab on Instagram.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.760
 Yeah, astonishing.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.120
 Yeah.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.600
 I do think it would be very cool.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.320
 We're getting close to doing something like this,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.680
 where you can create an app.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.880
 So you know you've got apps now that you can point at a tree

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.760
 and it'll tell you what the type of tree is.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.120
 But a historical app that tells you, like, oh, this tree,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.760
 this is the tree where a drunken moose got stuck in.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.520
 You know, this is the tree where--

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.240
 Well, I think that might be slightly more complicated.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.240
 You might have GPS on there as well.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.520
 Not just looking at the tree.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.000
 Yeah, it's totally doable.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.240
 I think that'd be great.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.640
 Every tree must have a story in central London, for example.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.760
 It feels like it's the job of someone like us

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.120
 to go around and actually write the history so that it

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.400
 can be accessible by app.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:53.920
 History.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.440
 You've got the time?

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.280
 Yes, tree.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.640
 OK, you've got the app name.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.440
 Oh, my days.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.680
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.760
 But it feels like you guys should do loads and loads of work,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.320
 only for some tech bro to come along,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.320
 like slice all that off the internet for free,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.800
 not credit you, and then stick it on an app

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.760
 that he sells for millions.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.880
 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.360
 Let's do that.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.120
 Yeah, I'm going to do the second one, the tech bro thing.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.000
 Oh.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.080
 I'll be the second guy.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.400
 And then they have a year of zero acorns.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.440
 Oh.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.000
 So they're like, the oak tree keeps everyone guessing.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 They're like a cicada.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.960
 Why do they have--

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.760
 They come out on prime numbers, right?

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.080
 So you confuse their predators.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.800
 So confuses any animals who are like,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.040
 I'm just going to hang out in this oak tree

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.120
 and every year I'm going to eat all its offspring.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.520
 Because, like, no offspring this year.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.160
 Piggy, piggy.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.480
 He's going to eat something else.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.040
 And then one year or just absolutely shed.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.240
 And you see it in the new forest.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.560
 These oak trees, absolute loads and loads of acorns.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.120
 It's like, I imagine it's like seeing--

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.520
 you know, when you see a fruit machine that hasn't paid out

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.200
 for ages or something, just looking up at the tree.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.040
 Like, it's heavy.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.560
 I know it's coming.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560
 That's what exactly it's like.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.440
 And then there was an admiral, I think it was Jarvis.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.680
 I can't remember, First Lord of the Admiralty or St. Vincent,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.640
 who, one of Nelson's contemporaries basically,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.960
 who would go around with his pockets full of acorns.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.040
 Because oak tree is so important for the Royal Navy.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.520
 As he was walking around with his mates,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.680
 he'd just be spraying acorns all over the floor

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.840
 from his pocket.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.560
 Johnny Apple seed kind of person.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.480
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.280
 That's how interesting.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:12.920
 A weird gig.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.440
 It's like the Green Party, what you to do, like, rogue,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.680
 you know, wildflowering now, don't you?

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.680
 Right, yeah, yeah.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.880
 Which I don't believe works,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.520
 because I've scattered wildflower seeds before

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.120
 and never have I seen a flower.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.360
 Yeah, it's a nightmare.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.760
 It's another nightmare for us.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.200
 But you have to denude the soil first, I think, don't you?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.480
 You have to get all the grass off.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.960
 Yeah, I haven't done that.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.440
 That's why it was all-- that's why the First World War was--

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.040
 Bad in many ways.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.960
 But interesting from the point of view

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.640
 of a wildflower enthusiast.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.680
 Oh, because you smash every living thing,

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.440
 you scour the ground,

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.080
 and you aerate different seeds

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.560
 because you're churning up the earth.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.200
 Brilliant.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.280
 So maybe there's a conspiracy theory that says

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.360
 it was all a wildflower plot.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.840
 Yes, it is the wildflower enthusiast.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.040
 Yes, that's a novel, I'd read.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.320
 Gabriello Prinship was, in fact.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.000
 A huge wildflower.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.880
 A wildflower.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.200
 I was reading about Thomas Jefferson's garden.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.880
 He had, in Monticello, a really beautiful garden.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.920
 And there was a thing that, in 1987, suddenly,

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.280
 the DEA in America, the Drug Enforcement Agency,

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.120
 suddenly stormed them and said,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.960
 you guys need to sort something out ASAP

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.080
 or you're all going to jail,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.880
 which is they were maintaining all the things

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.760
 that he had in his garden.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.360
 But Jefferson used to have opium poppies

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.400
 growing in his garden.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.200
 And for some reason, they thought that was OK

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.600
 to just continue doing.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.520
 So until 1987--

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.160
 Well, they grew up.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:30.760
 They grew up.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.400
 I mean, they'll grow.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.440
 Indeed, if you dig up the sile in war.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.080
 First things to come up, they--

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.760
 Yeah, so they maintained it.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.120
 They were growing.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.320
 And they said, this needs to be eradicated immediately.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.320
 Otherwise, you were all in serious trouble.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.400
 And so there was this huge panic where they just were--

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.280
 they were burning it all.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.240
 They were getting rid of it.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.320
 They were running into that.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.200
 They were burning all the merchandise in their store

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.000
 because they sold Thomas Jefferson t-shirts.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.520
 I had opium poppies all over them.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.200
 So all their merch had to go.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.320
 It was this just mass moment of panic.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.640
 This Monticello in his--

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.600
 No, no, when were they doing--

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.960
 '87, 1987.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.120
 More on drugs.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.280
 That's just too far isn't that more on drugs.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.240
 You've got to be making opium from the poppies

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.960
 before you get it confiscated, surely?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.920
 I love that quote from John JFK when he's--

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.120
 he welcomed all his Nobel laureates into the White House.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120
 They had a bit of a do.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.280
 And then he said, this is the greatest collection

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:27.080
 of mines in this room since Thomas Jefferson dined alone.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.080
 Nice.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.000
 That's a great quote.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.680
 You know, Finnish musicians make money in a way

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.640
 that I think possibly no other country has their musicians

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.160
 making it.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.080
 And that is through the taxi drivers of the country,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.120
 because the Supreme Court passed a rule which meant

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.640
 that cabbies have to pay royalties when they have

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.920
 their radios on when they have passengers in the car.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.920
 So it's like a PRS thing.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.800
 And this was done--

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.120
 what I couldn't ascertain--

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.640
 Yeah, so they have to pay--

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.000
 When they play radio?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.400
 Yeah, so 14 pounds every year needs

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.320
 to be paid to the Finnish Composer's Copyright Society.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.680
 What I couldn't get to the bottom of

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.440
 was whether or not the money goes to the global artists,

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.480
 because the article does say that it's very specifically

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.000
 to help the local acts get a slice of the fare.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.080
 That's really interesting, because you think the radio

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.320
 pay PRS anyway?

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.520
 Yeah, right, exactly.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.800
 Yeah, so--

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.280
 And this was passed a while ago, so maybe they've overturned it.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.040
 But definitely for a while, that was happening.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.920
 And it led to a lot of backlash, obviously,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.280
 from the taxi drivers who either just turned their radios off

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.800
 altogether, or I think tried to work out

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.760
 how to increase the fares to make up for the money.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.560
 I was going to say, pass on the cost.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.400
 Just do what supermarkets do.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.480
 Wait, 14 quid a year?

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.360
 Yeah.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.960
 We just felt like an odd tax to give to the taxis.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.880
 Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.640
 I think the other thing is, whenever

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.080
 I've been in the taxi in Britain,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.680
 the taxi driver isn't playing music for me.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.360
 I don't want to listen to--

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.000
 what's that radio channel that they all listen to?

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.520
 LBC.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.080
 LBC.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.560
 I don't want to listen to LBC.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.880
 They listen to it for themselves.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.080
 Yeah, that's a really good point, actually.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.880
 That is true.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.760
 Maybe they should just test, and as long as it's something

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.880
 the passengers don't want to listen to,

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.440
 then you don't have to pay.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.800
 You have to put in your app what music you hate.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.000
 Yeah.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.960
 There's a place in Australia where

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.640
 it rains less frequently.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.480
 But when it does, they get loads of tourists.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.400
 This place called Andamooka.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.400
 Can you guess why the rain brings the tourists?

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.720
 It cleans something.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.680
 They've got a big glass building, but they can't clean it.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.600
 They can't be bothered to clean it.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.400
 And the tourists come because they're like, oh, it's clean.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.240
 I can see it now.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.880
 Yeah.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.320
 Is it very craterous?

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.040
 And then it's kind of like ponds.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.600
 It's pools.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.880
 It's swimming areas all of a sudden.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.760
 And that leads to life.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.400
 That is something breeds in the ponds.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.600
 Tourists breed.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.800
 Tourists need to breed.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.000
 There's a rare frog that comes out only when it rains.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.280
 No, it's something less alive, but it

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.560
 is something that comes out.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.640
 A rock.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.120
 Bones.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.280
 It's fossil hunting.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.800
 I'll give you rock.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.280
 Basically, it's an opal area, like lots of those areas

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.960
 in the middle of Australia are.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.960
 And whenever there's really heavy rain,

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.880
 basically, opals just flush down to the streets.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.160
 And you could just walk down the street and pick opals up.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:07.840
 No.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.920
 Dick Worthington.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.560
 Isn't that cool?

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.360
 Yeah, the streets are made of opal.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.080
 Wow.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.120
 Australia's mad.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.040
 It is just a mad.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.520
 It is a mad country.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.680
 I mean, it's a great country.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.560
 And anyone living there should come to our shows.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.800
 But as we've sold them out, it's fine.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.560
 You can say it's shit.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.800
 OK, they cheese at cricket, fine.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.360
 But the thing about this place is that it's rained.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.480
 The opals have come down.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.320
 But then, of course, it's the middle of Australia.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.360
 It's now sunny again.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.040
 And so you can just see the light blinting off the opal.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.600
 So you don't even have to look.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.800
 It's almost like you're walking down.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.800
 Something gets in your eye.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.400
 You look down, and it's an opal.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.400
 So they're flushed into the town by--

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.720
 they're in the ground, and then they get sort of--

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.600
 It kind of washes the topside off.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.720
 And they're kind of flushed down into the main street.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.440
 It is.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.800
 You're making it sound like there's a sort of a Sunan

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.480
 avalanche, but it just cascades through.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.600
 Like cars have to clear the way, people are knocked over.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.640
 Can I just do one more quick, quick thing

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.080
 about the Finnish language?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.640
 So they have the longest multi-word palindrome

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.600
 of any language.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.000
 Multi-word palindrome.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.840
 So if you think like race car, that's two words.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.560
 But if you read it backwards, you can still say race car,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560
 right?

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.120
 A man, a plan, a canal, a pan.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.440
 That's a more famous one.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.560
 But multi-language.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.800
 No, it's multi-word in one language.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.000
 Again, then.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.400
 It's just that listening thing, isn't it?

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.280
 This has come up--

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.840
 Talk slower, guys.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.840
 Come on.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.480
 This has come up by a guy called Timu Pavelainen in 1992,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.560
 and it's just so contrived.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.680
 It starts off.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.600
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:57.520
 And that means Emma is already bringing the pot, Liro.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.960
 The suitable installer gingerly placed his balls.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.480
 And then it goes on for another page and a half.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.400
 Wow.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.440
 That's not wow.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.600
 That's what you're going to get so many emails, I hope,

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.000
 in the inbox from people making longer palindromes

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.640
 in that of their own language.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.480
 If you want to see a great one, and it is out there,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.120
 Dmitri Marden in his book does a palindrome that is about,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.840
 I think, like five pages long.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.240
 It's insane.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.360
 That's good, really.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.480
 Maybe not as long as that, but it's pages, yeah.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.880
 I've got it in my mind that there's a novel that was written,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.560
 but maybe not.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.200
 But if not, there should be as a palindrome.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.560
 I don't-- can that be?

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.480
 Maybe it could.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.120
 It would not be a good novel.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.720
 Imagine not being able to get the final word right.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.680
 Have you ever read that book where they don't use the letter

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.480
 E at all?

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.880
 Yeah, I've heard of it.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.160
 I've never read it.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.320
 Otter, otter drivel.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320
 Yeah, no, no.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.000
 One last thing.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.080
 Super quickly, Usain Bolt.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.160
 He's a dad now.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.640
 Yeah.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.000
 Do you know what his kids are called?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.960
 Have you called Lightning?

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:58.800
 He named his son.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.640
 He's just had twins.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.080
 He named his son Thunder.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.720
 Brilliant.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.600
 Yeah.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.520
 And then Underbolt.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.160
 And that's Thunderbolt.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.040
 Oh, right, because of Thunderbolt, thank candy.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.680
 Wait a minute.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.160
 You said he had twins, what's the other one called?

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.080
 The other one's called Saint Leo.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.480
 And then he has a one-year-old daughter.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.640
 So the twins are younger.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.720
 And she's called Olympia Lightning.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.120
 Brilliant.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.040
 Brilliant.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.640
 Bolt.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.040
 Also like Lightning Bolt.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.400
 Yeah, that's so good.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.280
 He also has another one called Wingnut.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:33.480
 OK, that's it.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.200
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.320
 Hope you enjoyed that.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.240
 If there's anything you want to discuss further

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.400
 about the things that we have said,

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.600
 you can message us on podcast@qi.com.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.520
 And yeah, I mean, if you're around in Cardiff on the 16th,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.560
 do come say hi.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.320
 London, 23rd, 24th.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.080
 Do say hi.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.200
 27th in Manchester.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.880
 These are all October dates.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.160
 As you may have seen, we've turned it into a party of a night.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.560
 We've got quizzes going on.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.240
 We have special guests coming on who have been facts on the show

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.560
 that I've discovered in the local areas

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.720
 and get the guys to guess who I've secretly brought onto stage.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.560
 And we induct them into a Hall of Fame.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.040
 It's a really fun show this year.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.240
 We're incredibly proud of it.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.400
 And it's been so much fun meeting everyone

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.240
 who hangs around at the end for a photo.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.560
 We've been doing these in the lobby photos with everyone.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.000
 And yeah, really awesome to meet so many listeners of the show.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.400
 We never get to do that, so this is our one big chance.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.000
 Anyway, that's it.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.520
 We'll be back again with more club fishy stuff in the future.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.040
 And yeah, see you soon.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.080
 All right, off with the compilation.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.660
 (upbeat music)
